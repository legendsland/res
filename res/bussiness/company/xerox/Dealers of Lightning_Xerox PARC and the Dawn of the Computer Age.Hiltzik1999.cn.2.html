<p class="para">1973 年的一个深夜，一小群人聚集在电子工程师查尔斯·P·萨克的办公室里。这个房间位于圣克鲁斯山脉山麓缓坡顶上一栋低矮建筑的底层。牧场和杏园覆盖了山的一侧；工业实验室和研究设施星罗棋布地散布在另一侧，因此山脊本身似乎标志着该地区农业历史与高科技未来的分界线。萨克实验室所在的建筑以及位于半英里外山谷中的另外两个实验室，包括施乐公司的帕洛阿尔托研究中心，其规模虽小但不断壮大的员工将其称为施乐 PARC。</p><p class="para">Very late one night in 1973 a small group assembled inside the office of an electronics engineer named Charles P. Thacker. The room was located on the ground floor of a low-slung building set upon the crest of a gentle ridge in the foothills of the Santa Cruz range. Pastureland and apricot orchards covered one side of the hill; a spreading growth of industrial laboratories and research facilities dotted the other, so that the ridge itself seemed to mark the divide between the region’s agricultural past and its high-technology future. The building housing Thacker’s lab, along with two others located in a dale about a half-mile away, encompassed Xerox Corporation’s Palo Alto Research Center, known to its small but growing staff as Xerox PARC.</p>
<p class="para">来宾们来参加计算机的诞生。如今，这样的盛事必然伴随着人群、横幅、音乐、演讲、在三层楼高的户外屏幕上播放的多媒体节目、新闻稿、媒体参观，以及所有重要杂志的封面照片。更不用说金钱的气味了，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_fm03.html.pagexx"></a>这明确表明了社会对能够带来更智能、更快速、更光明未来的技术的渴求。</p><p class="para">The visitors had come to attend the birth of a computer. Today such an event inevitably would be accompanied by crowds, banners, music, speeches, multimedia shows projected on three-story-high outdoor screens, press releases, media tours, and admiring cover pieces in all the important magazines. Not to mention the smell of money, the <a></a>unambiguous signal of society’s insatiable thirst for any technology promising a smarter, faster, and brighter destiny.</p>
<p class="para">这次却没有大张旗鼓——这很遗憾，因为查克·萨克即将向同事们揭晓的机器将帮助种下现代狂热的种子。没有金钱的味道，只有臭氧和焊料的刺鼻气味。无论如何，在场的人中没有一个人加入 PARC 是想发财的。施乐给他们的报酬足够高，比拥有相当技能的科学家和工程师的标准高出几级。但今天流行的计算机呆子是新兴高科技百万富翁的形象在当时并不是任何人的幻想。相反，他们被开拓性的刺激吸引到 PARC。许多年后，他们中的一个人将其比作在一片原始雪原上留下第一个脚印的纯粹喜悦。</p><p class="para">On this occasion there was no such fanfare—a shame, given that the machine Chuck Thacker was about to unveil to his colleagues would help plant the seed of that modern frenzy. There was no smell of money, only the barbed aroma of ozone and solder. None of those present had joined PARC with the thought of becoming rich, anyway. Xerox paid them well enough, a couple of notches over the standard for scientists and engineers possessing their considerable skills. But today’s popular image of the computer nerd as incipient high-tech millionaire was nobody’s fantasy then. Instead they had been attracted to PARC by the thrill of pioneering. One of them compared it many years later to the sheer joy of making the very first footprints in a field of virgin snow.</p>
<p class="para">萨克检查了机器上最后几个电气连接，旁边还冒着烟。他三十岁，中等身材，身材方正，一缕乱发像雨篷一样永远垂在他狡猾的眼睛上。在这群年轻的博士中，他只有物理学学士学位，这很不寻常，但他们在工程问题上对他的尊重是毫不含糊的。他们承认他的天赋已经使他成为两台开创性的大型计算机设计和建造中不可或缺的参与者，并给予他最高的赞誉：他们说查克·萨克是“工程师中的工程师”。</p><p class="para">Thacker checked a few last electrical connections on his machine, his cigarette smoldering nearby. He was thirty and of medium height, with a squarish build and an unruly cowlick that seemed perpetually to overhang his wily eyes like an awning. Among this group of youthful Ph.D.s he was unusual in possessing merely a bachelor’s degree in physics, but their deference to him on questions of engineering was unequivocal. Acknowledging the gifts that had already made him an indispensable participant in the design and construction of two trailblazing large-scale computers, they paid him the ultimate accolade: Chuck Thacker, they said, was an “engineer’s engineer.”</p>
<p class="para">萨克的设计简单而朴素，没有那种常常毁掉他最好的同事作品的自负。他是节俭的大师，也是节俭的反面，他称之为“大而无当”。在萨克的示意图中，你永远找不到一个逻辑门或一根地线不合适，他监督同事的工作，使他们达到同样严格的标准。任何工程师在萨克工作的 PARC 计算机科学实验室提出一个可疑或不诚实的想法，很可能会被一声爆炸性的“胡说八道<span class="italic">！</span> ”阻止。在 PARC，你会发现不乏自负和严厉的评判者，但有一件事是大家都同意的，那就是<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_fm03.html.pagexxi"></a>一旦查克·萨克 (Chuck Thacker) 宣布你的想法是“胡说八道”，你最好闭嘴并开始铲雪。</p><p class="para">Thacker’s designs were simple and spare, devoid of the egotism that often spoiled the work of even the best of his fellow professionals. He was a master of parsimony and the sworn enemy of its opposite, which he called “biggerism.” In a Thacker schematic one never found a logic gate or a ground wire out of place, and he policed the work of his colleagues so they would meet the same exacting standard. Any engineer who set forth a dubious or dishonest idea in PARC’s Computer Science Laboratory, where Thacker worked, was likely to be stopped in his tracks by an explosive “<span class="italic">Bullshit!</span>” At PARC one found no shortage of big egos and stern judges, but one thing on which all agreed was that <a></a>once Chuck Thacker pronounced your idea “bullshit,” you had best shut up and start shoveling.</p>
<p class="para">因此，当 1972 年 PARC 的科学家们构想出一种革命性的数字机器时，他们依靠 Thacker 将这一概念转化为电路，这并不奇怪。他和他精心挑选的团队在短短几个月内建造的这台机器符合以前从未要求过的计算机规格。</p><p class="para">It was therefore not surprising that when in 1972 the scientists of PARC conceived a revolutionary kind of digital machine they relied on Thacker to convert the concept into circuitry. The machine he and his hand-picked team built in the course of an amazing few months conformed to specifications never before required of a working computer.</p>
<p class="para">它最引人注目的元素是其人性化的尺寸。当时的典型计算机大小相当于两三台背对背摆放的冰箱，并连接到更多专用硬件机架，而“Alto”​​则功能齐全，体积小到当你把它推到桌子底下时，小腿甚至会受到撞击。</p><p class="para">Its most arresting element was its human scale. Where the typical computer of this era was the size of two or three refrigerators standing back to back and wired to many more racks of special-purpose hardware, the “Alto” was to be self-contained and small enough to bark a shin on as you wheeled it under your desk.</p>
<p class="para">Alto 是交互式的，这意味着它能立即响应用户的需求。当代计算机通过穿孔卡或电传打字机间接与用户沟通，速度非常慢，而且很笨拙，一次乏味的询问和响应交换需要几天才能完成。这就像试图用摩尔斯电码维持紧急对话一样。但 Alto 可以通过全尺寸电视屏幕与用户沟通，该屏幕可以在键盘上输入或用电子设备绘制文本和图像后仅几纳秒内显示出来。</p><p class="para">The Alto was interactive, which meant instantly responsive to the user’s demands. Contemporary computers communicated with their users indirectly, through punch cards or teletypes so slow and awkward that a single bleak exchange of query and response required days to complete. It was like trying to sustain an urgent conversation by Morse Code. But the Alto would communicate with its user via a full-sized TV screen that could display text and images mere nanoseconds after they were typed on a keyboard or drawn with an electronic device.</p>
<p class="para">还有一件事：每台 Alto 都只为一个人服务。对于体验完全由与数百名其他用户共享大学主机的宝贵资源的用户来说，这是一个革命性的概念。有了 Alto，就无需排队等待运行自己的程序。用 Alan Kay（PARC 科学家，也是该机器的主要概念化者之一）创造的一个术语来说，Alto 就是一台“个人计算机”。</p><p class="para">One more thing: Each Alto was to serve a single individual. This was a revolutionary concept to users whose experience consisted exclusively of sharing the precious resources of university mainframes with hundreds of other users. With the Alto there was to be no waiting in line for a turn to run one’s own program. To use a term coined by Alan Kay, the PARC scientist who was one of the machine’s principal conceptualizers, the Alto was to be a “personal computer.”</p>
<p class="para">这些规范中的每一个都违背了计算机科学的公认智慧。计算机很大，因为它们的硬件电路占用空间。它们很慢，因为它们同时为数十或数百个用户提供服务。它们被共享，因为数字技术非常昂贵，其成本必须分摊到每台机器的许多用户身上。航空公司以同样的原理，通过一次运送 300 名乘客来支付飞机和燃料的成本<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_fm03.html.pagexxii"></a>波音 747 飞机的飞行时间。每人一台电脑？对当代设计师来说，这似乎是一种无耻的浪费行为。支持单个用户所需的计算机内存将花费近一万美元。浪费这么多钱就像给从波士顿飞往旧金山的每位乘客一架单独的飞机。</p><p class="para">Every one of these specifications violated the accepted wisdom of computer science. Computers were big because their hardware circuits took up room. They were slow because they were serving scores or hundreds of users at once. And they were shared because digital technology was so expensive its cost had to be diffused among many users per machine. It was the same rationale by which the airlines covered the cost of aircraft and fuel by transporting 300 passengers at a <a></a>time in Boeing 747s. One computer per person? To contemporary designers this seemed an act of outrageous profligacy. The computer memory necessary to support a single user would cost nearly ten thousand dollars. Squandering so much money would be like giving every passenger from Boston to San Francisco an individual plane.</p>
<p class="para">但对 Thacker 和他的同事来说，这些反对意见都没有切中要点。Alto 的目标不是成为时代的机器，而是未来的机器。目前计算机内存确实贵得吓人，但每周都在便宜。按照价格下降的速度，1973 年售价 1 万美元的内存在 1983 年只需 30 美元即可买到。PARC 的指导原则是，这个地方的存在是为了让他们的雇主在未来领先十年。他们甚至想出了一个简写短语来解释这个概念。他们说，Alto 是一台时间机器。</p><p class="para">But to Thacker and his colleagues such objections missed the point. The Alto aimed to be not a machine of its time, but of the future. Computer memory was horrifically expensive at the moment, true, but it was getting cheaper every week. At the rate prices were falling, the same memory that cost ten grand in 1973 would be available in 1983 for thirty dollars. The governing principle of PARC was that the place existed to give their employer that ten-year head start on the future. They even contrived a shorthand phrase to explain the concept. The Alto, they said, was a time machine.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">在 Alto 的设计阶段，Thacker 花费了大量时间研究如何缩小体积，同时保留足够的内存和功率来运行复杂的软件，同时保持显示屏处于活动状态。为了追求效率，他从工程科学的每个不起眼的角落里偷学了一些技巧和捷径。硬件增加了重量，降低了系统速度，因此他尽可能地用微型软件程序（称为“微代码”）取代硬接线电路。这样，他就可以像气球驾驶员扔沙袋以获得几英尺的宝贵升力一样，通过抛弃电路板来减少设计的体积。他知道他的设计很省力；只是不确定它是否有效。现在是时候找出答案了。</p><p class="para">Thacker had spent much of the Alto design phase working out ways to make things smaller while retaining just enough memory and power to run complex software while simultaneously keeping the display active. In quest of efficiency he lifted tricks and shortcuts from every obscure corner of engineering science. Hardware added mass and slowed the system down, so wherever he could he replaced hard-wired circuits with miniature software programs called “microcode.” This allowed him to wring bulk out of the design by jettisoning circuit boards like a balloonist dropping sandbags to gain a few more precious feet of lift. He knew his design was spare; he was just not sure it worked. Now the moment had come to find out.</p>
<p class="para">Alto 的操作软件尚未编写完成，因此它的大脑暂时位于一台名为 Nova 的商用微型计算机中，该计算机通过电缆连接到 Alto 的后面板，就像昏迷患者的复苏器一样。实验室的几名成员通过将<span class="italic">芝麻街</span>的饼干怪兽的几幅图画转换成数字 1 和 0 的序列，制作了一种动画测试模式。Thacker 拨动一两个开关，比特流通过电缆从 Nova 流入 Alto 自己的处理器和内存。在那里，它被重新排序为机器指令，控制哪个 dis<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_fm03.html.pagexxiii"></a>游戏屏幕上的五十万个点或“像素”将被打开，而其余的点将保持黑暗。如果工作正常，此过程将产生一系列测试图像，这些图像的轮廓为黑色，背景为发光的白色。</p><p class="para">The Alto’s operating software had not yet been written, so its brains resided temporarily in a commercial minicomputer called a Nova, which was cabled to the Alto’s back panel like a resuscitator to a comatose patient. A few members of the lab had crafted a sort of animated test pattern by converting several drawings of <span class="italic">Sesame Street</span>’s Cookie Monster into sequences of digital ones and zeros. Thacker flipped a switch or two and the bitstream flowed over the cables from the Nova into the Alto’s own processor and memory. There it was reordered into machine instructions that governed which of the dis<a></a>play screen’s half-million dots, or “pixels,” were to be turned on and which were to be left dark. If it worked properly, this process would produce the series of test images in black outline against a glowing white background.</p>
<p class="para">每个人的目光都集中在屏幕上，屏幕闪烁着。突然，图案出现了。当大家目不转睛地看着时，饼干怪兽也盯着他们，它毛茸茸的，眼睛凸出，露出傻乎乎的笑容，一手拿着字母“C”，一手拿着饼干，闪现在屏幕上。</p><p class="para">Everyone’s eyes focused on the screen as it flickered to life. Suddenly the pattern appeared. As the group watched, transfixed, Cookie Monster stared back at them, shaggy and bug-eyed, brandishing its goofy grin, flashing upon the screen while holding the letter “C” in one hand and a cookie in the other.</p>
<p class="para">图像本身与技术的强大力量形成了荒谬的对比，但这并不重要。信息并不在内容中，就像一个世纪前电话改变世界的意义不可能在“沃森先生，过来。我需要你”这句话的字面意思中找到一样。</p><p class="para">That the image itself stood in absurd counterpoint to the sheer power of the technology did not matter. The message was not in the content, any more than the world-altering significance of the telephone could have been found one century earlier within the literal meaning of the words, “Mr. Watson, come here. I want you.”</p>
<p class="para">他们明白，就像亚历山大·格雷厄姆·贝尔的名言曾经通过一种全新方式利用的电脉冲从一个点发射到另一个点一样，饼干怪兽也是通过一种全新的力量被绘制到磷光屏幕上的：不是手绘，而是通过一串电脉冲创建，这些电脉冲以数字位的形式映射到存储芯片上，然后再次读出为运动图像。</p><p class="para">They understood that just as Alexander Graham Bell’s phrase had once been shot from one point to another by electrical impulses harnessed in a brand new way, so had the Cookie Monster been painted onto a phosphorescent screen by an entirely new power: Not drawn by hand, but created via a stream of electrical pulses mapped onto memory chips as digital bits and read out again as a moving image.</p>
<p class="para">对于查克·萨克来说，这种兴奋是难以形容的。他知道他所做的不仅仅是创造了一个新奇事物。他和他的同事们把计算机缩小到了人类的尺度，并永远改变了它的命运。显示屏上那个傻乎乎的人物咀嚼着，只是暗示了这项技术对未来十年、二十年甚至三十年的人们意味着什么。但它的路线已经确定了。就好像他们都从悬崖上踏入虚空，降落在一个新世界，证明了时间旅行毕竟是真实的。</p><p class="para">To Chuck Thacker the thrill was indescribable. He knew he had done more than create a novelty. He and his colleagues had reduced the computer to human scale and recast its destiny forever. The goofy figure munching its way across the display gave only a hint of what this technology would mean to people ten, twenty, even thirty years in the future. But its course was set. It was as though they had all stepped off a cliff into the void and alighted in a new world, bearing proof that time travel, after all, was real.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">1973 年，后来与个人电脑的出现有关的公司和个人都在忙于其他事情。IBM 当时还在生产电动打字机；微软的比尔·盖茨当时还是哈佛大学的新生；而苹果电脑的未来联合创始人史蒂夫·乔布斯当时还是一名大学辍学生，正在印度四处游荡，寻找他的禅师。</p><p class="para">In 1973 the companies and individuals later to be identified with the advent of the personal computer were otherwise engaged. IBM was still turning out electric typewriters; Microsoft’s Bill Gates was a freshman entering Harvard; and Steve Jobs, the future co-founder of Apple Computer, was a college dropout wandering around India in search of his Zen master.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_fm03.html.pagexxiv"></a>
<p class="para">但 Alto 已经问世。它小巧而强大，小到可以放在桌子下面，简单到连孩子都能使用，它是世界上第一台真正的个人电脑。它也领先时代近十年，因为 IBM PC 和 Apple Macintosh 是 PARC 于 1973 年实现的理念的首次成功商业化体现，直到 20 世纪 80 年代才出现。</p><p class="para">But the Alto had arrived. Compact and powerful, small enough to fit under a desk and simple enough for children to use, it was truly the world’s first personal computer. It was also nearly ten years ahead of its time, for the IBM PC and the Apple Macintosh, the first successful commercial expressions of the ideas PARC brought to fruition in 1973, did not appear until the 1980s were well under way.</p>
<p class="para">这就是 Alto 诞生的实验室的运营标准。施乐 PARC 是有史以来最杰出的发明天才团队的所在地，在这里，发明和工程的奇迹如田野上的雏菊一样随处可见。PARC 的科学家是计算机精英中的传奇人物，但几乎不为公众所知，他们开创了当今最激动人心的创新背后的技术。如今，美国和世界正处于前所未有的技术热潮之中；很少有人知道，推动这场热潮的大部分因素都是在施乐 PARC 发明、改进或完善的。</p><p class="para">Such was the operating standard in the lab where Alto was born. At Xerox PARC, the home of one of the most exceptional teams of inventing talent ever assembled in one place, prodigious feats of invention and engineering sprouted as commonly as daisies in an open field. Legendary names among the computer elite but almost entirely unknown to the general public, PARC’s scientists pioneered the technology behind today’s most exciting innovations. America and the world are today in the grip of an unprecedented technology craze; very few are aware that most of what drives the frenzy was invented, refined, or perfected at Xerox PARC.</p>
<p class="para">在 PARC 成立之时，人们对计算机的看法与现在大不相同。当时计算机使用起来非常困难，是一群专业工程师和设计师的工具，他们似乎以让计算机变得像古希腊的神谕一样晦涩难懂、令人生畏为荣。（毕竟，这正是这些工程师和设计师获得特殊地位的原因。）</p><p class="para">At the moment of PARC’s founding, computers were viewed much differently from the way they are now. They were exasperatingly difficult to use, the tools of a cult of professional engineers and designers who seemed to take a perverse pride in making them as obscure and intimidating as the oracles of ancient Greece. (This was, after all, exactly what gave those same engineers and designers their special status.)</p>
<p class="para">PARC 的科学家改变了这一切。他们认为计算机必须为用户服务，而不是用户为计算机服务。计算机必须操作简单直观。计算机必须以人性化的方式与用户沟通，即使速度超乎寻常。他们决心驯服机器，就像他们的祖先驯服野狗并教会它狩猎和守卫一样。</p><p class="para">The scientists of PARC changed all that. They took it as their credo that the computer must serve the user rather than the other way around. That it must be easy and intuitive to operate. That it must communicate with the user in human terms and on a human scale, even if at supernatural speeds. They were determined to tame the machine just as their ancestors tamed the wild dog and taught him to hunt and stand guard.</p>
<p class="para">在计算机科学处于十字路口、未来未知的关键时刻，他们将计算机从一台光荣的计算器改造成了如今的图形通信奇迹。当 PARC 的科学家们聚集在一起时，它在现代生活中的角色远非预先注定。他们规划了道路。</p><p class="para">At a critical moment when the very science of computing stood at a crossroads, its future uncharted, they transformed the machine from a glorified calculator into the marvel of graphical communication it is today. Its role in modern life was far from preordained when PARC’s scientists convened. They charted the course.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_fm03.html.pagexxv"></a>
<p class="para">如今，每当你用鼠标点击图标或在电脑屏幕上打开重叠窗口时，你都在使用 PARC 发明的技术。用文字处理器撰写文档，你的文字会通过 PARC 发明的软件到达显示器。将字体放大或缩小，用 Braggadocio 或 Gothic 字体代替普通打字机字母 — — 这也是 PARC 发明的技术，通过按键将完成的文档通过电缆或红外链路传输到激光打印机的方法也是如此。激光打印机也是 PARC 发明的。</p><p class="para">Every time you click a mouse on an icon or open overlapping windows on your computer screen today, you are using technology invented at PARC. Compose a document by word processor, and your words reach the display via software invented at PARC. Make the print larger or smaller, replace ordinary typewriter letters with a Braggadocio or Gothic typeface—that’s also technology invented at PARC, as is the means by which a keystroke speeds the finished document by cable or infrared link to a laser printer. The laser printer, too, was invented at PARC.</p>
<p class="para">上网、给同事发电子邮件、在配有触摸屏的 ATM 机上查看银行账户、在电视天气预报员的动画地图上追踪冷锋穿过美国中西部的路线：PARC 开辟了通往不可或缺技术的道路。同样，3D 计算机图形学也起源于此，它为《<span class="italic">侏罗纪公园》中的恐龙和</span><span class="italic">《玩具</span>总动员》中的玩具赋予了生命。PARC 的技术在当今的台式计算机世界中有多普及？1988 年，当苹果公司起诉微软窃取其 Macintosh 图形显示器的“外观和感觉”并将其用于 Windows 时，比尔盖茨的辩护基本上是这<span class="italic">两家</span>公司都是从施乐公司窃取的。</p><p class="para">Surf the Internet, send e-mail to a workmate, check your bank account at an ATM equipped with a touch screen, follow the route of a cold front across the Midwest on a TV weather forecaster’s animated map: The pathway to the indispensable technology was blazed by PARC. There, too, originated the three-dimensional computer graphics that give life to the dinosaurs of <span class="italic">Jurassic Park</span> and the inspired playthings of <span class="italic">Toy Story</span>. How pervasive is PARC’s technology in today’s desktop computer world? When Apple sued Microsoft in 1988 for stealing the “look and feel” of its Macintosh graphical display to use in Windows, Bill Gates’s defense was essentially that <span class="italic">both</span> companies had stolen it from Xerox.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">PARC 是历史上最不寻常、成果最丰富的研究机构之一，它最初的设想非常朴素——是施乐公司最近收购的一家计算机子公司的研究实验室。它在 20 世纪 70 年代初突破了这些界限，成为更接近国家资源的机构，这也是它独具神秘色彩的一部分。四个因素对 PARC 的爆炸性创造力贡献最大。其一是施乐的资金，它对办公复印机的近乎垄断带来了看似取之不尽的现金流。其二是高素质研究人才的买方市场。由于越南战争的费用和政治因素削减了政府的研究预算，全国性的经济衰退也对企业研究产生了同样的影响，施乐是少数能够竞标招募最优秀科学家和工程师的企业之一。</p><p class="para">One of the most unusual and prolific research facilities in history, PARC was originally conceived in much more modest terms—as a research lab for a computer subsidiary Xerox had recently acquired. How it burst those boundaries in the early 1970s to become something more closely resembling a national resource is part of its special mystique. Four factors contributed most to PARC’s explosive creativity. One was Xerox’s money, a seemingly limitless cascade of cash flowing from its near-monopoly on the office copier. The second was a buyer’s market for high-caliber research talent. With the expenses and politics of the Vietnam War cutting into the government’s research budget and a nationwide recession exerting the same effect on corporate research, Xerox was one of the rare enterprises in a position to bid for the best scientists and engineers around.</p>
<p class="para">第三个因素是计算机技术的状态，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_fm03.html.pagexxvi"></a>正处于历史的转折点。大型计算机和分时系统的旧架构已达到传统技术的极限，而新技术刚刚开始发挥作用——例如，半导体存储器在速度和经济性方面提供了巨大的提升，而集成电路让科学界最有远见的梦想家首次实现了他们的梦想。计算机科学从未在如此短的时间内实现如此巨大的理解飞跃。PARC 的智力温室是地球上为数不多的利用创造性智力来实现这些梦想的地方之一。</p><p class="para">The third factor was the state of computer technology, which stood <a></a>at a historic inflection point. The old architectures of mainframe computers and time-sharing systems were reaching the limits of traditional technologies, and new ones were just coming into play—semiconductor memories that offered huge gains in speed and economics, for example, and integrated circuits that allowed the science’s most farsighted visionaries to realize their dreams for the first time. Never before or since would computer science be poised to take such great leaps of understanding in so short a period. The intellectual hothouse of PARC was one of the few places on earth employing the creative brainpower to realize them.</p>
<p class="para">最后一个因素是管理。PARC 的创始人经验告诉他们，获得最佳研究成果的唯一方法是聘请他们能找到的最好的研究人员，并让他们不受指令、指示或最后期限的束缚。PARC 的计算机工程师大多不受公司改进施乐现有产品的命令的约束。他们肩负着不同的使命：带领公司进入新的未知领域。</p><p class="para">The final factor was management. PARC was founded by men whose experience had taught them that the only way to get the best research was to hire the best researchers they could find and leave them unburdened by directives, instructions, or deadlines. For the most part, the computer engineers of PARC were exempt from corporate imperatives to improve Xerox’s existing products. They had a different charge: to lead the company into new and uncharted territory.</p>
<p class="para">施乐公司只是偶尔愿意跟随他们，这是这个故事的讽刺之处之一。PARC 历史上最广为人知的一面是，它的工作被母公司忽视，而其他公司却赚了数十亿美元。在一定程度上这是真的。科学家们不受约束的创造力，更不用说他们异乎寻常的思维和行为习惯，与他们冷漠的母公司之间产生了无情的冲突。施乐公司原则上决心进入数字世界，但实际上却被束缚在复印机的营销上（无法同时处理两个问题），因此，施乐管理层对 PARC 的成就一开始感到困惑，然后感到不安，最后感到敌意。由于施乐公司从未完全理解 PARC 技术的潜在价值，它只能站在新市场的门槛上，而它的竞争对手——包括笨拙的 IBM——却一跃进入了计算机时代。</p><p class="para">That Xerox proved only sporadically willing to follow them is one of the ironies of this story. The best-publicized aspect of PARC’s history is that its work was ignored by its parent company while earning billions for others. To a certain extent this is true. The scientists’ unfettered creativity, not to mention their alien habits of mind and behavior, fomented unrelenting conflict with their stolid parent company. Determined in principle to move into the digital world but yoked in practice to the marketing of the copier machine (and unable to juggle two balls at once), Xerox management regarded PARC’s achievements first with bemusement, then uneasiness, and finally hostility. Because Xerox never fully understood the potential value of PARC’s technology, it stood frozen on the threshold of new markets while its rivals—including big, lumbering IBM—shot past into the computer age.</p>
<p class="para">然而，这种关系太容易、也太经常被简单化了。传说变成了神话，神话又变成了漫画——很快就获得了某种礼拜仪式般的确定性。如今，PARC 仍然是打击大企业（尤其是施乐）的方便武器，因为他们犯了无数的企业短视罪，包括想象中的罪。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_fm03.html.pagexxvii"></a>和挥霍无度。施乐公司对 PARC 漠不关心，以至于“甚至没有为 PARC 的创新申请专利”，在本文撰写前不久，一家领先的商业杂志告诉读者——这一说法让永久被派往 PARC 的专利律师团队感到震惊，更不用说该中心的前科学家了，他们的办公室墙上仍然装饰着刻有他们专利封面的免费牌匾。（与大多数公司员工的情况一样，专利权仍归雇主所有。）另一家商业杂志权威地写道，Alto“作为商业产品失败了”。事实上，Alto 从一开始就严格设计为研究原型——不会像水星太空舱那样作为商业产品进行营销。</p><p class="para">Yet this relationship is too easily, and too often, simplified. Legend becomes myth and myth becomes caricature—which soon enough gains a sort of liturgical certitude. PARC today remains a convenient cudgel with which to beat big business in general and Xerox in particular for their myriad sins, including imaginary ones, of corporate myopia <a></a>and profligacy. Xerox was so indifferent to PARC that it “didn’t even patent PARC’s innovations,” one leading business journal informed its readers not long before this writing—an assertion that would come as a surprise to the team of patent lawyers permanently assigned to PARC, not to mention the center’s former scientists whose office walls are still decorated with complimentary plaques engraved with the cover pages of their patents. (As is the case with most corporate employees, the patent rights remained vested with their employer.) Another business journal writes authoritatively that the Alto “failed as a commercial product.” In fact, the Alto was designed from the first strictly as a research prototype—no more destined for marketing as a commercial product than was, say, the Mercury space capsule.</p>
<p class="para">另一个巨大的神话是，施乐公司从未从 PARC 赚到任何钱。事实是，仅激光打印机一项发明就为施乐公司带来了数十亿美元的收入，是其在 PARC 投资的数倍。</p><p class="para">Another great myth is that Xerox never earned any money from PARC. The truth is that its revenues from one invention alone, the laser printer, have come to billions of dollars—returning its investment in PARC many times over.</p>
<p class="para">在本书所涵盖的最初十五年中，施乐公司本可以更好地利用 PARC 推出的多种新技术。它未能做到这一点的原因将在后面的编年史中探讨。但一家公司，无论多么聪明和有远见，是否能够主宰、更不用说垄断像数字计算这样无定形和千变万化的技术，仍然是一个悬而未决的问题。无可争辩的是，施乐公司确实在他们可以对新兴技术发挥最大影响的那一刻聚集了一群极具创造力的人才，并以无与伦比的慷慨资助他们的工作。</p><p class="para">Xerox could certainly have better exploited the manifold new technologies issuing from PARC in its first fifteen years, the period covered in this book. The reasons it failed to do so will be examined in the chronicle ahead. But whether one company, no matter how wise and visionary, could ever have dominated, much less monopolized, technologies as amorphous and Protean as those of digital computing is a wide-open question. What is indisputable is that Xerox did bring together a group of superlatively creative minds at the very moment when they could exert maximal influence on a burgeoning technology, and financed their work with unexampled generosity.</p>
<p class="para">这本书主要是口述历史，取材于当时在场的人的话语和回忆。许多人已经转向其他工作，其中一些是基于他们在 PARC 的发现，而另一些则获得了丰厚的回报。然而，几乎每个人都记得，他们在 PARC 的岁月是他们一生中最激动人心、最充实的时光。</p><p class="para">This book is largely an oral history, drawn from the words and recollections of people who were there. Many have moved on to other work, some of it based on their discoveries at PARC and some of it spectacularly lucrative. Almost to a person, however, they remember their years at PARC as the most exciting and fulfilling of their lives.</p>
<p class="para">需要强调的是，这一时期的 PARC 是一个异常多元化的地方，不仅涵盖计算机技术，还涵盖固体物理学和材料科学。该研究中心在后者学科方面完成的大部分工作都超出了<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_fm03.html.pagexxviii"></a>本书的范围因多种原因而缩小。首先，较传统的物理科学没有像计算机那样提供同样的机会来实现夸张和革命性的成果，至少在当时没有。物理学家也没有像计算机人员那样热衷于测试施乐的公司战略、内部政治或员工行为标准。这并不是说物理学家应该完全被剥夺在聚光灯下的地位；事实上，PARC 第二个 15 年中最令人振奋的一些工作发生在该中心的物理实验室中——这是对其创始人耐心和远见的又一证明。但由于 PARC 形成时期的智力发酵如此强烈地集中在计算机和系统科学实验室中，因此我选择关注它们。</p><p class="para">It should be emphasized that PARC in this period was an exceptionally multifarious place, embracing not only computer technologies but solid-state physics and materials science. Most of the work accomplished at the research center in those latter disciplines lies outside the <a></a>scope of this book for several reasons. For one thing, the more traditional physical sciences did not offer the same opportunities for extravagant and revolutionary results as computing, at least not at that moment. Nor did the physicists test Xerox’s corporate strategy, internal politics, or, indeed, standards of employee behavior with quite the same zest as the computer people. This is not to say the physicists should be wholly deprived of their place in the limelight; in truth, some of the most exhilarating work of PARC’s second fifteen years has occurred in the center’s physics labs—another testament to its founders’ patience and foresight. But because the intellectual ferment of PARC’s formative years was concentrated so powerfully in the Computer and Systems Science Labs, I have chosen to focus on them.</p>
<p class="para">在撰写本文时，我力求让读者尽可能近距离地了解 PARC，从它诞生之初的阵痛开始，到它探索和发现的狂热岁月，再到它的第一代成员分散到世界各地，将他们的发现带到世界各地。没有经历过的人不可能真正全面地描绘出 PARC 的这段时期；即使是那些在那里的人，对同一事件的回忆也会相互矛盾，有时甚至非常矛盾。我的目标是将这些回忆汇编成一个连贯的历史，并通过它揭示事件、人物和技术的独特融合如何造就了有史以来最具生产力和创造力的研究中心之一。</p><p class="para">In doing so I have strived to give the reader as close to a hallway-level view of PARC as could reasonably be attempted, starting with its birth pangs as a collection of youthful prodigies, through the rapturous years of exploration and discovery, and ending as the members of its first generation disperse to bring their discoveries to the rest of the world. It would be impossible for anyone who did not live through it to paint a truly comprehensive portrait of this period at PARC; even those who were there emerged with conflicting—sometimes wildly conflicting—recollections of the same events. My goal has been to assemble these recollections into a coherent history, and through it to shed light on how a unique convergence of events, personalities, and technologies happened to beget one of the most productive and inventive research centers ever known.</p>

<p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">照片</span></span>上是一个身穿格子运动衫的英俊男子，他那孩子气的脸庞被烟斗烟雾遮住了一半。罗伯特·W·泰勒看上去很有趣，但略显过时，他的沙色头发比现在的要长，但对于当时时尚杂志的著名摄影师拍摄这张照片的那个遥远的时代来说，却又短得不合时宜。他的目光注视着镜头外的某个东西，仿佛在思考未来，这很适合这位将有史以来最伟大的计算机工程人才聚集在一起的人。</p><p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">T</span></span>he photograph shows a handsome man in a checked sport shirt, his boyish face half-obscured by a cloud of pipe smoke. Robert W. Taylor looks amused and slightly out of date, his sandy hair longer than one might wear it today but unfashionably short for the distant time period when the picture was taken by the famous photographer of a trendy magazine. His gaze is fixed on something beyond the camera as though contemplating the future, which would befit the man who brought together perhaps the greatest collection of computer engineering talent ever to work in one place.</p>
<p class="para">1996 年 7 月一个阳光明媚的下午，同一张照片俯视着一群才华横溢的人们在北加州一家酒庄的露天餐厅里聚会。不过，与第一次拍摄时相比，照片还是有些变化。这一次，照片被放大，比真人还大，在照片中欢庆的人们都老了 25 岁。</p><p class="para">On a sunny afternoon in July 1996 the same photograph looked down at a gathering of that same talent in the open-air restaurant of a Northern California winery. There were some changes from when it was first shot, however. This time the picture was blown up bigger than life, and the people celebrating under its amused gaze had aged a quarter-century.</p>
<p class="para">他们来这里是为了庆祝鲍勃·泰勒的退休，他是施乐帕克研究中心计算机科学领域出人意料的管理者。来宾中有几位他的思想导师，其中几位被评为<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch01.html.page4"></a>他们是这个年轻而又充满变化的学科的真正的元老。这群人包括韦斯·克拉克，他是一位脾气暴躁的硬件设计天才，他的职业生涯开始于即使是最小的计算机也必须在其巨大的内部空间中操作的时候；坐在不远处的是冷酷的道格拉斯·C·恩格尔巴特，他是多媒体交互的坚定先知，他的图形用户界面和鼠标点击导航原则在他那个时代被人鄙视，但在我们这个时代却无处不在。</p><p class="para">They were there to mark the retirement of Bob Taylor, the unlikely impresario of computer science at Xerox PARC. Among the guests were several of his intellectual mentors, including a few who ranked as <a></a>genuine Grand Old Men of a young and still-fluid discipline. This group included Wes Clark, an irascible genius of hardware design who started his career when even the smallest computers had to be operated from within their cavernous entrails; and seated not far away, the flinty Douglas C. Engelbart, the uncompromising prophet of multimedia interactivity whose principles of graphical user interfaces and mouse-click navigation were disdained in his own time but have become ubiquitous in ours.</p>
<p class="para">然而，公司里的大多数人都是鲍勃·泰勒的亲信。他们是毫不掩饰的崇拜者，正是鲍勃邀请他们到他宽敞的办公室坐坐，才让他们的事业起步。他们中有天才、神童、顶级学府的博士，他们被这位来自德克萨斯大学的心理学家深深吸引，虽然他在试图传达深奥的技术要点时结结巴巴，但他仍然成功地传达了当今统治着数百万台台式机的计算理念。许多人取得了更辉煌的成就，有些人则获得了惊人的财富。但没有人会忘记，当鲍勃·泰勒用他敏锐的眼光看着他们，并邀请他们加入他那一小群信徒时，他们的职业生涯发生了多么深刻的变化。</p><p class="para">Most of the company, however, consisted of Bob Taylor’s chosen people. They were unabashed admirers whose careers he had launched by inviting them to sit beneath his commodious wing. Geniuses, prodigies, owners of doctorates from the leading halls of learning, they lived in the thrall of this psychologist from The University of Texas who stammered frightfully when trying to communicate an abstruse technical point, yet still managed to impart a vision of computing that reigns today on millions of desktops. Many moved on to more splendid achievements and some to astounding wealth. But none ever forgot how profoundly their professional lives were changed when Bob Taylor fixed them with his discerning eye and invited them to enlist in his tiny company of believers.</p>
<p class="para">“作为工程师和科学家的领袖，他是无与伦比的，”查克·萨克说，他与他共事的时间比任何人都长。“如果你想要寻找奇迹，那就是他。”</p><p class="para">“As a leader of engineers and scientists he had no equal,” said Chuck Thacker, who worked beside him longer than almost anyone else. “If you’re looking for the magic, it was him.”</p>
<p class="para">萨克担任下午的司仪。在他的巧妙监督下，熟悉的鲍勃·泰勒故事被重新翻出来，重新被人们传唱。鲍勃安排将德克萨斯州的饮料 Dr Pepper “按托盘装载并存放在一个特殊的带锁保险库中”进口到 PARC。鲍勃开着他的 Corvette Stingray 飞驰在华盛顿的街道上，仿佛骑着一匹野马。或者，每当他在 PARC 独特的内部网络上收到电子邮件时，他的 Alto 就会发出“德克萨斯的眼睛注视着你”的提示音。泰勒坐在后面的荣誉席上，心情愉快地听着这一切，他穿着一件短袖条纹衬衫和华丽的樱桃红休闲裤。但是，没有什么比玩乐更让他高兴的了<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch01.html.page5"></a>自诩为整个诉讼程序的指导方针，同时又假装自己只是一个不起眼的旁观者。</p><p class="para">Thacker served as the afternoon’s master of ceremonies. Under his deft supervision the familiar old Bob Taylor stories got dusted off to be howled over anew. Bob arranging for Dr Pepper, the Texas state drink, to be imported into PARC “by the pallet load and stored in a special locked vault.” Bob bombing through the streets of Washington in his Corvette Stingray as though saddled on a wild stallion. Or rigging his Alto to beep out “The Eyes of Texas Are Upon You” whenever he received an e-mail message on PARC’s unique internal network. Taylor listened to it all in great good humor from the table of honor, way in the back, dressed in a short-sleeved striped shirt and resplendent cherry-red slacks. But then, nothing ever pleased him more than func<a></a>tioning as the lodestar of the proceedings while pretending to be nothing but an unassuming bystander.</p>
<p class="para">1972 年，当泰勒把查尔斯·西蒙尼带到 PARC 时，他还是一个没有绿卡的天真的匈牙利年轻移民，他驾驶着自己的里尔喷气式飞机从西雅图飞来，这是从 PARC 转到微软成为第 40 名员工的人所享有的福利之一。</p><p class="para">Charles Simonyi, who was a naïve young Hungarian immigrant without a green card when Taylor brought him to PARC in 1972, flew down from Seattle in his own Learjet, one of the perquisites that accrue to a man who moved from PARC to become employee number forty of a small company named Microsoft.</p>
<p class="para">“我记得鲍勃曾让我做好应对二十世纪三大最强大力量的准备，”他说，“其中之一是个人分布式计算。第二个是互联网。第三个非常强大的力量是足球。”</p><p class="para">“I remember Bob preparing me to deal with the three most powerful forces of the twentieth century,” he said. “One of these was personal distributed computing. The second was the Internet. And the third very powerful force is football.”</p>
<p class="para">场内爆发出阵阵赞赏的笑声。在场的每个人都明白，足球是驱动鲍勃·泰勒个性和职业生涯的黑暗潮流的象征。他们知道，作为一名竞争对手，他是一个绝对冷酷无情的人，为了保护和美化他的团队的工作，他会盲目地践踏任何挡路的人，就像一个嗅到球门线的后卫一样——无论是对手、上级，还是他自己圈子里被认为受异端思想影响的成员。</p><p class="para">Appreciative laughter rippled across the floor. Everyone present understood football as an emblem of the darker currents driving Bob Taylor’s personality and career. They knew that as a competitor he was an absolutely ruthless creature and that to protect and glorify the work of his group he would blindly trample anyone in the way like a fullback scenting the goal line—be they rivals, superiors, or members of his own circle judged to have fallen prey to heretical thoughts.</p>
<p class="para">多年来，这些习惯留下了一连串的不良关系。退休午餐会上的大多数客人都很有礼貌，没有公开谈论赠送泰勒金表的公司是数字设备公司，而不是施乐公司。他们也没有提到宴会上显眼的缺席者中有乔治·帕克和比尔·斯宾塞，前者曾聘请泰勒建立并管理 PARC 的计算机科学实验室，后者是帕克的继任者，十多年后将泰勒赶出了 PARC。众所周知，每一位职业生涯都归功于贵宾的客人中，就有不少人感受到泰勒的竞争之痛，并谴责他是地球上最傲慢、最精英、最没有原则的人之一。</p><p class="para">Over the years these habits left a trail of roasted relationships. Most of the guests at the retirement lunch were polite enough not to remark openly that the company giving Taylor the gold watch was Digital Equipment Corporation, not Xerox. Or that among the party’s conspicuous absentees were George Pake, who had hired him to establish and oversee the computer science laboratory at PARC, and Pake’s successor, Bill Spencer, who evicted Taylor from PARC more than a decade later. The common knowledge was that for every guest who owed a career to the guest of honor there existed not a few individuals who had felt the sting of Taylor’s rivalry and damned him as one of the most arrogant, elitist, and unprincipled persons on the planet.</p>
<p class="para">对这一令人不安的事实的暗示大多是间接的。人们回忆说，在他的触式橄榄球比赛中，他总是担任四分卫。前 PARC 工程师迪克·舒普 (Dick Shoup) 回忆说，在打垒球时，泰勒总是挥手示意其他内野手离开弹球。有一天，舒普抱怨道：“鲍勃，其他人也来玩了！”</p><p class="para">The allusions to this discomfiting truth were mostly indirect. At his touch football games, it was recalled, he was always the quarterback. The former PARC engineer Dick Shoup recalled how at softball Taylor would invariably wave all the other infielders off a pop-up. One day Shoup complained, “Bob, the other people came to play, too!”</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch01.html.page6"></a>
<p class="para">“但他们可能会错过！”泰勒厉声说道。“你不想赢吗？”</p><p class="para">“But they might miss it!” Taylor snapped. “Don’t you want to win?”</p>
<p class="para">其他人暗示鲍勃在“向下管理”方面很有天赋，这意味着纵容和维护自己的团队，但没有明确说明其推论：在向上管理方面，他往往是一场灾难。最后，一位老同事说出了每个人都知道的事情。“为鲍勃工作要比让鲍勃为你工作好得多，”他评论道。</p><p class="para">Others dropped hints about Bob’s genius at “managing down and in,” meaning pampering and defending his own team, without explicitly stating the corollary: At managing up and out he was often a disaster. Finally one old colleague put into words what everyone always knew. “It’s a lot better to work for Bob,” he observed, “than to have Bob working for you.”</p>
<p class="para">那天出席会议的大部分个人电脑先驱都曾为鲍勃工作过，而不是相反。在 PARC 工作了十三年，他管理着一批世界级的技术大师，与早期的经理人迪亚吉列夫一样，有着毫不妥协的热情，他指导着自己那支喜怒无常的艺术家团队——在这里安抚愤怒的情绪，在那里调解自负的情绪，保护他们免受敌人的伤害，并清理出一个精神空间，让他们的才能相互加强，打造出一个比耀眼的部分更伟大的整体。毫无疑问，有时这项任务需要泰勒拥有的所有心理洞察力。当一个人身边有三十个比自己聪明得多的天才（并且知道这一点）时，这是可以预料到的。然而，他们中很少有人会想到挑战他的终极权威。在鲍勃·泰勒的实验室里，你要么接受他的管理，要么就滚蛋。</p><p class="para">Most of the pioneers of personal computing in attendance that day had worked for Bob, not the reverse. At PARC for thirteen years he managed a world-class collection of technical virtuosi with the same uncompromising passion as Diaghilev, that impresario of an earlier age, guiding his own troupe of temperamental artists—soothing ruffled feathers here, mediating egotistical outbursts there, sheltering them from enemies, and clearing a psychic space so their talents could reinforce each other to build a whole immeasurably greater than the dazzling parts. No doubt there were times when the task demanded all the reserves of psychological discernment Taylor owned. That is to be expected when one is surrounded by thirty prodigies who are all measurably smarter than oneself (and know it). Yet seldom would any of them think of challenging his ultimate authority. In Bob Taylor’s lab you accepted his management, or you cleared out.</p>
<p class="para">没人能完全弄清楚泰勒是如何以及从何而来获得这种发现和培养领域内最有才华的研究人员的天赋的。部分原因是直觉。他可能无法清楚地表达甚至理解所有的技术细节，但不知何故，他总是知道什么时候研究人员或项目会带来重要成果，以及如何为这个人或项目的成熟做好准备。</p><p class="para">How and where Taylor acquired his gift for finding and cultivating the most talented researchers in his field no one ever quite figured out. Part of it was instinct. He might not be able to articulate or even understand all the technical details, but somehow he always knew when a researcher or a project would lead to something important, and how to prepare the ground for that person or project to ripen.</p>
<p class="para">这种神秘的领导品质最恰当地体现在巴特勒·兰普森身上，他是场上唯一一个能与萨克和鲍勃·泰勒打成平手的人。兰普森的智力是泰勒实验室的一大特色，人们开玩笑说，有时似乎是鲍勃·泰勒为巴特勒·兰普森工作，而不是相反。兰普森通过重复他和萨克建造第一台 PARC 计算机时发生的伟大故事来打消他们的这种想法。这是一台分时机器<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch01.html.page7"></a>名为 MAXC 的计算机，是在短短 18 个月内从一台领先的小型计算机克隆出来的，而这台小型计算机是某大公司花了数年时间开发的（巧合的是，这家公司就是数字设备公司）。泰勒一直告诉他们，他们应该考虑一种替代架构，但实际上并没有解释他所考虑的替代方案是什么。直到几年后，当他们完成 Alto 的开发工作时，他们才意识到，他们所构建的正是他从一开始就希望他们构建的。</p><p class="para">This mysterious quality of leadership was most aptly summed up by Butler Lampson, the only person on the floor who could match Thacker’s record of playing time with Bob Taylor. Lampson’s intellectual power was such a dominating feature of the Taylor lab that people joked about how it sometimes seemed that Bob Taylor worked for Butler Lampson rather than the other way around. Lampson disabused them of the notion by repeating the great old story about what occurred when he and Thacker were building the first PARC computer. This was a time-sharing machine <a></a>called MAXC, which was cloned in the astoundingly short span of eighteen months from a leading minicomputer that had taken a major company years to develop (by coincidence, it was Digital Equipment). Taylor kept telling them they ought to be considering an alternative architecture without actually explaining just what alternative he had in mind. It was not until a couple of years later, when they completed work on the Alto, that they realized they had built what he meant them to from the very beginning.</p>
<p class="para">“大师的言谈常常有些深奥难懂，”兰普森说道，引来一阵会心的笑声，“他的解释比他谦逊的弟子所能提供的更深刻、更深奥。回想起来，你真的会发现这条路早在多年前就已规划好了，而你一直在追随他的脚步。”</p><p class="para">“The master often speaks in somewhat inscrutable fashion,” Lampson said to peals of knowing laughter, “with a deeper and more profound interpretation than his humble disciples are able to provide. In retrospect you can really see that the path has been plotted years in advance, and you’ve been following his footsteps all along.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">退休派对结束后不久，泰勒邀请我去他位于伍德赛德的家做客。伍德赛德是高科技高管和企业家的居住区，从茂密的森林山脊上可以俯瞰硅谷。“留出足够的时间，”他说。“从你现在的位置到这里需要整整一个小时。”</p><p class="para">Not long after that retirement party Taylor invited me to visit him at his home in Woodside, a bedroom community for high-tech executives and entrepreneurs that overlooks Silicon Valley from atop a thickly forested ridge. “Leave plenty of time,” he said. “It’ll take you a good hour to get here from where you are.”</p>
<p class="para">一个人要经过一条陡峭的山坡才能到达家，这条山脊大道就是著名的天际线大道。想象他开着他的新宝马在那些急转弯处飞驰，真是令人恐惧，那辆车的车牌上写着 T <span class="smallCaps">HE</span> UDM（终极驾驶机器）。在一所被橡树和花旗松密密麻麻包围的房子前，穿着拖鞋​​的泰勒迎接了我。他那只精力充沛的巨型贵宾犬马克斯在我们周围蹦蹦跳跳。“趴下，孩子！快躺下！”泰勒命令道。这只狗逗了主人五秒钟，然后又站起来发狂，泰勒在面对老板令人不快的命令时一定很温顺。</p><p class="para">One reaches his home via a steep climb up a hillside to the west of Palo Alto, past the ridgetop thoroughfare known as Skyline Drive. It was terrifying to imagine him careening around those hairpins in his new BMW, the one with the license plate reading T<span class="smallCaps">HE</span> UDM (for “The Ultimate Driving Machine”). At the front door of a house densely hemmed in by oaks and Douglas firs, Taylor greeted me in slippers. Around us bounded his hyperactive giant poodle, Max. “Down, boy! Go lay down!” Taylor commanded. The dog humored his master for about five seconds before getting up to rampage again, about as tractable as Taylor must have been when confronted with a distasteful injunction from his own bosses.</p>
<p class="para">从他舒适的客厅里，人们可以透过浅色石头壁炉两侧的窗户向下望去，可以看到斯坦福大学的胡佛塔，直线距离六英里，公路距离十一英里。从这个有利位置看不到 PARC，也许只有在泰勒的想象中才可以看到。泰勒离婚了，他的三个儿子都长大并找到了工作，他独自住在这个小窝里，花了一些时间与最后的挣扎作斗争<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch01.html.page8"></a>战争。对他来说，世界很容易被划分为他所雇用的天才和他竭力保护的那些天才。</p><p class="para">From his comfortable living room one can peer down through the windows on either side of a pale stone fireplace toward the Hoover Tower of Stanford University, six miles away as the crow flies and eleven by road. PARC is invisible from this vantage point, except perhaps in Taylor’s imagination. Divorced, his three sons grown and employed, he lives alone in this aerie and spends a certain amount of time fighting the last <a></a>war. For him the world is easily divided between the geniuses he employed and those from whom he struggled to protect them.</p>
<p class="para">我请他阐述在他领导下取得的伟大创新背后的共同主题。这些创新包括 ARPANET，这是他在加入 PARC 之前作为五角大楼<span class="italic">资助者</span>构想和资助的早期互联网，以及个人电脑的概念，它连接到本地网络并配备高质量的交互式显示器。</p><p class="para">I asked him to articulate the common theme lurking behind the great innovations achieved under his leadership. These included the ARPANET, the embryonic Internet he conceived and financed as a Pentagon <span class="italic">grantmeister</span> before joining PARC, and the idea of the personal computer, linked into a local network and equipped with a high-quality interactive display.</p>
<p class="para">他靠在椅背上，将拖鞋放在咖啡桌上。“我从来没对计算机作为一种数学设备感兴趣，而是对它作为一种通讯设备感兴趣，”他说道，然后意味深长地停顿了一下，仿佛在暗示我几乎必须生活在 20 世纪 60 年代的军工联合体中，才能理解当时的世界观有多么革命性。在此之前，数字计算机的历史就像一台被美化的计算器。一台占据大型办公楼半层楼的主机可以运行工资单，平衡一家价值数十亿美元的公司的账目，在几秒钟内计算出炮弹或载人航天器瞄准月球的最佳轨迹。但它是一台无声的独立机器，通过电传打字机或一堆打孔卡接收问题，并以同样的方式给出答案。</p><p class="para">He settled back, slippers on the coffee table. “I was never interested in the computer as a mathematical device, but as a communications device,” he said, then paused meaningfully, as if to suggest that I would almost have had to live within the military-industrial complex of the 1960s to understand how revolutionary a worldview that was. The history of the digital computer up to then was that of a glorified calculator. A mainframe taking up half the floor of a large office building could run a payroll, balance the books of a billion-dollar corporation, calculate in split seconds the optimum trajectory of an artillery shell or a manned spacecraft aimed at the moon. But it was a mute self-contained machine that received its questions via teletype or stacks of punch cards and delivered its answers in the same way.</p>
<p class="para">“人类必须在很多卡片上打孔，让这些卡片保持整齐，然后将这副可能有数百张卡片的卡片放到计算机上……第二天你回来时发现你的程序执行到第 433 张卡片后就停止了，因为你漏了一个逗号。你修复了这个问题，这次程序执行到第 4006 张卡片后就停止了，因为你忘记打一个 O 而不是零，或者其他愚蠢的原因。这真是令人沮丧。”</p><p class="para">“The notion of a human being having to punch holes in lots of cards, keep these cards straight, and then take this deck of what might be hundreds and hundreds of cards to a computer…You come back the next day and find out that your program executed up until card 433 and then stopped because you left out a comma. You fix that and this time the program gets to card 4006 and stops because you forgot to punch an O instead of a zero or some other stupid reason. It was bleak.”</p>
<p class="para">泰勒意识到需要一些全新的东西。“我开始从功能上说话，”他说。他问自己：哪个器官在访问人类大脑方面提供了最大的带宽？显然是眼球。如果人们随后思考计算机如何才能最好地与人类操作员沟通，答案就会不言而喻。“我认为机器应该将其资源集中在显示器上。”</p><p class="para">Taylor perceived the need for something entirely new. “I started talking functionally,” he said. He asked himself: Which organ provides the greatest bandwidth in terms of its access to the human brain? Obviously, the eyeball. If one then contemplated how the computer could best communicate with its human operator, the answer suggested itself. “I thought the machine should concentrate its resources on the display.”</p>

<p class="para">鲍勃·泰勒出生于 1932 年。如果要从他早年的生活中找到他性格的线索，有两点尤为突出。其一是他家庭的流浪生活方式。他的父亲雷蒙德·泰勒牧师是大萧条时期西得克萨斯州的卫理公会牧师，当时教会的政策是每隔几年就重新安置牧师。他在墨西哥边境以北几个小时车程的尤瓦尔迪待了两三年，随后又在维多利亚、奥佐纳或梅赛德斯待了几年，这些地方除了田间和牧场工人的极度贫困外，没有什么特别之处。即使在今天，这个地区仍有三分之一的居民生活在贫困线以下。</p><p class="para">Bob Taylor was born in 1932. If one quarries his early life for keys to his temperament, two things stand out. One is his family’s itinerant lifestyle. His father, the Reverend Raymond Taylor, was a Methodist minister in the West Texas of the Depression at a time when church policy was to relocate its ministers every couple of years. There would be two or three years in Uvalde a couple of hours north of the Mexican border, followed by a few in Victoria, Ozona, or Mercedes, none of these places notable for much except the wrenching poverty of field and ranch hands. Even today this is a region where one out of three residents lives below the poverty line.</p>
<p class="para">这种情况一直持续到战争爆发前夕，当时他的父亲在圣安东尼奥卫理公会大学找到了一份教授哲学和宗教的工作。频繁的搬迁已经给这个男孩留下了印记。“每次你都必须结交一批新朋友，并面对一系列新的偏见，”他回忆道。生活在聚光灯下，当地牧师的儿子的生活几乎没有让事情变得更容易。“你需要经历许多次争斗，才能确定自己在等级制度中的地位。”到十岁时，鲍勃·泰勒已经掌握了在当地等级制度中确立自己的地位并抵御所有挑战的技巧。</p><p class="para">This went on until almost the onset of war, when his father took a job teaching philosophy and religion at the Methodist University of San Antonio. The frequent relocations had already left their mark on the boy. “You’ve got to make a new set of friends and interact with a new set of prejudices every time,” he recalled. Living under the spotlight that falls on the local minister’s son scarcely made things any easier. “There’s the usual number of fights you have to go through to find out where you stand in the pecking order.” By the time he was ten Bob Taylor had mastered the skill of establishing his place in the local hierarchy and holding it against all comers.</p>
<p class="para">第二个因素是他母亲奥黛丽在他很小的时候透露给他的。他在 28 天大的婴儿时就被领养了。</p><p class="para">The second element was something his mother, Audrey, revealed to him at a very early age. He had been adopted as a twenty-eight-day-old infant.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch01.html.page10"></a>
<p class="para">“我记得我听的第一个睡前故事是关于我是如何被选中的。被我的父母选中。其他父母只能接受他们得到的东西，但我被选中了。这可能给了我一种不应有的自信。”他罕见地自嘲道。但在他的成年生活中，很少有东西比选拔过程对鲍勃·泰勒来说更神圣。对他来说，这几乎是一种恩赐。他将是做出选择的人，但他希望被选中的人能感受到与他一样的信心和深深的感激之情。</p><p class="para">“The first bedtime story I remember being told was about how I had been chosen. Picked out by my mother and father. All the other parents had to take what they got, but I was chosen. That probably gave me an undeserved sense of confidence.” He chuckled in a rare moment of self-deprecation. But throughout his adult life few things would be as sacred to Bob Taylor as the process of selection. For him it was almost an anointing. He would be the one doing the choosing, but he expected the select to feel invested with the same confidence he had felt, and the same profound gratitude.</p>
<p class="para">战争结束后，他准备上大学——或者说，根本没准备好。他在南卫理公会大学短暂学习过一段时间（“我主修校园学”），之后因朝鲜战争而暂时休学，在达拉斯海军航空站担任海军预备役军官。退伍军人权利法案支付了他进入德克萨斯大学的费用，他在那里又学习了两年古怪的课程。“1956 年的一天，我意识到自己在学校待了很长时间。我走进院长办公室，想知道毕业需要什么条件。他们查了一下，说‘如果你选了这两门课，下学期就可以毕业。你的专业是心理学，辅修数学、英语、哲学和宗教。’”事实上，事情并没有那么偶然。他待了很长时间，获得了感官心理学硕士学位，感官心理学是研究大脑如何从感官接收输入的学科。</p><p class="para">After the war he was ready for college—or rather, not ready at all. There was a short stint at Southern Methodist University (“I majored in campusology”) followed by a break for the Korean War, which he spent as a naval reserve officer landlocked at the Dallas Naval Air Station. The G.I. Bill paid for a berth at The University of Texas, where he followed an eccentric course of study for another two years. “One day in 1956 I realized I’d been in school an awfully long time. I walked into the Dean’s office to find out what it would take to graduate. They checked and said, ‘If you take these two courses you can graduate next semester. Your major will be psychology and you’ll have minors in mathematics, English, philosophy, and religion.’” In truth it was not quite as haphazard as that. He stayed long enough to earn a master’s in sensory psychology, the study of how the brain receives input from the senses.</p>

<p class="para">1961 年，鲍勃·泰勒来到了华盛顿特区，他绕了好远的路才到达这里。离开德克萨斯大学后，他曾在佛罗里达州奥兰多市郊外的一个朋友开办的实验寄宿学校任教。但是，他的第二个和第三个孩子——双胞胎男孩的出生，让他以每年 3,600 美元的年薪当宿舍舍监的生活很快告一段落。他在马丁航空公司找到了一份工作，该公司正在附近的一家工厂制造名为“潘兴”的机动导弹系统。一年后，他跳槽到马里兰州一家设计军用飞行模拟器的公司，这份工作薪水更高。在这里，引起他注意的是信息以交互方式传递的巨大力量。这是一个每个人都能从抽象角度理解的原则，但只有当他们真正理解时，才能真正领悟其中的道理。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch01.html.page11"></a>在实际操作中，你可以用书本和理论来教飞行员，直到你的声音停止，但是要找到一种方法，让他们的手放在操纵杆上，眼睛放在模拟的风景上，就好像他们是第一次学习一切一样。</p><p class="para">The year 1961 found Bob Taylor in Washington, D.C., which he had reached by a circuitous route. After leaving UT he had briefly taught at an experimental boarding school run by a friend outside Orlando, Florida. But the arrival of his second and third children, twin boys, quickly put an end to life as a dormitory housemaster on $3,600 a year. He found a job at Martin Aircraft, which was building the mobile missile system known as Pershing at a nearby plant. A year later he jumped to a better-paying post with a Maryland company designing flight simulators for the military. What caught his attention here was the tremendous power of information delivered interactively. This was a principle everyone understood in the abstract, but got driven home only when they wit<a></a>nessed it in action: You could teach pilots from books and theory until your voice gave out, but find a way to place their hands on a joystick and their eyes on a simulated landscape and it was as though they were learning everything for the first time.</p>
<p class="para">这份工作也直接决定了他的下一站。肯尼迪总统呼吁在 2000 年前将人类送上月球，这促使羽翼未丰的国家航空航天局 (NASA) 四处搜寻管理人才。巧合的是，泰勒曾试图向 NASA 推销一项研究计划，使用他的一个模拟器来探索各种各样的感官输入。NASA 对这个想法很感兴趣，但更感兴趣的是它的支持者。NASA 同意资助他的公司进一步开展工作，但前提是他必须加入 NASA 担任项目经理。</p><p class="para">This job also led directly to his next stop. President Kennedy’s exhortation to place a man on the moon by the end of the decade had the fledgling National Aeronautics and Space Administration scrounging for management talent wherever it might surface. Taylor, by lucky coincidence, had tried to sell NASA on a research program using one of his simulators to explore a wide variety of sensory inputs. NASA was intrigued by the idea, but even more by its proponent. The agency agreed to fund further work by his company, but only if he joined NASA as the project manager.</p>
<p class="para">这位乡村牧师的儿子还未过二十岁，就参与了自曼哈顿计划以来最重要的政府应急计划。他见到了最初的七名水星宇航员，他们是那个时代的民族英雄，并亲眼目睹了太空拍摄。但这种兴奋很快就消失了。对于热衷于阅读《生活》杂志上七名宇航员精彩传记的公众来说，NASA 和水星计划可能看起来是科学魅力的顶峰<span class="italic">，</span>但事实并非如此。</p><p class="para">Not yet out of his twenties, the rural preacher’s son was in the thick of the most important government crash program since the Manhattan Project. He met with the original seven Mercury astronauts, the era’s reigning national heroes, and witnessed space shots first-hand. But such thrills soon paled. NASA and the Mercury program might appear the apogee of scientific glamour to a public devouring the polished hagiographies of the seven astronauts in <span class="italic">Life</span> Magazine, but the truth was less splendid.</p>
<p class="para">“我们说过要去月球，但距离那里还有很长的路要走，”泰勒回忆道。“这主要是工程学，有时是相当平凡的工程学。这不是科学，我对科学<span class="italic">更</span>感兴趣。”</p><p class="para">“We said we were going to the moon, but we were a hell of a long way from getting there,” Taylor recalled. “It was mostly engineering, and sometimes fairly pedestrian engineering. It wasn’t science, and I was <span class="italic">much</span> more interested in science.”</p>
<p class="para">他在内心深处一直在寻找出路。1962 年的一天，他意外地收到了一个关于计算机技术的跨部门会议的邀请，他瞥见了出路。这个邀请来自五角大楼，或者更具体地说是来自麻省理工学院行为心理学家 JCR Licklider，他负责国防部高级研究计划局 ARPA 的一个新项目。泰勒只知道 Licklider 令人生畏的名声，而泰勒的硕士论文就是在心理声学（听觉心理学研究）这个专业上完成的。他没有预料到的是<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch01.html.page12"></a>利克莱德在第一次见面时就称赞了他的论文。“1962 年我 30 岁，而他已经享誉国际，”泰勒说。“他竟然知道我是谁，这让我大吃一惊。”</p><p class="para">Deep down he was looking for a way out. He glimpsed it one day in 1962 when he received an unexpected invitation to an interagency meeting on computer technology. The summons came from the Pentagon, or more specifically from J.C.R. Licklider, an MIT behavioral psychologist who had taken charge of a new program at ARPA, the Defense Department’s Advanced Research Projects Agency. Taylor knew Licklider only by his forbidding reputation, which had been forged in the same specialty, psychoacoustics—the study of the psychology of hearing—in which Taylor had done his master’s thesis. What he did not anticipate was <a></a>that Licklider would compliment him on his thesis during their first meeting. “I was thirty in 1962, and he was internationally known,” Taylor said. “It floored me that he knew who I was.”</p>
<p class="para">当时，ARPA 从事科学研究，而不是工程研究。该机构成立于 1957 年，当时苏联发射了人造卫星，全国陷入恐慌，最初几乎只专注于导弹物理学——具体来说，就是如何让美国在向地球轨道发射导弹方面迅速赶上苏联的水平。然而，到了 1962 年，当利克莱德被任命为新信息处理技术办公室 (IPTO) 负责人时，紧迫性已经减弱。ARPA 仍然怀有的任何军事倾向都只能作为一种人工制品来看待，例如当利克莱德偶然发现他名义上管辖的一个“秘密”项目是高度机密的，甚至他也没有权限知道它是什么时。（“这让我很紧张，”他后来承认。）</p><p class="para">In those days ARPA did science, not engineering. Founded in the nationwide panic that followed the Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik in 1957, the agency at first focused almost exclusively on missile physics—specifically, how to bring the United States quickly up to par with the Soviets in shooting projectiles into Earth orbit. By 1962, however, when Licklider was tapped to run a new Information Processing Techniques Office, or IPTO, the urgency had waned. Whatever military orientation ARPA still harbored was visible only as a sort of artifact, as when Licklider discovered by accident that one “cloak-and-dagger” project under his nominal jurisdiction was so highly classified even he was not cleared to know what it was. (“That made me nervous,” he admitted later.)</p>
<p class="para">ARPA 已将重点重新放在广泛科学领域的民用研究上，其中一些研究与国家安全只有微不足道的关联。“我没有感受到为任何军事研究提出理由的太大压力，”利克莱德在多年后接受采访时说。当然，五角大楼确实期望该机构的工作可能会意外地解决一些技术问题，例如令人烦恼的“指挥和控制”问题：如何有效利用战场上产生的大量信息来管理武装部队日益复杂的武器系统。</p><p class="para">ARPA had refocused itself on civilian research in broad scientific areas, some of them having only tenuous relevance to national security. “I did not feel much pressure to make a military case for anything,” Licklider told an interviewer years later. Of course, the Pentagon did expect that the agency’s work might serendipitously lead to. solutions of some of its technical problems, such as the vexing issue of “command and control”: how to employ effectively the immense volume of information generated on a battlefield to manage the armed forces’ increasingly elaborate weapons systems.</p>
<p class="para">多年来，军方一直将这个问题视为训练人类如何用手指扣动扳机。利克莱德告诉他的上司，真正的解决方案在于让机器与人类达成妥协。他称之为“人机共生”，两年前他恰好发表了一篇关于这个主题的论文。传统上，问题必须非常仔细地编写并呈现给计算机，以便机器理解每一步。一个微小的错误，所有的计算都会停止。尝试在这种情况下策划一场战斗——你会在到达第二步之前就被消灭。但如果系统被设计成计算机不再是一个沉默的数据操纵者，而是一个对话的参与者——<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch01.html.page13"></a>他在论文中写道，这是“一位能力可以与你互补的同事”之类的话。</p><p class="para">For years the military had viewed this issue in terms of training the human beings with their fingers on the triggers. Licklider informed his bosses that the real solution lay in making the machine meet the human halfway. This was something he called “man-computer symbiosis,” a subject on which he happened to have published a paper two years earlier. Traditionally, problems had to be written and presented to the computer very carefully so the machine would understand every step. One tiny error, and all computation would cease. Try planning a battle under these conditions—you would be obliterated before reaching the second step in the process. But what if the system were designed so the computer was no longer a mute data manipulator, but a participant in a dialogue—<a></a>something, he had written in that paper, like “a colleague whose competence supplements your own?”</p>
<p class="para">鉴于当时的技术，这样的事情根本不可能发生，但这是可以预见的。“每次我有机会发言时，我都会说我们的使命是交互式计算，”利克莱德说，“我认为这将彻底改变人们的思维方式和做事方式。”他迅速将预算中的大部分资金用于实现这一目标。</p><p class="para">Nothing like that was possible given the technology of the time, but it could be foreseen. “Every time I had the chance to talk, I said the mission is interactive computing,” Licklider said, “I thought, this is going to revolutionize how people think, how things are done.” He promptly allocated most of the money in his budget to its pursuit.</p>
<p class="para">利克莱德身材高挑，来自中西部，一副猫头鹰眼镜下隐藏着热情而愉快的性格。他最喜欢把人们聚集在一起，并坚持让新认识的人也称呼他为“利克”。加入 ARPA 几个月后，他召集了预算中包含计算机研究项目的政府机构峰会。这个小组非常强大，不仅包括 ARPA 和 NASA，还包括海军、陆军和空军的研究机构、国立卫生研究院和国家科学基金会。当利克在会议开始时描述他自己的“非常谦虚”的项目时，他毫不怀疑谁站在计算机资助金字塔的顶端。他的 1400 万美元预算已经支持了麻省理工学院、伯克利分校和卡内基梅隆大学的项目，比其他所有机构的<span class="italic">总</span>预算还要多。</p><p class="para">Licklider was a tall Midwesterner whose owlish glasses camouflaged a warm and pleasant personality. He loved nothing more than bringing people together and insisted that even new acquaintances address him as “Lick.” A few months after joining ARPA he convened his summit of government agencies with computer research projects in their budgets. The group was an august one, encompassing not only ARPA and NASA but the research arms of the Navy, Army, and Air Force; the National Institutes of Health; and the National Science Foundation. When Lick opened the session by describing his own “very modest” program he left no doubt about who stood at the top of the computer funding pyramid. His $14 million budget, which already supported projects at MIT, Berkeley, and Carnegie-Mellon University, was larger than those of all the other agencies <span class="italic">combined</span>.</p>
<p class="para">利克莱德的项目开启了政府资助的计算机研究的黄金时代。很快，他就建立了一支完整的学术队伍，只要有合适的新研究方向引起他们的兴趣，他们就有权回到他的研究岗位。利克莱德对“合适”的定义很宽泛。他明白，计算机研究不同于物理和化学等传统科学，后者从发现到发现，循序渐进，建立在几个世纪的理论和实验之上，其过程类似于地质增生。相比之下，计算机研究年轻而具有爆发力，就像被一连串的枪声推动着一样，每一项技术创新都会激发一次飞跃。</p><p class="para">Licklider’s program launched the golden age of government-funded computing research. Very soon he had established a full stable of academic scholars entitled to come back to his well whenever an appropriate new line of study struck their fancy. And Licklider defined “appropriate” broadly. He understood that computer research differed from traditional sciences like physics and chemistry, which lumbered incrementally from discovery to discovery, building on centuries of theory and experiment in a process that resembled geological accretion. Computing, by contrast, was young and explosive, driven forward as though by a series of pistol shots, every technological innovation inspiring a headlong leap ahead.</p>
<p class="para">因此，他的信息处理技术办公室在授予合同时无需其他机构要求的任何官僚文书工作。韦斯·克拉克回忆说，当他们在麻省理工学院共用一个办公室时，他向利克莱德介绍了他的第一台数字计算机——克拉克设计的 TX-2：“我几乎感觉自己好像被从<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch01.html.page14"></a>看看我是否愿意从他们手中再拿走 25 万美元。”</p><p class="para">His Information Processing Techniques Office accordingly awarded its contracts without any of the bureaucratic paperwork other agencies required. Recalled Wes Clark, who had introduced Licklider to his first digital computer—the Clark-designed TX-2—when they shared an office floor at MIT: “I almost felt as though I was called up from <a></a>time to time to see if I wouldn’t be willing to take another quarter of a million dollars off their hands.”</p>
<p class="para">1964 年，利克莱德离开 IPTO 重返麻省理工学院时，他已经启动了许多开创性的项目，旨在让计算机更易于用户使用。图形研究指向了显示计算机生成信息的新方法。计算机网络和新编程语言方面也出现了一些举措。重新组织计算机内存和处理周期的系统可以同时为许多用户提供服务（这被称为分时），将构建和运行这些庞大装置的单次会话成本降低到中小型大学都能负担得起的水平。</p><p class="para">By the time he left IPTO in 1964 to return to MIT, Licklider had set in motion numerous trailblazing projects aimed at making the computer more accessible to the user. Studies in graphics pointed toward new ways of displaying computer-generated information. There were initiatives in computer networking and new programming languages. Systems to reorganize the computer’s memory and processing cycles so it might serve many users simultaneously—which was known as time-sharing—brought the per-session cost of building and running these enormous contraptions down to a level that even midsized and small universities could afford.</p>
<p class="para">利克的继任者似乎是管理这个不断扩展的项目的最佳人选。伊凡·萨瑟兰是麻省理工学院的优秀毕业生，当时他恰好在陆军担任中尉。年仅 26 岁的他已经积累了令人羡慕的研究记录，其中最辉煌的成就是开发了第一个交互式计算机图形程序。该系统被称为 Sketchpad，允许用户使用光笔直接在计算机的阴极射线屏幕上绘制高度详细和复杂的图形，并将其存储在内存中。利克和萨瑟兰之间的联系之一是，后者在同一台 TX-2 计算机上连续半小时设计了 Sketchpad。</p><p class="para">Lick’s successor seemed the perfect man to manage this expanding program. Ivan Sutherland was a brilliant MIT graduate who happened to be serving with the Army as a first lieutenant. Only twenty-six, he had already amassed an enviable research record, the crowning achievement of which had been the development of the first interactive computer graphics program. Known as Sketchpad, the system allowed a user to draw highly detailed and complex drawings directly on a computer’s cathode-ray screen using a light pen and store them in memory. Among the bonds uniting Lick and Sutherland was that the latter had designed Sketchpad during a protracted series of half-hour sessions on that very same TX-2 computer.</p>
<p class="para">利克莱德留给萨瑟兰的预算为 1500 万美元，工作量已经远远超出一个人的能力，还有一个人选：鲍勃·泰勒。乍一看，他是个奇怪的人选。泰勒从未上过计算机高级课程。他永远无法设计硬件或编写软件程序。但他表现出利克莱德认为有吸引力的两个品质：对人机交互前景的本能把握，以及极高的“人际交往能力”。利克莱德和萨瑟兰认为，除此之外，他无法融入比特和电子之中几乎不重要。他们不可能知道，短短几年内，鲍勃·泰勒在美国计算机研究领域的影响力就超过了他们两人。在五角大楼担任中尉副手的卑微工作<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch01.html.page15"></a>员工任命即将让鲍勃·泰勒 (Bob Taylor) 走上他和计算机的命运之路。</p><p class="para">Licklider left Sutherland with a $15 million budget, a workload that had grown far beyond what a single man could handle, and a suggested deputy: Bob Taylor. At first glance he was a strange choice. Taylor had never taken an advanced course in computing. He would never be able to design hardware or write a software program. But he displayed two qualities Licklider found appealing: an instinctive grasp of the promise of man-computer interaction, and an exceptionally high degree of “people skills.” Next to this, Lick and Sutherland figured, his inability to get down among the bits and electrons was scarcely significant. They could not have known that within a few short years Bob Taylor would outshine them both in his influence over computer research in the United States. The humble job of serving as deputy to a first lieutenant with a Pentagon <a></a>staff appointment was about to set Bob Taylor on the path to his, and the computer’s, destiny.</p>
<p class="para">伊凡·萨瑟兰在 IPTO 工作了不到 18 个月。1965 年底，哈佛大学向他提供了终身教职。他于 1966 年 6 月正式离职，但非正式离职时间要早得多。当年 1 月或 2 月，泰勒已经独自管理 IPTO。</p><p class="para">Ivan Sutherland spent scarcely eighteen months at IPTO. Late in 1965 Harvard offered him a tenured position. He was officially gone by June 1966 but unofficially much earlier. By January or February that year Taylor was already running IPTO all by himself.</p>
<p class="para">学徒期很短，但收获颇丰。泰勒迅速领悟了五角大楼生活中的诸多重要惯例，比如微小的级别差异所带来的巨大意义。一天，他得知自己的新助理、麻省理工学院的 23 岁工程师巴里·韦斯勒将被授予 GS-9 的平民军衔。这太低了：泰勒认为合适的级别应该是 GS-13。在薪酬方面，两者的差别微不足道，两个级别的薪酬几乎相同。但泰勒认为，更高的军衔将确保韦斯勒在五角大楼高层眼中被视为经验丰富的专业人士，而不是新手。这一殊荣肯定会在韦斯勒与军方官员的互动中日复一日地带来回报。（此外，他还会因为将五角大楼的规则逼得无法执行而感到满足。）</p><p class="para">The apprenticeship had been short, but edifying enough. Taylor rapidly digested such important conventions of Pentagon life as the enormous significance of tiny gradations in rank. One day he learned that his own new assistant, a twenty-three-year-old MIT engineer named Barry Wessler, was to be assigned the humble civilian rank of GS-9. Too low: Taylor concluded the appropriate level would be GS-13. The difference was a trivial one in terms of pay, which was nearly the same for both grades. But Taylor reasoned that the higher rank would guarantee that Wessler got treated by the Pentagon’s brass hats as a seasoned professional rather than a greenhorn. This was a distinction certain to return dividends day after day in terms of Wessler’s interaction with military officialdom. (Plus there would be the satisfaction of having squeezed Pentagon rules until they squealed.)</p>
<p class="para">韦斯勒回忆道：“鲍勃的工作方式是找出他做不到的事情，然后努力去做。他本可以毫不费力地让我提高一两个级别，但 GS-13？这太过分了。但他做到了。”</p><p class="para">As Wessler recalled, “Bob worked by finding out what he couldn’t do, and then going for it. He could have gotten me a level or two higher without too much trouble, but GS-13? That was off the scale. But he got it done.”</p>
<p class="para">与高层的严格礼仪形成鲜明对比的是，ARPA 的文职领导们没有打扰泰勒按照自己的意愿设计他的项目。他所选择的方案显然是利克莱德方案的延伸。互动性、分时、图形：利克莱德的所有爱好都变成了泰勒的爱好。他还精明地调整了利克莱德的管理风格，以适应自己外向的性格。他每年会拜访资助对象几次，但不仅仅是为了听取研究人员的进度报告。他参与的事情更像是社区拓展，发展新团队，培养崭露头角的年轻研究人员，培养新一代的天才。</p><p class="para">In contrast to the rigid protocol of the brass, ARPA’s civilian chiefs left Taylor undisturbed to fashion his program as he chose. What he chose was distinctly an extension of Licklider’s. Interactivity, time-sharing, graphics: All of Lick’s pet preoccupations became Taylor’s. He also shrewdly adjusted Licklider’s management style to fit his own extroverted personality. He would visit his grant recipients several times a year, but not solely to hear the researchers’ obligatory progress reports. He was engaged in something more like community outreach, developing new teams, nurturing up-and-coming young researchers, cultivating an entire new generation of virtuosi.</p>
<p class="para">泰勒在学术界待了足够长的时间，他知道最有趣的思想骚动发生在完全专业阶层之下。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch01.html.page16"></a>教授。“你们最年轻的教员是谁？”他会四处询问。“他们的抱负是什么？最出色的研究生在哪里？”他追踪年轻的天才，用领导者独特的魅力吸引他们，这种魅力似乎更倾向于倾听和鼓励而不是指挥。经理需要公司来上台；从某种意义上说，泰勒正在举行试镜。从另一个角度来看，他正在重现自己过去最有意义的时刻之一。他身边的人不会因为偶然或教养而获得这样的成就。他们将是被选中、挑选……被收养的。</p><p class="para">Taylor had spent enough time in academia to know that the most interesting intellectual ferment took place well below the stratum of full pro<a></a>fessor. “Who are your youngest faculty?” he would ask around. “What are their ambitions? Where are the most impressive graduate students?” He tracked down the young prodigies, captivating them with the peculiar charm of a leader who seemed inclined more to listen and encourage than to dictate. An impresario needs a company to put on stage; Taylor, in one sense, was holding auditions. In another, he was reproducing one of the most meaningful moments of his own past. The persons he surrounded himself with would get there not by chance or breeding. They would be chosen, selected…adopted.</p>
<p class="para">在担任主任的第一年，泰勒组织了一次全国性的 IPTO 研究会议，后来成为一年一度的系列会议。从表面上看，这填补了令人困扰的沟通空白。这里有信息处理领域的顶尖人才，他们都在为 ARPA 工作，解决本质上相同的问题。然而，大多数人除了名声外，彼此并不认识。他把会议变成了一年一度的活动，每年都在不同且令人欣慰的“有趣”的地方举行。有一年冬天，这个团队可能会在犹他州的帕克城滑雪；第二年，他们会在狂欢节前赶到新奥尔良。</p><p class="para">In his first year as director Taylor organized one of what would become an annual series of nationwide IPTO research conferences. On the surface this filled a troublesome communications vacuum. Here were the top talents in the field of information processing, all working for ARPA on essentially the same problems. Yet most did not know each other except by reputation. He made the conference an annual affair, held each year at some different and gratifyingly “interesting” place. One year winter might find the group skiing at Park City, Utah; the following year would bring them to New Orleans in time for Mardi Gras.</p>
<p class="para">目的并不是主要为了玩耍。相反，它是为了建立一个人际网络，就像他即将为计算机提出的网络一样。在这些活动中，他们建立了终身的职业和个人纽带。他们每天从一起吃早餐开始，然后在早上进行几个小时的讨论。他们会一起吃午餐，然后自由活动直到晚餐，这是另一项公共活动。一天结束时，他们会进行进一步的座谈会。</p><p class="para">Not that the purpose was chiefly to play. Rather, it was to build a network of people mirroring the one he would soon propose for computers. Lifelong professional and personal bonds were forged at these events. They would start the day with a communal breakfast, followed by several hours of discussion in the morning. They would eat lunch together, then were set free until dinner, another communal affair. The day ended with further colloquia.</p>
<p class="para">每天的讨论都以泰勒职业生涯中独特的管理风格展开。每位参与者都有一小时左右的时间来描述自己的工作。然后，他就会像一块牛腩排被一群贪婪的狼吃掉一样，任由法庭摆布。</p><p class="para">The daily discussions unfolded in a pattern that remained peculiar to Taylor’s management style for the rest of his career. Each participant got an hour or so to describe his work. Then he would be thrown to the mercy of the assembled court like a flank steak to a pack of ravenous wolves.</p>
<p class="para">“我让他们互相争论，”泰勒毫不掩饰地高兴地回忆道。他们以科学家冷静坦率的态度展开了一场智力上的大战，除了事实的证实之外，什么都不顾。“这些人真的关心他们的工作。他们<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch01.html.page17"></a>“他们对政治不感兴趣，他们不想给任何人留下深刻印象，”泰勒说。“如果他们认为我说的话完全是错的，他们会立即告诉我。如果他们认为<span class="italic">自己</span>错了，他们会立即告诉对方。最后，这些非常聪明的人彼此更加了解了。”</p><p class="para">“I got them to argue with each other,” Taylor recalled with unashamed glee. They went at the intellectual roughhouse with the scientist’s unemotional candor, oblivious to everything but the substantiation of truth. “These were people who really cared about their work. They <a></a>weren’t interested in politics, they weren’t interested in impressing anybody,” Taylor said. “If they thought that something I was saying was dead wrong, they’d just as soon tell me as not. They’d just as soon tell one another as not if they thought <span class="italic">they</span> were wrong. And in the end these people, all of whom were pretty bright, got to know one another better.”</p>
<p class="para">当然，他煽动这场思想混战还有另一个动机。这是他所知道的了解他们所从事的工作的最佳方式。他本可以请任何一位首席研究员坐下来向他解释他们的工作，这是事实，但他认为自己甚至不知道该问什么问题的可能性都很小。最好让他的专家们互相挑战，而他则在一旁观看，就像排长让他的士兵接受严格的野外演习，看看他们是否会失败，如果会，在哪里失败。“这样我就能了解他们的优势和劣势，否则这些优势和劣势可能会被我隐藏起来，”他说。“如果有技术上的弱点，它们几乎总是会在这种条件下浮现出来。这非常非常有益。”</p><p class="para">Of course he had another motive in fomenting the intellectual free-for-all. It was the best way he knew of gleaning what they were up to. He could have asked any of his principal investigators to sit him down and explain their work, it was true, but he figured the chances were slim that he would even know the right questions to ask. Better to let his experts challenge each other while he watched, like a platoon leader subjecting his men to the rigors of field maneuvers to see whether they will break, and if so, where. “This way I would get insights about their strengths or weaknesses that otherwise might be hidden from me,” he said. “If there were technical weak spots, they would almost always surface under these conditions. It was very, very healthy.”</p>
<p class="para">但这不是针对个人的。批评一个人的思想是可以接受的，但批评他的性格是绝对不行的。泰勒致力于建立一种民主制度，在这种制度下，每个人的思想都会受到团体的公正批判，无论支持者的资历或级别如何。</p><p class="para">But it was not to be personal. Impugning a man’s thinking was acceptable, but never his character. Taylor strived to create a democracy where everyone’s ideas were impartially subject to the group’s learned demolition, regardless of the proponent’s credentials or rank.</p>
<p class="para">同样的原则也适用于泰勒为研究生设立的每年一次的 ARPA 会议。教职员工甚至泰勒本人都被禁止参加这些会议。刚从研究生院毕业不久的巴里·韦斯勒被委派负责监督，除了“召集大家一起做点什么”之外，他没有接到任何指示。</p><p class="para">The same principle governed the once-a-year ARPA conferences Taylor established for graduate students. Faculty members and even Taylor himself were barred from these meetings. Barry Wessler, not long out of grad school himself, was delegated to supervise, receiving no instructions other than “to get people together and make something happen.”</p>
<p class="para">在第一次会议上，该小组邀请了一位不幸的野人，他来自那个偏僻的地方——犹他大学，名叫艾伦·凯。凯在一次公开会议上站出来，推销他关于可以握在手中的计算机的设想。他已经为它取了一个名字：“Dynabook”，这是一种笔记本形状的机器，带有显示屏和键盘，你可以用它来创作、编辑和存储非常个人化的文学、音乐和艺术作品。</p><p class="para">At the first session the group piled on an unfortunate wild man from that backwater, the University of Utah, named Alan Kay. Kay had stepped forth in a public session to pitch his vision of a computer you could hold in your hand. He had already coined a name for it: “Dynabook,” a notebook-shaped machine with a display screen and a keyboard you could use to create, edit, and store a very personal sort of literature, music, and art.</p>
<p class="para">“他疯了，”韦斯勒回忆道。“人们对他的整个想法都表示怀疑，并给他带来了很大的困难。他画了这样一幅步行图<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch01.html.page18"></a>把电脑夹在胳膊下到处走，我们都认为这太荒唐了。”</p><p class="para">“He was crazy,” Wessler recalled. “People greeted the whole idea with disbelief and gave him a very tough time. He painted this picture of walk<a></a>ing around with a computer under your arm, which we all thought was completely ridiculous.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">与此同时，泰勒正全力以赴地寻找推动交互式计算前沿发展的方法。当时，这意味着推进分时技术，因为没有其他方法可以支付交互式系统所需的大量计算资源。</p><p class="para">Taylor, meanwhile, was fully occupied in finding ways to push forward the frontiers of interactive computing. At the time, this meant advancing the technology of time-sharing because there was simply no other way to pay for the enormous computing resources an interactive system demanded.</p>
<p class="para">在任职期间，利克莱德将大部分 ARPA 资金用于一定规模的分时项目，例如麻省理工学院庞大的 Multics 项目，该项目旨在设计一个能够同时支持 300 名用户的系统。泰勒鼓励他的承包商也接受规模较小的项目。其中之一是加州大学伯克利分校的 Genie 项目，该项目基于这样一个原则：并非每所大学都能负担得起 Multics 所需的价值数百万美元的通用电气 645 大型机。相反，Genie 的目标是设计一个不超过十到二十个用户的系统。泰勒认为，如果这样一台小型机器可以广泛分布，那么分时系统实际上可能会覆盖比 Multics 所能覆盖的用户更多的用户。</p><p class="para">During his tenure Licklider had steered most ARPA funding to time-sharing projects of a certain majestic scale, such as MIT’s vast Multics program, whose aim was to design a system capable of supporting 300 users at once. Taylor encouraged his contractors to embrace smaller-scale projects as well. One of these, an effort at the University of California at Berkeley called Project Genie, was based on the principle that not every university could afford the multimillion-dollar General Electric 645 mainframe Multics required. Instead Genie aimed to design a system for no more than ten or twenty users. If such a small machine could be widely distributed, Taylor reasoned, time-sharing might actually reach many more users than Multics could ever deliver.</p>
<p class="para">Genie 的主机是 SDS 930，由南加州一家成立三年的创业公司 Scientific Data Systems 制造，售价仅为 73,000 美元左右。930 在商业市场上很受欢迎，因其出色的速度、出色的可靠性和大容量存储而广受赞誉。Genie 团队证明，只需少量新硬件和巧妙的重新编程，多功能 930 就可以变成一台小型分时机。然后他们建议 Taylor 安排 Scientific Data Systems 将修改后的 930 作为商业产品推出。</p><p class="para">Genie’s host machine was the SDS 930, which was made by an entrepreneurial three-year-old company in Southern California named Scientific Data Systems and sold for only about $73,000. The 930 was a popular entry in the commercial market, where it was widely admired for its exceptional speed, excellent reliability, and large storage capacity. The Genie team demonstrated that with a nominal amount of new hardware and clever reprogramming the versatile 930 could be turned into a small-scale time-sharing machine. Then they proposed that Taylor arrange for Scientific Data Systems to bring out the modified 930 as a commercial product.</p>
<p class="para">泰勒对这个想法表示了热烈的支持。他邀请 SDS 创始人兼董事长马克斯·帕列夫斯基到五角大楼，这次会面最终成为了一次难忘的会面。帕列夫斯基曾向他提出，将由政府资助的原型机作为礼物送给他，但遭到了断然拒绝。</p><p class="para">Taylor gave the idea his enthusiastic endorsement. He invited Max Palevsky, the founder and chairman of SDS, to the Pentagon for what ripened into a memorable encounter. Palevsky, offered a government-funded research prototype on a silver platter, turned him down flat.</p>
<p class="para">42 岁的帕列夫斯基是一名高管，他对自己商业头脑的信心得到了同事们的加强。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch01.html.page19"></a>该公司取得了非凡的成功。（1965 年，也就是他遇到泰勒的那一年，SDS 的税前利润已超过 500 万美元。）但帕列夫斯基对分时系统毫无用处。SDS 靠向大学和航空航天公司等小众市场销售中小型计算机系统赚钱。对帕列夫斯基来说，分时技术似乎过于复杂，商业市场是一个黑洞——即使是计算机行业的领头羊 IBM 也曾在尝试实施自己的分时策略时遭遇挫折。“这是一个非常复杂的计划，”帕列夫斯基回忆道，“我只是没想到周围会有那么多成熟的客户。”</p><p class="para">The forty-two-year-old Palevsky was an executive whose heartfelt confidence in his own business acumen had been reinforced by his com<a></a>pany’s extraordinary success. (In 1965, the year of his encounter with Taylor, SDS had earned more than $5 million in pre-tax profits.) But Palevsky had no use for time-sharing. SDS made its money selling small-and medium-sized computer systems for a niche market of universities and aerospace firms. To Palevsky the technology of time-sharing appeared too elaborate by half and the commercial market a black hole—even IBM, the bellwether performer in the computer industry, had run aground trying to implement a time-sharing strategy of its own. “It was a very sophisticated scheme,” Palevsky recalled, “and I just didn’t think there were that many sophisticated customers around.”</p>
<p class="para">泰勒和帕列夫斯基都意志坚定，他们之间立即产生了一种相互厌恶，从一开始就互相对立。泰勒试图让帕列夫斯基注意他办公室里的一个终端，该终端直接连接到大陆另一边正在运行的重新配置的 SDS 930。帕列夫斯基对此毫无兴趣。泰勒认为帕列夫斯基的计算知识浅薄而落后。帕列夫斯基对这位政府官僚也同样不耐烦，他的技术热情显然超过了他的商业头脑。除此之外，他还宣布，备受吹捧的 Genie 团队所做的工作“漏洞百出”。</p><p class="para">Equally strong-willed, Taylor and Palevsky conceived an instant mutual antipathy that had them at cross-purposes from the start. Taylor tried to draw Palevsky’s attention to a terminal in his office linked directly to the reconfigured SDS 930 chugging away on the other side of the continent. Palevsky had not the slightest interest. Taylor judged Palevsky’s knowledge of computing shallow and retrograde. Palevsky grew equally impatient with this government bureaucrat whose technical exuberance clearly outran his commercial sense. Beyond that, he announced that the work done by the vaunted Genie team was “full of holes.”</p>
<p class="para">“这东西永远也卖不出去，”他说。</p><p class="para">“This thing’ll never sell,” he said.</p>
<p class="para">泰勒被彻底震撼了。对他来说，互动是一项神圣的事业，马克斯·帕列夫斯基挡在路上是无法容忍的。泰勒感到自己那股想要确立自己在等级制度中的首要地位的旧冲动又在滋生。“你在浪费我的时间，”他咆哮道。“你为什么不滚出去？”</p><p class="para">Taylor was shaken to the core. For him interactivity was a sacred cause, and for Max Palevsky to stand in its way was intolerable. Taylor felt his old urge rising to establish his primacy in the pecking order. “You’re wasting my time,” he snarled. “Why don’t you get the hell out of here?”</p>
<p class="para">他将永远铭记将马克斯·帕列夫斯基赶出办公室的那一天。但他们如此笨拙地争论的问题并没有结束。几分钟后，泰勒听到有人敲门。来人是里格登·柯里，一位彬彬有礼的乔治亚人，担任帕列夫斯基的销售和营销总监。柯里目睹了最近的摊牌，心里越来越沮丧。他的职责之一是密切关注 Genie 团队对 930 的改造。与他的老板相反，他对这台机器及其商业潜力印象深刻。</p><p class="para">He would always cherish his memory of the day he threw Max Palevsky out of his office. But the issue they had so clumsily debated was not closed. A few minutes later Taylor heard someone knock on his door. It was Rigdon Currie, a courtly Georgian who served as Palevsky’s director of sales and marketing. Currie had watched the recent showdown in mounting dismay. One of his responsibilities had been to keep an eye on the Genie team as they transformed the 930. In contrast to his boss, he was deeply impressed by the machine and its commercial potential.</p>
<p class="para">“我认为马克斯错了，”他说。</p><p class="para">“I think Max is wrong,” he said.</p>
<p class="para">“我知道，”泰勒回答道。“你打算怎么办呢？”</p><p class="para">“I know he is,” Taylor replied. “What are you going to do about it?”</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch01.html.page20"></a>
<p class="para">“我认为只要有人拿着钱在他家门口排队，我们就能扭转局面，”柯里说。“我可以带客户过来看看你的终端吗？”</p><p class="para">“I think we can turn him around as long as we get people lined up outside his door with money,” Currie said. “Could I bring the customers up here to see your terminal?”</p>
<p class="para">“当然。”</p><p class="para">“You bet.”</p>
<p class="para">在接下来的几周里，柯里陪同数十名客户来到泰勒的五角大楼办公室，拿到了十多份可靠的采购订单。帕列夫斯基别无选择，只能屈服。他批准将 Genie 机器作为 SDS 940 进行营销，但有一个条件：SDS 将从前三台售出的产品中收回所有开发成本。结果，940 的定价为 173,000 美元，比基础版 930 贵了约 100,000 美元，尽管它所附加的硬件不超过 5,000 美元。</p><p class="para">In the next few weeks Currie escorted scores of customers up to Taylor’s Pentagon quarters and emerged with more than a dozen solid purchase orders. Palevsky had no choice but to capitulate. He authorized the marketing of the Genie machine as the SDS 940 with one stipulation: SDS was to recover all its development costs from the first three sold. As a result, the 940 was priced at $173,000, about $100,000 more than the base 930, although it carried no more than $5,000 in additional hardware.</p>
<p class="para">这款机器成为 SDS 有史以来最畅销的产品之一，最终占其销售额的近三分之一。它帮助将分时度假变成了一项具有商业可行性的业务。但帕列夫斯基从未完全投入到新事业中。直到最后，940 都没有在专用装配线上生产，而是通过卡车将传统的 930 运到专门的工厂，在那里将它们拆开，然后手工安装新硬件。</p><p class="para">The machine became one of the best-selling products SDS ever had, eventually accounting for nearly one-third of its sales. It helped turn time-sharing into a commercially viable business. But Palevsky never fully committed his company to the new venture. Right up until the end, the 940 was manufactured not on a dedicated assembly line, but by trucking conventional 930s to a special plant, where they were torn down and the new hardware installed by hand.</p>
<p class="para">泰勒赢得了这场战斗。但他与马克斯·帕列夫斯基的交锋远未结束。短短几年后，他们的命运再次交汇——这一次是在美国公司犯下代价最昂贵的错误之一之后。这家公司就是施乐公司。</p><p class="para">Taylor won that battle. But his encounters with Max Palevsky were not over, not by a long shot. A few short years later their destinies would converge again—this time in the aftermath of one of the costliest miscalculations any American corporation has ever made. The corporation was Xerox.</p>

<p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">1968 年除夕</span></span>夜。在纽约州罗切斯特施乐公司总部二十八楼的办公室里，雅各布·E·戈德曼博士焦躁地盯着外面的恶劣天气。就像囚犯在牢房的墙上标记自己的刑期一样，他在心里计算着自己已经有多少天没有看到太阳了。</p><p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">N</span></span>ew Year’s Eve, 1968. From his office on the twenty-eighth floor of Xerox Corporation headquarters in Rochester, New York, Dr. Jacob E. Goldman stared testily out at the filthy weather. Like a prisoner marking off the term of his incarceration on the wall of a cell, he mentally toted up the days since he had seen any trace of the sun.</p>
<p class="para">这个数字是三十一。自从十二月一日来到施乐公司担任首席科学家以来，杰克·戈德曼每天都目睹罗切斯特的暴雨。他对此感到厌烦透顶。</p><p class="para">The number was thirty-one. Since arriving to take up the job of chief scientist at Xerox on the first of December, Jack Goldman had witnessed precipitation in Rochester every single day. He was thoroughly sick of it.</p>
<p class="para">就在这不祥的时刻，公司首席执行官 C. Peter McColough 走了进来，祝他新年快乐。</p><p class="para">At that inauspicious moment C. Peter McColough, the company’s chief executive, walked in to wish him a happy new year.</p>
<p class="para">“彼得，”戈德曼脱口而出，“我想我犯了一个大错误。”</p><p class="para">“Peter,” Goldman blurted, “I think I’ve made a great mistake.”</p>
<p class="para">“怎么了，杰克？你在这里不开心吗？”</p><p class="para">“What’s the matter, Jack? Aren’t you happy here?”</p>
<p class="para">“彼得，看窗外。”</p><p class="para">“Peter, look out the window.”</p>
<p class="para">戈德曼提醒麦科洛，他甚至还没来得及搬进一栋像样的房子。他的车每天晚上都暴露在户外的恶劣天气中，每天早上他都要花半个小时刮掉挡风玻璃上的冰雪。最近他分居了，独自生活，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch02.html.page22"></a>戈德曼甚至发现自己紧张地思考着未来他的候选人会如何适应罗切斯特的恶劣气候。</p><p class="para">Goldman reminded McColough that he had not even had time to move into a proper house. His car spent every night exposed to the elements outdoors, and every morning he wasted a half-hour scraping ice and snow off the windshield. Recently separated and living alone, <a></a>Goldman even found himself nervously pondering how future candidates for his hand might take to Rochester’s dismal climate.</p>
<p class="para">麦考洛为首席科学家的痛苦感到不安，因为他费了很大力气才让杰克·戈德曼加入公司。他坚信，尽管施乐取得了成功，但它需要吸收现代技术。否则，随着其产品被新技术取代，施乐将面临被遗忘的风险。聘请杰克·戈德曼是福特汽车公司一位有远见的技术专家，也是研究人才的优秀评判者，这是这一战略的重要组成部分。</p><p class="para">McColough had to be disconcerted by his chief scientist’s misery, given the trouble he had taken to get Jack Goldman into the corporation. He believed fervently that Xerox, successful as it was, needed to absorb modern technology. The alternative was to risk sinking into oblivion as its products became supplanted by new developments. Hiring Jack Goldman, a visionary technologist and superb judge of research talent at Ford Motor Company, was a critical component of that strategy.</p>
<p class="para">但为了给新任命的人让路，麦考洛首先必须罢免现任首席科学家。这位首席科学家就是年迈的约翰·H·德绍尔，他已经担任这一职位数十年。“麦考洛认为是时候让德绍尔辞去施乐首席技术官一职，让他退休，祝贺他并感谢他所做的一切，并让一位顶尖的技术专家接替他的位置，”当时的一位高管回忆道。“德绍尔自然非常不愿意离开。”</p><p class="para">But to make way for the new appointee McColough had first had to dislodge the incumbent chief scientist. This was the aging John H. Dessauer, who had held the post for decades. “McColough thought it was time for Dessauer to step down as the chief technical officer of Xerox, make him emeritus, congratulate him and thank him for everything he’s done, and get a hotshot technologist in there in his place,” recalled one executive from that period. “Naturally Dessauer was very reluctant to go.”</p>
<p class="para">这使得时任施乐总裁的麦考洛陷入了尴尬的境地。高盛拒绝考虑施乐的提议，直到德绍尔退休得到保证。正如他在 1966 年直言不讳地告诉一位企业猎头：“当你准备好给我提供他的工作时再来吧。”但德绍尔在施乐公司堪称神一般的存在。正是他诱骗了当时规模很小的 Haloid 公司的老板，资助了一位名叫切斯特·卡尔森的古怪发明家未经测试的复印技术，并将其推向商业化。他曾监督著名的施乐 914 复印机的设计和开发，该复印机成为历史上最成功的工业产品。坦率地说，德绍尔和任何在世的人一样，对施乐公司后来的辉煌繁荣负有责任。</p><p class="para">That placed McColough, then the Xerox president, in a delicate spot. Goldman refused to consider Xerox’s offer until Dessauer’s retirement was assured. As he bluntly told one corporate headhunter in 1966: “Come back when you’re prepared to offer me his job.” But Dessauer was close to a deity at Xerox. It was he who had inveigled his bosses at modest little Haloid Company into bankrolling the untested duplicating technology of an eccentric inventor named Chester Carlson and shepherded it toward commercialization. He had supervised the design and development of the celebrated Xerox 914 copier, which became the most successful industrial product in history. To put it bluntly, Dessauer was as responsible as any man alive for the fabulous prosperity of what had evolved into Xerox Corporation.</p>
<p class="para">为了克服自己的顽固性，麦考洛最终求助于施乐公司中唯一一位地位更高的人：受人尊敬的董事长兼首席执行官乔·威尔逊。威尔逊完全理解麦考洛想要重振施乐研究的愿望。最后，两人想出了一个计划，同时宣布威尔逊自己将辞去首席执行官（但不是董事长）的职务，麦考洛的<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch02.html.page23"></a>晋升为首席执行官，作为换届的一部分，德绍尔从首席科学家职位上退休。几乎没有人能像乔·威尔逊那样代表一家美国公司，施乐公司的大多数员工从未见过其他首席执行官。德绍尔几乎无法抗拒这种自我牺牲的局面。他抱怨了很久，最后还是默许了。</p><p class="para">To overcome his recalcitrance McColough finally appealed to the lone individual at Xerox occupying an even higher level of divinity: the venerated chairman and chief executive, Joe Wilson. Wilson fully sympathized with McColough’s desire to revitalize Xerox research. At length the two men came up with a plan to simultaneously announce Wilson’s own retirement as chief executive (although not as chairman), McColough’s <a></a>promotion to CEO, and, as part of the changing of the guard, Dessauer’s retirement as chief scientist. Almost no one personified an American corporation as Joe Wilson did Xerox, most of whose employees had never known another CEO. Dessauer could hardly resist such a self-sacrificing scenario. Grumbling to the end, he finally acquiesced.</p>
<p class="para">经过这样的周旋，杰克·戈德曼上任一个月后就不肯罢休了。在那个下雪的新年前夜，麦考洛迅速思考了起来。他决定安抚他的新主管，向他透露他当时一直保密的两个重要公司机密之一。</p><p class="para">After such maneuvering it would not do for Jack Goldman to get balky after a month on the job. On that snowy New Year’s Eve McColough thought fast. He decided to mollify his new executive by tipping him to one of the two vital corporate secrets he was at that very moment holding close to his vest.</p>
<p class="para">“振作起来，杰克，”他说。“事情即将发生。很快你就会对外界环境更加友善了。”</p><p class="para">“Take heart, Jack,” he said. “Things are in the offing. Soon you’ll be thinking more kindly of the outside environment.”</p>
<p class="para">戈德曼猜不出麦考洛到底在想什么，但这位首席执行官的不祥之举告诉他这是一件大事。事实上，该公司正在最终确定将总部迁往康涅狄格州斯坦福德的计划。鉴于施乐是罗切斯特本地机构的地位，这确实是一个重大新闻。搬迁将使该地区摇摇欲坠的经济失去数百甚至数千个工作岗位。由于担心遭到强烈反对，麦考洛打算在几个月的细致工作之前不公开这一决定。戈德曼听到有有利变化的迹象，即使他不知道是什么，也感到很安心，他接受了老板的节日祝福，心情好了很多。</p><p class="para">Goldman could not guess what exactly McColough had in mind, but the CEO’s portentous manner told him it was something big. In fact, the company was finalizing plans to move its headquarters to Stamford, Connecticut. Given Xerox’s stature as a native Rochester institution, this would be momentous news indeed. The relocation would drain the region’s faltering economy of hundreds, maybe thousands, of jobs. Wary of a backlash, McColough had no intention of making the decision public until months more of subtle groundwork could be laid. Appeased by the hint that a favorable change was in the air, even if he could not know what it was, Goldman accepted his boss’s holiday wishes in a much improved temper.</p>
<p class="para">但另一个秘密，麦考洛当晚甚至没有​​提到，最终对施乐的未来产生了更强大的影响——以及杰克·戈德曼的未来。在一系列高度机密的谈判中，麦考洛一直在为施乐收购南加州的一家电脑公司进行谈判。新年不到六周，他和该公司董事长就宣布了一项价值近 10 亿美元的交易。</p><p class="para">But it was the other secret, the one McColough failed even to hint at that evening, which would wind up exerting a much more powerful force on Xerox’s future—and on Jack Goldman’s. In a series of highly confidential talks, McColough had been negotiating for Xerox to acquire a computer company in Southern California. Less than six weeks into the new year he and its chairman would announce a deal worth nearly one billion dollars.</p>
<p class="para">没有向新任首席科学家透露这个秘密可能是 Peter McColough 职业生涯中最大的错误之一。Goldman 后来沉思道，如果他当时能敞开心扉，“我本可以带他去见计算机领域的专家。那些人会劝他不要这么做。”</p><p class="para">Not divulging this secret to his new chief scientist may have been one of the biggest mistakes of Peter McColough’s career. Had he only opened up, Goldman mused later, “I could have led him to knowledgeable people in the computer field. People who would have advised against it.”</p>
<p class="para">然而，从另一个角度来看，他没有这么做是幸运的。对于施乐公司来说<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch02.html.page24"></a>收购科学数据系统（如果只从商业战略角度考虑，则是一个明显的错误估计）将直接导致 PARC 的成立。</p><p class="para">Seen another way, however, it was fortunate he did not. For Xerox’s <a></a>purchase of Scientific Data Systems—a flagrant miscalculation when considered solely as an act of business strategy—would lead directly to the founding of PARC.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">戈德曼并不反对施乐进军数字计算领域。毕竟，作为首席科学家，他的职责就是将新技术引入一家思想狭隘、思维迟钝的公司。他担心的是施乐的处理方式。</p><p class="para">It was not that Goldman opposed the idea of Xerox getting into digital computing. After all, his responsibility as chief scientist was precisely to introduce novel technologies into a company grown narrow-minded and dull. What concerned him was the way it had been handled.</p>
<p class="para">乔·威尔逊 (Joe Wilson) 是计算机行业的先驱，他一直担心新技术有朝一日可能会取代施乐公司在图像到纸张领域的垄断地位。他曾对麦考洛说：“如果我们想在十年或二十年后成为大公司，我们必须能够处理数字和图形形式的信息。”</p><p class="para">The urge to enter the computer business came from Joe Wilson, who had long expressed apprehension that new technologies might someday render Xerox’s image-to-paper monopoly obsolete. “If we’re going to be big ten or twenty years out,” he once lectured McColough, “we’ve got to be able to handle information in digital form as well as graphic form.”</p>
<p class="para">麦科洛很快得出结论，加入数字革命的最佳方式是购买其中的一部分。然而，这一努力却变成了一场长期的喜剧。到 1968 年底，几乎没有一家计算机公司没有被施乐提出收购要约。“彼得翻遍了每一块石头，”一位在整个传奇过程中担任过多个公司工作组的高管回忆道。“他考察了每一个人。”霍尼韦尔、宝来、斯佩里、控制数据——当时与强大的 IBM 竞争的每一家领先制造商都拒绝了这一提议。施乐曾经发现一家公司急于出售，但它却退缩了。当时，通用电气一反常态地把分时业务搞得一团糟，于是以低价向施乐提出收购要约。但通用电气似乎是一个过于绝望的卖家。“他们不断提高折扣，并提出更优惠的条件，”同一位高管回忆道。“他们试图给麦科洛一份他无法拒绝的交易。但这是一个毫无希望的提议。通用电气既没有技术，也没有尖端业务，所以我们拒绝了他们。”</p><p class="para">McColough soon concluded that the best way to join the digital revolution was to buy a piece of it. This effort, however, turned into a long-running comedy. By the end of 1968 there were few computer companies in existence that Xerox had not approached with an acquisition offer. “Peter turned over every rock,” recalled one executive who served on numerous corporate task forces over the course of the saga. “He looked at everybody.” Honeywell, Burroughs, Sperry, Control Data—every leading manufacturer then competing with the redoubtable IBM rebuffed the overture. The one time Xerox found a company eager to sell, it developed cold feet. That happened when General Electric, which had uncharacteristically made a hash of its time-sharing business, offered the operation to Xerox at a bargain price. But GE appeared too desperate a seller. “They kept increasing the discount and making the terms more favorable,” remembered the same executive. “They were trying to give McColough a deal he couldn’t refuse. But it was a hopeless proposition. GE had neither technology nor a cutting-edge business, and we turned them down.”</p>
<p class="para">在其他时候，通用电气发出的信号不一，错失了机会。施乐公司向数字设备公司（DEC，一家年轻而激进的公司）的创始人兼董事长肯·奥尔森发出了收购要约。奥尔森的回答是断然拒绝。直到几年后，通用电气才<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch02.html.page25"></a>DEC 的原始融资人之一乔治·多里奥特 (Georges Doriot) 告诉高盛，施乐找错了人。“彼得是我在哈佛的学生，”他抱怨道。“他应该知道，在这种事情上，你不应该找总统。你应该找支持者。”</p><p class="para">At other points there had been mixed signals and missed opportunities. Xerox made an offer to Ken Olsen, the founder and chairman of Digital Equipment Corporation, the young and aggressive company known as DEC. Olsen’s answer was a flat refusal. Only years later did General <a></a>Georges Doriot, one of DEC’s original financiers, inform Goldman that Xerox had approached the wrong person. “Peter was my student at Harvard,” he complained. “He should have known you don’t approach the president on a matter like this. You talk to the backers.”</p>
<p class="para">麦科洛的愿望清单最终缩小到一个名字：马克斯·帕列夫斯基的科学数据系统公司，几年前精灵计划就是为这家公司建造 SDS 940 的。</p><p class="para">McColough’s wish list eventually dwindled down to a single name: Max Palevsky’s Scientific Data Systems, the same company for which Project Genie had built the SDS 940 a few years earlier.</p>
<p class="para">自从推出分时机以来，SDS 一直以惊人的速度增长。1968 年，也就是 McColough 入主施乐的那一年，公司创下了 1,000 万美元的利润记录。然而，只有像 McColough 这样对计算机行业一无所知的人，才会自欺欺人地认为 SDS 是施乐进入光明数字未来的入口。因为耀眼的数字掩盖了一些黯淡的事实。SDS 在科学计算领域取得的成功，无法轻易转移到高容量商业数据处理市场，这个竞争激烈的领域由 IBM 主导，McColough 现在希望施乐能在其中发挥重要作用。与此同时，SDS 的核心市场正遭受严重的经济衰退，政府研究资金的枯竭加剧了这种衰退。人们一直对该公司的研究能力和管理团队的深度存有疑问。</p><p class="para">Since bringing out the time-sharing machine SDS had continued to grow amazingly fast. In 1968, the year McColough came knocking, the company booked record profits of $10 million. Yet only someone with McColough’s total lack of understanding of the computer industry could delude himself into viewing SDS as Xerox’s entrée to a bright digital future. For the glittering numbers obscured some gloomy facts. SDS’s success at mining a comfortable niche in scientific computing would not easily transfer to the high-volume business data processing market, the ferociously competitive sector dominated by IBM in which McColough now expected Xerox to play a major role. SDS’s core market, meanwhile, was suffering from a serious economic downturn exacerbated by a drying up of government research funding. And there were nagging questions about the company’s research capabilities and the depth of its management team.</p>
<p class="para">帕列夫斯基是一位不屈不挠的推销员，他对这些细节避而不谈。私下里，他认为施乐的管理方式笨拙而缺乏想象力——教科书式的垄断者注定会在竞争激烈的市场中被践踏——但他勇敢地向麦考洛保证，两家公司是“绝配”。他宣称，SDS 拥有的高速打印技术，加上施乐在制造成像系统（即复印机）和向大公司推销方面的经验，将创造出独特的新商业产品，在 IBM 的巢穴里与其抗衡。麦考洛听信了施乐的劝说，如果施乐想加入，就必须迅速行动。正如他后来所说，SDS 是“城里剩下的唯一一场球赛”。</p><p class="para">A relentless salesman, Palevsky glided over such details. Privately considering Xerox management ponderous and unimaginative—textbook monopolists destined to be trampled in a competitive market—he gamely assured McColough that their two companies were “a perfect fit.” The high-speed printing technology SDS owned, combined with Xerox’s experience in making imaging systems (i.e., copiers) and marketing them to large corporations, would create unique new business products to beard IBM in its own lair, he proclaimed. McColough allowed himself to be persuaded that if Xerox wanted in, it had to move fast. SDS, as he later put it, was “the only ballgame left in town.”</p>
<p class="para">如果他在进入帕列夫斯基的巢穴之前先在自己的组织内进行调查，他可能会更好地对付这位推销大师。施乐总部配备了一支训练有素的金融专家队伍，可以分析每个主要行业。这是一个<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch02.html.page26"></a>公司规定，除非专门小组对目标公司的账簿和市场进行仔细审查，并向董事会提出合理的建议，否则不会考虑任何收购。</p><p class="para">Had he inquired within his own organization before straying into Palevsky’s lair, he might have been better armed to deal with this master pitchman. Xerox headquarters was equipped with a corps of talented financial experts trained to analyze every major industry. It was a <a></a>corporate rule that no acquisition could ever be considered until a task force placed the target’s books and markets under a microscope and delivered a thoroughly reasoned recommendation to the board.</p>
<p class="para">然而，这一次，麦科洛不明智地把专家们留在家里。这可能是出于过度谨慎：五年前，施乐公司对 SDS 的收购失败了，因为有传言称，施乐公司的一位高管为了收购而非法购买了 SDS 的股票。不知出于什么原因，在极其保密和几乎没有后援的情况下，他在埃尔塞贡多（El Segundo）与帕列夫斯基会面，埃尔塞贡多是一个工业村，现代 SDS 大楼就坐落在洛杉矶国际机场的边界线上，麦科洛与帕列夫斯基“讨价还价”。回想起来，哪一方占上风是一目了然的。帕列夫斯基后来回忆说，麦科洛“决心达成交易”。他说，会议“非常非常短。两个半天就搞定了。”</p><p class="para">This time, however, McColough unwisely left the experts at home. It may have been out of an excess of caution: A run Xerox had made at SDS five years earlier had collapsed amid rumors that a Xerox executive had illicitly bought SDS stock in anticipation of the takeover. For whatever reason, under conditions of extreme secrecy and with virtually no backup he met with Palevsky in El Segundo, the industrial hamlet where the modern SDS complex nestled against the boundary line of Los Angeles International Airport, to “dicker about price.” Which side had the upper hand was, in retrospect, crystal clear. McColough, Palevsky recalled later, “was determined to make a deal.” The meetings, he said, “were very, very short. Two half-days were all it took.”</p>
<p class="para">1969 年 2 月 10 日星期一，两人宣布，施乐将以超过 9.2 亿美元的价格收购科学数据系统公司，这是施乐有史以来最大的交易，也是当时美国公司历史上最大的交易之一。麦考洛一人之力震惊了投资界。首先，他提议用施乐股票支付帕列夫斯基。施乐股票确实是华尔街的热门股票——每股 269 美元，对于收购而言，这笔钱确实很便宜。但这并不意味着它不能被浪费。施乐将不得不发行近 350 万股新股来支付这笔交易。马克斯·帕列夫斯基将一举成为施乐最大的股东。此外，他本人、他的投资银行家亚瑟·罗克和两名值得信赖的副手还将获得董事会席位。</p><p class="para">On Monday, February 10, 1969, the two of them announced that Xerox, in the largest transaction it had ever undertaken and one of the largest in American corporate history up to that time, would buy Scientific Data Systems for more than $920 million. McColough’s one-man initiative stunned the investment community. For one thing, he proposed to pay Palevsky in Xerox shares. It was true that the stock was a high-flying favorite on Wall Street—trading at $269 a share, it was cheap currency indeed to spend on an acquisition. But that did not mean it could not be squandered. Xerox would have to issue nearly 3.5 million new shares to pay for the deal. Max Palevsky would be transformed into Xerox’s single largest stockholder in one giant step. Plus he was to be awarded seats on the board of directors for himself, his venture banker Arthur Rock, and two trusted lieutenants.</p>
<p class="para">对于一家单年收入从未超过 1000 万美元的公司来说，这笔交易还不到 McColough 同意为拥有其百分之一市场份额的公司支付的收购溢价的一半。如果 SDS 的情况没有好转，施乐的投资将在 92 年内无法收回。</p><p class="para">This for a company that had never made more than $10 million in a single year. IBM itself traded for less than half the purchase premium McColough had agreed to pay for a company with one-hundredth of its market share. If things did not pick up at SDS, Xerox’s investment would not be paid off for 92 years.</p>
<p class="para">人们立即担心施乐公司会因为急于进入计算机行业而购买一个空壳。高层管理人员已经成群结队地离开 SDS，其中许多人选择退休，享受他们拥有的<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch02.html.page27"></a>过去几年股价上涨带来的收益。帕列夫斯基本人公开宣布他打算尽快退出日常管理。在工作中，他很容易分心，涉足政治、电影、和平运动。有理由怀疑是否会有人留下来照看商店。</p><p class="para">Concerns surfaced immediately that Xerox was buying an empty shell in its desperation to get into the computer business. Top managers were already leaving SDS in droves, many of them retiring on what they had <a></a>made from the rise in its stock price over the previous few years. Palevsky himself had openly announced his intention to withdraw from day-to-day management as soon as possible. On the job he was prone to distraction, a dabbler in politics, movies, the peace movement. There was reason to question whether anyone would be left to mind the store.</p>
<p class="para">总部的杰克·戈德曼和其他人一样对 SDS 交易感到震惊。“我是公司研究主管，”他说，“但我没有被咨询过。根本没有。”</p><p class="para">Back at headquarters Jack Goldman was as shocked by the SDS deal as everybody else. “I was the head of research for the company,” he said, “but I wasn’t consulted. At all.”</p>
<p class="para">作为新人，他愿意原谅这种轻视，但只能在一定程度上原谅。在一项重大技术投资中，他的意见被忽视，这不符合施乐公司传统的研究观念：在某种意义上，这很好，但与战略规划等重要事项无关。</p><p class="para">He was willing to forgive the slight as the price of being a newcomer, but only up to a point. For his opinion to be overlooked on a major technology venture tasted disagreeably of Xerox’s traditional conception of research: fine in its place, but irrelevant to anything as important as strategic planning.</p>
<p class="para">据戈德曼所知，这种态度在公司内蔓延，这对公司来说是个不幸。它甚至影响了施乐公司的主要技术实验室所做的研究，该实验室位于罗切斯特郊区韦伯斯特，规模庞大。在福特，戈德曼最大的预算难题是为工程师和科学家的实验室购买所需的所有计算机，更不用说为团队引进外部专家来帮助他们利用新技术设计汽车了。</p><p class="para">From what Goldman could tell, this attitude pervaded the company, to its misfortune. It affected even the kind of research being done at Xerox’s main technical laboratory, a vast installation spread over the Rochester suburb of Webster. At Ford, Goldman’s biggest budgetary headache had been finding money for all the computers the engineers and scientists demanded for their labs, not to mention the outside experts imported by the platoon to help them exploit the new technology in designing cars.</p>
<p class="para">施乐研究部门从未发生过类似的事情。韦伯斯特的工程和研究人员对计算机辅助设计这一新科学漠不关心。韦伯斯特受过传统教育的化学家、物理学家和冶金学家将注意力集中在狭隘的、以产品为导向的任务上，试图开发更好的墨粉和感光器，以适应以同样的方式设计的复印机。就这一点而言，他们有足够的天赋，但他们没有动力跟上新的研究技术。至于将想象力运用到一门全新的科学、概念或机器上，韦伯斯特是无望的。这不是杰克·戈德曼理解的研究；这是产品开发，两者完全不同。</p><p class="para">Nothing of the kind ever occurred at Xerox research. The Webster engineering and research staff treated the new science of computer-aided design with utter indifference. Webster’s classically educated chemists, physicists, and metallurgists devoted their attention to narrow, product-oriented tasks, trying to develop better toners and photoreceptors to drop into copiers designed the same old way. As far as that went they were talented enough, but they had no incentive to keep up with new research techniques. As for applying imagination to an entirely new science, concept, or machine, Webster was hopeless. It was not research as Jack Goldman understood the word; it was product development, which was something very different.</p>
<p class="para">“真正的研究人员倾向于与整个世界互动，”他观察到。“他们知道大学校园里发生的事情，并受到邀请，因此他们成为你<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch02.html.page28"></a>可以吸引新想法进入公司。研究是一个渠道，通过它可以引进那些通常不会与设备设计人员交流的人，”他说。施乐公司一直没有新想法，而且这很明显。通过让研究人员自我隔离，公司变得像一座密封的坟墓一样陈旧。</p><p class="para">“Real research people tend to interact with the world at large,” he observed. “They know what’s happening on the university campuses and get invited back and forth, so they become an avenue through which you <a></a>can attract new ideas into the company. Research is a funnel through which you can bring in people who normally won’t talk to the guys down in the trenches designing equipment,” he said. Xerox had not been getting new ideas, and it showed. By allowing its researchers to isolate themselves the company had become as musty as a sealed tomb.</p>
<p class="para">戈德曼之所以同意加入施乐，只是因为他在麦考洛的前瞻性决心中看到了一线希望。这位加拿大出生的绅士型高管承诺将公司研究置于一个全新的基础上，从而将戈德曼从福特公司吸引过来。戈德曼可能觉得在总部有些不自在——身材矮小、肥胖、粗俗、机智敏锐、言辞尖刻，毕业于叶史瓦大学，与那些因商业成功而吸引施乐管理层的常春藤盟校高管形成了鲜明对比。但麦考洛承诺，作为首席科学家，他将有权自下而上地开展研究，追随科学的指引，而不是自上而下，这只符合公司老派的利益。这使得这个提议很难拒绝。</p><p class="para">Goldman had only agreed to join Xerox because he saw a glimmer of hope in McColough’s forward-looking determination. The gentlemanly Canadian-born executive had lured Goldman away from Ford by pledging to place corporate research on an entirely new footing. Goldman may have felt somewhat out of place at headquarters—short, rotund, and profane, quick-witted and sharp-tongued, and educated at Yeshiva University, he certainly made a contrast to the patrician, Ivy-Leaguish executives that commercial success had attracted the Xerox management cadre. But McColough had promised that as chief scientist he would have the authority to conduct research from the bottom up, following wherever science led him, rather than top-down, which only served the interests of the company’s old guard. That made the offer hard to resist.</p>
<p class="para">现在，戈德曼发现自己的信心动摇了。收购一家计算机制造商可能会为施乐注入新的活力，施乐已经从一个敏捷、创新、敢于冒险的公司沦为摇摇欲坠的巨头。但 SDS 并不是这样的收购对象。他对该公司的保守主义感到震惊。他向同事乔治·怀特透露，SDS 计算机在自己的市场上表现不错，但它们的时代已经过去了。没有人会再误以为它们是前沿技术。“他觉得埃尔塞贡多的那些家伙在技术方面只是一群愚蠢的模仿者，”怀特回忆道。“他们永远不会在任何重要的事情上成为第一。”</p><p class="para">Now Goldman found his confidence shaken. Acquiring a computer manufacturer could have helped inject a new attitude into a Xerox that had devolved from a nimble, innovative risk-taker into a creaking giant. But SDS was not that kind of acquisition. He was appalled at its intellectual conservatism. SDS computers were good enough in their own market, he confided to his colleague George White, but their day had passed. No one would mistake them any longer for leading-edge. “He felt those guys down there in El Segundo were just a bunch of dumbbell copycats as far as technology was concerned,” White recalled. “They were never going to be first on anything that mattered.”</p>
<p class="para">然而，它们可能还有一个更微妙的目的。随着 SDS 收购案即将在 6 月份的公司年度股东大会上进行股东投票，杰克·戈德曼开始思考如何从已经被贴上“彼得·麦考洛的愚蠢行为”标签的事件中为施乐抢占新的机会。</p><p class="para">Yet they might serve a subtler purpose. As the SDS purchase moved toward a shareholder vote at the corporate annual meeting in June, Jack Goldman contemplated how to snatch a new opportunity for Xerox from what was already being labeled “Peter McColough’s Folly.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">麦考洛用公司首席执行官所能想到的所有言辞来反驳华尔街对 SDS 的怀疑。他日渐衰落的声望使它成为<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch02.html.page29"></a>艰苦的战斗。大约一年前，他曾以同样固执己见的方式收购金融服务公司 CIT，但未获成功，这让投资界感到不满。这笔新交易再次引发了人们对他“高尔夫球场式”交易的抱怨，他讨厌这个标签。他坚称，SDS 是一家成功的公司，最好的年华还在后头。“它每年都在盈利。增长记录很棒。盈利记录很棒。所以我们达成了交易。”</p><p class="para">McColough fought Wall Street’s doubts about SDS with all the rhetoric a corporate chief executive could muster. His waning prestige made it an <a></a>uphill battle. A year or so earlier he had disgruntled the investment community with an equally headstrong—and unsuccessful—takeover bid for the financial services company CIT. This new transaction revived complaints about his “golf-course” deal-making, a label he detested. SDS was a successful company with its best years still ahead, he asserted. “It had been making profits every year. The growth record was great. The profitability record was great. So we made a deal.”</p>
<p class="para">他的论点只会激起更多的怀疑。行业分析师对这笔交易的热情持续降温，他们认为 SDS 主营业务的增长前景微乎其微，并不乐观。最后，在纽约证券分析师的午餐会上，麦科洛提出了一个夸张的愿景。他说，将 SDS 和施乐视为独立的公司是错误的。他的想法是让 SDS 帮助施乐将其在办公复印机市场的统治扩展到更大的领域——“未来的办公室”。他强调说，未来的施乐将控制“信息架构”。</p><p class="para">His arguments only incited more skepticism. The growth prospects in SDS’s main lines of business were meager, not great, according to industry analysts whose ardor for the transaction continued to cool. Finally, at a luncheon meeting of New York securities analysts, McColough laid out a grandiloquent vision. It was wrong to look at SDS and Xerox as separate companies, he said. His idea was for SDS to help Xerox expand its rule over the office copier market into the domination of a greater universe—“the office of the future.” The Xerox to come, he declared emphatically, would control “the architecture of information.”</p>
<p class="para">这句话是典型的 CEO 用语，严肃、有倾向性，而且含糊不清，与施乐选择的任何战略完全一致。麦考洛后来将这句话归功于他的演讲稿撰写人。然而在接下来的十年里，这句话一直萦绕在空气中，像回声一样挥之不去。信息架构：这句话就像刻在施乐即将建造的山顶宫殿的门上，用来安置一群与公司以往的工资单上的其他员工截然不同的员工。</p><p class="para">The phrase was classic CEO-speak, grave, tendentious, and nebulous enough to be perfectly consistent with any strategy Xerox chose to pursue. McColough later attributed the wording to his speechwriter. Yet for the next decade it would hang in the air like an persistent echo. The architecture of information: The phrase might as well have been chiseled over the doors of the hilltop palace Xerox would soon build to house a group of employees quite unlike any others the company had ever placed on its payroll.</p>
<p class="para">“这句话很棒，”一位 PARC 工程师后来说道，“因为没人知道它到底是什么意思。所以你可以做很多有趣的事情，并简单地引用这句话作为理由。”</p><p class="para">“It was a great phrase,” one PARC engineer said later, “because nobody knew exactly what it meant. So there were quite a few interesting things you could do and simply cite that as the justification.”</p>
<p class="para">5 月，股东们相信了麦科洛对未来的模糊设想，批准以 9.18 亿美元的股票收购 SDS。施乐拥有了 SDS 的计算机公司。现在它需要想办法处理它。</p><p class="para">In May the shareholders, accepting on faith McColough’s hazy vision of the future, approved the acquisition of SDS for a final price of $918 million in stock. Xerox owned its computer company. Now it needed to figure out what to do with it.</p>
<p class="para">这时杰克·戈德曼介入了。年会结束六周后，他向麦科洛提交了一份长达 21 页的提案，其中包括人员配置图表和未来五年的预计预算，用于建设一个充满活力的新科学设施。</p><p class="para">That is where Jack Goldman stepped in. Six weeks after the annual meeting he delivered to McColough a twenty-one-page proposal, complete with staffing charts and pro-forma budgets looking ahead five years, for a dynamic new scientific facility.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch02.html.page30"></a>
<p class="para">收购 SDS 为他提供了一个立足之地。表面上看，所谓的“施乐高级科学与系统实验室”是为了加强新子公司薄弱的研究能力。但高盛打算以此为基础建造一座更大的大厦。他精明地意识到施乐渴望与 IBM 和 AT&amp;T 等工业实力典范并驾齐驱，因此他勾勒出一个从事基础科学研究的公司研究中心，独立于任何现有产品组，就像 IBM 传说中的约克敦高地研究中心和 AT&amp;T 的贝尔实验室一样。大约一半的员工将致力于高级物理和材料研究，其余员工将致力于系统和计算等新科学。</p><p class="para">The SDS purchase had given him a peg on which to hang the proposal. On the surface the rationale for the so-called “Xerox Advanced Scientific &amp; Systems Laboratory” was to fortify the new subsidiary’s weak research capability. But from that foundation Goldman was intent on building a much larger edifice. Cannily recognizing that Xerox yearned to be ranked alongside such paragons of industrial muscle as IBM and AT&amp;T, he sketched out a corporate research center engaged in basic science independent of any existing product group, exactly like IBM’s fabled Yorktown Heights research center and AT&amp;T’s Bell Laboratories. About half the staff would be devoted to advanced physics and materials research, and the rest to the new sciences of systems and computing.</p>
<p class="para">“他谈论的是一流的研究设施，”当时韦伯斯特的一位员工后来回忆道。“这个设施将通过吸引顶尖科学家进行基础研究而为全世界所知，甚至可能赢得一两个诺贝尔奖。”</p><p class="para">“He was talking about a first-class research facility,” one Webster staff executive of the time recalled later. “Something that would become known worldwide by attracting top scientists doing fundamental research, and maybe winning a Nobel Prize or two.”</p>
<p class="para">因此，戈德曼不仅将该实验室与 SDS 的当前需求联系起来，而且更模糊地将其与“施乐的长远利益”联系起来。工作人员将被指派“在那些看起来相关或可能变得相关的学科中建立科学领先地位”。即使计算机科学需要大部分关注，戈德曼也警告施乐必须学会预料意外情况。“计算机的使用至少发展得和预期的一样快，但方式却不是大多数预言家所预期的。”总的来说，在鼓励上级相信新实验室符合施乐现有业务战略的同时，他巧妙地建立了一个案例，利用基础研究来发现新的、意想不到的机会。</p><p class="para">Goldman therefore associated the lab not only with the immediate needs of SDS but more vaguely with “Xerox’s long-range interests.” The staff would be assigned “to establish scientific preeminence in those disciplines that appear relevant or likely to become relevant.” Even if computer science demanded the lion’s share of attention, Goldman warned that Xerox must learn to expect the unexpected. “The use of computers has developed at least as fast as anticipated, but not in the manner anticipated by most prognosticators.” Overall, while encouraging his superiors to believe the new lab sprang logically from Xerox’s existing business strategy, he subtly built a case for using basic research to identify new, unanticipated opportunities.</p>
<p class="para">在福特，戈德曼经常被指责缺乏精明的商业意识。（他总是不厌其烦地讲述亨利·福特二世在目睹了一项非凡但不切实际的新技术演示后说：“杰克，你的东西很少装在车上，对吧？”）后来，他在施乐也面临同样的批评。然而，他的备忘录瞥见了计算技术可能将公司引向何方。戈德曼意识到——远远领先于该领域的许多其他人——软件将很快超过硬件，成为创新的驱动力。更重要的是，他看到它<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch02.html.page31"></a>将成为施乐公司能够利用计算机驱动高科技打印机的能力获利的关键。</p><p class="para">Goldman had often been reproached at Ford for lacking a refined sense of business or commerce. (He never tired of telling the story of how Henry Ford II, witnessing a demonstration of some remarkable but impractical new technology, remarked: “Not much of your stuff gets on a car, does it, Jack?”) He would later face the same criticism at Xerox. Yet his memo glimpsed where computing might lead the company. Among other things, Goldman recognized—significantly ahead of many others in the field—that software would soon outstrip hardware as the driving force of innovation. More important, he saw that it <a></a>would be the key to Xerox’s ability to profit from the computer’s ability to drive a high-tech printer.</p>
<p class="para">他写道：“施乐公司应该用一台一半是静电复印机、一半是计算机的机器来革新某些打印功能。”因此，施乐公司比 PARC 最赚钱的产品——激光打印机——提前十多年问世。他还准确地预测了教育和图形领域蓬勃发展的机会，而早在硬件出现之前，任何运行哪怕是与商业系统略有相似的东西的硬件都还未出现。</p><p class="para">“Xerox should be the one to revolutionize certain printing functions with a machine which is half xerographic printer and half computing machine,” he wrote, thus anticipating by more than ten years the product with which Xerox would most profitably commercialize the work of PARC: the laser printer. He also accurately forecast burgeoning opportunities in education and graphics long before the hardware existed to run anything even faintly resembling a commercial system.</p>
<p class="para">然而，同样明显的是，高盛并没有充分认识到建立一个几乎完全脱离施乐现有业务需求的实验室的危险。谁能预见到，一小群与世隔绝、享有特权的理论家会与成千上万的普通工程师疏远，而这些工程师面临着无休止的最后期限，需要将产品推出？或者，当他写到系统科学实验室将“与整个公司建立融洽关系”时，他只是在虚伪。</p><p class="para">Yet it is also evident that Goldman did not fully appreciate the hazards of creating a laboratory almost entirely divorced from the needs of Xerox’s existing businesses. Who could have foreseen the abyss that would alienate one tiny group of sequestered and privileged theoreticians from the thousands of ordinary engineers who faced relentless deadlines to get product out the door? Or perhaps he was merely being disingenuous when he wrote of a systems science laboratory that would “develop rapport with the entire company.”</p>
<p class="para">戈德曼为企业实验室提出了一项雄心勃勃的增长计划。实验室成立时将有 25 到 30 名研究人员，预算不到 100 万美元，但大约四年后，实验室规模将与韦伯斯特实验室相当，拥有 300 名员工，设施价值 700 万美元。他预测，以 1969 年的美元计算，运营预算将稳定在每年约 600 万美元。（事实证明，这个数字比实际少了五倍。）</p><p class="para">Goldman proposed an ambitious growth plan for the corporate lab. It would open with twenty-five to thirty researchers and a budget of less than $1 million, but equal Webster’s size within about four years with a staff of 300 housed in a seven-million-dollar facility. The operating budget, he forecast, would plateau at about $6 million a year in 1969 dollars. (The figure turned out to be short by a factor of five.)</p>
<p class="para">至于新实验室的选址，他推荐纽黑文，因为那里有耶鲁大学的“知识夜生活”，可以吸引潜在的新员工，而且距离斯坦福的新总部也很近。“如果新研究中心与施乐环境和施乐思维太过隔绝，那么与施乐需求和实践相结合的机会就会大大减少，”他预言道。“另一方面，靠近公司总部的地点在与施乐未来和现在的商业利益相结合方面有很大优势。”</p><p class="para">As for the new lab’s location, he recommended New Haven, which offered Yale University’s “intellectual night life” as a lure for prospective recruits as well as proximity to the new corporate seat in Stamford. “If the new research center is too isolated from Xerox environment and Xerox thinking, the chances of relevant coupling to Xerox’s needs and practices will be severely diminished,” he wrote prophetically. “On the other hand, a site near corporate headquarters has very much to offer in terms of coupling to the full range of future as well as present business interests of Xerox.”</p>
<p class="para">自由而富有进取心的彼得·麦考洛夫对企业研究隐居地的想法十分着迷。然而，他的热情并没有得到高层的一致认同。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch02.html.page32"></a>公司。在董事会会议上，戈德曼介绍了他的新实验室计划，却遭到了来自意想不到的来源的强烈反对：来自 SDS 的新董事会成员。</p><p class="para">The liberal and enterprising Peter McColough was thoroughly enchanted by the notion of a corporate research hermitage. His enthusiasm, however, was not unanimously shared in the top reaches of the <a></a>company. At the board meeting at which Goldman presented his plans for the new lab, strident opposition arose from an unexpected source: the new board members from SDS.</p>
<p class="para">马克斯·帕列夫斯基极力反对每年花五六百万美元进行不切实际的研究。他认为麦考洛和高盛对待严肃的财务承诺就像是业余爱好者，他们的动机与真正的企业目标无关。“我记得 IBM 在关于研究中心的讨论中被提到过很多次，”他后来回忆道。“这是企业的炫耀性消费。我从来没有感觉到施乐公司的人明白，除非你真的像 IBM 那样进行基础研究，否则这样的事情是不会赚钱的——把它当作一项需要多年才能带来回报的大工程。”他抱怨道，如果施乐公司真的在进行计算机研究，为什么不直接把钱给 SDS？这样计算机部门就可以开发其 Sigma 系列计算机的新版本，该系列计算机是为了取代老化的 930 而推出的。</p><p class="para">Max Palevsky balked violently at the idea of dissipating five or six million dollars a year on pie-in-the-sky research. He thought McColough and Goldman, were approaching a serious financial commitment like dilettantes and that their motives were irrelevant to real corporate goals. “The memory I carried away was the number of times IBM came up in the discussions about the research center,” he recalled later. “It was corporate conspicuous consumption. I never got the feeling that the people at Xerox understood that something like this didn’t pay unless you really did basic research like IBM—treat it as a big undertaking that would need years to give you any return.” If Xerox was serious about computer research, he groused, why not simply give the money to SDS? Then the computer division would be able to develop a new version of its Sigma series computer, which had been brought out to supplant the aging 930.</p>
<p class="para">戈德曼对此感到厌恶。他回答说，为 SDS 利益服务的最佳方式是开展独立、影响深远的基础研究，而不是资助对老化产品的渐进式升级。“他们才是能从研究实验室中获利最多的人，但他们对此完全不感兴趣，”他后来说道。</p><p class="para">Goldman was disgusted. He replied that the best way to serve SDS interests was to mount an independent, far-reaching effort in basic research, not by financing incremental upgrades for an aging product. “They were the people who could best profit from the research lab, and they were completely disinterested,” he said later.</p>
<p class="para">无论如何，麦科洛拥有独自批准新实验室的必要权力。他邀请戈德曼参加会议是出于对董事会的礼遇，而不是为了争取选票。至于 SDS 派系，“彼得没有太在意他们的反对意见，愿上帝保佑他，”戈德曼回忆道。“但从记录上看，他既没有要求也没有请求董事会批准。”</p><p class="para">In any event, McColough had the necessary authority to green-light the new lab on his own. He had brought Goldman into the meeting as a courtesy to the board, not as a bid for votes. As for the SDS faction, “Peter didn’t pay too much attention to their objections, bless his soul,” Goldman recalled. “But as a matter of record he did not require nor did he ask for board approval.”</p>
<p class="para">他同意高德曼在尚待确定的地点建立施乐公司的第二个全尺寸研究实验室，但条件是，该实验室的人力和预算不能超过罗切斯特郊外引以为豪的韦伯斯特研究园区。高德曼对这个唯一的警告不以为然。根据他的总体规划，这两个实验室将指向完全不同的方向。不过，他心里到底喜欢哪一个，这一点是毫无疑问的。口袋里有了种子资金，他开始为施乐公司建造一座新科学的圣殿。</p><p class="para">To Goldman he gave his blessing to establish Xerox’s second full-scale research laboratory on a site to be determined, with the understanding that it was not to outshine in manpower or budget the proud Webster research park outside Rochester. Goldman shrugged at this solitary caveat. According to his master plan, the two labs would be pointed in entirely different directions. Still, there was no question with which one his heart lay. With seed money in his pocket, he set off to build Xerox a shrine to a new science.</p>

<p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">1969 年5</span></span>月，大约在施乐公司股东投票批准收购 SDS 的时候，圣路易斯华盛顿大学的教务长已经快要走投无路了。刚刚结束的学年是乔治·E·帕克职业生涯中最艰难的一年。20 世纪 60 年代对任何大学管理部门来说都不是轻松的时期，但帕克觉得，在上个学期，他所在的文科校园里通常平静的骚乱达到了顶峰。一群抗议的学生占领了校长办公室。有人向后备军官训练团的拱形活动房投掷了燃烧弹，并将其烧毁。帕克花了一年时间与各种反动的校董和校友进行斗争，他回忆说，他们“想知道为什么我们不解雇学生，留下教职员工。”春天快要结束时，他说，“我简直是战斗疲劳。”</p><p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">I</span></span>n May 1969, about the time Xerox shareholders voted to approve the purchase of SDS, the provost of Washington University in St. Louis was reaching the end of his rope. The academic year just ending had been the most trying of George E. Pake’s career. The 1960s were not easy on anyone in a college administration, but Pake felt that unrest on his own normally placid liberal arts campus had reached a high-water mark during the previous semester. A group of protesting students had occupied the chancellor’s office. Someone tossed a Molotov cocktail into the ROTC Quonset hut and burned it to the ground. Pake spent the year contending with all sorts of reactionary trustees and alumni who, he recalled, “wondered why we didn’t just fire the students and keep the faculty.” As spring drew to a close, he said, “I was a case of battle fatigue.”</p>
<p class="para">在一个更加和平的时代，帕克似乎是理想的大学管理者。他身材瘦削，性格内向，说话简洁，略带心不在焉，这加强了他学究气十足的气质。但这种羞怯是骗人的。当教职员工变得暴躁时，他可以坚持自己的立场，尤其是当被要求坚持学术规范标准时。他坚持认为，公平是<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch03.html.page34"></a>关键。大型学术机构的管理人员不可能知道足够多的信息，能够仅从学术或学术角度调解所有问题。在智力过高、社交礼仪欠缺的强大教职员工之间进行仲裁的诀窍是保持坚定不移的公正。当其他一切都失败时，就把一切都分成两半。</p><p class="para">In a more peaceful era Pake would have seemed the ideal college administrator. Narrow-shouldered and retiring, he possessed a clipped and slightly distracted manner of speaking that reinforced his donnish air. But this diffidence was deceptive. When the faculty got fractious he could dig in his heels and hold his ground, especially when called upon to uphold his standards of academic propriety. Fairness, he insisted, was the <a></a>key. No administrator of a large academic institution could possibly know enough to mediate every issue purely on academic or scholastic grounds. The trick in refereeing among powerful faculty with their overdeveloped intellects and underdeveloped social graces was to remain unyieldingly impartial. When all else fails, split everything down the middle.</p>
<p class="para">这是他从斯坦福大学来到圣路易斯多年来一直努力磨练的一项技能，他曾在斯坦福大学担任物理学教授。华盛顿大学任命了一位充满活力的新校长，决心提升其作为一流学术机构的声誉，而帕克也接受了他的号召，以高级管理人员的身份加入了这场运动。起初，这种变化激发了他的理想主义。他想象自己以一种如果他只是一名教师和实验室研究员就无法做到的方式促进高等教育的社会效益。但到了 1969 年春天，当他成为下一任校长时，他也变得非常失望。</p><p class="para">This was a skill he had tried to hone in the years since he had come to St. Louis from Stanford, where he had held a physics professorship. Washington University had installed a dynamic new chancellor determined to enhance its reputation as a first-class academic institution, and Pake had accepted his call to join the crusade as a senior administrator. At first the change fed his idealism. He imagined himself promoting the social benefits of higher education in ways that would be closed to him if he remained merely a teacher and laboratory researcher. But by the spring of 1969, when he was next in line to succeed that chancellor, he had also become profoundly disillusioned.</p>
<p class="para">“我从未想象过自己会在军事行动中指挥指挥，”他说。“我知道我不想成为总理候选人，不想过那种金鱼缸里的生活。我的妻子会讨厌它。”</p><p class="para">“I hadn’t visualized myself as running a command post in a military operation,” he said. “I knew I did not want to be a candidate for chancellor, not to lead that goldfish-bowl kind of life. My wife would have hated it.”</p>
<p class="para">于是那年秋天他又回去教书了。感恩节周末，就在他终于重新适应教室和黑板的环境时，他接到了老朋友杰克·戈德曼的电话。</p><p class="para">So that fall he returned to teaching. On Thanksgiving weekend, just as he was finally reacclimating to the milieu of classroom and chalkboard, he got a phone call from his old friend Jack Goldman.</p>
<p class="para">“乔治，”戈德曼说，“我有一个建议给你。”</p><p class="para">“George,” Goldman said, “I got a proposition for you.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">杰克·戈德曼与乔治·帕克的渊源可以追溯到 25 年前，当时他们曾在西屋研究实验室共同参与战时项目，戈德曼是高级研究员，帕克是西屋的本科学者。</p><p class="para">Jack Goldman’s relationship with George Pake dated back twenty-five years to when they had worked together on wartime projects at Westinghouse Research Laboratory, Goldman as a senior fellow and Pake as a Westinghouse undergraduate scholar.</p>
<p class="para">战后，戈德曼继续留在工业界，而佩克则前往哈佛攻读博士学位。但他们在物理学家这个与世隔绝的圈子里关注着彼此的职业生涯。就在戈德曼开始为他的新研究中心寻找主任时，他听说福特曾把他以前的工作让给佩克，但佩克拒绝了。</p><p class="para">After the war Goldman remained in industry while Pake moved on to Harvard for his doctorate. But they kept track of each other’s careers within the insular community of working physicists. Just as he was starting his search for a director for his new research center, Goldman heard that Ford had offered his former job to Pake, and that Pake had turned it down.</p>
<p class="para">戈德曼猜测，佩克的推理与福特对基础研究的反复无常的承诺有关。“我认为我可以做出更好的<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch03.html.page35"></a>“他为施乐所做的努力比福特为福特所做的努力还要多，”他回忆道。在芝加哥的一次演讲结束后，他乘坐施乐公司新推出的 Sabreliner 商务机（他最喜欢的交通工具）飞往圣路易斯。“我在机场遇到了佩克，邀请他登上公司的飞机，给他喝了几杯，并建议他加入。”</p><p class="para">Goldman guessed Pake’s reasoning had something to do with Ford’s erratic commitment to basic research. “I figured I could make a better <a></a>case for Xerox than Ford could make for Ford,” he recalled. After a speaking engagement in Chicago he swung down to St. Louis in Xerox’s new Sabreliner corporate jet (his favorite mode of transportation). “I met Pake at the airport, invited him aboard the company plane, gave him a couple of drinks and proposed that he join up.”</p>
<p class="para">事实上，高盛的宣传比这个轻松的描述更集中。两人从机场赶到附近的酒店，高盛花了大半天时间，向他描绘了一个诱人的愿景：在原始环境中利用施乐的大量现金进行计算机研究。“我们说的是真金白银，乔治，”他说，向他展示了实验室的发展计划，该实验室将在四年内雇用 300 名专业人员。</p><p class="para">In truth, Goldman’s pitch was more focused than this breezy description suggests. From the airport the two of them repaired to a nearby hotel, where Goldman spent the better part of a day spinning a seductive vision of computer research conducted in a pristine setting with Xerox’s copious cash. “We’re talking real money, George,” he said, showing him the growth plan for a lab that would employ 300 professionals within four years.</p>
<p class="para">帕克犹豫了，他想知道施乐的长期决心。“我有很多朋友在其他工业研究机构工作，他们通常担心的是盛衰效应，”他后来说。“你知道，在经济繁荣的年份，公司会投资研究，但在经济不景气的年份，他们想退出。”这是浪费数百万美元的秘诀。“研究是一个稳态的东西。你不能只是打开和关闭它。”</p><p class="para">Pake hesitated, wondering about Xerox’s resolve over the long haul. “I had a lot of friends at other industrial research establishments and the usual thing they were worried about was the feast-or-famine effect,” he said later. “You know, in the good business years the company invests in research, but in the bad years they want to pull out.” That was a recipe for wasting millions of dollars. “Research is a steady-state thing. You can’t just turn it on and off.”</p>
<p class="para">戈德曼竭尽全力安慰佩克。他提醒佩克，1944 年，哈洛伊德公司向切斯特·卡尔森提供了研究支持，而其他公司都不愿意这样做。卡尔森几乎没有任何东西可以证明他的发明的潜力，除了一张小纸片，上面他潦草地复制了自己写的“10-22-38 Astoria”——这是他第一次成功复印的日期和地点。现在的施乐公司已经投资这项不可思议的发明 15 年，直到 1959 年第一台 914 型打印机下线并大获成功。长期研究？全国有哪家企业比施乐公司更了解它？</p><p class="para">Goldman tried his best to be reassuring. He reminded Pake that in 1944 the Haloid Company had offered Chester Carlson research support when no other corporation would. Carlson had scarcely anything to demonstrate the potential of his invention other than a tiny scrap of paper on which he had duplicated his own scrawled “10–22–38 Astoria”—the date and place of his first successful xerographic copy. The company that was now Xerox had invested in that improbable invention for fifteen years before the first Model 914 came off the production line in 1959 and made its fortune. Long-range research? Was there an enterprise anywhere in the land that understood it better than Xerox?</p>
<p class="para">“是的，但在我看来，公司已经搞反了，”帕克回答道。“如果你打算涉足计算机行业，你应该先让研究人员帮你确定要收购的合适公司。”</p><p class="para">“Yes, but it seems to me the corporation has got it backwards,” Pake replied. “If you’re going into the computer business, you should have got the researchers first to help you identify the right corporation to buy.”</p>
<p class="para">戈德曼表示：“不幸的是，现在已经太晚了。”</p><p class="para">“Unfortunately,” Goldman said, “it’s too late for that.”</p>
<p class="para">帕克在会议结束时坚持说，他非常享受在圣路易斯当大学教授的生活，但他开始崩溃了。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch03.html.page36"></a>杰克·戈德曼重新登上飞机，他得到了帕克的同意，同意前往罗切斯特和斯坦福会见彼得·麦考洛和董事长乔·威尔逊。如果有人能说服他这个摇摆不定的猎物加入公司，他们就一定能做到。</p><p class="para">Pake ended the meeting insisting how deeply he enjoyed the life of a college professor in St. Louis, but he was beginning to crack. Before <a></a>Jack Goldman reboarded his plane he extracted Pake’s agreement to visit Rochester and Stamford to meet Peter McColough and the chairman, Joe Wilson. If anyone could charm his wavering quarry into joining the company, they could.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">“我回去后问彼得·麦考洛为什么要开办一个新的研究中心，”帕克后来回忆道。“我说，‘你们这里有一个研发静电复印技术的研究中心。要建一个新的研究中心，你必须有一个新的研究图书馆和新的研究机械车间以及所有其他东西。你必须重复很多固定成本。扩大罗切斯特的实验室不是更容易吗？’</p><p class="para">“When I went back I asked Peter McColough why he wanted to start a new research center,” Pake recalled later. “I said, ‘You’ve got a research center here that has developed xerography. To build a new one you’ll have to have a new research library and new research machine shop and all the other things. Lot of fixed costs you have to duplicate. Wouldn’t it be easier to expand the laboratory in Rochester?’</p>
<p class="para">“麦考洛转向我——我清楚地记得这次谈话，它在我的记忆中是不可磨灭的。他说，‘乔治，我认为罗切斯特的这些人在静电复印技术方面取得了巨大的成功。但我不确定他们是否有足够的适应能力来接受新的和不同的技术。如果我们要将新技术引入施乐，最好在一个全新的环境中进行。’”</p><p class="para">“McColough turned to me—and I remember this conversation very well, it’s indelible in my memory. He said, ‘George, I think these people here in Rochester have had a heady success with xerography. But I’m not sure they’re adaptable enough to take on new and different technologies. If we’re going to bring new technologies into Xerox it would be better to do it in a whole new setting.’”</p>
<p class="para">麦科洛的回答可能直接出自杰克·戈德曼的剧本。尽管帕克本人不愿意，但他还是被麦科洛和威尔逊深深地迷住了，他们似乎愿意在一次面试后就让他掌管价值数百万美元的公司资产，这让他深感荣幸，尤其是因为他告诉他们，他希望人们能以自由主义的标准来衡量他的成功。</p><p class="para">McColough’s reply might have come directly from the Jack Goldman playbook. Despite himself, Pake was utterly taken with McColough and Wilson and deeply flattered by their apparent willingness to place him in charge of a multimillion-dollar corporate asset after only one interview, especially since he told them he would expect to be held to a liberal standard of success.</p>
<p class="para">“我说过，如果你雇用我，五年内你不会得到任何商业价值，”他回忆道。“但如果十年内你没有得到任何有价值的东西，那么你就会知道你雇错了人。”</p><p class="para">“I said if you hire me you will get nothing of business value in five years,” he recalled. “But if you don’t have something of value in ten years, then you’ll know you’ve hired the wrong guy.”</p>
<p class="para">帕克知道，管理一个致力于寻找他最喜爱的物理学和数字计算这一新领域的共同点的研究中心是千载难逢的机会。相比之下，在中西部结束自己的教学生涯似乎确实没有什么吸引力。1970 年元旦刚过，他就打电话给杰克·戈德曼，表示接受这份工作。</p><p class="para">Pake understood that managing a research center devoted to finding a common ground between his first love, physics, and the intriguing new field of digital computing was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. In comparison, the charm of closing out one’s teaching career in the Midwest seemed meager indeed. Just after New Year’s Day 1970, he telephoned Jack Goldman to accept the job.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">第一件事就是找一个地点。</p><p class="para">The first order of business was to find a site.</p>
<p class="para">高盛将实验室设在纽黑文的计划甚至失败了<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch03.html.page37"></a>在帕克加入之前，耶鲁大学一直处于困境之中。事实证明，耶鲁大学患上了“城镇长袍综合症”这种古老疾病，其严重程度比戈德曼想象的还要严重。的确，耶鲁大学以教师的势利而闻名，但他仍然对耶鲁大学对校园外企业的不友好感到震惊。面对被剥夺资源的前景，戈德曼决定另寻他处，而这些资源正是他最初寻求学术环境的原因。</p><p class="para">Goldman’s plan to locate the lab in New Haven had collapsed even <a></a>before Pake came aboard. Yale, as it turned out, was afflicted by a strain of that old malady known as the town-gown syndrome more virulent than Goldman had suspected. The university, it was true, was famous for the snobbery of its faculty, but he was still shocked at its unfriendliness to enterprises located outside the grimy stone campus walls. Faced with the prospect of being shut off from the very resources for which he sought an academic setting in the first place, Goldman decided to look elsewhere.</p>
<p class="para">早期，其他几个候选地点也被排除在外。其中包括韦伯斯特，因为戈德曼担心他的新实验室会受到罗切斯特仍然根深蒂固的复印机官僚机构的智力控制。同样被排除的还有普林斯顿大学；纽约州立大学长岛的石溪分校，该校正在那里建设新校区；以及东海岸的其他几个地点，这些地点要么距离现有的施乐工厂太远，要么缺乏戈德曼渴望的贝尔实验室的声望。</p><p class="para">Several other possibilities were culled early. These included Webster, where Goldman feared his new lab would come under the intellectual domination of the copier bureaucracy still entrenched in Rochester. Also rejected were Princeton; Stony Brook on Long Island, where the State University of New York was building a new campus; and several other East Coast sites that were either too far from an established Xerox facility or lacked the cachet Goldman craved for his would-be Bell Labs.</p>
<p class="para">派克把戈德曼的注意力引向了西部。20 世纪 60 年代初在斯坦福大学任教期间，他曾目睹过一个现象，这个现象很快使圣克拉拉半岛以“硅谷”而闻名。签约几周后，他提议戈德曼包租公司的飞机去加州旅行。戈德曼是个热心的企业旅行者，他欣然同意了。不久，他和派克就从伯克利向南前往圣地亚哥，在每一所主要大学校园停留，寻找理想的地点。</p><p class="para">Pake directed Goldman’s attention westward. Teaching at Stanford in the early 1960s had given him a glimpse of the phenomenon that would shortly make the Santa Clara peninsula famous as “Silicon Valley.” A few weeks after signing on, he proposed that Goldman charter the company plane for a California excursion. Ardent corporate wayfarer that he was, Goldman agreed with alacrity. Soon he and Pake were working their way south from Berkeley to San Diego, stopping at every major university campus in search of the ideal spot.</p>
<p class="para">但伯克利没有可用的房地产来支持企业研究机构。在圣巴巴拉，一所新的州立大学校园正在耀眼的海岸线上拔地而起，那里有房地产，但没有大型机场。“奥克斯纳德……惨不忍睹，”佩克回忆道。“帕萨迪纳……雾霾可怕。施乐在那里有一个叫做光电系统的部门，占地面积相当大，但它无法与加州理工学院互动——太工业化了。所以我们没有看到任何令人鼓舞的事情。”</p><p class="para">But at Berkeley there was no available real estate to support a corporate research facility. At Santa Barbara, where a new state university campus was sprouting on the dazzling coastline, there was real estate but no major airport. “Oxnard…dismal,” Pake recalled. “Pasadena…Smog was terrible. Xerox had a division called Electro-Optical Systems there with a fairly big site but it was not something that could interact with Caltech—too industrial. So we didn’t see anything very encouraging.”</p>
<p class="para">这很符合他的目的。因为他带领戈德曼进行的旋风式参观主要是装点门面。帕克的主要目标是斯坦福大学及其充满活力的家乡帕洛阿尔托。戈德曼最初排除了这个地点，因为附近没有任何施乐工厂，但帕克鼓励他重新考虑。他从经验中知道，这所大学急于与工业企业建立牢固的关系<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch03.html.page38"></a>整个山谷里，像蚁丘一样涌现出来。此外，这里还有宜人的物质和文化氛围——如果想吸引有天赋的研究人员到胚胎实验室，这一点不容忽视。</p><p class="para">That suited his purposes fine. For the whirlwind tour on which he led Goldman was mostly window dressing. Pake’s primary objective was Stanford and its vibrant home town, Palo Alto. Goldman had initially ruled out the site for lack of any nearby Xerox facility, but Pake goaded him to reconsider. He knew from experience that the university was anxious to develop strong relationships with the industrial enterprises <a></a>springing up like anthills all over the valley. Then there was the salubrious physical and cultural climate—not a trivial consideration if one hoped to attract gifted researchers to an embryonic lab.</p>
<p class="para">对于戈德曼反对帕洛阿尔托距离施乐的任何一家工厂都太远的说法，帕克巧妙地用含糊其辞的方式反驳道：距离意味着足够近，可以及时吃午饭到达施乐工厂。SDS 位于洛杉矶，距离湾区一小时航程。任何人都可以早上离开帕洛阿尔托，在 SDS 吃午饭，然后及时回家吃晚饭。实验室最初的理由不就是 SDS 的研究支持吗？</p><p class="para">As for Goldman’s objection that Palo Alto was too far from any Xerox property, Pake countered with a neat equivocation: Let proximity mean being close enough to reach a Xerox facility in time for lunch. SDS was in Los Angeles, an hour’s flight from the Bay Area. Anyone could leave Palo Alto in the morning, lunch at SDS, and get home in time for dinner. And was not the original rationale for the lab to be SDS’s research support?</p>
<p class="para">“这是一个非常有趣的想法，”戈德曼说，屈服于不可避免的事情。<span class="sup">*</span> 3 月初，帕克任命他的前两名员工，一对来自韦伯斯特研究部门的行政官员理查德·琼斯 (Richard E. Jones) 和弗兰克·斯奎尔斯 (M. Frank Squires)，负责飞往帕洛阿尔托寻找合适的办公楼。</p><p class="para">“That’s a very interesting thought,” Goldman said, bowing to the inevitable.<span class="sup">*</span> In early March, Pake invested his first two staff members, a pair of administrative officials from the Webster research division named Richard E. Jones and M. Frank Squires, with the task of flying to Palo Alto and finding a building suitable to rent.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">“韦伯斯特没人想做这份工作，”里克·琼斯笑着回忆起他是如何成为 PARC 第一位正式员工的。“我是韦伯斯特研发部门的行政经理。其他人的孩子都在罗切斯特上学，而我只有一个九个月大的儿子。1966 年，我娶了一位罗切斯特女孩，但当我说‘离开罗切斯特搬到加利福尼亚怎么样？’时，她说‘当然可以。’”斯奎尔斯同样没有家庭的束缚，他刚刚退役，所以琼斯任命他为人事经理。</p><p class="para">“Nobody at Webster wanted the job,” Rick Jones chuckled, remembering how he became PARC’s first official employee. “I was the administrative manager at research and development in Webster. Everyone else had kids in school in Rochester and I only had a nine-month-old son. I had married a Rochester girl in 1966, but when I said, ‘How about leaving Rochester and moving to California?’ she said, ‘Sure.’” Squires was similarly unencumbered by a growing family, having only recently mustered out of the service, so Jones tapped him as personnel manager.</p>
<p class="para">在第一次勘察中，他们发现，由于政府和军方削减了研究经费，许多研究机构都处于闲置状态。几天之内，他们走访了 13 个空置地点，最后选定了斯坦福工业园中的一个。这是一栋一两层楼的建筑群，占据了斯坦福大学因资金短缺而决定建造的一块土地。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch03.html.page39"></a>出租给小企业。它位于校园边界外，在一个被果园和马场包围的山谷中，那里的草在干燥的半岛春天变成了棕色。它的主要街道波特大道在低矮的工业建筑之间蜿蜒曲折，最后消失在一座低矮的山丘上。</p><p class="para">On their first reconnaissance trip they found that cutbacks in government and military research spending had left plenty of vacant research facilities to choose from. In a couple of days they visited thirteen empty locations before settling on one in a development known as Stanford Industrial Park. This was a compound of one- and two-story buildings occupying a parcel of land the cash-strapped university had decided to <a></a>lease out to small businesses.

Its main street, Porter Drive, meandered in gentle curves among the squat industrial buildings before disappearing over a low hill.</p>
<p class="para">波特街半路上有一​​栋两栋建筑的综合楼，自从几年前大英百科全书搬走后，这栋楼就一直空置着。临街的是一栋两面都没有窗户的煤渣砖建筑，水泥地面坚固到足以支撑沉重的实验室设备。建筑后面是一栋稍大一些的建筑，外面是落地玻璃，沐浴在明亮的加州阳光下。他们跟在租赁代理后面，走进去，掀起一层灰尘和污垢，似乎从古至今都没有被清理过。空气中弥漫着一股霉味。地板上散落着碎裂的天花板瓷砖，形成一个大正方形，围绕着一个内部庭院，庭院里点缀着一棵孤零零的橄榄树。斯奎尔斯和琼斯凝视着这肮脏的景象，几缕微弱的阳光透过窗户的条纹照进来，照亮了整个房间。这个地方需要修缮。但他们检查过的其他每个地方都需要更多修缮。两栋大楼加起来总面积达 25,000 平方英尺，是他们见过的最宽敞的大楼。他们与房地产经纪人握手达成交易，然后飞回罗切斯特收拾行李。</p><p class="para">About halfway down Porter stood a two-building complex that had been vacant since the Encyclopedia Britannica moved out a couple of years before. Facing the street was a cinderblock building windowless on two sides and with a concrete floor sturdy enough to support heavy lab equipment. Behind it was a somewhat larger structure that presented an exterior of floor-to-ceiling plate glass to the bright California sun. Trailing behind the rental agent, they stepped inside, disturbing a layer of dust and filth that seemed to have remained untrammeled since the beginning of time. A musty stench pervaded the air. The floor, littered with pieces of crumbled ceiling tile, traced a large square around an interior courtyard adorned with one lonely olive tree. Squires and Jones contemplated the squalor, which was illuminated by a few dim rays of sunlight straggling in through streaks in the windows. The place needed work. But every other site they inspected would have needed more. And at a total of 25,000 square feet, the two buildings together were the roomiest they had seen. They gave the real estate agent a handshake deal and flew home to Rochester to pack up.</p>
<p class="para">五月中旬，琼斯带着妻子和襁褓中的儿子作为帕克的先锋返回。他暂时把家人安置在距离营地一两英里的瑞基凯悦酒店，这是埃尔卡米诺雷亚尔街上的一家汽车旅馆，未来十几年里，这里将成为帕克研究中心数十名新兵的过渡住所。从租赁代理那里拿到新工作场所的钥匙后，他前往了新营地。当他沿着长长的车道行驶时，他看到一个陌生人正透过一扇大窗户往外张望。</p><p class="para">In mid-May Jones returned with his wife and infant son as Pake’s advance guard.

After picking up the keys to his new workplace from the rental agent, he headed over to the property.

<p class="para">佩克也一直很忙。在结束他在华盛顿的最后一个学期的教学任务时，他努力应对数字计算科学的挑战。他觉得自己就像一只老狗在努力学习新技巧。“我从零开始，”他说。“我不得不四处打听谁是好人，什么是大问题等等。但我确实很担心，因为我不是计算机科学家。”</p><p class="para">Pake had also been busy. While closing out his final semester’s teaching obligations at Washington, he wrestled with the challenge of getting up to speed on the science of digital computing. He felt like an old dog trying to learn new tricks. “I was starting from scratch,” he said. “I had to ask around to find out who are the good people, what are the big issues and so on. But I did worry because I was not a computer scientist.”</p>
<p class="para">然而，他确实认识一个人，此人对这一新学科的青年土耳其党人有着极为熟悉：鲍勃·泰勒 (Bob Taylor)。</p><p class="para">He did, however, know one person who boasted a first-rate familiarity with the Young Turks of the new discipline: Bob Taylor.</p>
<p class="para">1964 年，佩克认识了泰勒，当时华盛顿大学正在为麻省理工学院计算机专业学生韦斯·克拉克 (Wes Clark) 开展一项不同寻常的营救行动。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch03.html.page41"></a>克拉克的个性之一是对分时概念的本能反感。（“我是这个行业中最老的反对者之一，”他曾在一次采访中说道。）他认为，分时鼓励大学等机构追求更宏大、更昂贵的机器，而这些机器本质上对于学生和教授通常进行的小规模工作来说效率低下。它们唯一的优点是，它们可以通过向每个用户收取高额费用来获得回报，无论用户实际使用了多少时间。因此，计算变得比以往任何时候都更加遥远和令人生畏——在克拉克看来，麻省理工学院的原型系统就是这种倒退趋势的典型代表：“在一个密封的计算中心里有一台非常大的国际商业机器：计算机不是<span class="italic">工具</span>，而是<span class="italic">半神</span>。”克拉克发现更麻烦的是，像分时技术那样对主处理器进行细分，使得伊万·萨瑟兰在 TX-2 上取得的基于显示的研究变得不可能。分时计算机的任何用户都不可能像萨瑟兰那样独占处理器足够长的时间来驱动连贯的视觉显示。（克拉克允许 TX-2 共享，但只能以串行方式共享——您签约使用一段时间，但在此期间整台机器都属于您。）分时用户只能通过电传打字机与他们的机器通信，因为人们打字的速度很慢，这为系统提供了必要的机会，可以在按键之间将注意力从一个客户转移到另一个客户。</p><p class="para">Pake had met Taylor in 1964, back when Washington University undertook an unusual rescue operation for Wes Clark, the MIT computer pio<a></a>neer. Among Clark’s idiosyncrasies was a visceral antipathy to the concept of time-sharing. (“I’m one of the oldest continuing floating objectors in the business,” he once told an interviewer.) Time-sharing, he believed, encouraged institutions like universities to lust after grander and costlier machines that were by their nature inefficient for the small-scale work students and professors typically did. Their only virtue was that they could be paid off by overcharging every user for his or her time-slice of the entire behemoth, no matter how much of it the user actually employed. Thus was computing rendered more remote and intimidating than ever—a backwards trend exemplified in Clark’s view by the archetypal system at MIT: “That of a very large International Business Machine in a tightly sealed Computation Center: The computer not as <span class="italic">tool</span>, but as <span class="italic">demigod</span>.” What Clark found even more troubling was that subdividing the main processor, as time-sharing did, rendered impossible the sort of display-based research that Ivan Sutherland had achieved so spectacularly on the TX-2. No user of a time-shared computer could ever monopolize the processor long enough to drive a coherent visual display as Sutherland had. (Clark allowed the TX-2 to be shared, but only serially—you signed up for a block of time on it, but during that period the entire machine was yours.) Time-sharers were limited to communicating with their machines via teletype, because the sluggish rate at which people typed was what gave the system the necessary opportunities to shift its attention from one customer to another between keystrokes.</p>
<p class="para">克拉克认为，直接转向单用户计算机将更好地服务于计算机科学，即使这意味着暂时使用性能不足的计算机。“他会说，用不了多少年，我们就会拥有一台可以握在手中的计算机，”帕洛阿尔托研究中心的工程师、克拉克的长期同事塞韦罗·奥恩斯坦回忆道。“当时计算机填满了比这更大的建筑物——一台计算机。但他说，‘是的，你只需把它们画在桌子上，就像那样。’所以我们很多人觉得分时是一种巨大的浪费。”</p><p class="para">Clark thought computer science would be better served by jumping directly to single-user machines, even if that meant temporarily making do with underpowered computers. “He would talk about how it was not going to be too many years before we would have a computer you could hold in your hand,” recalled Severo Ornstein, a PARC engineer who was one of Clark’s longtime associates. “At that time computers were filling buildings larger than this one—a single computer. But he said, ‘Yeah, you’ll just paint ’em on your desk, just like that.’ So a lot of us felt that time-sharing was an enormous waste.”</p>
<p class="para">从 1962 年开始，克拉克通过设计和建造传奇的“LINC”来强调他的信念。（它的名字代表“实验室仪器”<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch03.html.page42"></a>（LINC 最初名为“ment Computer”，但与其诞生地麻省理工学院林肯实验室的名字相呼应。）LINC 在当时是独一无二的，它可以由单个用户从办公桌大小的控制台进行操作，尽管它的处理器和内存被安置在一个衣柜大小的单元中，通常隐藏在附近的壁橱中。LINC 专为生物医学研究而设计，而不是通用机器（这有助于保持其紧凑性）。“它是第一台可以拆开放在汽车后备箱、带到其他地方、重新组装并运行的机器，”奥恩斯坦回忆道。“这个想法以前似乎是不可想象的。”</p><p class="para">Starting in 1962 Clark underscored his conviction by designing and building the legendary “LINC.” (Its name stood for “Laboratory Instru<a></a>ment Computer” but echoed the name of its birthplace, MITs Lincoln Lab.) The LINC was unique for its time in that it could be operated by a single user from a desk-sized console, although its processor and memory were housed in a wardrobe-sized unit typically concealed in a nearby closet. Designed specifically to serve biomedical research rather than as a general-purpose machine—which helped keep it compact—the LINC “was the first machine that you could take apart and put in the back of your car, carry somewhere else, put back together again, and it would run,” Ornstein recalled. “That idea had never previously seemed conceivable.”</p>
<p class="para">但这台机器实在是太迷人了。它引起了美国国立卫生研究院的兴趣，1964 年，国立卫生研究院向麻省理工学院提供了一笔史无前例的 3700 万美元，用于围绕 LINC 建立一个计算机辅助生物医学研究的校际项目。金钱的诱惑吸引了麻省理工学院的学术高层参与他们之前被放在研究部门边缘的项目，但克拉克无论如何都喜欢这个项目。他不希望看到自己的项目受到学术机构的控制。他一直顽固不化，断然拒绝合作，迫使恼怒的大学突然撤回对整个项目的支持。</p><p class="para">But the machine was almost too fascinating. It attracted the interest of the National Institutes of Health, which in 1964 offered MIT the unprecedented sum of $37 million to establish around the LINC an inter-university program of computer-aided biomedical research. The scent of money attracted MIT’s academic mandarins to a project they had previously relegated to the fringes of the research departments, which Clark preferred anyway. He did not relish seeing his own program coming under the academic establishment’s thumb. Obstreperous to the last, he flatly refused to cooperate, forcing the exasperated university to abruptly withdraw its support for the entire venture.</p>
<p class="para">接下来的几周，克拉克疯狂地走遍全国，为这台机器和十几位依赖它谋生计和事业的初级研究员寻找新归宿。华盛顿大学正试图建立一所医学院和数字计算项目，它看到了麻省理工学院的机会，更不用说有机会通过抢夺东海岸的一家大型机构来扭转局面<span class="italic">。</span>在被逐出林肯实验室的几天前，克拉克从办公桌前抬起头来。一个戴眼镜的陌生人站在办公室里，结结巴巴地说着一个透明的故事，说他“恰巧”路过剑桥，前往伍兹霍尔参加一个约会。他是乔治·帕克，在一位共同朋友的推荐下来查看克拉克的情况。几天后，在返回圣路易斯之前，他同意将克拉克的项目永久安置在华盛顿大学，在那里，它将通过 ARPA 的鲍勃·泰勒获得进一步的资助。</p><p class="para">For the next few weeks Clark frantically canvassed the country to find a new home for the machine and the dozen junior researchers whose livelihoods and careers depended on it. Washington University, which was trying to build both a medical school and a digital computing program, saw opportunity in MITs pique, not to mention the chance to turn the tables on a big East Coast institution by raiding <span class="italic">it</span> for a change. A few days before his scheduled eviction from Lincoln Lab, Clark looked up from his desk. A stranger in spectacles was standing in the office, stammering out a transparent story about “just happening” to be passing through Cambridge en route to an engagement in Woods Hole. It was George Pake, come to check Clark out on the recommendation of a mutual friend. Before returning to St. Louis a few days later, he agreed to give Clark’s project a permanent home at Washington University, where it was to obtain further funding through one Bob Taylor, at ARPA.</p>
<p class="para">Pake 和 Taylor 都对这次初次互动表示满意<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch03.html.page43"></a>两人都对对方抱有好感。泰勒在计算机界的出色人脉以及他以最小的麻烦支出数百万美元的明显权力给佩克留下了深刻印象。（正式地说，泰勒当时仍然是伊万·萨瑟兰的副手。）泰勒认为佩克是一位务实的管理者，能够突破繁文缛节来协助他高度重视的项目和研究人员。他们显然没有想到，在短短几年内，他们的生活会如何交织在一起，成为同事和对手。</p><p class="para">Pake and Taylor each came away from this initial interaction favorably <a></a>disposed toward the other. Pake was impressed by Taylor’s excellent contacts within the computing fraternity and his apparent authority to disburse millions of dollars with a minimum of fuss. (Formally speaking, Taylor was still Ivan Sutherland’s deputy at the time.) Taylor saw Pake as a pragmatic administrator capable of cutting through red tape to assist a program and a researcher he valued highly. They obviously could have had no inkling of how, within a few short years, their lives would intertwine as colleagues and adversaries.</p>
<p class="para">在两人有机会再次见面之前，泰勒广阔的网络已经覆盖了当 ARPA 为韦斯·克拉克的项目提供救命援助时几乎不存在的计算机研究领域。在 ARPA，他资助了斯坦福大学、卡内基梅隆大学和麻省理工学院的美国第一个成熟的计算机科学研究生学位课程。一些研究领域的存在实际上要归功于他的慷慨。其中包括计算机图形学，当戴夫·埃文斯 (Dave Evans) 打电话给泰勒说他的母校邀请他回到盐湖城启动一个计算机项目时，计算机图形学在犹他大学诞生了。戴夫·埃文斯是一位虔诚的摩门教徒，曾领导加州大学伯克利分校的 Genie 团队开发分时 SDS 940。他问，让一个 ARPA 项目开始怎么样？</p><p class="para">Before the two would have a chance to meet again Taylor’s capacious net would come to embrace areas of computer research that barely existed when ARPA delivered its lifesaving shot to Wes Clark’s project. At ARPA he funded the country’s first full-fledged graduate degree programs in computer science at Stanford, Carnegie-Mellon, and MIT. Some fields of study virtually owed their existence to his largesse. Among them was computer graphics, which came to life at the University of Utah when Dave Evans, a devout Mormon who had led the Genie team building the time-sharing SDS 940 at UC Berkeley, called Taylor to say his alma mater had invited him to return to Salt Lake to start a computer program. How about an ARPA project, he asked, to get it going?</p>
<p class="para">当时，计算机图形学几乎没有引起任何人的注意，原因很简单，大多数计算机都没有任何视觉显示。如果埃文斯愿意在犹他州的偏僻地区启动这样一个项目，让这个项目能够与其他地方的传统思想完全隔绝，那么泰勒会全力支持。这个冒险的结果比任何人预期的都要好。泰勒资助的这个项目，部分是出于个人实验，部分是出于对一位老朋友的帮助，后来发展成为计算机图形学研究领域的世界领先者。</p><p class="para">Computer graphics was then attracting almost no one’s attention, for the simple reason that most computers lacked visual displays of any kind. If Evans was willing to start such a program in the backwater of Utah, where it could develop in pristine isolation from the traditionalist thinking elsewhere, Taylor was all for it. The venture turned out better than anyone could have expected. The program Taylor funded partially as a personal experiment and partially as a favor to an old friend evolved into a world leader in computer graphics research.</p>
<p class="para">然而，他留下的最持久的遗产并不是一项大学计划，而是将他所做的一切联系在一起的直觉飞跃。这就是阿帕网，即当今互联网的前身。</p><p class="para">His most enduring legacy, however, was not a university program but a leap of intuition that tied together everything else he had done. This was the ARPANET, the precursor of today’s Internet.</p>
<p class="para">泰勒最初的全国性计算机网络模型源于他的观察，当时分时系统开始推动一种全国性计算机兄弟会的形成（当时女性成员很少）。无论是麻省理工学院、斯坦福大学还是加州大学洛杉矶分校，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch03.html.page44"></a>研究人员都在寻找相同问题的答案。“这些人开始互相认识，分享大量信息，并互相询问‘我如何使用这个？我在哪里可以找到那个？’”泰勒回忆道。“看到这台计算机成为促进人类社区形成的媒介，真是太了不起了。”</p><p class="para">Taylor’s original model of a nationwide computer network grew out of his observation that time-sharing was starting to promote the formation of a sort of nationwide computing brotherhood (at this time very few members were women). Whether they were at MIT, Stanford, or UCLA, <a></a>researchers were all looking for answers to the same general questions. “These people began to know one another, share a lot of information, and ask of one another, ‘How do I use this? Where do I find that?’” Taylor recalled. “It was really phenomenal to see this computer become a medium that stimulated the formation of a human community.”</p>
<p class="para">然而，要达到这一理想状态还有很长的路要走。这个社区不像是一个国家，更像是一群部落小村落，彼此之间往往难以沟通，甚至相互敌对。他们机器的设计差异使许多群体在数字上与其他群体隔绝。风险在于每个机构都会发展出自己独特而孤立的文化，就像相关鸟类在一片广阔的未知海洋中的岛屿上独立进化一样。在思考如何将它们整合成一个更大的整体时，泰勒寻求一种让所有群体通过计算机进行互动的方式，每个岛屿社区都可以随时访问其他社区的机器，就好像他们都生活在一个连续的虚拟大陆上一样。</p><p class="para">There was still a long way to go before reaching that ideal, however. The community was less like a nation than a swarm of tribal hamlets, often mutually unintelligible or even mutually hostile. Design differences among their machines kept many groups digitally isolated from the others. The risk was that each institution would develop its own unique and insular culture, like related species of birds evolving independently on islands in a vast uncharted sea. Pondering how to bind them into a larger whole, Taylor sought a way for all groups to interact via their computers, each island community enjoying constant access to the others’ machines as though they all lived on one contiguous virtual continent.</p>
<p class="para">这一概念后来发展成为 ARPANET。这个想法在一定程度上要归功于利克莱德，他早先提出了一种他称之为大型机“星际网络”的方案。然而，在他任职 ARPA 期间，这一概念仍处于理论阶段；让小型分时系统单独运行已经非常困难，更不用说协同运行了。但泰勒认为，现在的技术已经发展到足以使这一概念实用的程度。他没有欺骗自己：建立这样一个系统意味着要克服巨大的障碍。另一方面，ARPA 的慷慨保护伞庇护了数百名科学家和工程师，他认为，他们的非凡才能完全可以应对挑战。</p><p class="para">This concept would develop into the ARPANET. The idea owed something to Licklider, who had earlier proposed what he dryly called an “intergalactic network” of mainframes. During his time at ARPA the notion remained theoretical, however; it was hard enough to get small-scale time-sharing systems to run individually, much less in concert with one another. But Taylor judged that the technology had now progressed far enough to make the concept practical. He did not deceive himself: Building such a system meant overcoming prodigious obstacles. On the other hand, ARPA’s generous umbrella sheltered hundreds of scientists and engineers whose prodigious talents, he reasoned, were fully up to the challenge.</p>
<p class="para">1966 年 2 月的一天，泰勒敲开了 ARPA 主任、奥地利出生的物理学家查尔斯·赫茨菲尔德的办公室，当时他只知道一个模糊的概念：一个数字网络将全国各地的分时用户连接起来。在任何其他机构，他都会被要求提供大量文件来合理化该计划并预测其在下一个千年的成本；但 ARPA 不是。“我没有正式提出 ARPANET 提案，”他后来回忆道。“我只是决定我们要建立一个网络，它将<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch03.html.page45"></a>将这些交互式社区连接成一个更大的社区，使得一个社区的用户可以连接到远程社区，就像该用户在自己的本地系统上一样。”</p><p class="para">One day in February 1966 Taylor knocked at the office of ARPA’s director, the Austrian-born physicist Charles Herzfeld, armed with little more than this vague notion of a digital web connecting bands of time-sharers around the country. At any other agency he would have been expected to produce reams of documentation rationalizing the program and projecting its costs out to the next millennium; not ARPA. “I had no formal proposals for the ARPANET,” he recounted later. “I just decided that we were going to build a network that would <a></a>connect these interactive communities into a larger community in such a way that a user of one community could connect to a distant community as though that user were on his own local system.”</p>
<p class="para">赫茨菲尔德礼貌地听了一会儿后，打断了泰勒的长篇大论。他密切关注着这位年轻同事的理论研究，已经知道他的想法的要点。他只有一个问题。</p><p class="para">After listening politely for a short time, Herzfeld interrupted Taylor’s rambling presentation. He had followed his young associate’s theoretical research closely enough to know already the gist of his ideas. All he had was a question.</p>
<p class="para">“你需要多少钱才能让这个计划顺利进行？”</p><p class="para">“How much money do you need to get it off the ground?”</p>
<p class="para">“我认为大约需要一百万美元左右，才能开始组织起来。”</p><p class="para">“I’d say about a million dollars or so, just to start getting organized.”</p>
<p class="para">赫茨菲尔德说：“你明白了。”</p><p class="para">“You’ve got it,” Herzfeld said.</p>
<p class="para">多年后，泰勒回忆起互联网诞生的那次会议时说：“那真的是一场持续了 20 分钟的谈话。”</p><p class="para">“That,” Taylor remembered years later of the meeting at which the Internet was born, “was literally a twenty-minute conversation.”</p>
<p class="para">要真正启动这个项目，还需要一些泰勒式的进一步操作。他所提名的项目经理候选人是 29 岁的麻省理工学院研究员劳伦斯·G·罗伯茨 (Lawrence G. Roberts)，尽管泰勒不断劝说，他还是拒绝离开林肯实验室安全且有学术价值的职位。七八个月后，泰勒迫切希望解决僵局。</p><p class="para">Actually getting the program underway required some further maneuvering, Taylor-style. His candidate for program manager, a twenty-nine-year-old MIT researcher named Lawrence G. Roberts, refused to leave his secure and intellectually rewarding post at Lincoln Lab despite Taylor’s relentless wheedling. After seven or eight months, Taylor was desperate to resolve the standoff.</p>
<p class="para">“我们是否仍支持林肯实验室 51% 的股份？”他问赫茨菲尔德，赫茨菲尔德确认了这个数字。泰勒让赫茨菲尔德给林肯实验室主任打电话。“告诉他，让拉里·罗伯茨来做这件事符合林肯实验室和 ARPA 的最大利益。”两周之内，罗伯茨接受了一份工作，这份工作最终让他作为互联网的创始工程师在计算机界获得了永久地位。正如泰勒后来吹嘘的那样：“我勒索拉里·罗伯茨，让他成名了！”</p><p class="para">“Do we still support fifty-one percent of Lincoln Lab?” he asked Herzfeld, who confirmed the figure. Taylor asked Herzfeld to put in a call to Lincoln’s director. “Tell him that it’s in Lincoln Lab’s and ARPA’s best interests to tell Larry Roberts to come down and do this.” Within two weeks, Roberts accepted a job that would eventually secure him a permanent place in the computing Pantheon, as the Internet’s founding engineer. As Taylor later crowed: “I blackmailed Larry Roberts into fame!”</p>

<p class="para">但到了 1969 年，鲍勃·泰勒感到精疲力竭。他已在 ARPA 的信息处理技术办公室工作了四年多，其中近三年担任主任。他每年 3000 万美元的研究预算已成为美国计算机研究领域最重要的力量。但研究机构正在他周围发生变化。不可避免的催化剂是越南战争。</p><p class="para">But by 1969 Bob Taylor was feeling burned out. He had spent more than four years at ARPA’s Information Processing Technologies Office, nearly three of those as director. His annual research budget of $30 million had become the single most important force in U.S. computer research. But the research agency was changing around him. The inescapable catalyst was Vietnam.</p>
<p class="para">1967 年，战争蔓延到了 ARPA 舒适的平民居住区，泰勒个人也受到了影响。约翰逊白宫<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch03.html.page46"></a>曾呼吁帮助解决与物资或部队部署无关的后勤噩梦。问题在于信息。越南军事指挥部似乎陷入了统计困境。“从越南返回白宫的关于敌人死亡、缴获物资、现有子弹、各种后勤报告存在差异，”泰勒回忆道。“陆军有一个报告系统；海军有另一个；海军陆战队有另一个。”</p><p class="para">In 1967 the war had reached into the comfortable civilian enclosure of ARPA and touched Taylor personally. The Johnson White House <a></a>had appealed for help with a logistical nightmare that had nothing to do with materiel or troop deployment. The issue was information. The Vietnam military command, it seemed, had got itself bogged down in a statistical quagmire. “There were discrepancies in the reporting coming back from Vietnam to the White House about enemy killed, supplies captured, bullets on hand, logistics reports of various kinds,” Taylor recalled. “The Army had one reporting system; the Navy had another; the Marine Corps had another.”</p>
<p class="para">不出所料，这个系统产生了荒唐的结果。敌方伤亡人数估计超过了已知的北越人口，而据报道缴获的糖量达到世界供应量的四分之三。“这太荒谬了。白宫出于沮丧，求助于国防部长来收拾这个烂摊子。国防部长求助于 ARPA，因为 ARPA 是一个快速反应机构。ARPA 主任让我去越南看看是否有任何计算机技术可以为整个过程带来至少某种程度的一致，即使不是理智的。”</p><p class="para">Unsurprisingly, this system produced ludicrous results. Estimates of enemy casualties exceeded the known population of North Vietnam, while the reported quantities of captured sugar reached levels equivalent to three-quarters of the world supply. “It was ridiculous. Out of frustration the White House turned to the Secretary of Defense to clean this mess up. The Secretary of Defense turned to ARPA, because ARPA was a quick-response kind of agency. The director of ARPA asked me to go out to Vietnam and see whether or not any kind of computer technology could bring at least some semblance of agreement, if not sanity, to this whole process.”</p>
<p class="para">泰勒在助手巴里·韦斯勒和五角大楼驻地的三名陆军、海军和空军代表的陪同下，多次前往战区。情况比他预想的还要糟糕。军队简直被信息淹没了。数据流入仓库，却从未流出。执行任务归来的飞行员会听取他们的报告，并将报告输入打孔卡；然后他们的副驾驶也会听取报告，并<span class="italic">记录</span>下来。但没有人对这些信息做任何事情，这些信息堆积如山，没有人费心去弄清楚这些报告应该如何或为何进行整理和组织。</p><p class="para">Joined by his assistant, Barry Wessler, and three Pentagon-based representatives from the Army, Navy, and Air Force, Taylor made several trips to the war zone. The situation was even worse than he expected. The military was literally drowning in information. Data flowed into depots and never flowed out. Pilots returning from missions would get debriefed their reports entered on punch cards; then their co-pilots would get debriefed and <span class="italic">their</span> reports recorded. But no one did anything with the information, which piled up without anyone bothering to figure out how or even why these reports should be collated and organized.</p>
<p class="para">泰勒派出技术团队前往问题地点解决混乱局面，尽管遇到了阻力。有时，一些基地指挥官会拒绝让 ARPA 的民事分析师访问他们宝贵的无用数据缓存，这时，以一星将军身份出差处理政府事务的泰勒将被迫介入并利用职权。</p><p class="para">Taylor assigned technical teams to the trouble spots to straighten out the chaos, although not without meeting resistance. Occasionally some base commander would refuse to grant ARPA’s civilian analysts access to his precious cache of useless data, at which point Taylor, who traveled on government business as a one-star general, would be forced to step in and pull rank.</p>
<p class="para">泰勒和他的团队解决了军方的问题。他们在美国军事指挥中心安装了一台主计算机<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch03.html.page47"></a>位于 Ton Son Nhut 空军基地的宿舍，并使其成为所有数据的唯一存储库。“此后白宫只收到一份报告，而不是几份报告，”泰勒评论道。“我不知道这些数据是否更准确，但至少更一致。”</p><p class="para">Taylor and his group solved the military’s problem, after a fashion. They installed a master computer at the U.S. military command head<a></a>quarters at Ton Son Nhut Air Base and made it the lone repository of all data. “After that the White House got a single report rather than several,” Taylor remarked. “Whether the data were any more correct or not I don’t know, but at least it was more consistent.”</p>
<p class="para">但这段经历让他对自己在五角大楼的角色越来越感到不安。“我第一次去越南时想，‘好吧，我们在为这些受压迫的人民做一件好事。我们来这里是为了收拾残局。’但到了第二次或第三次，我意识到这是一场内战，我不想参与其中。我也不认为我的国家应该参与其中。” <span class="sup">*</span></p><p class="para">But the experience left him feeling increasingly uneasy about his role at the Pentagon. “My first trip out to Vietnam I was thinking, ‘Well, we’re doing a good thing for these oppressed people. We’re out here to clean this mess up.’ But by the second or third trip I realized this is a civil war and I didn’t want to have much to do with it. Nor did I think my country should have anything to do with it.”<span class="sup">*</span></p>
<p class="para">战争对 ARPA 的打击越来越大，这让他更加沮丧。在 60 年代的大部分时间里，该机构的民事性质使其免受军事机构内部日益加深的分歧的影响。但随着战争的不断蔓延，该机构不得不争夺资源。到 60 年代末，五角大楼已将 ARPA 的预算削减至 60 年代中期的一半。</p><p class="para">Adding to his frustration was the war’s increasing toll on ARPA. For most of the decade the agency’s civilian character had insulated it from the deepening rifts within the military establishment. But as the war encroached more and more, the agency had to fight for resources. By the close of the 1960s the Pentagon had slashed ARPA’s budget to half of what it had been at mid-decade.</p>
<p class="para">该机构还面临着越来越多的政治麻烦。五角大楼的任何部门都可以从事完全无害和纯民用研究的想法在全国引起了不信任。作为一种防御措施，ARPA 开始摆脱其与民用部门的纠葛，并有意识地将自己重塑为国家所认为的战争机器的一个部门。当加州理工学院工程师 Eberhardt Rechtin 于 1967 年接替赫茨菲尔德担任主任时，他向国会监督者保证，他将推动 ARPA 朝着“任务导向”的目标迈进，即旨在满足主要军事目标的项目。1969 年的曼斯菲尔德修正案<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch03.html.page48"></a>军事拨款法案的修正案将正式确立这一趋势，指示五角大楼今后只资助明显与军事相关的项目。为了强调这一点，修正案将 ARPA 的名称改为 DARPA，即<span class="italic">国防</span>高级研究计划局。</p><p class="para">The agency faced mounting political troubles, too. The notion that any arm of the Pentagon could engage in wholly innocent and purely civilian research incited mistrust across the country. As a defensive measure, ARPA started to shed its civilian entanglements and consciously remake itself into what the nation thought it was anyway—an arm of the war machine. When the Caltech engineer Eberhardt Rechtin succeeded Herzfeld as director in 1967, he assured his congressional overseers he would nudge ARPA toward “mission-oriented” objectives—programs aimed at satisfying chiefly military goals. The 1969 Mansfield Amend<a></a>ment to the military appropriations bill would formalize the trend, directing the Pentagon henceforth to fund only projects of obvious military relevance. As if to underscore the point, the amendment changed ARPA’s name to DARPA, the <span class="italic">Defense</span> Advanced Research Projects Agency.</p>
<p class="para">泰勒坦率地对政府研究的削弱感到震惊。“我在那里的大部分时间里，ARPA 都在进行对科学现状产生巨大影响的项目，”他回忆道。“我们已经决定不做渐进式的事情。但一旦你有了任务导向，你就会专注于非常狭窄的目标。”</p><p class="para">Taylor beheld the emasculation of government research with frank alarm. “Most of the time I was there ARPA was going for projects with an order-of-magnitude impact on the state of the science,” he reflected. “We had made a decision that we would not go for incremental things. But as soon as you get mission orientation you’re focusing on very narrow objectives.”</p>
<p class="para">他觉得是时候离开了。他担任这个职位的时间比他的两位前任加起来还要长。阿帕网在拉里·罗伯茨的密切关注下安全启动。9 月，该网络的首批四个节点（位于加州大学洛杉矶分校、斯坦福研究所、加州大学圣巴巴拉分校和犹他大学）投入运营。泰勒接受了戴夫·埃文斯的邀请，帮助犹他州开展一项范围模糊的研究协调工作。1969 年底，他永远离开了华盛顿，前往盐湖城。一年后，当乔治·帕克找到他时，他还在那里。</p><p class="para">He felt it was the right time to leave. He had held his job longer than both his predecessors combined. The ARPANET was securely launched under Larry Roberts’s unwavering eye, In September the network’s first four nodes—at UCLA, Stanford Research Institute, the University of California at Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah—went operational. Taylor accepted an invitation from Dave Evans to help Utah undertake a research coordination effort of conveniently vague scope. In late 1969 he left Washington for good and headed for Salt Lake City. He was still there a year later when George Pake tracked him down.</p>
<p class="para">“我听说他在犹他州并不开心，”佩克回忆道。这当然是泰勒朋友的主流观点，他们很难想象他开着蓝色科尔维特在盐湖城沉闷的街区里飞驰。他坦率地承认，他建议取消一些项目，将其他项目合并，这在校园里引起了“一些不满”。显然，戴夫·埃文斯帮助他离开华盛顿，帮了他一个忙。但除此之外，鲍勃·泰勒只是在原地踏步。</p><p class="para">“I heard through the grapevine that he wasn’t altogether happy at Utah,” Pake recalled. This was certainly the prevailing opinion among Taylor’s friends, who found it hard to imagine him careening through the stolid precincts of Salt Lake in his blue Corvette. On campus his recommendations to cancel some programs and merge others together caused, he freely admitted, “some dissatisfaction.” Clearly Dave Evans had done him a favor by facilitating his departure from Washington. But beyond that, Bob Taylor was marking time.</p>
<p class="para">帕克邀请泰勒来帕洛阿尔托的目的是向他请教，而不是给他提供工作机会（尽管他不排除后者的可能性）。他一直无法解决最紧迫的管理问题：确定计算机领域最优秀的研究人员。编制一份全国最好的计算机科学项目名单是一回事——总是出现同样的几个名字，包括伯克利、麻省理工学院、卡内基梅隆大学和斯坦福大学——但评估其中的个人才能，或者知道哪些项目指向未来，则是另一回事。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch03.html.page49"></a>进步，而哪些是智力上的死胡同。佩克认识到泰勒在五年富有成效的工作中所做的正是这样的判断。</p><p class="para">Pake’s purpose in inviting Taylor to Palo Alto was to pick his brains rather than offer him a job (although he did not rule out the latter possibility). He had been unable to solve his most pressing administrative problem: identifying the best researchers in the computing field. It was one thing to compile a list of the country’s best computer science programs—the same few names kept coming up, including Berkeley, MIT, Carnegie-Mellon, and Stanford—but quite another to appraise the individual talents within, or to know which projects pointed toward <a></a>progress and which were intellectual cul-de-sacs. Pake recognized that Taylor’s job for five productive years had involved making exactly those sorts of judgments.</p>
<p class="para">几天后，泰勒被领进了位于波特大道的帕克办公室。除了主人之外，房间里还有两个人——人事主管弗兰克·斯奎尔斯和比尔·甘宁。比尔·甘宁是一位和蔼可亲、谦逊有加的工程师，在模拟和数字电子领域拥有 20 年的经验，被任命为 PARC 系统科学实验室的经理。</p><p class="para">A few days later Taylor was ushered into Pake’s office on Porter Drive. There were two men in the room other than his host—Frank Squires, the personnel chief, and Bill Gunning, a pleasant and unassuming engineer with twenty years’ experience in analog and digital electronics who had been appointed manager of PARC’s Systems Science Lab.</p>
<p class="para">“他们让我坐下，帕克说，‘我们收购了一家电脑公司，’”泰勒回忆道。“我说，‘是啊，太糟糕了。你们买错了。’我告诉他们，SDS 对交互式计算不感兴趣，而这正是我要做的。”他毫不谦虚地继续总结他认为 SDS 和马克斯·帕列夫斯基误入歧途的原因，他与这位电脑巨头（当时还是施乐公司的董事）的痛苦遭遇似乎仍记忆犹新。在主人耐心聆听的情况下，他概述了他对未来的愿景，即利用全国性网络的交互式计算机增强人与人之间的交流。</p><p class="para">“They sat me down and Pake said, ‘We bought a computer company,’” Taylor recalled. “I said, ‘Yeah, that’s too bad. You bought the wrong one.’ I told them that SDS wasn’t interested in interactive computing, and that’s what I’d be doing.” Without humility he proceeded to summarize how he believed SDS and Max Palevsky had gone astray, the memory of his bitter encounter with the computer magnate (then still a Xerox director) apparently still fresh. As his hosts listened patiently, he outlined his vision of a future in which interactive computers harnessed to nationwide networks enhanced the communication of human to human.</p>
<p class="para">帕克对 SDS 的尖刻批评泰然处之。他已经与埃尔塞贡多的人们打过交道，并且在很大程度上同意泰勒的评价。关于分布式个人计算的讲座则是另一回事。房间里没有人认为鲍勃·泰勒是一位重要的理论家，他的离题只会让他们心不在焉。“我们对他感兴趣不是因为他对分布式计算有任何远见，”斯奎尔斯回忆道，“而是因为他认识的人——这意味着美国每一位重要的计算机科学家。”</p><p class="para">Pake, for one, took his caustic critique of SDS in stride. He had already encountered the people in El Segundo and largely agreed with Taylor’s assessment. The lecture on distributed personal computing was a different matter. No one in the room valued Bob Taylor as an important theoretician and his digression elicited only their mental shrugs. “We were interested in him not because of any vision he had of distributed computing,” recalled Squires, “but because of the people he knew—and that meant every significant computer scientist in the United States.”</p>
<p class="para">会议结束后，他们确信他们需要他加入。他同样确信，他的直言不讳已经确保他再也不会收到他们的消息。“我离开时想，‘我不想要他们，他们也不想要我’，”他说。因此，当几天后派克在盐湖城给他打电话时，他更加惊讶。</p><p class="para">When the meeting ended they were sure they needed him on board. He was equally certain his plain talk had ensured he would never hear from them again. “I left thinking, ‘I don’t want them and they don’t want me,’” he said. Therefore he was all the more surprised when Pake called him a few days later in Salt Lake.</p>
<p class="para">“我希望你能来帮忙建立计算机实验室，”他说。</p><p class="para">“I want you to come help build the computer lab,” he said.</p>
<p class="para">帕克的提议听起来很直接，但双方却有一种奇怪的矛盾情绪。泰勒明白，名义上的<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch03.html.page50"></a>作为 PARC 计算机实验室的负责人，他必须将大部分时间花在“处理公司事务和教育 Pake”上，而不是直接指导研究。他认为这份工作超出了他的能力范围，他不愿意学习。幸运的是，这也不是 Pake 想要的。</p><p class="para">Pake’s offer sounded straightforward enough, but there were oddly ambivalent feelings on both sides. Taylor understood that the titular <a></a>head of the PARC computer lab would have to spend most of his time “attending to matters with corporate types and educating Pake,” rather than directly supervising research. This was a job he considered out of his competence and disinclined to learn. Fortunately enough, it was not exactly what Pake had in mind, either.</p>
<p class="para">他告诉泰勒，这份工作需要招募整个实验室的工作人员，包括他自己的老板。泰勒将被聘为助理管理职位，但帕克不厌其烦地警告他，从书面上看，他甚至连这个职位都不够格，必须证明自己才能晋升。</p><p class="para">The job, he told Taylor, would involve recruiting an entire laboratory staff—including his own boss. Taylor would be hired in an associate management position, but Pake took pains to warn him that on paper he was underqualified even for that and would have to prove himself before advancing.</p>
<p class="para">“我并没有直接对他说‘你不具备我即将提供给你的这份工作所需的研究资质’，”帕克回忆道。“我说过：‘鲍勃，我认为如果你想继续工作，你需要做的就是积累真正的研究资质。你为什么不以副经理的身份加入这个实验室，帮我招募它的经理，也就是你的老板，并开展一项研究项目，为你积累这些资质呢？’”</p><p class="para">“I didn’t exactly say to him, ‘You don’t have the right research credentials for the job I’m about to offer you,’” Pake recalled. “What I did say was: ‘Bob, it seems to me that what you need to do is to develop real research credentials if you want to go on. Why don’t you come into this laboratory as associate manager and help me recruit its manager, your boss, and undertake a research program that would develop these credentials for you?’”</p>
<p class="para">当然，他的意思主要是说泰勒没有受人尊敬的博士学位。在佩克的硬科学世界里，研究人员在三个世纪前就已建立的基础之上打下了基础，博士学位是真正原创性和成就的证明。但在刚刚起步的计算机科学中，情况并非如此，计算机科学正在逐步建立自己的学术基础。佩克的观点也不太适用于泰勒作为顶尖研究人才的大师级激励者的独特能力，这是任何高等大学学位都无法比拟的。在接下来的几年里，泰勒没有博士学位这个荒谬却又不为人知的问题，将进一步破坏两人的关系。它永远影响着佩克对泰勒能力的评价，这只会增加泰勒对那些拥有博士学位的物理学家的敌意，他认为这些物理学家作为“通用科学实验室”的成员，吸走了 PARC 一半的预算。他决心证明，他这群杂牌工程枪手的研究能力能够胜过镇上任何一位有资质的物理学家，他绝不会放过任何一个机会，除非他再次发起挑战。</p><p class="para">What he meant, of course, was chiefly that Taylor lacked a respectable Ph.D. In Pake’s hard science universe, where researchers laid their bricks upon foundations that had been built as long as three centuries earlier, a doctorate was a certificate of genuine originality and achievement. That was not true in the fledgling science of computing, which was erecting its own academic foundation as it went along. Nor did Pake’s viewpoint apply very well to Taylor’s unique abilities as a master motivator of top research talent, which could never be encompassed within the rubric of any advanced university degree. In the coming years this absurd yet unspoken issue of Taylor’s nonexistent Ph.D. would help poison the two men’s relationship. It would never cease to color Pake’s assessment of Taylor’s abilities, which only added to Taylor’s belligerence toward the Ph.D.-laden physicists who he viewed as sucking down half of the PARC budget as members of the “General Science Lab.” He was determined to prove that his ragtag bunch of engineering gunslingers could out-research any credentialed physicist in town, and he would never let an opportunity pass without reiterating the challenge.</p>
<p class="para">然而，目前，终于有机会真正<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch03.html.page51"></a>在与精心挑选的团队一起实现自己的计算愿景时，他试图无视帕克的傲慢态度。他和他的门徒在每个大学校园都遇到过这种“硬科学”官僚的古怪偏见。他所要求的只是帕克的理解，即施乐所珍视的“未来办公室”将包含网络和交互式计算机。帕克同意了，但并没有仔细考虑这些术语的含义。</p><p class="para">For the moment, however, enraptured by the chance to finally real<a></a>ize his own vision of computing with a hand-picked team, he tried to ignore Pake’s condescension. He and his protégés had encountered these quaint prejudices of “hard science” bureaucrats on every university campus. All he asked to be spelled out was Pake’s understanding that Xerox’s cherished “office of the future” would embrace networking and interactive computers. Pake agreed without devoting much thought to what those terms implied.</p>
<p class="para">抵达帕洛阿尔托后不久，泰勒就承担起了自己的新职责，他找到了一种更直接的方式来解释自己。一天，他走过大厅时，看到帕克的秘书格洛丽亚·华纳正在展示她的新 IBM Selectric 打字机。这台机器采用独特的高尔夫球形打字机制，是当时最优雅、最受欢迎的办公设备。泰勒走上前去，用手指轻敲了一下它。</p><p class="para">Shortly after arriving in Palo Alto to take up his new responsibilities, Taylor found a more direct way to explain himself. Walking down the hall one day he noticed Pake’s secretary, Gloria Warner, showing off her new IBM Selectric typewriter. With its distinctive golf ball-shaped striking mechanism, this machine was the most elegant and popular piece of office equipment of the time. Taylor stepped up and tapped it with his finger.</p>
<p class="para">“你知道，”他说，“我们要让这个东西过时。”</p><p class="para">“You know,” he said, “we’re going to make this thing obsolete.”</p>

<p class="para">比格尔森刚从华盛顿大学获得物理学博士学位，1970 年 3 月，乔治·帕克亲自招募了他，当时波特大道大楼还是一个空荡荡的空壳。到 9 月，大楼已经清理干净，但还没有填满，他和妻子第一次来到这里，亲眼目睹了加利福尼亚。改造人员已经进场，将大楼的空间隔开，方形走廊的两边都排满了（大部分是空置的）办公室，但比格尔森走进大楼时首先注意到的是阳光明媚的内部庭院。</p><p class="para">A freshly minted physics Ph.D. from Washington University, Biegelsen had been personally recruited by George Pake in March 1970, when the Porter Drive building was still a littered and empty shell. It had been cleaned up but not filled up by September, when he and his wife arrived to lay eyes on California for the first time. The remodelers had been in, partitioning off the space in the big building so that both sides of the square corridor were lined with (mostly vacant) offices, but the first thing Biegelsen noticed when he walked into the building was its sunlit interior courtyard.</p>
<p class="para">“中庭里有一棵橄榄树，其他就没什么了，”他回忆道。“但下面的地面上全是橄榄。我想，‘哇，这是加利福尼亚，食物就躺在地上！’我捡起一颗放进嘴里，差点被里面的酸性物质呛死。后来我在图书馆里花了几个小时试图找出腌制这些东西的方法。”</p><p class="para">“The atrium had an olive tree in it and not much else,” he remembered. “But the ground underneath was just covered with olives. I thought, ‘Wow, this is California, the food is just lying there on the ground!’ I picked one up and put it in my mouth and just about died from the acidity in it. Later I spent hours in the library trying to find out how to cure the things.”</p>
<p class="para">这是对这个神秘地方的优点和挑战的一个很好的介绍，这个地方太新了，每个人的第一个任务都是决定<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch04.html.page53"></a>如何处理他们的自由。对于比格尔森来说，空荡荡的办公室和一尘不染的白纸黑字有一种苦乐参半和略带恐惧的一面。这是任何先驱者在迈出未知的第一步之前一瞬间都会感受到的恐惧。</p><p class="para">That was a fair enough introduction to the virtues and challenges of this mysterious place, so new that everyone’s first task was deciding <a></a>what to do with their freedom. For Biegelsen there was a bittersweet and slightly frightening aspect to the empty offices and the clean slate. It was the trepidation sensed by any pioneer in the split second before he takes his very first step into the unknown.</p>
<p class="para">“我刚从研究生院毕业，对要做什么一无所知。我摸索着寻找真正配得上这份工作的东西，但这个地方太美了，郁郁葱葱，而且这份工作真的很棒，我既有好运，又需要有所作为。”</p><p class="para">“Here I was fresh out of graduate school and I didn’t have the vaguest idea of what I was to do.

<p class="para">在接下来的几个月里，更多像他一样的年轻科学家的到来，让波特街的玻璃幕墙建筑显得熙熙攘攘。事实上，招聘工作进展缓慢，这是有意为之。尽管 PARC 成立公告发布后的头几周就收到了 900 多份简历，但帕克和斯奎尔斯还是花了不少时间才发出录用通知。他们认为，政府削减拨款以及航空航天和国防工业的严峻经济形势肯定会产生大量有天赋的候选人。帕克特别谨慎，他的目标是组建一支能够为施乐赢得诺贝尔奖的杰出科学家队伍，因为贝尔实验室已经为 AT&amp;T 赢得了两项诺贝尔奖。<span class="sup">*</span> 1971 年元旦，PARC 成立六个月，包括行政人员和秘书在内，员工人数仍然只有 23 人。</p><p class="para">Over the next few months the arrival of more young scientists like himself lent the glass-walled building on Porter a deceptively bustling air. In fact, the staffing proceeded slowly, by design. Although the announcement of PARC’s founding had brought in more than 900 resumes in the first few weeks, Pake and Squires took their time making offers. Government funding cuts and the dire economics of the aerospace and defense industries, they figured, were sure to produce a robust supply of gifted candidates. Pake was especially cautious, his ambitions fixed on assembling a cadre of exceptional scientists capable of winning Xerox a Nobel Prize, as Bell Labs had already won two for AT&amp;T.<span class="sup">*</span> At its six-month anniversary on New Year’s Day 1971, PARC’s staff, including administrators and secretaries, still numbered only twenty-three.</p>
<p class="para">缓慢的招聘速度为新公司成立仪式留下了充足的时间。PARC 于 10 月的一场晚宴上正式揭幕，主持仪式的正是彼得·麦考洛 (Peter McColough)，当时他正巧在加州向西海岸的投资者推销施乐债券。</p><p class="para">The languid pace of recruitment left plenty of time for the ceremonies that often accompany the launch of new corporate ventures. PARC was formally dedicated at a dinner in October by none other than Peter McColough, who happened to be in California peddling an issue of Xerox bonds to West Coast investors.</p>
<p class="para">帕克很高兴能向大家展示他刚刚起步的研究中心及其人数少得可怜的员工。杰克·戈德曼飞来参加这次活动，并向惠普联合创始人比尔·休利特和斯坦福大学校长理查德·莱曼等硅谷名人发出了邀请。里克·琼斯订了一顿外卖晚餐，并租了额外的桌椅。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch04.html.page54"></a>随后，一股异常热浪袭来，气温稳定在潮湿的 95 度。</p><p class="para">Pake was delighted to show off his fledgling research center and its minuscule staff. Jack Goldman flew in for the occasion and invitations were dispatched to such Silicon Valley luminaries as Bill Hewlett, the co-founder of Hewlett-Packard, and Stanford President Richard Lyman. Rick Jones ordered a catered dinner and rented extra tables and chairs. <a></a>Then a freak heat wave struck and the temperature settled at a humid 95 degrees.</p>
<p class="para">这意味着麻烦。波特大道上唯一尚未投入使用的系统是空调。琼斯想象着一百位宾客在听完仪式演讲后打瞌睡，然后倒在精美的开胃菜上，于是他匆忙为几名工人配备了梯子和水管，并指示他们将屋顶降温，而他则赶往圣何塞租几台大落地扇。</p><p class="para">This meant trouble. The one system not yet operational on Porter Drive was the air conditioning. Envisioning a hundred guests dozing through the ritual speeches and keeling over into their fancy hors d’oeuvres, Jones hastily equipped a couple of workmen with ladders and water hoses and instructed them to cool off the roof while he sped down to San Jose to rent a few big floor fans.</p>
<p class="para">当晚客人们抵达时，大楼已经够凉爽了，硅谷创始一代的高科技企业家们可以和 PARC 的新生科学家舒适地交流，分享知识和抱负。但当客人们走向自助餐厅时，琼斯抬头看了看天花板，发现自助餐桌正上方的瓷砖上出现了黑色污渍。“我的天，”他自言自语道，“他们忘了关掉水管！”他冲上楼去堵住水流，而几位勇敢的客人则将摆满昂贵美食的桌子抬到安全的地方——就在受损的天花板开始滴水之前。</p><p class="para">By the time the guests arrived that evening, the building was cool enough for Silicon Valley’s founding generation of high-tech entrepreneurs to mingle comfortably with the freshman class of PARC scientists in the harmony of shared knowledge and ambition. But as the guests moved to the buffet, something made Jones glance up at the ceiling, where a dark stain was spreading among the tiles directly over the buffet table. “My God,” he said to himself, “they forgot to turn off the hoses!” He bolted upstairs to stanch the flow of water while several intrepid guests bore the tables, laden with expensive delicacies, to safety—just before the compromised ceiling started to drip.</p>
<p class="para">最后，呻吟的电路板被移到了干燥的地方，灾难得以避免，戈德曼和帕克发表了欢迎致辞。笑容满面的彼得·麦考洛沉浸在他作为开明技术领袖的新声誉中。在他的余下任期内，他会深情地认为 PARC 是他最杰出的成就之一，也是施乐的皇冠上的明珠。他的继任者们并不认同这一观点。</p><p class="para">Finally the groaning boards were relocated under a dry area and, disaster averted, Goldman and Pake made their welcoming speeches. A beaming Peter McColough basked in his newfound reputation as an enlightened technological leader. For the rest of his administration he would think fondly of PARC as one of his finest achievements and Xerox’s crown jewel. It was not an opinion all his successors would share.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">到 1970 年底，在 PARC 人员配备尚未满员之前，帕克就将中心细分为三个不同的部门，从而建立了长期的组织结构。计算机科学实验室由泰勒担任代理经理，负责管理五名科学家，其中包括吉姆·库里和罗伯特·弗莱格尔，这是他从犹他州带来的一对图形专家。系统科学实验室 (SSL) 也有五名专业人员，暂时由比尔·甘宁管理，他接受这份工作是为了临时过渡，但急于回到实际研究中（更愿意从事研究工作）。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch04.html.page55"></a>经理两年后才会被招聘）。该结构的第三个支柱是通用科学实验室 (GSL)，名义上由帕克领导的固体物理分支。GSL 雇用了四名科学家，其中一人是前韦伯斯特物理学家杰拉尔德·卢科夫斯基 (Gerald Lucovsky)，他担任帕克手下的 GSL 副经理。</p><p class="para">By the end of 1970, long before PARC reached its full complement of staff, Pake established its long-term organizational structure by subdividing the center into three distinct units. The Computer Science Laboratory had Taylor as acting manager over five scientists, including Jim Curry and Robert Flegal, a pair of graphics specialists he brought along from Utah. The Systems Science Laboratory (SSL), also with five professionals, had been placed temporarily under the management of a reluctant Bill Gunning, who had accepted the job as a stopgap but was anxious to return to hands-on research (a more willing research <a></a>manager would not be recruited for another two years). The third leg of the structure was the General Science Lab (GSL), the solid-state physics branch nominally headed by Pake. GSL employed four scientists, one of whom, an ex-Webster physicist named Gerald Lucovsky, served under Pake as GSL’s associate manager.</p>
<p class="para">这种结构反映了 Pake 的决心，即让新计算科学和经典物理科学处于平等地位，他认为这将鼓励双方融合。即使这个梦想永远无法实现，这种乐观的结构在接下来的十年里仍然保持不变，只有微小的变化，例如 Pake 将光学科学实验室从 SSL 中分离出来，使其在激光打印和光学存储技术方面的工作具有更高的地位。</p><p class="para">This structure mirrored Pake’s determination to set the new science of computing and the classical science of physics on equal footings, which he believed would encourage the two sides to intermingle. Even if this dream would never be realized, the optimistic structure endured through the next decade with only minor changes, as when Pake severed the Optical Science Lab from SSL to give its work on laser printing and optical memory technology greater status.</p>
<p class="para">到 1970 年底，帕克还制定了完整的研究计划。在 1971 年 1 月 4 日的公司备忘录中，他为他的 23 人小组概述了一项雄心勃勃的计划，另外还有 8 到 10 名专业人员将在接下来的几个月内开始工作。系统科学实验室将接管激光驱动计算机打印机的开发，该打印机的发明者是韦伯斯特的一名工程师，他的老板对它的潜力不感兴趣，于是他去了西部。SSL 研究人员还将研究光学存储器，这项技术最终催生了今天的光盘和 CD-ROM，以及计算机语音识别。泰勒的计算机科学实验室将追求他对图形学的爱好，同时为一个基本的中心范围的计算机系统制定规范。GSL 被分配研究固态技术，包括晶体的电学和光学特性。</p><p class="para">Pake also established by the close of 1970 a full research agenda. In a corporate memo dated January 4, 1971, he outlined an ambitious program for his group of twenty-three, augmented by another eight or ten professionals due to start work over the following few months. The Systems Science Lab was to take over development of a laser-driven computer printer whose inventor, a Webster engineer, had come west after failing to interest his bosses in its potential. SSL researchers would also investigate optical memories, a technology that would eventually give rise to today’s compact disc and CD-ROM, and speech recognition by computer. Taylor’s Computer Science Lab was to pursue his pet interest in graphics while developing specifications for a basic center-wide computer system. And GSL was assigned studies in solid-state technologies, including the electrical and optical qualities of crystals.</p>
<p class="para">帕克警告他的上级，按照预计的增长曲线，波特大道综合大楼（当时可以舒适地容纳所有人）到 1971 年年底肯定会爆满。他太乐观了。今年头几周，施乐总部通过实施全公司招聘冻结，打破了人员配置预测。</p><p class="para">Pake warned his superiors that under the projected growth curve the Porter Drive complex, which at the time housed everyone comfortably, would certainly burst its seams by the close of 1971. He was too upbeat. In the first weeks of the year Xerox headquarters knocked the staffing projections flat by imposing a company-wide hiring freeze.</p>
<p class="para">当时，施乐公司正处于困境之中。自 914 推出以来，其盈利持续增长的模式几乎从未中断，但现在却开始崩盘。刚刚过去的一年带来了整体经济放缓，其最大客户因此削减了资本支出。更令人不安的是，1970 年也标志着<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch04.html.page56"></a>施乐在复印机市场的垄断地位被打破。4 月，IBM 推出了第一台办公复印机。这台机器运行缓慢、笨重，速度和可靠性都无法与施乐相媲美。但由于背后有美国工业巨头的支持，这款新产品的上市投下了令人生畏的阴影。</p><p class="para">Xerox at that moment was a company in siege mode. Its pattern of consistently rising earnings, virtually unbroken since the introduction of the 914, was cracking. The year just ended had brought a general economic slowdown and, consequently, cutbacks in capital spending by its biggest customers. More troubling, 1970 had also marked the <a></a>end of Xerox’s monopoly over the copier market. In April IBM had brought out its first office copier. It was a slow, clunky machine that could scarcely match the Xerox line for speed and reliability. But with one of the great names of American industrial muscle behind it, the new entry cast a very menacing shadow.</p>
<p class="para">与此同时，施乐公司的硒合金感光器专利即将到期。硒合金感光器是每台复印机内旋转鼓内衬的材料。硒是静电复印技术的关键元素。它的静电荷被光中和，并通过阴影保留下来，从而镜像要复印的页面图像。墨粉颗粒粘附在鼓的带电区域，这些区域与原件上的暗色标记相对应，然后可以转移到新页面上以复制图像。尽管该过程的许多其他部分（尤其是墨粉本身的成分）仍受专利或公司机密的保护，但硒专利的到期摧毁了阻止闯入者进入施乐私人领地的一道关键障碍。IBM 采用了不同的工艺，但其他公司肯定会利用这一技术优势。众所周知，该公司总部位于罗切斯特的老大哥伊士曼柯达公司已经在研发一款竞争机器。更不祥的是，在地球的另一端，由美国、德国和日本的工程师组成的团队正在开发一款小型台式复印机，最终以 Savin 750 的名称在美国上市销售。通过向施乐一直忽视的数百万中型和小型客户提供高速办公复印服务，Savin 将威胁到公司的生存。</p><p class="para">Meanwhile, Xerox’s patent was about to expire on its selenium-alloy photoreceptor, the material that lined a revolving drum inside every copier. The selenium was a critical element of xerography. Its electrostatic charge was neutralized by light and preserved by shadow in a way that mirrored the image of a page to be copied. Particles of toner stuck to the charged regions of the drum, which corresponded to dark marks on the original, and could then be transferred to a fresh page to reproduce the image. Although numerous other parts of the process—notably the composition of the toner itself—were still protected by patents or by corporate secrecy, the expiration of the selenium patent demolished one key barrier preventing interlopers from playing in Xerox’s private preserve. IBM used a different process, but others were sure to take advantage of this technological bonus. Eastman Kodak, the company’s Rochester-based big brother, was already known to be working on a rival machine. More ominously, halfway around the world, teams of American, German, and Japanese engineers were developing a small tabletop copier, ultimately to be marketed in the United States as the Savin 750. By offering high-speed office duplication to the millions of mid-sized and small customers Xerox had always ignored, the Savin would threaten the company’s very survival.</p>
<p class="para">这些事件开启了被企业史学家称为施乐“失去的十年”的时期。20 世纪 70 年代是 PARC 创造力最强的时期，总部对这段时期的印象更为深刻，因为这段时期市场份额不断缩水、经济停滞，专利和反垄断诉讼不断。该公司未能实现 1970 年 11 月和 12 月的收入和利润目标，预示着即将到来的风暴。斯坦福总部已不再受乔·威尔逊时代的工程师和销售主管的控制，而是受会计师和金融工程师的控制，他们迅速采取行动控制开支。</p><p class="para">These events kicked off what corporate historians dubbed Xerox’s “lost decade.” The 1970s, a period of conspicuous creativity at PARC, would be better remembered at headquarters as an era of shriveling market share, financial stagnation, and unceasing litigation over patent and antitrust claims. Presaging the coming storm, the company had missed its revenue and profit targets for November and December 1970. The panicked Stamford headquarters, no longer under the control of the engineers and sales executives of Joe Wilson’s era but of accountants and financial engineers, moved rapidly to rein in spending.</p>
<p class="para">这一时期 PARC 面临的危险甚至比简单的<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch04.html.page57"></a>停止招聘新员工。在这家规模很小的研究中心还未发展成熟时，几乎没有员工知道它差点被关闭。在那些精通财务的高管向董事会提出的削减成本措施中，关闭或出售新的帕洛阿尔托工厂是其中之一。继续这样做似乎没有什么损失，也没有什么意义：固定投资仍然微不足道；建筑物已出租；对施乐的价值仍是推测性的。（帕克不是警告他们至少五年内不要指望回报吗？）</p><p class="para">The danger to PARC in this period was even graver than a simple <a></a>hold on new hiring. Few of its tiny staff ever knew how close the research center came to being exterminated before it even reached puberty. For among the cost-cutting steps the finance-minded executives proposed to the board of directors was the closure or sale of the new Palo Alto facility. There did not seem to be anything to lose or much point in carrying on: The fixed investment was still negligible; the buildings leased; the value to Xerox still conjectural. (Had not Pake warned them not to expect a return for at least five years?)</p>
<p class="para">但在最后一刻，一位主任站出来，在绞刑架前捍卫他不容置疑的权威。约翰·巴丁是科学研究领域的杰出人物，也许是他那个时代最有成就的工程师。1971 年，他已经因与威廉·布里顿和威廉·肖克利在贝尔实验室共同发明晶体管而获得诺贝尔奖。（1972 年，他因对超导理论的贡献而再次获得诺贝尔奖。）</p><p class="para">But at the last minute one director stood up to interpose his incontestable authority before the hangman. John Bardeen was a towering figure of scientific research, perhaps the most accomplished engineer of his time. In 1971 he already had one Nobel Prize under his belt, for co-inventing the transistor at Bell Labs with William Brittain and William Schockley. (Another would follow in 1972, for his contributions to the theory of superconductivity.)</p>
<p class="para">巴丁干脆地向其他董事们表达了自己的看法，即剥离 PARC 是一种不负责任的短视行为。它的预算只有 170 万美元，对利润来说微不足道。相比之下，它的潜力是无限的。“这是你们最有前途的东西，”他说（同样是董事会成员的杰克·戈德曼默默地点头表示同意）。“保留它！”中心得救了。</p><p class="para">Bardeen crisply informed his fellow directors of his opinion that divesting PARC would be an irresponsibly shortsighted act. Its budget was $1.7 million, barely a flyspeck on the bottom line. By contrast, its potential was limitless. “This is the most promising thing you’ve got,” he said (as Jack Goldman, also a board member, nodded silent and relieved assent). “Keep it!” The center was saved.</p>
<p class="para">当这场小闹剧在斯坦福上演时，PARC 的最初几名新员工在租来的家具和空置的办公室中互相认识。随着时间的推移，帕克建立的行政部门将凝聚成充满争议的观点和个性的战线，但那还远得很。“我们都混在一起，所以不会出现一个小组在大楼的某个地方，系统人员在另一个地方，计算机人员在另一个地方的情况，”大卫·索恩伯格回忆道，他在招聘冻结的最后关头加入，并在元旦后不久作为第 25 名员工到达工作岗位。“我们是一个足够小的团队，所以每个人都认识其他人。”</p><p class="para">While that small drama played itself out in Stamford, PARC’s first few recruits got to know each other amid rented furniture and vacant offices. In time the administrative divisions Pake established would congeal into battle lines of contentious perspectives and personalities, but that was still far in the future. “We were all intermingled with each other, so it wasn’t as if one group was in one part of a building and the systems people were in another part and the computer people were in another part,” recalled David Thornburg, who slid in just under the wire of the hiring freeze and arrived for work shortly after New Year’s Day as employee number twenty-five. “We were a small enough group so everyone knew everyone else.”</p>
<p class="para">在那一瞬间，PARC 似乎实现了 Pake 的梦想：一个物理学家和计算机科学家可以一起探索共同科学的乌托邦。他们在 PARC 虽小但很自由的环境中交流。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch04.html.page58"></a>不知何故，这是一个包罗万象的世界，一个充满可能性和神秘联系的地方。第一天上班时，比格尔森 (Biegelsen) 出现在他的办公室门口，比格尔森凭借三个月的任期，已经是 PARC 的资深人士。</p><p class="para">For a glittering instant it seemed as though PARC might fulfill Pake’s dream of a utopia where physicists and computer scientists communed in quest of a common science. They mixed freely in PARC’s small yet <a></a>somehow all-encompassing world, a place full of possibilities and mysterious conjunctions. Thornburg was still unpacking his things on his very first day when Biegelsen, who on the strength of his three months’ tenure already ranked as a seasoned PARC veteran, showed up at his office door.</p>
<p class="para">“我来是想把你介绍给你的隔壁邻居，”比格尔森一边说，一边把索恩伯格领进了相邻的小区。“我是乔治。我觉得你们应该认识一下，因为你们在研究生院有相似的研究兴趣。”</p><p class="para">“I just came to introduce you to your next-door neighbor,” Biegelsen said, leading Thornburg into the adjoining warren. “This is George. I thought you guys should get together because you shared a similar research interest in grad school.”</p>
<p class="para">索恩伯格感到很困惑。他知道乔治在研究语音识别，而他来这里是为了当一名薄膜冶金学家。</p><p class="para">Thornburg was perplexed. He understood George to be working on speech recognition and he had come in as a thin-film metallurgist.</p>
<p class="para">“真的吗？”邻居问。“你是做什么工作的？”</p><p class="para">“Really?” the neighbor asked. “What did you do you work in?”</p>
<p class="para">这就是能言善辩的索恩伯格开始全面阐述他的博士生涯所需要的全部内容，尽管他不得不在中途改变主题，因为俄勒冈州一位名叫乔治怀特 (George White) 的人抢先发表了关于同一主题的论文。</p><p class="para">That was all the voluble Thornburg needed to set off on a thorough explication of his doctoral career, not excepting the time he had to change themes in midcourse thanks to the preemptive publication of a thesis on the same subject by a guy from Oregon named George White.</p>
<p class="para">“很高兴认识你，”他的邻居微笑着说道。“我是乔治·怀特。”</p><p class="para">“I’m pleased to meet you,” his neighbor said, smiling. “I’m George White.”</p>
<p class="para">让新员工特别高兴的是这里坚定的非正式氛围和毫不做作的作风。PARC 看起来更像是一个大学部门而不是企业研究机构，这并不奇怪，因为大多数员工几乎是第一次接触非学术世界。由于除了两位首席科学家（来自韦伯斯特的光学专家约翰·乌尔巴赫和卢科夫斯基）之外，其他人都是施乐的新人，因此帕克和琼斯开始派他们去罗切斯特、韦伯斯特、埃尔塞贡多和帕萨迪纳的光电系统部门进行实地考察，只是为了让他们感受一下企业文化。但他们生活的中心仍然是波特大道上的两栋建筑。</p><p class="para">What particularly delighted the new staff was the atmosphere of determined informality and lack of pretension. That PARC seemed more like a university department than a corporate research facility was unsurprising, given that most of the staff were being exposed to the nonacademic world virtually for the first time in their lives. Since all but two of the principal scientists (John Urbach, an optical expert from Webster, and Lucovsky) were newcomers to Xerox, Pake and Jones took to sending them on field trips to Rochester, Webster, El Segundo, and the Electro-Optical Systems division in Pasadena, just to give them some feeling for the corporate culture. But the center of their existence remained the two buildings on Porter Drive.</p>
<p class="para">“我们每周会聚一次，分享实验室里发生的事情，”索恩伯格回忆道。“这几乎成了一场准社交活动。”PARC 刚刚成立，没有人获得安全徽章或公司身份证明。由于场地内几乎没有任何有价值的设备，大楼一直没有上锁，对外来者也十分友好。“我们与斯坦福大学相邻，所以<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch04.html.page59"></a>经常有访客进出实验室。我们中的很多人甚至开始觉得自己有点像大学讲师，可以把所有时间都花在研究上，而不必上课。所以我们把这里当成一个开放的环境，我们可以自由地与任何我们想要的人分享我们正在做的事情。”</p><p class="para">“We would get together once a week and just sort of share what was going on in the lab,” Thornburg recalled. “It became almost a quasisocial event.” PARC was so new that no one had been issued security badges or company identification. With scant equipment of any value on the premises, the building stayed unlocked and hospitable to outsiders. “We were physically adjacent to Stanford University, so there <a></a>were visitors dropping in and out of the lab all the time. A lot of us even came to feel we were sort of like university instructors who got to spend all our time doing research without having to teach classes. So we operated as though this were an open environment where we were free to share what we were doing with anyone we wanted to.”</p>
<p class="para">或者偶尔<span class="italic">太过</span>自由。1971 年初的一个早晨，杰克·戈德曼在每周例会上发表了讲话，他经常访问他的新孵化器。戈德曼的讲话——也许是受到 PARC 最近险情的启发——与开始生成正式报告和白皮书的必要性有关，以向斯坦福保证，在西部花的钱是购买真正的知识成果。</p><p class="para">Or occasionally <span class="italic">too</span> free. One morning in early 1971 the weekly meeting was addressed by Jack Goldman, who was in the habit of paying frequent visits to his new incubator. Goldman’s talk—perhaps inspired by PARC’s recent close call—had to do with the need to start generating formal reports and white papers to reassure Stamford that the money being spent out west was buying genuine intellectual achievement.</p>
<p class="para">索恩伯格不认识的一个人打断了戈德曼的话，并提出了建议。“他说，‘好吧，如果你问我，杰克’——我们其他人只叫他‘戈德曼博士’——‘如果你问我，杰克，我们应该建立一个基于计算机的查询系统，我们可以标记报告的不同级别，这样只需要执行摘要的人就可以得到它，而需要更多信息的人可以得到完整的报告。’他基本上是在谈论一个类似超文本的环境。我们都坐在那里，觉得这是个好东西，戈德曼站在前面，咬着雪茄，说‘是的，这是个好主意。’”</p><p class="para">Someone Thornburg did not recognize interrupted Goldman with a suggestion. “He said, ‘Well, if you ask me, Jack’—the rest of us never called him anything but ‘Dr. Goldman’—‘If you ask me, Jack, what we should do is build a computer-based query system where we can tag the different levels of the report, so somebody who just wants an executive summary could get that and someone who wants more could get the full report.’ He was basically talking about a hypertext-like environment. We were all sitting there thinking this is pretty good stuff, and Goldman was up front, chomping on his cigar, saying ‘Yeah, that’s a good idea.’”</p>
<p class="para">会议一结束，索恩伯格就看到他的朋友鲍勃·鲍尔冲进了走廊。出于好奇，他跟着鲍尔，最后发现鲍尔靠在墙上，笑得喘不过气来。</p><p class="para">The moment the meeting broke up Thornburg saw his friend Bob Bauer shoot out into the hallway. Curious, he followed, and finally found Bauer leaned up against a wall, laughing so hard he could hardly catch his breath.</p>
<p class="para">“有什么好笑的？”索恩伯格问道。</p><p class="para">“What’s so funny?” Thornburg asked.</p>
<p class="para">“你知道那个说‘好吧，如果你问我，杰克’的人吗？”</p><p class="para">“You know that guy who said, ‘Well, if you ask me, Jack?’”</p>
<p class="para">“是啊，他是谁？”</p><p class="para">“Yeah, who is he?”</p>
<p class="para">“他不在这里工作，”鲍尔说。“他刚从斯坦福过来，和计算机科学系的某个人共进午餐。他们说，‘我们要开会，你留在这里’，于是他就跟着他们进去了。高盛可能会给他发奖金什么的，而且这个人甚至不在施乐公司工作！”</p><p class="para">“He doesn’t work here,” Bauer said. “He just came over from Stanford to have lunch with somebody in computer science. They said, ‘We got a meeting, stick around,’ so he followed them in. Goldman is probably going to want to give him a bonus or something, and the guy doesn’t even work for Xerox!”</p>
<p class="para">但这种同僚主义的天堂更像是神话而非现实，或者至少注定是短暂的。杰克·戈德曼没有同意帕克让物理学家和其他传统科学家加入的愿望。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch04.html.page60"></a>因为他赞同任何将旧科学与新科学结合起来的想法。相反，他认为这是一种快速增加 PARC 员工人数的方法，即从韦伯斯特挖走可用的人才，同时招募他指望能为 PARC 树立名声的计算机和系统专家。</p><p class="para">But the paradise of collegiality was more mythical than real, or at least it was destined to be short-lived. Jack Goldman had not acceded to Pake’s desire to have physicists and other traditional scientists on the <a></a>premises because he subscribed to any notion of marrying the old science to the new. Instead he saw it as a way to rapidly ramp up PARC’s head count by kidnapping available talent from Webster while recruiting the computer and systems experts he was counting on to make PARC’s reputation.</p>
<p class="para">“我们的想法是，当你招募新人时，你希望他们能有人交流，”戈德曼说。“所以我们在两个科学部门（即物理和光学部门）都安排了公司里的人，一些来自罗切斯特的杰出人物，他们渴望离开。他们都是很好的人，我因为把他们从韦伯斯特调走而遭受了一定程度的批评，这实际上降低了韦伯斯特团队的平均智商。”但他感觉到，物理学家和计算机科学家最终会陷入一场深刻的哲学和科学拉锯战。戈德曼认为，如果帕克认为他可以掩盖这种基本冲突，那他就错了。</p><p class="para">“The idea was that when you brought new people in you wanted them to have someone to talk to,” Goldman said. “So we sort of seeded the two scientific departments”—that is, physics and optics—“with people from the company, a few of the shining lights from Rochester who were desirous of moving. They were very good guys and I suffered a certain amount of criticism for taking them away from Webster and essentially lowering the average IQ of the Webster group.” But he sensed that the physicists and computer scientists would end up in a profound philosophical and scientific tug of war. If Pake believed he could paper over such an elemental conflict, Goldman thought, he was mistaken.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">几个月后，招聘冻结结束了。在此期间，研究行业的裁员急剧加剧，部分原因是《曼斯菲尔德修正案》将五角大楼的开支限制在军事研究上，该修正案开始在全国范围内产生影响。佩克和斯奎尔斯以与以前一样谨慎的审慎态度恢复了招聘。</p><p class="para">The hiring freeze ended after a couple of months. In that period the downsizing in the research industries had sharply intensified, in part because the Mansfield Amendment restricting Pentagon spending to specifically military research had begun to bite nationwide. Pake and Squires resumed recruiting with the same cautious deliberation as before.</p>
<p class="para">在研究和工程人才的买方市场中，PARC 的丰厚预算和无限期的特许在企业实体中独树一帜。其他工业研究中心可能享受慷慨的资金或同样宽松的特许，但没有一个像 PARC 一样，既有开放的资金，又有明显的产品开发压力豁免权。从美国杰出的计算机研究科学家的角度来看，除了少数几所顶尖大学外，施乐是唯一一家。“所有拥有绝妙想法的超级聪明人都欣喜若狂地为乔治·帕克和杰克·戈德曼工作，”戈德曼员工中的研究主管乔治·M·怀特回忆道。<span class="sup">“</span>没有人会为他们筹集资金并创办公司，就像<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch04.html.page61"></a>他们今天会这样做。在 PARC，他们可以得到良好的预算、良好的实验室和独立性，而所有这些都是 Pake 和 Goldman 提供的。”</p><p class="para">In a superb buyers’ market for research and engineering talent, PARC’s lavish budget and open-ended charter stood alone among corporate entities. Other industrial research centers might enjoy generous funding or comparably liberal charters, but none had both the open checkbook and apparent immunity from product development pressures enjoyed by PARC. From the point of view of the nation’s outstanding computer research scientists, Xerox—outside of a handful of top universities—was the only game in town. “All the super-bright guys who had swell ideas were tickled pink to go work for George Pake and Jack Goldman,” recalled George M. White, the research executive on Goldman’s staff.<span class="sup">*</span> “Nobody was going to float money and start a company for them, like <a></a>they would today. At PARC they could get a good budget and a good lab and independence, all of which Pake and Goldman provided.”</p>
<p class="para">PARC 的魅力还在于其优厚的薪酬标准。这在一定程度上是帕克向公司管理层提出的精明恳求的结果，帕克担心施乐公司的政策要求 PARC 的薪酬标准与韦伯斯特大学一比一，这将使最负盛名的大学能够以高于 PARC 的价格抢到最优秀的人才。</p><p class="para">Adding to PARC’s charm was its premium pay scale. This was partially the result of shrewd entreaties to corporate management by Pake, who feared that Xerox policy requiring PARC’s salary scale to match Webster’s, dollar for dollar, would allow the most prestigious universities to outbid PARC for the best talent.</p>
<p class="para">帕克敦促杰克·戈德曼为 PARC 争取豁免，理由是计算机科学家与韦伯斯特的物理学家和化学家不同。首先，他们相对稀少。1970 年，只有少数几所学术机构提供计算机科学研究生课程。国会对 ARPA 拨款的限制预示着这一数字将保持较小，一流毕业生的数量将很少。最终，戈德曼为计算机科学博士争取到了比韦伯斯特标准高出 15% 到 20% 的差额。这帮助 PARC 招募到了最优秀的人才，但其副作用是，通用科学实验室的物理学家和光学科学家被排除在外，这可想而知。</p><p class="para">Pake urged Jack Goldman to secure PARC a dispensation on the grounds that computer scientists were a different breed from the physicists and chemists of Webster. For one thing they were comparatively scarce. In 1970 a mere handful of academic institutions offered graduate programs in computer science. The congressional restrictions on ARPA grants foretold that the number would stay small and the inventory of first-class graduates thin. At length Goldman secured a differential for computer science Ph.D.s of 15 to 20 percent over Webster scale. That helped PARC secure the best recruits, but had the predictable side effect of generating resentment among the General Science Lab’s physicists and optical scientists, who were excluded.</p>
<p class="para">从此以后，PARC 可以为拥有高级计算机科学学位或该领域工作经验的人提供 30,000 至 35,000 美元的起薪——这在当时对于博士来说是相当不错的薪水，尽管薪资范围仍然很广，而且往往取决于应聘者的见多识广和讨价还价的技巧。一些来自斯坦福大学的人被低估了，因为斯坦福大学以对受薪专业人士吝啬而闻名。其中一人回忆说，他接受了 24,000 美元的 PARC 全职工资，这在计算机实验室的主要研究人员的薪水中处于最低水平，但比他在斯坦福人工智能实验室赚到的 16,000 美元高出很多。</p><p class="para">Henceforth PARC could offer people with advanced computer science degrees or working experience in the field starting salaries between $30,000 and $35,000—excellent pay for Ph.D.s at the time, although the range remained wide and often depended on a recruit’s worldliness and bargaining skills. Some from Stanford University, which was known for its stinginess with salaried professionals, got low-balled. One recalled accepting a full-time PARC salary of $24,000, which was at the low end of pay for principal researchers in the computer lab but a big step up from the $16,000 he had earned at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab.</p>
<p class="para">仿佛是为了预示未来的困境，泰勒的薪水是佩克最头疼的问题。尽管泰勒缺乏正式资历，但佩克还是将他列为计算机科学实验室副经理，更正式地说，是 CSL 的计算机图形区域经理。PARC 战斗序列中区域经理的起薪为 44,000 美元，这超出了施乐公司任何非博士学位人员的工资标准。“为了得到这份工作，我不得不与高盛和总部争执，因为泰勒只有心理学硕士学位<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch04.html.page62"></a>“看起来不太对劲，”帕克说，“当然，我自己也能理解这其中的官僚主义问题。”</p><p class="para">As though to foreshadow the shoals ahead, it was Taylor’s pay that caused Pake the biggest headache. Despite his lack of formal credentials Pake had rostered him on the payroll as associate manager of the Computer Science Lab and, more formally, as area manager of computer graphics within CSL. The starting salary for an area manager in PARC’s order of battle was $44,000, off the scale for a non-Ph.D. anywhere at Xerox. “I had to fight with Goldman and he had to fight with headquarters to get that, because Taylor had only a master’s degree in psychology <a></a>and it didn’t look right,” Pake said. “Of course, I could understand the bureaucratic problems with that myself.”</p>
<p class="para">泰勒的薪水问题不仅仅是因为他缺乏资历。在他来到 PARC 的几个月内，他的性格就开始惹恼其他实验室经理，他们自然而然地对他的态度表示不满，他认为 PARC<span class="italic">存在的唯一理由</span>就是进行计算机研究，而花在硬科学上的任何钱都注定是浪费。</p><p class="para">It was not only Taylor’s lack of credentials that made his salary a sore point. Within months of his arrival at PARC his personality started to grate on the other lab managers, who understandably took exception to his attitude that PARC’s sole <span class="italic">raison d’être</span> was to pursue computer research and that anything spent on the hard sciences was by definition money down a rathole.</p>
<p class="para">泰勒在 ARPA 会议上绝不容忍人身攻击，但在 PARC 管理会议上，他似乎非常接近人身攻击<span class="italic">。</span>其他实验室经理对他对待冈宁的方式尤其感到震惊，冈宁是一个热情而迷人的人，他在电子行业工作的时间几乎和泰勒在地球上工作的时间一样长。“他对冈宁的态度极其傲慢，”琼斯回忆道。“这真的引起了很多争执。比尔说了什么，鲍勃就会说，‘这太愚蠢了！’或者，‘我在这里只是在浪费时间！’这非常不专业，而且完全不是大家习惯的整体氛围。”</p><p class="para">A man who would never tolerate personal attacks at his ARPA conferences, Taylor seemed to tack treacherously close to the <span class="italic">ad hominem</span> at PARC management meetings. The other lab managers were particularly appalled by his treatment of Gunning, a warm and charming individual who had spent almost as many years in the electronics industry as Taylor had spent on Earth. “He treated Gunning with the utmost condescension,” Jones recalled. “It really created a lot of strife. Bill would say something and Bob would come out with, ‘That’s stupid!’ or, ‘I’m just wasting my time in here!’ It was very unprofessional, and not at all the general atmosphere everyone was used to.”</p>
<p class="para">年底前，几名中层管理人员组成的代表团走进帕克的办公室，要求解雇泰勒。这一次，帕克拒绝了。他并不比他们更被泰勒迷住，但他更清楚泰勒对组织的非同寻常的价值。泰勒精心培养了全国最优秀的年轻计算机研究人员的忠诚度，与那个毫无魅力地激怒同事和上级的泰勒完全不同。最重要的是，没有人能比得上他吸引研究人才到 PARC 的能力；到目前为止，几乎所有被计算机科学实验室聘用的人都是认识他并尊重他的人。帕克觉得还有更多有天赋的科学家尚未被挖走。</p><p class="para">Before the year was out a delegation of several middle managers marched into Pake’s office to demand Taylor be fired for his behavior. On this occasion, Pake demurred. He was no more charmed by Taylor than they, but he was more acutely aware of the man’s uncommon value to the organization. The Taylor who had spun a web of carefully nurtured loyalties among the nation’s best young computer researchers seemed an entirely different character from the one who so charmlessly provoked his peers and superiors. The bottom line was that no one could match his ability to lure research talent to PARC; virtually everyone hired thus far into the Computer Science Lab was someone who knew and respected him personally. Pake felt there were many more gifted scientists yet to be snagged.</p>
<p class="para">他是对的。1970 年底，泰勒拿出他的一些旧筹码，上演了两起令人眼花缭乱的抢劫案。</p><p class="para">He was right about that. Toward the end of 1970 Taylor called in some of his old chits to stage a pair of dazzling heists.</p>
<p class="para">第一次是突袭西海岸（可能是全美）唯一一个在交互式计算方面符合他严格标准的实验室。该实验室属于传奇工程师道格拉斯·C·恩格尔<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch04.html.page63"></a>巴特是一位坚定不移的梦想家，他在位于帕洛阿尔托以北几英里的门洛帕克社区的一家名为 SRI 的小型智库中担任要职。</p><p class="para">The first was a raid on the only laboratory on the West Coast—possibly the country—whose work on interactive computing met his stern standards. The lab belonged to the legendary engineer Douglas C. Engel<a></a>bart, an adamantine visionary who held court out of a small think tank called SRI, or the Stanford Research Institute, a couple of miles north of Palo Alto in the community of Menlo Park.</p>
<p class="para">恩格尔巴特在那里建立了他的“增强研究中心”。这个名字源于他的信念：计算机不仅能够协助人类的思维过程，还能在更高的层面上重塑它。他所定义的“增强人类智力”意味着计算机存储、分类和检索信息的能力终有一天会改变人们的思维、写作和计算方式。</p><p class="para">There Engelbart had established his “Augmentation Research Center.” The name derived from his conviction that the computer was not only capable of assisting the human thought process, but reinventing it on a higher plane. The “augmentation of human intellect,” as he defined it, meant that the computer’s ability to store, classify, and retrieve information would someday alter the very way people thought, wrote, and figured.</p>
<p class="para">恩格尔巴特的愿景完善并扩展了范尼瓦尔·布什博士提出的一个令人印象深刻的概念，范尼瓦尔·布什博士是麻省理工学院工程系主任，也是富兰克林·罗斯福的战时科学顾问。1945 年，布什将注意力转向以战争的名义产生的科学进步，以及它们如何服务于和平。结果就是一篇名为《正如我们所想》的科学预言小杰作，发表在 1945 年 7 月的<span class="italic">《大西洋月刊</span>》上。</p><p class="para">Engelbart’s vision refined and expanded a concept memorably set forth by Dr. Vannevar Bush, an MIT engineering dean and wartime science advisor to Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1945 Bush had turned his attention to the scientific advances produced in the name of war and to how they might serve the peace. The result was a small masterpiece of scientific augury entitled “As We May Think,” which appeared in the July 1945 issue of <span class="italic">The Atlantic Monthly</span>.</p>
<p class="para">《正如我们所想》仍然是计算机时代为数不多的真正具有开创性的文献之一。即使在今天，它仍然是一部细致的科学和社会分析著作。当代读者被它的实用主义和远见所震撼，没有一丝陈词滥调或乌托邦主义的痕迹，这些都是关于未来的写作常见的烦恼。布什对在空中画出神奇的图画不感兴趣；他正忙于研究战后世界的新技术，看看它们如何减轻社会的紧迫负担。</p><p class="para">“As We May Think” remains one of the few genuinely seminal documents of the computer age. Even today it stands out as a work of meticulous scientific and social analysis. The contemporary reader is struck by its pragmatism and farsightedness, expressed without a hint of platitude or utopianism, those common afflictions of writing about the future. Bush was not interested in drawing magical pictures in the air; he was busy scrutinizing the new technologies of the postwar world to see how they might relieve society’s pressing burdens.</p>
<p class="para">他的文章主要讨论了技术管理信息的能力。布什预见到了后来被称为“信息过剩”的现象的出现，并将其投射到喧嚣的后世。“出版范围已经远远超出了我们目前真正利用记录的能力，”他写道。“人类经验的总结正在以惊人的速度扩展，我们用来穿过随之而来的迷宫找到当下重要信息的方法与在横帆船时代使用的方法相同。”</p><p class="para">His essay dealt chiefly with technology’s ability to manage information. Bush discerned the birth of what would come to be called the “information glut” and projected it forward to a cacophonous posterity. “Publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record,” he wrote. “The summation of human experience is being expanded at a prodigious rate, and the means we use for threading through the consequent maze to the momentarily important item is the same as was used in the days of square-rigged ships.”</p>
<p class="para">布什本人就是成功的模拟计算机的发明者，他明白计算机技术可能有助于社会从<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch04.html.page64"></a>混乱。他勾勒出了一种叫做“memex”的东西，他将其描述为“一种个人用来存储所有书籍、记录和通信的设备，它是机械化的，因此可以以极快的速度和灵活性进行查阅。”查阅机制将是“关联索引……任何项目都可以随意选择另一个项目。这是 memex 的基本特征。”</p><p class="para">Himself the inventor of a successful analog computer, Bush understood that computer technology might help society draw sense out of <a></a>the chaos. He sketched out something called the “memex,” which he described as “a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility.” The mechanism of consultation would be “associative indexing…whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another. This is the essential feature of the memex.”</p>
<p class="para">道格·恩格尔巴特第一次接触到布什的 memex 是在一篇杂志文章中，当时他在马尼拉的红十字会图书馆里看到这篇文章，当时他正在等待从二战服役归来的回国。他被作者对互联数据世界的想象深深吸引，仿佛被巫师的咒语所迷惑。几年后，当他获得工程学博士学位离开伯克利时，他已经决定，他一生的使命就是将 memex 变成现实。</p><p class="para">Doug Engelbart first encountered Bush’s memex in a magazine article he found in an a Red Cross library in Manila, where he was awaiting transport home from his World War II service. He succumbed to the author’s vision of a world of interlinked data as though to a sorcerer’s spell. By the time he left Berkeley a few years later with a Ph.D. in engineering, he had decided that his mission in life would be, in effect, to turn the memex into reality.</p>
<p class="para">事实上，他远远超出了布什本人的想象。在 SRI，他根据布什的粗略蓝图推广了一套成熟的交互式硬件和软件系统，该系统旨在管理、操纵和传达文本和视频图像。这一成就更加引人注目，因为它需要与几乎普遍的怀疑论进行艰苦的斗争。恩格尔巴特的资金不足的项目不止一次险些被淘汰。然而，他逐渐获得了一大批年轻工程师和科学家的支持，他们觉得与魅力十足的道格·恩格尔巴特的第一次会面改变了他们的生活，他们对他的愿景几乎怀有宗教般的敬畏。“他不仅有道理，”早期的门徒之一比尔·杜瓦尔回忆道。“就像有人打开了一盏灯。一见钟情可能不太合适，但这是最接近一见钟情的了。”</p><p class="para">In the event, he went far beyond anything Bush himself had imagined. At SRI he propagated from Bush’s rough blueprint a full-blown system of interactive hardware and software aimed at managing, manipulating, and communicating text and video images. The achievement was all the more remarkable given that it involved an uphill battle against nearly universal skepticism. More than once Engelbart’s thinly financed project narrowly eluded extermination. Gradually, however, he acquired a sizable coterie of young engineers and scientists who felt their lives altered by their first meetings with the charismatic Doug Engelbart and who regarded his vision with an almost religious awe. “He not only made sense,” recalled Bill Duvall, one of the early disciples. “It was like someone turning on a light. Love at first sight is perhaps the wrong term to use, but it was as close to that as you can get.”</p>
<p class="para">另一个被恩格尔巴特的工作所吸引的人是鲍勃·泰勒。1963 年，泰勒在 NASA 筹集了足够的资金以克服预算危机，从而挽救了恩格尔巴特的实验室。在转入 ARPA 后，他把涓涓细流变成了滚滚洪流。到 60 年代末，增强研究中心由 ARPA 每年 50 万美元的拨款资助，占据了 SRI 门洛帕克总部的一整侧，成为该智库的主要研究项目。</p><p class="para">One other individual entranced by Engelbart’s work was Bob Taylor. At NASA in 1963 Taylor had saved Engelbart’s lab by scrounging enough money to overcome a budget crisis. After moving on to ARPA he turned the trickle of funding into a flood. By the end of the decade the Augmentation Research Center, fueled by ARPA’s half-million-dollar annual grant and occupying one entire wing of SRI’s Menlo Park headquarters, reigned as the think tank’s dominant research program.</p>
<p class="para">它所创造的结果简直令人惊叹。痴迷于<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch04.html.page65"></a>为了开发人机交互的新方式，恩格尔巴特通过电缆将视频终端连接到主机，并通过电视图像与机器进行通信。为了让用户能够即时将插入点或光标从文本块中的一处移动到另一处，他在一块挖空的木块上安装两个以直角固定的小轮子，以便它可以在平坦的表面上平稳滚动。轮子将其运动传递给电位计，电位计的信号又由计算机转换为屏幕上光标的位置。从这个粗糙的装置中诞生了一种完整的文化。“没有人确切知道为什么它被命名为‘鼠标’，”恩格尔巴特多年后说。“我们都没有想到这个名字会一直流传至今。”整个交互系统——鼠标、屏幕、计算机、软件和底层理念——被缩写为“NLS”，即“在线系统”。</p><p class="para">What it produced was nothing short of astonishing. Obsessed with <a></a>developing new ways for man and computer to interact, Engelbart linked video terminals to mainframes by cable and communicated with the machines via televised images. To allow the user to move the insertion point, or cursor, from place to place in a block of text instantaneously, he outfitted a hollowed-out block of wood with two small wheels fixed at right angles so it could be rolled smoothly over a flat surface. The wheels communicated their motion to potentiometers whose signals in turn were translated by the computer into the placement of the cursor on the screen. From this crude device would spring an entire culture. “No one is quite sure why it got named a ‘mouse,’” Engelbart said years later. “None of us thought that the name would have stayed with it, out in the world.” The entire interactive system—mouse, screen, computer, software, and underlying philosophy—was known by the acronym “NLS,” for “oNLine System.”</p>
<p class="para">直到 1968 年，恩格尔巴特和他的助手们一直默默无闻，他们的工作只在政府资助者和计算机理论家的圈子里为人所知。那一年，他要求在 12 月于旧金山举行的两大工程协会秋季联合计算机会议上用 90 分钟演示 NLS。结果成为了计算机历史上最著名的事件之一。</p><p class="para">Until 1968 Engelbart and his aides labored in relative obscurity, their work known only within the insular fraternity of government grant-makers and computer theorists. That year he requested ninety minutes to demonstrate NLS at the Fall Joint Computer Conference of two leading engineering societies, scheduled for San Francisco in December. The result was one of the most famous events in computing history.</p>
<p class="para">鼠标首次公开亮相，是其中最不起眼的。恩格尔巴特和他的 16 名助手几乎将现有的电子技术发挥到了极限。他后来回忆道：“我们制造了特殊的电子设备，从我的鼠标、键盘和键盘中获取控制输入，并通过电话连接将它们传输到 SRI [即斯坦福研究所]。我们从实验室租用了两条微波线路，大约三十英里。这需要 SRI 屋顶上的两个额外天线，Skyline Boulevard 上的卡车上的四个天线，以及会议中心屋顶上的两个天线。这需要花钱……资助我们的 ARPA 和 NASA 的好心人不得不说，‘别告诉我！’”</p><p class="para">The mouse, making its first public appearance, was the least of it. Engelbart and his sixteen assistants stretched existing electronic technology nearly to the breaking point. He recalled later: “We built special electronics that picked up the control inputs from my mouse, keyset, and keyboard and piped them down to SRI [that is, Stanford Research Institute] over a telephone hookup. We leased two microwave lines up from our laboratory, roughly thirty miles. It took two additional antennas on the roof at SRI, four more on a truck on Skyline Boulevard, and two on the roof of the conference center. It cost money…The nice people at ARPA and NASA, who were funding us, effectively had to say, ‘Don’t tell me!’”</p>
<p class="para">付出的每一分钱都是值得的。当恩格尔巴特用低沉的声音描述并演示一套由互动视频会议、多媒体显示器和分屏技术组成的全功能系统时，观众全神贯注。</p><p class="para">The effort was worth every penny. The audience was riveted, as Engelbart in his subdued drone described and demonstrated a fully operational system of interactive video conferencing, multimedia displays, and split-screen technology.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch04.html.page66"></a>
<p class="para">有一次，二十英尺高的投影屏幕的一半被恩格尔巴特在台上的现场视频图像占据，另一半被从门洛帕克现场传输的文本占据（这是一份购物清单，包括苹果、橘子、豆汤和法式面包）。几分钟后，屏幕上出现了一个实时视频图像，一只手在桌面上滚动着不寻常的“鼠标”，而叠加的计算机显示器则显示光标如何同时顺从地跟随其路径。</p><p class="para">At one point half of a twenty-foot-tall projection screen was occupied by a live video image of Engelbart on stage, the other half by text transmitted live from Menlo Park (it was a shopping list including apples, oranges, bean soup, and French bread). Minutes later the screen carried a live video image of a hand rolling the unusual “mouse” around a desktop while a superimposed computer display showed how the cursor simultaneously and obediently followed its path.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">压轴大戏</span>是恩格尔巴特对 memex 的实现。屏幕显示了用户如何选择文本文档中的单个单词，并立即转到第二个文档的相关部分——超文本的本质，今天，大约三十年后，在每个万维网页面和无数的文字处理文档中都能找到。在这场精彩的表演结束时，道格·恩格尔巴特，这位之前不光彩的先知，获得了全场起立鼓掌的奖励。</p><p class="para">The <span class="italic">piece de resistance</span> was Engelbart’s implementation of the memex. The screen showed how a user could select a single word in a text document and be instantly transported to the relevant portion of a second document—the essence of hypertext, found today, some thirty years later, on every World Wide Web page and countless word-processed documents. At the conclusion of the bravura performance Doug Engelbart, previously a prophet without honor, was rewarded with a standing ovation.</p>
<p class="para">1971 年，泰勒（他的 ARPA 资金帮助支付了该演示的费用）打算以某种方式将恩格尔巴特的交互式愿景引入 PARC。唯一的问题是如何在不引入道格·恩格尔巴特的情况下做到这一点。问题在于，这位大师的励志梦想与他固执己见和自以为是的性格密不可分。一位崇拜者称他为“圣经中的先知”，他的外貌与这一角色相符。他身材高大，面容嶙峋，眼睛深陷，鼻子像鹰一样，仿佛是从一块古老的花岗岩上雕刻出来的。他说话轻声细语，但固执己见，多年来与不信教者的斗争使他确信自己注定要成为一支忠诚队伍的唯一领导者。</p><p class="para">In 1971 Taylor, whose ARPA funds had helped pay for that demo, was intent on somehow importing Engelbart’s interactive vision into PARC. The only question was how to do it without also importing Doug Engelbart. The problem was that the master’s inspirational dreams were inseparable from his inflexible and self-righteous disposition. One admirer called him “a prophet of biblical dimensions,” a role he fit down to his physical appearance. Tall and craggy, with deepset eyes and a hawklike nose, he might have been carved from a slab of antediluvian granite. Soft-spoken but intransigent, his years of battling unbelievers had convinced him that he was fated to remain the solitary leader of a devoted cadre.</p>
<p class="para">当泰勒准备反击时，这群干部已经表现出了严重不满的迹象。随着他的想法的新鲜感逐渐消退（公平地说，这个过程可能需要几年），一些信徒开始意识到为如此不妥协的老板工作的弊端——尤其是他喜欢发表神谕式的言论，需要一群高级助理定期让其他员工坐下来，解释道格的想法。</p><p class="para">By the time Taylor was poised to strike, that cadre was showing signs of serious discontent. As the novelty of his ideas wore off (to be fair, this was a process that could take several years), some disciples started to discern the drawbacks of working for so uncompromising a boss—particularly one whose tendency to oracular pronouncements required a stratum of top assistants to periodically sit the rest of the staff down and explain what Doug had in mind.</p>
<p class="para">恩格尔巴特自我定义的使命不是生产产品，甚至不是原型；而是对知识的无限探索。因此，他的实验室里似乎没有一个项目会结束。每当有人接近一个里程碑时，他就会突然重新定义它，谴责<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch04.html.page67"></a>实验室需要数月或数年的时间才能完成后续工作。终点线不断后退，就像沙漠海市蜃楼中的绿洲。实验室的一位长期成员说：“我们就像在迷宫中奔跑的老鼠。”</p><p class="para">Engelbart’s self-defined mission was not to produce a product, or even a prototype; it was an open-ended search for knowledge. Consequently, no project in his lab ever seemed to come to an end. Whenever one approached a milestone he would abruptly redefine it, condemning <a></a>the lab to months or years of further work. The finish line was constantly receding, like the oasis in a desert mirage. Said one long-term member of his lab: “We were like rats running in his maze.”</p>
<p class="para">第一个叛逃的是威廉·K·英格利什 (William K. English)，他是一位才华横溢的工程师，几乎从一开始就与恩格尔巴特在一起，于 1962 年加入他，成为他的硬件王牌和全能管家。身材瘦削、深思熟虑的比尔·英格利什 (Bill English) 是 1968 年演示的幕后黑手。他对老板非常忠诚，但对实验室永远无法完成任务感到不满。一些人还认为，他厌倦了恩格尔巴特独享实验室成就功劳的方式。</p><p class="para">The first to defect was William K. English, a brilliant engineer who had been with Engelbart almost from the start, joining him in 1962 as his hardware ace and all-around major-domo. Wiry and deliberative, Bill English had been the invisible guiding hand behind the 1968 demo. He was ferociously loyal to his boss but bridled at the lab’s perpetual lack of closure. Some also believed he was fed up with Engelbart’s way of monopolizing credit for the lab’s accomplishments.</p>
<p class="para">泰勒为英格利希提出了解决这两个问题的方法：在 PARC 复制 NLS 或类似的东西。这样，英格利希就可以实现他珍视的目标，将该系统商业化<span class="italic">，并</span>管理自己的实验室，摆脱恩格尔巴特的阴影。很难说英格利希是否犹豫离开他追随了近十年的领导者，但他继续了泰勒未完成的突袭，最终招募了十几名恩格尔巴特最重要的追随者。</p><p class="para">Taylor offered English a solution to both complaints: reproduce NLS, or something like it, at PARC. English could thus fulfill his treasured goal of bringing the system to commercial fruition <span class="italic">and</span> be in charge of his own lab, out from under the shadow of the implacable Engelbart. Whether English hesitated leaving the leader he had followed for nearly a decade is hard to say, but he continued the raid where Taylor left off, eventually recruiting a dozen of Engelbart’s most important followers.</p>
<p class="para">他们作为一个团队，将恩格尔巴特的原则融入 PARC，就像使徒传播宗教一样。多亏了他们，增强研究中心在接下来十年中几乎在 PARC 出现的每一项重大创新中都留下了不可磨灭的印记。然而，这一胜利并非没有痛苦的讽刺。英格利希重新设计的 NLS 版本是范尼瓦尔·布什的愿景和恩格尔巴特工作的直接产物，它将被人们铭记为 PARC 最大的失败。</p><p class="para">As a team they infused Engelbart’s principles into PARC like apostles spreading religion. Thanks to them, the Augmentation Research Center left its indelible stamp on almost every major innovation to emerge from PARC in the next decade. Yet this triumph was not without its painful ironies. English’s reworked version of NLS, the direct descendant of Vannevar Bush’s vision and Engelbart’s work, would be remembered chiefly as PARC’s biggest failure.</p>
<p class="para">碰巧的是，PARC 的毁灭者是通过鲍勃·泰勒的第二次大劫案来到 PARC 的。泰勒知道，在伯克利，一些非常有才华的工程师即将失去工作。在他看来，没有他们，PARC 几乎无法生存。1970 年底，在乔治·帕克的批准下，他采取了必要的措施来挽回他们。</p><p class="para">The agents of its ruin, as it happened, came to PARC via Bob Taylor’s second great heist. Taylor knew that up in Berkeley a handful of extraordinarily talented engineers were about to lose their jobs. In his view PARC could scarcely exist without them. Toward the end of 1970, with George Pake’s approval, he took the necessary steps to reel them in.</p>

<p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">1968年</span></span>对加州伯克利来说并不平静。当时电报大道上发生骚乱，人民公园发生争斗，州长罗纳德·里根出动国民警卫队。加州大学校园内的建筑被占领、设置路障、遭到燃烧弹袭击。警方在麻痹和过度反应之间摇摆不定。空气中弥漫着混乱和激进主义，催泪瓦斯和直升机投下的神秘白色粉末让示威者的皮肤发痒和灼伤，仿佛遭到黄蜂袭击。</p><p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">T</span></span>he year 1968 was not a tranquil one for Berkeley, California. It was the time of riots on Telegraph Avenue, the battle over People’s Park, and the calling out of the National Guard by Governor Ronald Reagan. Buildings on the University of California campus were occupied, barricaded, firebombed. The police oscillated between paralysis and overreaction. Turmoil and radicalism were in the air, along with tear gas and a mysterious white powder dropped from helicopters that made demonstrators’ skin itch and burn as though attacked by hornets.</p>
<p class="para">伯克利计算机公司的所有者认为保持低调是明智之举。当时的激进团体表现出明显的卢德主义倾向，计算机设施是主要目标——一个反政府组织轰炸了威斯康星大学的陆军数学研究中心，导致一名年轻物理学家丧生。加州大学伯克利分校似乎也面临同样的情况。</p><p class="para">The owners of Berkeley Computer Corporation thought it wise to lay low. Radical groups of the time manifested a distinctly Luddite streak, and computer facilities were prominent targets—witness the bombing by one anti-government group of the Army Mathematics Research Center at the University of Wisconsin, which cost a young physicist his life. UC Berkeley seemed a good bet for much of the same.</p>
<p class="para">因此，伯克利计算机公司在城市中不引人注意地分布在三个不同的地方。一栋楼里住着程序员。还有查克·萨克记得的“一个稍微简陋一点的地方，硬件人员住在那里，基本上就是一座无电梯的大楼。”<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch05.html.page69"></a>第三家是第六大街上一个仓库上方的普通建筑，距离校园几英里，离海滨也不远，他们正在这里制造他们认为可以发财的机器。萨克回忆道：“我们发现了一座混凝土建筑，它是一家仓库的毛皮储藏室，只是仓库的周围被烧毁了。所以这里就是一个街区结构，两层楼，边长约 50 英尺，实际上就是一个巨大的混凝土管道。我们第一次看到这个地方时，里面塞满了两百万个塑料香槟酒瓶塞。”他们清理了瓶塞，把建筑装修得更不起眼后，他说，“你开车经过街上，永远不会知道它是什么。”</p><p class="para">Berkeley Computer therefore inconspicuously spread itself out over the city in three separate locations. One building housed the programmers. Then there was what Chuck Thacker remembered as “a somewhat more shoddy place where the hardware people lived, essentially a walkup <a></a>above a warehouse on Sixth Street.” The third was a nondescript edifice a few blocks further along Sixth, a few miles from the campus and not far from the waterfront, in which they were actually building the machine they thought would make their fortune. Thacker recalled: “We found a concrete building that was the fur storage vault for a warehouse, except the warehouse had burned down around the vault. So here was this block structure, two stories, about fifty feet on a side, just a big concrete tube really. When we first saw the place it was filled with two million plastic champagne corks.” After they cleared out the corks and fitted out the building to be even more nondescript, he said, “You’d drive by on the street and never know what it was.”</p>
<p class="para">在这个平淡无奇的结构里，一些当代最有创造力的计算机设计师在工作。</p><p class="para">Inside this prosaic structure worked some of the most creative computer designers alive.</p>
<p class="para">该团队花了数年时间才组建起来。尽管 BCC 成立于 1968 年，但其根源可以追溯到 Genie 项目，即 ARPA 分时方案，它为 Max Palevsky 的 SDS 设计了 ​​940 计算机。人们甚至可以将该公司的精神诞生追溯到 1964 年的一天，当时一位名叫 Butler Lampson 的研究生穿过伯克利校园一扇没有标记的门，发现 Peter Deutsch 在另一边。</p><p class="para">The team had taken several years to coalesce. Although incorporated in 1968, BCC’s roots reached back to Project Genie, the ARPA time-sharing scheme that designed the 940 computer for Max Palevsky’s SDS. One could even date the company’s spiritual birth to a day in 1964 when a graduate student named Butler Lampson passed through an unmarked door on the Berkeley campus and found Peter Deutsch on the other side.</p>
<p class="para">兰普森的父母都是外交官，他以哈佛大学一流的本科成绩来到伯克利大学学习物理，并以超凡的聪明才智而闻名。他身材瘦削，身高略超过六英尺，步态轻快，使他看起来更高。他的讲话方式敏捷而有说服力，除非他有特别引人注目的想法，在这种情况下，他的思维系统会冲到他的言语过程之前，他会结结巴巴地说，直到他的嘴巴跟上他的大脑。当所有的输入和输出都同步时，他的思维似乎比其他人快一千倍。（“我们现在可以认识到，在口头讨论中，理论上的速度极限是兰普森<span class="italic">，</span> ”几年后，韦斯·克拉克在一次专业会议上发表了一次他一贯的快速演讲后，他开玩笑地说。）</p><p class="para">The son of foreign service parents, Lampson had come to study physics at Berkeley with a first-class undergraduate pedigree from Harvard and a reputation for being preternaturally smart. He was rail-thin and stood a little over six feet, with a loping gait that made him seem taller. His manner of speaking was fleet but cogent, unless he was in the grip of some particularly compelling idea, in which case his thought system would rush ahead of his speech processes and he would stumble over his words until his mouth caught up to his brain. When all the inputs and outputs were synchronized, it often seemed as if his mind worked about a thousand times faster than anyone else’s. (“We can now appreciate that in spoken discourse the theoretical speed limit is the <span class="italic">Lampson</span>,” Wes Clark famously cracked at a professional conference a few years later following one of his customarily breakneck presentations.)</p>
<p class="para">尽管巴特勒·兰普森很聪明，但他还是对伯克利物理的挑战有些畏惧。后来他声称自己转学计算机科学是因为它“不像物理那么难”，但他<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch05.html.page70"></a>这与普通人的想法大相径庭。他的意思是，他发现，推动历史上最伟大的智者们已经研究了 300 年的科学，这项任务从根本上来说毫无趣味。尤其是当一个全新的领域向他招手时，在这个领域，每一项新发现都代表着人类启蒙的巨大飞跃。因此，当他在旧金山的一次计算机会议上遇到一位朋友，问他海湾对岸的 Genie 项目进展如何时，他做好了迎接挑战的准备。</p><p class="para">Sharp as he was, however, even Butler Lampson was a little daunted by the challenge of physics at Berkeley. Later he claimed that he transferred into computer science because it was “not as hard” as physics, but he <a></a>scarcely meant it the way normal persons do. He meant he found the task of advancing a science that history’s greatest intellects had been mining for 300 years fundamentally uninteresting. Especially when a brand-new field beckoned in which every new discovery represented a terrific leap forward in human enlightenment. So he was primed for the challenge when a friend he ran into at a computer conference in San Francisco asked how things were going across the bay with Project Genie.</p>
<p class="para">兰普森茫然地回了个眼神。“我从未听说过，”他承认道。他离开聚会时描述了一项有趣的计算机架构研究，并告诉大家去伯克利校园东北角一栋建筑的路线。几天后，他发现自己站在科里楼的一楼，面对着一扇没有标记的门。</p><p class="para">Lampson returned a blank look. “I’ve never heard of it,” he admitted. He left the party with a description of an intriguing study of computer architectures, along with directions to a building located at the far northeast corner of the Berkeley campus. A few days later he found himself standing on the ground floor of Cory Hall, facing an unmarked door.</p>
<p class="para">即使在 1964 年，我们也很难指责 Genie 团队的谨慎；该项目由国防部资助。另一方面，即使在伯克利，偏执也是有限度的。没有标记的门没有锁。兰普森推开门走了进去。</p><p class="para">Even in 1964 one could hardly fault the Genie people for their circumspection; the project was funded by the Defense Department. On the other hand there was a limit to paranoia, even at Berkeley. The unmarked door was unlocked. Lampson pushed it open and walked in.</p>
<p class="para">他仿佛走进了白兔的巢穴。那是一个大房间，大部分是空的。一侧放着一台 Bendix LGP30 计算机，这是一台巨大而过时的数字机器，他看不出有什么用处。面对着 Bendix 的是一台小得多的 Scientific Data Systems 930，这是一台相当新式的坚固耐用的计算机。在 930 旁边的转椅上坐着一个矮胖、赤脚的人，他有一头浓密的黑发和浓密的胡须，正平静地将纸带送入计算机输入端。纸带不是很长，兰普森看着陌生人把它完全送进去，然后，奇怪的是，又把它拿出来，又送回去。</p><p class="para">He might have stepped into the lair of the White Rabbit. It was a big room, mostly empty. On one side stood a Bendix LGP30 computer, a massive and obsolete digital machine serving no purpose he could discern. Facing the Bendix was a much smaller Scientific Data Systems 930, a rugged computer of fairly recent vintage. In a swivel chair parked by the 930 sat a short, pudgy, barefooted human being with a mane of black hair and a dense beard, serenely feeding a paper tape into a computer input. The paper tape was not very long and Lampson watched as the stranger fed it in all the way and then, oddly, took it out and fed it back in again.</p>
<p class="para">兰普森再也无法抑制自己的好奇心。“这太奇怪了，”他说。“你为什么要这么做？”</p><p class="para">Lampson could no longer stifle his curiosity. “That’s weird,” he said. “Why did you just do that?”</p>
<p class="para">“这是一台双程可移动式装载机！”那人头也不抬地说道。</p><p class="para">“It’s a two-pass relocatable loader!” the man said without looking up.</p>
<p class="para">“但这太荒谬了！”</p><p class="para">“But that’s ridiculous!”</p>
<p class="para">“我知道！我知道！”他不耐烦地回答道。“我正在重写！”</p><p class="para">“I know! I know!” was the impatient reply. “I’m rewriting it!”</p>
<p class="para">在外人看来，这段对话可能听起来像是荒诞派戏剧中的情节。但作为同一种技术语言的使用者，两人彼此理解得就像共济会神秘学的同道中人一样清楚。双程可重定位装载机确实存在，而且它<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch05.html.page71"></a>是一个临时拼凑物：一个效率低下、过于繁琐的机器，机器制造商设计不当。它确实需要程序员连续两次输入纸带，因为每次输入时计算机只能收集到其运行所需信息的一半。</p><p class="para">To an outsider the conversation might have sounded like something out of the Theatre of the Absurd. But as speakers of a shared technical language, the two men understood each other as clearly as fellow initiates to the Masonic mysteries. The two-pass relocatable loader did exist and it <a></a>was a kludge: an inefficient, overelaborated piece of machinery that had been poorly designed by the machine’s manufacturer. And it did require the programmer to input a paper tape twice in succession because on each sequence the computer could only glean half the information it needed to function.</p>
<p class="para">兰普森意识到这个系统浪费时间和精力，一眼就看出控制台旁的那个人拥有重新设计系统的天赋，因此这台该死的机器实际上会学到一些新东西，比如如何在磁带上一次读取所有必要的数据。他的名字叫彼得·多伊奇。在接下来的二十年里，他和兰普森并肩工作。</p><p class="para">Lampson recognized the system as a waste of time and energy and appreciated at a glance that the man at the console possessed the inborn skill to redesign it so the damn machine would actually learn something new, like how to absorb all the necessary data on a single pass of the tape. His name was Peter Deutsch. He and Lampson would work side by side for the better part of the next twenty years.</p>
<p class="para">他们是一对不太可能的搭档，也是后来赋予 PARC 独特个性的众多搭档之一。兰普森的贵族气质给人的印象是，他正站在一个隐喻性的高度思考科学。德意志就像一场白色的龙卷风，急不可耐，永远急于着手下一个神秘的编程任务。兰普森的头脑掌握概念和原理的速度很快，但在与周围的人互动时（通常试图说服他们他是对的），他的思维速度更快。德意志似乎更喜欢在与自己的交流中解开计算机编程的谜题。</p><p class="para">They were an unlikely pair, one of many that would later give PARC its unique character. Lampson’s patrician bearing left people with the impression that he was contemplating science from a great metaphorical height. Deutsch was a white tornado, impatient, perpetually chafing to get his hands on the next arcane programming task. As fast as Lampson’s mind grasped concepts and principles, it worked faster when interacting with the people around him (usually attempting to convince them he was right). Deutsch seemed to prefer unraveling the riddles of computer programming in communion with himself.</p>
<p class="para">天才多伊奇的标志性形象是一张他青春期前的照片。照片中，他正坐在一把垫着坐垫或电话簿的椅子上，为世界上第一台小型计算机（数字设备公司的 PDP-1）编写程序，以便能够到键盘。那时，他已经是计算机编程这门神秘艺术的大师了。他从 12 岁开始学习这门艺术，当时他的父亲是麻省理工学院的物理学家，带回家一本校园 Univac 1 的手册。</p><p class="para">The emblematic image of the gifted Deutsch was a photograph taken of him as a preadolescent. It showed him writing a program for the world’s first minicomputer, a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-1, perched on a chair padded with a cushion or phone book so he could reach the keyboard. By then he was already a master of the occult art of computer programming, which he began to learn at the age of twelve when his father, an MIT physicist, brought home a manual for the campus Univac 1.</p>
<p class="para">该手册涵盖了 Univac 的汇编代码，这是一种符号语句系统，工程师将其用作编写机器程序的构建块。“不知怎么的，它激发了我的兴趣，”Deutsch 回忆道。“我说我想见见编写该手册的人，我父亲安排了这件事。他是一个名叫 Lanza 的人，他实际上找到了一个需要编码的小型计算程序，并问我是否愿意这样做。我说当然可以。我仍然不知道专业人士<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch05.html.page72"></a>gram 计算，他是否相信他从中得到的答案，或者有关它的任何其他东西。”</p><p class="para">The manual covered the Univac’s assembly code, a system of symbolic statements which engineers used as building blocks to write programs for the machine. “Somehow it struck a spark,” Deutsch remembered. “I said I wanted to meet the person who wrote that manual and my father arranged it. He was a person named Lanza, and he actually found a small computational program that needed coding and asked if I wanted to do it. I said sure. I still don’t know what the pro<a></a>gram computed, whether he trusted the answers he got out of it, or anything else about it.”</p>
<p class="para">但他开始与 Univac 以及他父亲的关系使他能够接触到的其他大型计算机打交道。计算机中心的研究生程序员已经习惯了（尽管不一定有耐心）这个小个子向他们提出关于他们工作的无礼问题。他们中比较聪明的人甚至可能已经意识到，不久之后<span class="italic">他们就会向</span><span class="italic">他</span>提问。</p><p class="para">But it started him hanging around the Univac, as well as other mainframe computers to which his father’s connections got him access. The grad student programmers in the computer center became accustomed to (if not necessarily patient with) this diminutive soul peppering them with impertinent questions about their work. The wiser among them may even have realized that it would not be long before <span class="italic">they</span> were asking <span class="italic">him</span> questions.</p>
<p class="para">很快，他就开始向主管讨要半小时的空闲时间，但他明白，如果有人来认真工作，他就会遭到拒绝。当大学获得 PDP-1 时，他已经成长为一名熟练、灵巧的程序员，拥有艺术家的天赋。在他搬到伯克利接受本科教育后，他仍然会在假期时不时地到麻省理工学院看望父亲，匆匆写几行代码。学生们会翻遍废纸篓，阅读他丢弃的东西，希望能从他创造性的技术中吸取一丝痕迹。</p><p class="para">Soon he was cadging stray time in half-hour segments from the supervisors with the understanding that if anyone came along with serious work, he would get bumped. By the time the university acquired its PDP-1, he had matured into an adept and dexterous programmer with the instincts of an artist. After he moved to Berkeley for his undergraduate education, he would still drop in at MIT now and then during vacations to visit his father and dash off a few lines of code. Students would literally ransack the wastebaskets to read what he had discarded with the hope of absorbing a trace of his inventive technique.</p>
<p class="para">当时还是伯克利大学新生的 Deutsch 刚参与 Genie 项目几个月，就遇到了 Butler Lampson。他解释说，Genie 的目标是将 SDS 930 改造成一台小型分时机，它由电气工程系的 David Evans 和 Mel Pirtle 负责——前者是一位谦逊的计算机科学教授，他尽可能将自己的工作限制在从政府筹集资助等任务上，后者是一位健谈的加州研究生，负责设计硬件。</p><p class="para">Still a Berkeley freshman, Deutsch had been involved with Genie only a few months when he was encountered by Butler Lampson. He explained that Genie’s goal was to refashion the SDS 930 into a small-scale time-sharing machine and that it was run out of the electrical engineering department by David Evans and Mel Pirtle—the first an unassuming computer science professor who limited himself as much as possible to such tasks as raising grant money from the government, the second a garrulous Californian graduate student who designed the hardware.</p>
<p class="para">兰普森对大学校园这个偏僻角落有着难以抗拒的吸引力。“我从彼得那里了解到了正在发生的事情，然后我开始经常在那里闲逛，”他回忆道。“过了一段时间，我清楚地意识到，这比物理学有趣得多。”</p><p class="para">Lampson felt irresistibly drawn to this remote corner of the university campus. “I found out from Peter what was going on, then I started to hang around there a lot,” he recalled. “After a while it became clear that this was going to be a lot more interesting than physics.”</p>
<p class="para">有了兰普森的加入，Genie 的发展势头强劲。团队拆开了 SDS 930，安装了新硬件，编写了一个全新的操作系统。“这个项目没有什么特别新颖的想法，”兰普森后来说道。“重点是尝试采纳其他人的想法<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch05.html.page73"></a>人们已经实现了这些想法，其中一些已经在其他机器上实现，并展示了如何在一个不那么宏大的环境中使它们全部工作。” Genie 实现了它的目标，即将分时技术带给大众，方法是将其实现在一台小型机器上，最终 Taylor 和 Currie 诱骗 Palevsky 将其作为 SDS 940 进行营销。</p><p class="para">With Lampson on board, Genie picked up momentum. The group tore apart the SDS 930, tacked on new hardware, and wrote an entirely new operating system. “There weren’t any spectacularly new ideas in the project,” Lampson said later. “The point was to try to take ideas that other <a></a>people had, some of which had been implemented on other machines, and show you could make it all work in a much less grandiose environment.” Genie accomplished its goal, which was to bring time-sharing to the masses by implementing it on the small machine that Taylor and Currie eventually beguiled Palevsky into marketing as the SDS 940.</p>
<p class="para">Genie 团队随后开始思考一个永恒的问题：如何再接再厉。他们是一群才华横溢的人才，尤其是在 Deutsch 和 Lampson（他们在该领域中设计和调试操作系统的能力无人可比）与 Chuck Thacker 联手之后，可以说，Chuck Thacker 的硬件技能代表了一个非常坚固的三角形的第三边。</p><p class="para">The Genie team then turned to the eternal question of what to do for an encore. They were a powerful group of talents, especially after Deutsch and Lampson, as good at designing and debugging operating systems as anyone in the field, were joined by Chuck Thacker, whose hardware skills represented the third side, so to speak, of a very sturdy triangle.</p>
<p class="para">萨克出生在洛杉矶郊区，家境贫寒，没有父亲。他靠在当地小型工程店打工来支付学费，其中一家工厂生产原子弹爆炸后民防部队用来测量地面辐射的设备。（毕竟那是 20 世纪 50 年代。）他一直是电子迷——他还记得自己在学生时代拥有第一个晶体管的那一天——但正是从这些穿着衬衫的店员那里，他学会了如何将一个不错的设计精简为可制造的设计，将其精简到最朴素的本质。“他们是真正的工程师中的工程师，”他说。</p><p class="para">Growing up poor and fatherless in a suburb of Los Angeles, Thacker had paid his way through school with a succession of jobs at small local engineering shops, including one that made the devices Civil Defense would use to measure ground radiation after the Bomb dropped. (This was the 1950s, after all.) He had always been an electronics nut—he could still remember the day he acquired his very first transistor as a schoolboy—but it was from these shirt-sleeved shop men that he learned to pare a decent design into a manufacturable one by stripping it down to its frugal essence. “They were the real engineer’s engineers,” he said.</p>
<p class="para">在加州理工学院，他曾短暂尝试过获得学士学位，但未能成功。那里的物理学分为两个不同的部分。一部分是理论部分，涉及大量数学和宇宙学推测；另一部分是萨克所说的“巨型玩具部分”，涉及建造巨大的、精心设计的结构，如同步加速器和回旋加速器。这是他最喜欢的部分。</p><p class="para">At Caltech, where he made a short and unsuccessful first run at obtaining a bachelor’s degree, physics was divided into two distinct parts. There was the theory side, which involved a lot of math and cosmological speculation, and what Thacker called “the giant tinker toy side,” which involved building immense, elaborately engineered structures like synchrotrons and cyclotrons. That was the part he loved.</p>
<p class="para">事实上，萨克对小玩意的热爱与无数像他一样的物理学家对计算机的热爱如出一辙。当他北上伯克利，远离洛杉矶的雾霾，重新开始他摇摇欲坠的学术生涯时，他融入了计算机界，这一过程让他无可避免地找到了几个月前兰普森发现的那扇没有标记的门。</p><p class="para">In fact, Thacker was animated by the same love of gadgetry that lured countless other physicists like himself into computing. When he moved north to Berkeley to get away from the L.A. smog and give his faltering academic career a fresh start, he fell in among the computing crowd, a course that led him inexorably to the same unmarked door Lampson had discovered a few months earlier.</p>
<p class="para">现在是 1968 年。940 的研发工作已经结束，Dave Evans 搬到了犹他大学，留下 Pirtle 和其他人<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch05.html.page74"></a>想象一下在比 940 大得多的画布上工作——例如，一个分时系统，一次可以为 500 个用户提供服务，而不是十几个。他们设想一台机器有多个处理器，每个处理器分配一个特定的任务，所有处理器都相互连接，就像交配章鱼的触手一样。它规模庞大、令人兴奋、富有创新性，而且设想不是学术或政府资助的项目，而是严格的商业项目。伯克利计算机公司就这样诞生了。</p><p class="para">Now it was 1968. Work on the 940 had ended and Dave Evans had relocated to the University of Utah, leaving Pirtle and the others to <a></a>think about working on a much larger canvas than the 940—a time-sharing system, for example, that would serve not a dozen but 500 users at a time. They imagined a machine with several processors, each assigned a specific task and all interconnected, like the tentacles of mating octopuses. It was huge, exciting, innovative, and envisioned not as an academic or government-funded venture, but strictly as a commercial one. Thus was Berkeley Computer Corporation born.</p>
<p class="para">尽管 BCC 是基于投机技术，但乍一看，其财务结构似乎更为稳固。皮尔特尔通过华尔街关系，从一家名为 Data Processing Financial and General 的公司获得了 200 万美元的融资，由顶级投资公司 White, Weld &amp; Co. 承销。这听起来很多，但这只是种子资金。该团队认为，将 Berkeley 1 计算机推向市场将花费这笔资金的数倍，这意味着他们必须非常熟悉银行家的要求和高级金融的复杂性。</p><p class="para">Although BCC was based on speculative technology, its financial structure appeared at first glance to be made of sterner stuff. Pirtle had arranged through his Wall Street connections to secure $2 million in financing from a company called Data Processing Financial and General, underwritten by the white-shoe investment firm of White, Weld &amp; Co. That sounded like plenty, but it was only seed money. The team figured that bringing the Berkeley 1 computer to market would consume that sum many times over, which meant they would have to become very familiar with the demands of bankers and the intricacies of high finance.</p>
<p class="para">“这绝对不是那种两个人在车库里创办的创业公司，”兰普森说，他现在在伯克利担任教职，并以联合创始人的身份出现。然而，这是一件风险极大的事情。BCC 的先驱们即将成为“第二系统效应”的受害者。</p><p class="para">“This was definitely not your two-guys-in-a-garage startup,” said Lampson, who by now held a faculty appointment at Berkeley and set his own name down as a co-founder. It was, however, something infinitely more risky. The BCC pioneers were about to become victims of the “second-system effect.”</p>
<p class="para">第二系统理论是由 IBM 的一位高管弗雷德里克·布鲁克斯 (Frederick Brooks) 提出的，他在管理大型软件团队的职业生涯中了解到，计算机系统设计师往往会将他们最喜欢的功能都融入到他们的第二个项目中，而这些功能由于资金紧张或期限紧迫而被迫从第一个项目中剔除。结果是一个过度生长、效率低下的怪物，很少能按预期工作。正如他在其精辟的杰作《<span class="italic">人月神话》</span>中所说：“第二个系统是人类设计的最危险的系统。”</p><p class="para">The theory of second systems was formulated by an IBM executive named Frederick Brooks, whose career supervising large-scale software teams taught him that designers of computer systems tend to build into their second projects all the pet features that tight finances or short deadlines forced them to leave out of their first. The result is an overgrown, inefficient monstrosity that rarely works as expected. As he put it in his pithy masterpiece, <span class="italic">The Mythical Man-Month</span>: “The second is the most dangerous system a man ever designs.”</p>
<p class="para">BCC 机器可能完全从布鲁克斯的文本中诞生。正如兰普森回忆的那样，经济实用的 SDS 940 的设计者将他们的下一台机器视为一个机会，“看看所有你可以做得更精彩的东西，并计划通过创建一个可以<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch05.html.page75"></a>可以处理更多用户和更大型的程序，速度更快，计算资源利用效率更高，在各个方面都更优秀、更出色。</p><p class="para">The BCC machine could have sprung full-blown from the pages of Brooks’s text. As Lampson recalled, the designers of the economical and practical SDS 940 regarded their next machine as an opportunity to “look at all the things you could make much more wonderful, and plan to make them all more wonderful by creating a system that could <a></a>handle a lot more users and much larger programs and was much faster and used computing resources much more efficiently and was better and more wonderful in every possible way.</p>
<p class="para">“这不是一个很现实的计划，”他承认。“但当时看起来很棒，这是下一步的正确选择，第二个系统通常都是这样做的。”</p><p class="para">“It was not a very realistic enterprise,” he acknowledged. “But at the time it seemed great, the proper next step, as second systems often do.”</p>
<p class="para">他们的热情让伯克利计算机公司成为一个令人愉快的工作场所，这里的科学家和工程师们被纯粹的狂妄自大所驱使，工作时间之长在硅谷成为陈词滥调——15 年后，硅谷开始崭露头角。他们相信自己在计算机设计方面开辟了新天地，而且他们说对了。除其他外，他们的机器还采用了“虚拟内存”，这是一种将作业从磁盘交换到内存并再交换回来的系统，这使它能够容纳比其物理规格更多的活动，就像一栋房子，外部尺寸是平房，但内部平面图却是一座皇家宫殿。</p><p class="para">Their exuberance made Berkeley Computer, by all accounts, a jolly place to work, its scientists and engineers propelled by pure hubris into working the kind of inhuman hours that would become a Silicon Valley cliché—when Silicon Valley came into its own fifteen years later. They believed they were breaking new ground in computer design, and they were right. Among other things, their machine incorporated “virtual memory,” a system for swapping jobs from disk to memory and back again that enabled it to accommodate much more activity than its physical specifications otherwise would, like a house with the exterior dimensions of a bungalow but the interior floor plan of a regal palace.</p>
<p class="para">然而，从硬件角度来看，这台机器简直就是一头猛兽。“这台机器由多个专用处理器组成，一个用于处理磁盘和鼓式输入/输出系统，一个用于处理通信，一个用于处理作业调度，”设计它们的 Thacker 回忆道。“这些东西与两个稍大一些的处理器协作，这两个处理器是机器的中央处理器，实际上负责运行用户作业。”所有处理器都必须物理连接在一起，还要连接到内存，这就需要在八个六英尺高的装满设备的柜子之间蜿蜒几英里的电缆，然后连接到电传打字机和行式打印机等外围设备。</p><p class="para">In hardware terms, however, the machine was a beast. “The machine consisted of a number of specialized processors, one to handle the disk and drum input/output system, one to handle communications, and one to handle job scheduling,” recalled Thacker, who designed them. “And these things cooperated with two processors which were somewhat larger, which were the central processors for the machine which actually ran the user jobs.” The processors all had to be physically connected to each other and also to the memory, which required a couple of miles of cable snaking among eight six-foot-tall cabinets full of equipment, and then out to peripherals such as teletypes and line printers.</p>
<p class="para">包括萨克在内的一些工人很早就察觉到项目正在失控。这位工程师的工程师具有独特的特点，他的目标是在他的系统中少一些，而不是多一些。“对于一名工程师来说，这太不寻常了，”查尔斯·西蒙尼回忆道，他是一位来自共产主义匈牙利的年轻移民，曾协助萨克，看着他整夜不停地抽烟，设计机器的逻辑。“他用这个词来形容正在发生的事情。他称之为‘大而无当’。我从他那里听到了这个词，我的英语不是很好，我总是觉得它听起来有点下流，因为他会说，‘这个项目被扩大了。’”</p><p class="para">Some of the workers, including Thacker, could tell early on that the project was getting out of hand. The engineer’s engineer possessed the unique trait of aiming for less, not more, in his systems. “This was so unusual for an engineer,” recalled Charles Simonyi, a young immigrant from communist Hungary who assisted Thacker, watching as he chain-smoked through the night designing the machine’s logic. “He had this word for what was happening. He called it ‘biggerism.’ I heard this word from him and my English was not that good and I always thought it sounded slightly obscene, because he’d say, you know, ‘This project has been biggered.’”</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch05.html.page76"></a>
<p class="para">更难的是，硬件由古老和现代组件组成的笨重组合。处理器采用一种全新的、远非完美无缺的技术，即 TTL（“晶体管-晶体管逻辑”）构建而成。但只读存储器（它承载着机器的基本操作代码）是焊接在 20 块电路板上的二极管阵列——数十万个微型二极管，每个二极管代表一个数字位。西蒙尼回忆说，在调试阶段编辑操作代码意味着在一平方英尺的电路板上找到错误的二极管，用模切机手工将其剪下，然后钻新孔并将新二极管焊接到位。这就像用锤子和凿子编辑文本一样。</p><p class="para">Adding to the challenge, the hardware comprised an unwieldy mix of ancient and modern components. The processors were built using a brand-new, and far from bug-free, technology known as TTL (for “transistor-transistor logic”). But the read-only memory, which carried the machine’s basic operating code, was an array of diodes soldered onto some 20 circuit boards—hundreds of thousands of tiny diodes each representing a digital bit. Editing the operating code during the debugging phase, Simonyi recalled, meant finding the errant diode on a foot-square circuit board, clipping it by hand with a die cutter, then drilling new holes and soldering a fresh diode in place. It was like editing text with a hammer and chisel.</p>
<p class="para">在设计操作系统时出现了更多问题。在计算领域，规模经济通常起着相反的作用：随着系统规模的扩大，系统变得越来越复杂。设计用于服务 50 个用户的计算机并不比 5 个用户的计算机复杂 10 倍，而是 100 倍或 1000 倍。事实证明，伯克利的 500 个用户计算机比这个才华横溢的团队所能处理的还要复杂。正如弗雷德里克·布鲁克斯所预料的那样，当他们最终让它工作时，它并不完美——而且永远无法达到 500 个用户的额定容量。</p><p class="para">More problems cropped up in designing the operating system. In computing, economies of scale often work in reverse: As a system grows larger it becomes exponentially more complicated. A computer designed to serve fifty users is not ten times more complicated than a machine for five users, but one hundred times, or a thousand. Berkeley’s 500-user machine proved more complex than even this exquisitely talented team could handle. As Frederick Brooks would have predicted, when they finally got it working it did not work perfectly—and never well enough for the rated capacity of 500 users.</p>
<p class="para">然而，在公司生命周期的后期，预期的全面崩盘才出现。在头一两年，BCC 的命运就像一条上升的弧线。公司将员工人数增加到 100 多名硬件和软件工程师。原型机的名称从 Berkeley 1 升级为 Berkeley 500，以更好地表达他们对其容量的信心（正如 Lampson 所说，“出于营销目的”）</p><p class="para">The full-bore crash of expectations, however, came late in the company’s life cycle. For the first year or two BCC’s fortunes resembled the rising curve of an arc. The company ramped up employment to more than 100 hardware and software engineers. The prototype’s name got upgraded from the Berkeley 1 to the Berkeley 500, the better to express their confidence in its capacity (and, as Lampson said, “for marketing purposes”)</p>
<p class="para">皮尔特尔巧妙地压制了人们对该项目的任何疑虑。一位名叫埃德·菲亚拉的应聘者来自波士顿工程公司 Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman 的工程师，在决定是否接受这份工作之前，他采取了预防措施，订购了邓白氏信用报告，了解 BCC 的情况。菲亚拉回忆道：“报告上说，‘嗯，他们付了账单，但我们不知道他们具体是怎么付的。’”他抑制住了疑虑，还是搬到了伯克利，到达的那天晚上，BCC 正在举行盛大的聚会。</p><p class="para">Pirtle had an artful way of squelching any doubts that might arise about the program. One recruit, an engineer named Ed Fiala who came from the Boston engineering firm of Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman, had taken the precaution of ordering a Dun &amp; Bradstreet credit report on BCC before deciding whether to accept the job. “It said, ‘Well, they’re paying their bills but we don’t exactly know how,’” Fiala recalled. He stifled his misgivings and moved to Berkeley anyway, arriving on a night when BCC was having a big party.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch05.html.page77"></a>
<p class="para">“每个人都面带微笑，热情洋溢，我问梅尔·皮尔特尔公司的情况怎么样，”菲亚拉回忆道。“他说，‘我们做得很好！’我有点担心。我问，‘你们的融资情况怎么样？’他说，‘哦，我们有很多。我们刚刚拿到了三十万美元。’我问这笔钱能维持多久，他说，‘六个星期。’”</p><p class="para">“Everybody was all smiles and enthusiasm, and I asked Mel Pirtle how the company was doing,” Fiala recalled. “He said, ‘We’re doing great!’ I was a little concerned. I asked, ‘What sort of financing do you have?’ He said, ‘Oh, we have lots. We just got three hundred thousand dollars.’ And I asked how long that would last and he said, ‘Six weeks.’</p>
<p class="para">“现在，三十万美元对我来说听起来是一大笔钱，但六周似乎并不长。所以我说，‘这难道不是比你完成项目所需的时间要少得多吗？’他说，‘嗯，是的……但我们总能得到更多的钱。’”</p><p class="para">“Now, three hundred thousand dollars sounded like a lot of money to me but the six weeks didn’t seem all that long. So I said, ‘Isn’t that a lot less time than it’s going to take you to complete your project?’ He said, ‘Well, yes…but we can always get more money.’”</p>
<p class="para">一段时间内确实如此。参观 BCC 总部的支持者们无一例外地被员工们的热情所打动，认为一切都在步入正轨。（“我知道我试图表现出热情，”菲亚拉说。）但在 1970 年，这种热情枯竭了。不仅经济衰退加剧，而且 BCC 和其他分时公司如此轻率地应对的技术风险比任何人预期的都要严重。人们开始质疑这台机器是否会完工，如果完工谁会购买它。皮尔特开始削减员工。年初，他给留下的员工发放了半薪，并建议所有人去找工作。</p><p class="para">For a while that was true. Backers touring the BCC quarters invariably came away convinced by the staff’s high spirits that everything was on track. (“I know I tried to look enthusiastic,” Fiala said.) But in 1970 the well ran dry. Not only had the recession dug in, but the technological risks confronted so cavalierly by BCC and other time-sharing companies turned out to be tougher than anyone expected. There were new questions about whether the machine would ever get done, and who would buy it if it did. Pirtle started to pare staff. Early in the year he placed those who were left on half salary and advised everyone to look for work.</p>
<p class="para">那时，鲍勃·泰勒 (Bob Taylor) 首次出现在公司。在年轻的程序员眼中，他是一个相当有趣的人物，一个整洁、自信的人，皮尔特和兰普森似乎对他抱有不同寻常的敬意，甚至是顺从。“我不知道该如何看待他，”西蒙尼说，他当时还是一名文化上无知的人，在伯克利大学读本科，同时在 BCC 做兼职，勉强糊口。“我印象中他是一个悠闲的花花公子类型，休·海夫纳 (Hugh Hefner) 类型，长得帅，穿着得体，运动型，当然，总是拿着烟斗。泰勒从来没有假装技术 BS 艺术家的架子。他没有这种架子是个优点，但同时我不得不问自己：‘如果他不是技术人员，不是技术 BS'er，那他到底是什么？’”</p><p class="para">Around then Bob Taylor made his first appearance on the premises. To the younger programmers he cut quite the intriguing figure, a natty, self-assured individual to whom Pirtle and Lampson seemed to pay an unusual degree of respect—even deference. “I didn’t know what to make of him,” said Simonyi, still a cultural innocent living hand-to-mouth as a Berkeley undergraduate while working part-time at BCC. “I had this impression of a laid-back Playboy type, a Hugh Hefner type, good looking, good dresser, athletic, with the pipe of course, always with the pipe. Taylor never had the airs of the false technical B.S. artist. It was a plus that he didn’t, but at the same time I had to ask myself: ‘If he’s not technical, not a technical B.S.’er, then what the hell is he?’”</p>
<p class="para">答案是：一个积极追求交易的人。在向佩克通报 BCC 的财务问题以及一流人才进入市场的可能性后，他最初的想法是让施乐公司直接收购 BCC，并将其整体并入 PARC，就像将新鲜鸡蛋放入生鸡蛋中一样。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch05.html.page78"></a>电池。这样，PARC 将获得一个先进的分时原型，以及至少 20 名顶尖人才和大量初级员工。与 Pirtle 的谈判一直持续到秋季。</p><p class="para">The answer was: A man energetically pursuing a deal. Having alerted Pake to BCC’s financial problems and the likelihood of a rare cache of first-rank talent hitting the market, his initial idea was for Xerox to buy BCC outright and fold it whole into PARC, like a fresh egg into raw <a></a>batter. That way PARC would acquire an advanced time-sharing prototype along with at least twenty top people and a sizable complement of junior staff. Negotiations with Pirtle along those lines proceeded into the fall.</p>
<p class="para">但无论是因为皮尔特报价过高还是 BCC 失败得太快，批发交易都以某种<span class="italic">点菜</span>方式告终。就在 BCC 申请破产时（1970 年 11 月 13 日星期五，最后一次醉酒聚会耗尽了它最后的零用钱），PARC 聘请了六名最优秀的员工——兰普森、萨克、德意志、菲亚拉、一位名叫理查德·舒普的硬件设计师和一位名叫吉姆·米切尔的软件程序员。皮尔特对此不感兴趣。相反，他接管了一项庞大的政府项目的管理，该项目将在邻近山景城的 NASA 艾姆斯研究中心建造世界上第一台并行架构超级计算机 Illiac IV（尽管有些人认为真正的原因是他知道他永远不会和泰勒相处融洽）。西蒙尼暂时跟随他。</p><p class="para">But whether because Pirtle quoted too high a price or BCC failed too rapidly, the wholesale deal collapsed in favor of a sort of <span class="italic">à la carte</span> arrangement. Just as BCC filed for bankruptcy (one final drunken party on Friday, November 13, 1970, drained the last of its petty cash), PARC hired six of its best people—Lampson, Thacker, Deutsch, Fiala, a hardware designer named Richard Shoup, and a software programmer named Jim Mitchell. Pirtle was not interested in coming along. Instead he took over the management of a colossal government project to build the world’s first parallel-architecture supercomputer, the Illiac IV, at NASA’s Ames Research Center in neighboring Mountain View (although some thought that the real reason was that he knew he would never get along with Taylor). Simonyi went with him, for the moment.</p>
<p class="para">伯克利 500 是有史以来唯一一台此类计算机，它由 ARPA 在泰勒的建议下购买，并运往夏威夷大学，以便该机构加入 ARPANET。伯克利计算机的最后几名员工在第六大街的宽敞建筑中将其安装并运行起来，然后怀着苦乐参半的心情看着它被装箱。“这是一个非常复杂和有趣的项目，”菲亚拉后来若有所思地说。“花五年时间研究它一定很有趣。”</p><p class="para">The Berkeley 500, the only machine of its kind ever built, was purchased by ARPA on Taylor’s recommendation and shipped to the University of Hawaii to allow that institution to join the ARPANET. The last employees of Berkeley Computer got it up and running in the cavernous building on Sixth Street, then watched with bittersweet emotions as it got crated up. “It was a very complex and interesting project,” Fiala mused later. “It would have been fun to work on it for five years.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">几乎是一举两得，泰勒就几乎组建了自己的团队。他拥有最优秀的硬件专家（萨克）、最优秀的操作系统设计师（兰普森），以及一整支计算机科学天才团队。PARC 只缺少一样东西：哲学家。</p><p class="para">Virtually at a single stroke, Taylor had completed his team—almost. He had the best hardware man (Thacker), the best designer of operating systems (Lampson), and an entire cell of other computer science prodigies. PARC was missing only one thing: a philosopher.</p>
<p class="para">因为仍然存在一个障碍，那就是在国内顶尖的计算机专家中，包括现在受他雇佣的专家，很少有人同意他的观点，即计算机设计的目标是创造一台通过高性能显示器与用户互动的个人机器。BCC 小组深深植根于分时文化，仍然致力于让尽可能多的用户使用一台机器，就像技术一样<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch05.html.page79"></a>从逻辑上讲，这是不可能的。正如韦斯·克拉克所言，这一目标与赋予个人交互所需的速度和响应能力不相容。当泰勒试图阐明他关于基于显示的用户界面的概念时，他们不予理睬。近两年来，他们都没有接受他的观点。</p><p class="para">For there was still the obstacle that among the leading computer experts in the country, including those now on his payroll, very few agreed with him that the goal of computer design was to create a personal machine that interacted with the user via a high-powered display. The BCC group, deeply rooted in the culture of time-sharing, was still intent on getting as many users hooked into a single machine as tech<a></a>nologically possible. That goal, as Wes Clark contended, remained incompatible with giving the individual the kind of speed and responsiveness that interactivity required. When Taylor tried to explicate his notion of a display-based user interface, they tuned him out. They would not come around to his point of view for nearly two years.</p>
<p class="para">但有一个人走在了所有人的前面。这个人于 1969 年在犹他州撰写了一篇博士论文，描述了一种理想的交互式计算机，称为 FLEX 机器。他曾尝试过功能强大的显示器和以复杂配置联网的计算机。在他的论文中，他一页又一页地哀叹世界上现有的硬件无法实现他制造交互式个人计算机的梦想。他向科学提出了挑战，要制造出他想象中的机器，这种机器“具有足够的能力超越你的视觉和听觉，足够的容量来存储数千页、诗歌、信件、食谱、唱片、图画、动画、乐谱以及你想记住和更改的任何其他东西。”</p><p class="para">But one man was way ahead of them all. That one had written a doctoral thesis at Utah in 1969 describing an idealized interactive computer called the FLEX machine. He had experimented with powerful displays and with computers networked in intricate configurations. On page after page of his dissertation he lamented the inability of the world’s existing hardware to realize his dream of an interactive personal computer. He set before science the challenge to build the machine he imagined, one with “enough power to outrace your senses of sight and hearing, enough capacity to store thousands of pages, poems, letters, recipes, records, drawings, animations, musical scores, and anything else you would like to remember and change.”</p>
<p class="para">对于泰勒来说，他是灵魂伴侣，也是一位深刻的思想家，能够预见到计算机的未来，甚至远远超出他的想象。在熟悉他的想法的计算机科学家中，一半认为他是个疯子，另一半认为他是一个有远见的人。他的名字叫艾伦·凯。</p><p class="para">To Taylor he was a soulmate and a profound thinker, capable of seeing a computing future far beyond anything even he could imagine. Among the computer scientists familiar with his ideas, half thought he was a crackpot and the other half a visionary. His name was Alan Kay.</p>

<p class="para">“与艾伦·凯的谈话并不涉及任何具体的事情，”加州理工学院教授卡弗·米德 (Carver Mead) 表示，他在 PARC 开发了复杂集成电路技术。“他们更像是在 Ideaspace 里闲逛。”</p><p class="para">“Conversations with Alan Kay aren’t about any particular thing,” says Carver Mead, a Caltech professor who developed the technology of complex integrated circuits at PARC. “They’re more a ramble through Ideaspace.”</p>
<p class="para">如今，Ideaspace Central 分布在南加州相距约十英里的两个地点。其中一个是 Kay 的家，位于洛杉矶的一个富裕地区。从外观上看，除了高耸的 V 形屋顶外，它并不显眼。这个奇特的附属建筑是专门为容纳一台两层楼高的管风琴而定制的，这台管风琴由精美的金色云杉专业手工制作而成，几乎每天早上，Kay 都会用这台管风琴演奏他最喜欢的布克斯特胡德和 JS 巴赫的音乐。（“Alan 认为他的职责是让管风琴得以建造，之后他将成为快乐的看管人，”它的建筑师 Greg Harrold 评论道。）</p><p class="para">Ideaspace Central today is divided between two Southern California locations about ten miles apart. One is Kay’s home in an affluent part of Los Angeles. It is unassuming from the outside except for a towering V-roofed addition. This curious annex was custom-built to shelter a two-story pipe organ professionally hand-crafted of exquisite blond spruce, on which Kay can be heard almost any morning practicing his favorite music by Buxtehude and J. S. Bach. (“Alan believed his role was to make it possible to build the organ, after which he would be the happy caretaker,” remarked its architect, Greg Harrold.)</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch06.html.page81"></a>
<p class="para">第二个地点是位于格伦代尔的一栋仓库式建筑，格伦代尔是洛杉矶以北圣盖博谷一个烟雾弥漫的区域。精心布置的隔断和书柜为凯提供了宽敞的工作区，一侧是一条没有门的通道，工作区通向地板——但不太私密，因为他喜欢在工作日中不断忙碌，同样慷慨地在同事中征求和传播想法。他戴着一个椭圆形的名牌迎接你，名牌上写着“艾伦”，还有一张米老鼠的照片。这看起来很可笑，事实也确实如此，直到你想起正是他以俏皮的饼干怪兽数字化形象开启了个人电脑时代。或者，他现在和他在 PARC 组建的非凡团队的另外两名成员一样受雇于华特迪士尼公司，该公司委托他帮助开发新的方式将故事和想法从创作者传递给观众。</p><p class="para">The second location is a warehouse-like building in Glendale, a smoggy precinct of the San Gabriel Valley just north of L.A. Artfully arranged partitions and bookcases provide Kay with a spacious work area open to the floor through a doorless passage on one side—not too private, for he likes to spend the workday in constant stir, eliciting and dispensing ideas among his co-workers with equal generosity. He greets you wearing an oval name tag reading “Alan” and bearing a picture of Mickey Mouse. It should look ludicrous and it does, until you remember that this is the man whose playful digitized image of Cookie Monster launched the age of the personal computer. Or that he is now employed—as are two other members of the extraordinary team he assembled at PARC—by the Walt Disney Company, which has entrusted him with helping to develop new ways to transmit story and idea from creator to audience.</p>
<p class="para">Alan Kay 可能是现代计算机迷的榜样，是 20 世纪 70 年代被新技术所吸引的那代人的查克·耶格尔 (Chuck Yeager)。如果您生活在那个时代与世隔绝的学生和电子迷社区中，您就会知道他的名字，也许是因为您曾在《<span class="italic">科学美国人》上读过他对微电子学和软件的清晰阐述，或在</span><span class="italic">《滚石》杂志</span>上读过一篇关于他的文章。您对机器和数学的热爱使您在社会上感到笨拙和孤立；Alan Kay 却陶醉其中，大摇大摆地在反主流文化圣经中宣称，您和您那些笨拙的伙伴们，带着你们所有的懦夫光环，是新世界的先知，在这个世界里，计算机及其无与伦比的力量将属于大众。</p><p class="para">Alan Kay might have been the role model for the modern computer nerd, a Chuck Yeager for the generation that got engaged by the new technology in the 1970s. If you lived within that era’s insular community of students and electronics nuts you knew his name, perhaps because you had read his lucid explications of microelectronics and software in <span class="italic">Scientific American</span>, or read an article featuring him in (of all places) <span class="italic">Rolling Stone</span>. You had been socially conditioned to feel ungainly and isolated by your devotion to machines and math; Alan Kay positively reveled in it, swaggered with it, declared in the pages of the counterculture bible itself that you and your awkward pals in all your nebbishy glory were the prophets of a new world in which computers and their unparalleled power would belong to the masses.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">正如他向《滚石》杂志</span>读者介绍的那样，计算机迷看起来“就像你想象中的改装车爱好者那样直率。就是那种狂热。他是一个喜欢熬夜的人，他和机器的关系是爱恨交织的。” 反叛的黑客：不是一个营养不良的怪人，只是一个“对传统目标不太感兴趣”的人。</p><p class="para">The Computer Bum, as he enlightened <span class="italic">Rolling Stone’s</span> readers, was someone who looked “about as straight as you’d expect hot-rodders to look. It’s that kind of fanaticism. He’s a person who loves to stay up all night, he and the machine in a love-hate relationship.” The hacker as rebel: Not an undernourished weirdo, merely someone “not very interested in conventional goals.”</p>
<p class="para">“艾伦曾被全国所有大学开除过，”数学家约翰·沃诺克 (John Warnock) 回忆道，他最初是在犹他大学 (University of Utah) 的研究生同学，后来在 PARC 担任同事时认识艾伦。“他<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch06.html.page82"></a>“他不是普通人。他是一个神童，与普通人的学术水平不太相符。”</p><p class="para">“Alan had been thrown out of every university in the country,” recalled John Warnock, a mathematician who knew him first as a fellow graduate student at the University of Utah and later as a colleague at PARC. “He’s <a></a>not your normal person. He’s a child prodigy who doesn’t quite fit in with your normal academics.”</p>
<p class="para">他的妻子邦妮·麦克伯德将他的性格转移到她为第一部电脑动画高科技惊悚片编写的剧本中的一个角色身上（实际上是分散在几个角色身上），这是一部名为《电子世界争霸战》的迪斯尼电影，<span class="italic">在</span>这部电影中，他的大胆、自信和令人振奋的动觉不知何故经受住了好莱坞剧本无情的削弱。艾伦·凯今天仍然是那种即使坐着也能传达出纯粹运动印象的人。正如卡弗·米德所说，与他交谈是一件令人精疲力竭的放大事情。一旦你让他开口说话，他就会对你进行所谓的“大脑倾泻”，多年积累的知识和综合体将以叙事的洪流倾泻而出，其中的主角是艾伦·凯和他所珍视的惊人而富有远见的想法（其中许多仍然未实现），他们的对手是经理、高管、会计师、公司董事会、学校教师以及所有将不受束缚的想象力视为威胁而不是天赋的人。</p><p class="para">His wife, Bonnie MacBird, would transfer his personality to a character (distribute it among several, actually) in her original screenplay for the first computer-animated high-tech thriller, a Disney film entitled <span class="italic">Tron</span> in which his boldness, his confidence, his exhilarating kines-thesia somehow survived the merciless dilution of Hollywood script doctoring. Alan Kay today is still the kind of person who communicates an impression of pure motion even when he is sitting down. As Carver Mead suggests, a conversation with him is an exhausting scaled-up affair. Once you get him talking he performs what he calls a “brain dump” on you, years of accumulated knowledge and synthesis pouring forth in a flood of narrative in which the protagonists are Alan Kay and the startling and visionary ideas he holds dear (many of them still deplorably unrealized), and their adversaries are managers, executives, bean-counters, corporate boards, schoolteachers, and all others who regard the unshackled imagination as a menace rather than a gift.</p>
<p class="para">在众多创意中，艾伦·凯 (Alan Kay) 是让计算机变得酷起来的人。他公开宣称，使用价值 300 万美元的机器玩游戏和“胡闹”是完全可以的。如果这意味着研究生们在一款名为“太空大战”的游戏中将数字火箭飞船从他们的电脑屏幕上发射出去，那么这都是将新技术融入文化结构的一部分。他毫不掩饰地将计算机视为玩具，这让许多人得以探索计算机除了解析数字和对数据库进行排序之外的其他程序的天才之处——换句话说，将其视为一种创造性工具。</p><p class="para">Visible within the flood of ideas is the Alan Kay who made computing cool. He declared publicly that it was all right to use three-million-dollar machines to play games and “screw around.” If that meant grad students were blasting digital rocket ships off their computer screens in a game called “Spacewar,” it was all part of the weaving of new technology into the cultural fabric. His unashamed view of the computer as very much a toy liberated many others to explore its genius for procedures other than the parsing of numbers and the sequencing of databases—to see it, in other words, as a creative tool.</p>
<p class="para">这种将技术视为达到目的的手段的观念，仍然是 Kay 与大多数其他技术艺术和科学从业者的区别所在。他与鲍勃·泰勒之间强大的亲缘关系的一个因素是，他们都对这台机器能做什么感到好奇，而不是<span class="italic">如何</span><span class="italic">做</span>。尽管他滔滔不绝地发表长篇大论，但泰勒招募到 CSL 的大多数有灵感的工程师，兰普森和萨克，一开始都过于盲目地关注他们能真正制造什么。他们会问：路上的下一站是哪里？凯把这个问题彻底颠覆了：让我们弄清楚我们想去哪里，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch06.html.page83"></a>并向我们​​展示如何实现这一目标。他从未忘记计算机在世界上的正确位置：满足用户的愿望，而不是相反。</p><p class="para">This notion of technology as a means to an end still distinguishes Kay from most other practitioners of the art and science of technology. One factor in his powerful kinship with Bob Taylor was their shared curiosity about <span class="italic">what</span> this machine could be made to do, more than <span class="italic">how</span>. Notwithstanding his incessant harangues, most of the inspired engineers Taylor recruited to CSL, the Lampsons and Thackers, started out too blindly focused on the issue of what was within their power to actually build. They would ask: What is the next stop on the road? Kay turned the question inside out: Let’s figure out where we want to go, <a></a>and that will show us how to get there. He never lost sight of the computer’s appropriate station in the world: to conform to the user’s desires, not the other way around.</p>
<p class="para">“对大多数人来说，几乎不可能将技术视为工具而不是目的，”一天，他在迪士尼幻想工程位于格伦代尔的仓库的小隔间里说道。他即将开始另一次卡弗·米德所称的“创意空间”之旅，在这里，夸张和隐喻是这个领域的等价硬币（或同一枚硬币的两面）。“人们陷入了一种思维陷阱，认为环境中的任何事物都应视为理所当然。这是我们神经系统运作的一部分。但将其视为理所当然是危险的，因为这样一来，它会控制你，而不是你控制它。这是麦克卢汉的真知灼见，也是 20 世纪最伟大的真知灼见之一。20 世纪的禅宗就是将在这一过程中变得无形的事物重新变得有形。</p><p class="para">“It’s almost impossible for most people to see technology as the tool rather than the end,” he was saying one day in his cubicle at Disney Imagineering’s Glendale warehouse. He was about to embark on another excursion through what Carver Mead called Ideaspace, where hyperbole and metaphor are equivalent coins of the realm (or obverse sides of the same coin). “People get trapped in thinking that anything in the environment is to be taken as a given. It’s part of the way our nervous system works. But it’s dangerous to take it as a given because then it controls you, rather than the other way around. That’s McLuhan’s insight, one of the bigger ones in the twentieth century. Zen in the twentieth century is about taking things that have been rendered invisible by this process and trying to make them visible again.</p>
<p class="para">“家长们问我，他们应该做些什么来帮助孩子学习科学知识。我说，散步时一定要带上放大镜。成为一个微型探索馆......”</p><p class="para">“Parents ask me what they should do to help their kids with science. I say, on a walk always take a magnifying glass along. Be a miniature exploratorium….”</p>
<p class="para">你必须对他的生活有所了解，才能认出这是他童年时期的场景。凯的父亲是一名科学家，一名从事设计手臂和腿部假肢的生理学家。“我当然记得和他一起散步，”凯回忆道。“当你和对科学感兴趣的父母一起散步时，通常会谈论所有你无法轻易看到的东西。”</p><p class="para">You would have to know something about his life to recognize this as a scene from his childhood. Kay’s father was a scientist, a physiologist engaged in designing prostheses for arms and legs. “I can certainly remember going on walks with him,” Kay recalled. “And when you go on a walk with a parent who’s interested in science, it’s usually about all the things that you can’t readily see.”</p>
<p class="para">这种被释放的好奇心使他能够认识到将计算能力交到每个人手中的新方法。但他必须走很长的路才能发现他的命运在于系统编程的神秘科学。如果不是因为某些情况让他在德克萨斯州韦科的一个空军基地处于一种被称为“Figmo”的暂停状态，这一切可能根本不会发生。</p><p class="para">This sort of unleashed curiosity would allow him to recognize new ways of placing computing power in everyone’s hands. But he had to travel a fair distance before discovering that his destiny lay in the arcane science of systems programming. That might never have happened at all had circumstances not left him becalmed on an Air Force base in Waco, Texas, in the suspended state of existence known as “Figmo.”</p>
<p class="para">这个词是军队的缩写，意思是“去他妈的，我接到命令了”。就像其他军用俚语一样，很难想出更好的词来描述这种情况。那是 1961 年，凯伊服役的最后两年即将结束。当时，他在詹姆斯康威空军基地的病理实验室工作，即将被调职。</p><p class="para">The term is a military acronym for “Fuck it, got my orders.” As always with service slang, one can hardly think of a better way to describe the condition. It was 1961 and Kay was marking off the last two years of his enlistment. At this moment he was working in the pathology lab at James Conway AFB, on the verge of being transferred on.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch06.html.page84"></a>
<p class="para">“我曾经玩过 figmo，当你还在老基地时，每个人都知道你要去别的地方。在这个老基地，你不再是真实的。你坐在一起打牌、看书，这是军队里最棒的事情之一。我试图用 figmo 玩扑克，他是一名职业扑克玩家，我试着提高扑克水平，诀窍是看看我能否把它变成一种学习经历，而不仅仅是被骗。”</p><p class="para">“I was in figmo, when you’re at your old base but everybody knows you’re about to go somewhere else. You’re not for real anymore on this old base. You sit around and play cards and read books, one of the best things in the military. I was trying to get a little better at poker with a figmo who was a professional poker player, the trick being to see if I could make it a learning experience instead of just getting fleeced.”</p>
<p class="para">但是，如果说 Kay 在调职期间不能被要求做任何事，那么他被迫无所事事的状态就让他很容易受到诱惑。在这种情况下，诱惑是安排一次针对计算机程序员的能力测试。康威大学从来没有人通过过这项测试。然而，对于一个天才来说，任何标准化测试都像是一场狂欢。Kay 的头脑既灵活又未被充分利用，他把这当作一种乐趣。“我绝不会错过任何测试，”他说。当然，他轻松通过了。</p><p class="para">But if Kay could not be ordered to do a damn thing pending his transfer, his state of enforced idleness left him wide open to being enticed. In this case the enticement was the scheduling of an aptitude test for computer programmers. No one from Conway had ever passed this test. To a prodigy, however, any standardized test is like a carnival midway. Kay, whose mind was as nimble as it was underemployed, viewed it as a lark. “No way I’d ever pass up a test,” he said. Naturally, he passed handily.</p>
<p class="para">幸运的是，美国空军并不把程序员培训看得如此轻松。空军正在从原始的打孔卡制表机全面升级为世界上第一台流行的通用商业计算机 IBM 1401，并从欧洲招募语言学家，将他们培养成程序员，并在军队中搜寻任何表现出一点点能力的人。</p><p class="para">As luck would have it, the Air Force did not view programmer training quite so casually. Undergoing a full-scale conversion from primitive punch card tabulators to the IBM 1401, the world’s first popular general business computer, the service was pulling linguists out of Europe to turn them into programmers and scouring the ranks for anyone showing the slightest ability.</p>
<p class="para">“他们认为，既然你参加了这项测试，IBM 就可以在一周内教会你从头开始编写 1401 程序，”凯回忆道。“这不是计算机科学，只是培训，但这是我接受过的最好的培训。你拼命工作，一周后你就可以编写计算机程序了。”</p><p class="para">“They figured that since you’d taken this test, IBM could teach you to program the 1401 from scratch in one week,” Kay recalled. “It wasn’t computer science, just training, but it was the best training I’ve ever had. You worked your ass off and at the end of the week you could program a computer.”</p>
<p class="para">从表面上看，凯伊似乎不太可能接受指导机器如何操作的严格要求，因为他习惯性地对不属于他自己的规则和规定反应迟钝。然而，原因在于计算机严苛而坚定的逻辑规则可以带来无限的创造性结果。</p><p class="para">On the surface Kay seemed an unlikely candidate to take to the rigors of instructing a machine how to operate, for by habit he responded poorly to rules and regulations not his own. The explanation, however, lies in how a computer’s stern and unyielding logical rules can lead to infinitely creative results.</p>
<p class="para">计算机看起来很聪明，但它们的智能是一种骗局，是一种以惊人的速度和无限重复的能力为后盾的花招。它们必须被教导如何执行推理问题的每个微小步骤，以及按照什么顺序执行。这就是为什么计算机内部发生的任何事情都不是完全出乎意料的（除非它正在发生）。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch06.html.page85"></a>错误）。程序员为机器指明了方向，就像带孩子在花园小径上散步一样。双方都知道旅途的规则。如果程序员偏离了路径一步——比如编写了违反机器逻辑的命令——计算机就会拒绝跟随。如果计算机违反规则——拒绝沿着规定的路径迈出下一步——程序员就会知道它病了，必须先治愈它，然后他们才能一起迈出更大的一步。</p><p class="para">Computers look smart, but their intelligence is a fraud, a sleight-of-hand stunt abetted by blinding speed and a capacity for infinite reiteration. They must be instructed how to perform every tiny step of a problem of ratiocination, and in what sequence. That is why nothing that ever happens inside a computer is entirely unexpected (unless it is going <a></a>wrong). The machine has been shown the way by its programmer, like a child taken for a stroll along a garden path. Both partners know the rules of the journey. Let the programmer stray one step off the path—let’s say by coding a command that violates the machine’s logic—and the computer will refuse to follow. Let the computer break the rules—refusing to take the next step along the mandated path—and the programmer will know it is sick and must be cured before they can take even one more stride together.</p>
<p class="para">显然，程序员必须遵守系统。他们指示机器遵循一系列条件（<span class="italic">如果</span>满足某某条件，则执行此操作；否则执行<span class="italic">该操作……如果</span>已执行<span class="italic">该操作</span>，并且还存在某某状态，则执行<span class="italic">该操作</span>；否则执行<span class="italic">该操作</span>）。但这些条件本身必须符合设计师刻录到机器电路中的逻辑，否则机器将无法理解。计算机编程是用计算机自己的语言告诉计算机如何读取和遵循这一连串“如果”的过程。程序员建立了一套规则，这些规则恰好与机器自己的规则非常基本地一致。这是最终的递归努力，规则和法规的共同发现导致更多规则和法规的发明，使机器能够扩展和拓展其能力，从而扩展其程序员和用户的能力。艾伦·凯将成为这种合作关系的专家（在相关领域，程序员的编程；但那还远得很）。</p><p class="para">Obviously, then, programmers must conform to a system. They instruct the machine to follow a series of conditions (<span class="italic">if</span> such-and-such a condition is met, do this; otherwise do <span class="italic">that…. If</span> you have done <span class="italic">that</span>, and such-and-such a state also exists, do <span class="italic">this</span>; else <span class="italic">that</span>). But the conditions must themselves conform to logic that has been burned into the machine’s circuits by the designer, or it will not comprehend. Computer programming is the process of telling a computer in its own language how to read and follow this cascade of “ifs.” The programmer establishes a set of rules that happen to conform in a very fundamental way to the machine’s own. It is the ultimate recursive endeavor, the joint discovery of rules and regulations leading to the invention of more rules and regulations that allow the machine to extend and expand its abilities and, consequently, those of its programmer and user. Alan Kay would become an expert in this partnership (and in a related field, the programming of programmers; but that lay far in the future).</p>
<p class="para">但有一个奇妙的陷阱：这些逻辑规则和规定可以适用于程序员选择定义的任何抽象条件。正如凯多年后所说：“计算机对符号的使用，就像语言和数学中对符号的使用一样，与现实世界完全脱节，使它们能够创造出精彩的废话……尽管计算机的硬件受自然法则的制约（电子只能以某些物理定义的方式在电路中移动），但计算机可以执行的模拟范围仅受人类想象力的限制。在计算机中，宇宙飞船可以以比光速更快的速度飞行，时间可以反向运行。”</p><p class="para">But there is a marvelous catch: These logical rules and regulations can apply to any abstract conditions the programmer chooses to define. As Kay put it years later: “Computers’ use of symbols, like the use of symbols in language and mathematics, is sufficiently disconnected from the real world to enable them to create splendid nonsense…Although the hardware of the computer is subject to natural laws (electrons can move through the circuits only in certain physically defined ways), the range of simulations the computer can perform is bounded only by the limits of human imagination. In a computer, spacecraft can be made to travel faster than the speed of light, time to travel in reverse.”</p>
<p class="para">他对这个结构如此严格却又无限可塑的体系的迷恋，可能与他童年在一个<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch06.html.page86"></a>凯一家人关系亲密，但经常四处漂泊。1940 年，凯出生在马萨诸塞州斯普林菲尔德，一年后，全家搬到了父亲的故乡澳大利亚。仅仅四年后，他们又开始搬家，躲避一支已经抵达新几内亚、似乎准备继续向南航行而不遭到抵抗的日本舰队。回到美国后，凯一家住在马萨诸塞州哈德利的艾伦外祖父的农舍里。外祖父是克利夫顿·约翰逊，本世纪初的一位作家、音乐家和先驱纪实摄影师。凯的教育就是在这间农舍开始的。</p><p class="para">His enchantment with a system so rigidly structured yet infinitely malleable may have had to do with his childhood in the bosom of a <a></a>close but itinerant family. One year after his birth in 1940 in Springfield, Massachusetts, the family had moved to Australia, his father’s native land. Only four years later they were on the move again, fleeing a Japanese fleet that had already reached New Guinea and seemed prepared to continue its way south without resistance. Back in the United States the Kays took up residence in the Hadley, Massachusetts, farmhouse of Alan’s maternal grandfather. He was Clifton Johnson, a writer, musician, and pioneering documentary photographer early in the century. In this farmhouse Kay’s education began.</p>
<p class="para">艾伦出生那年，克利夫顿·约翰逊去世了，这激发了全家人的幻想，认为老人的好奇心和创造性气质已经融入了孙子身上。更平淡无奇的是，约翰逊家里堆满了书，五千本，涉及天下所有话题。艾伦五岁时就自学成才，上了一年级。“到我上学的时候，我已经读了几百本书。一年级的时候我就知道他们在骗我，因为我已经接触过其他观点。他们不喜欢有不同的观点，所以这是一场斗争。”</p><p class="para">Clifton Johnson had died the year of Alan’s birth, inspiring a family fancy that the old man’s inquisitive and creative temperament had been infused into the grandson’s. More prosaically, Johnson had filled the house with books, five thousand of them, addressing every topic under the sun. Alan reached first grade as a five-year-old autodidact. “By the time I got to school, I had already read a couple hundred books. I knew in the first grade that they were lying to me because I had already been exposed to other points of view. They didn’t like the idea of having different points of view, so it was a battle.”</p>
<p class="para">战斗中也有一些喘息的机会。其中之一是音乐，是他母亲教给他的，她自己也接受了约翰逊本人的音乐训练。但除此之外，这场较量贯穿了他的整个求学生涯。由于他父亲是一名大学科学家和生理学家，他的求学范围从精英布鲁克林技术高中到长岛郊区波特华盛顿的公立学校。他有一段病痛时期，这让他进一步自学，包括高中四年级时严重的风湿热发作，以及进一步的争吵（在布鲁克林因不服从命令而被开除）。</p><p class="para">There were some respites from the combat. One was music, taught to him by his mother, who had received her own musical training from Johnson himself. But otherwise the contest continued through his entire school career. This ranged, thanks to his father’s career as a university scientist and a physiologist, from the elite Brooklyn Technical High School to public school in Port Washington on suburban Long Island. There were sickly periods leading to further self-education, including a bad bout of rheumatic fever in his senior year of high school, and further contentiousness (a dismissal for insubordination in Brooklyn).</p>
<p class="para">在凯的记忆中，波特华盛顿是一个充满音乐的社区。“这里曾经是足球运动员在乐队和管弦乐队中演奏以彰显地位的地方。这就是音乐。公理会教堂有五个唱诗班，每个唱诗班有 100 名歌手。我永远不会忘记复活节，他们会把唱诗班集合起来做日出礼拜。整个管弦乐队。五百名歌手。最棒、最棒的东西。”在那里，他还遇到了克里斯·杰弗斯，他后来介绍了<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch06.html.page87"></a>杰弗斯给了他第一台电脑。杰弗斯是大三学生，比凯小一年级（尽管凯因病缺席了一年的学业，但他们还是一起毕业的）。杰弗斯还是一位出色的钢琴家，拥有完美的音高，还有一支蓬勃发展的爵士乐队。凯加入了吉他手的行列。乐队演奏了杰弗斯轻松编排的迪克西兰爵士乐，如果你正在寻找一种对演奏者施加严格正式规则的形式，并鼓励他们根据另一套严格的正式规则打破这些规则，那么这是一个有趣的选择。</p><p class="para">Port Washington in Kay’s recollection was a community suffused with music. “This was a place where football players played in the band and orchestra for status. It was the thing. The Congregational Church had five choirs, each with 100 voices. I’ll never forget Easter, when they’d combine the choirs for sunrise services. Full orchestra. Five hundred voices. The best, best stuff.” There he also met Chris Jeffers, who would introduce <a></a>him to his first computer. Jeffers was a junior, a year behind Kay (although since Kay’s illness lost him a year of school, they graduated together). He was also a superb pianist with perfect pitch and a thriving jazz band. Kay joined up on guitar. The band played Dixieland jazz from Jeffers’s effortless arrangements, an interesting choice if one is looking for a form that imposes strict formal rules on players who are encouraged to break them according to another set of strict formal rules.</p>
<p class="para">他们分头上大学，杰弗斯去了科罗拉多大学，凯去了贝瑟尼学院，这是一所西弗吉尼亚州的小型学校，生物学专业不错。学业上的灾难让他们重逢。凯讲述这个故事时，贝瑟尼对他的指控感到愤怒，因为学校管理部门强加了犹太人配额，以控制医学预科课程中的纽约人数量。院长指示他复活节假期后不要返回校园。凯打电话给杰弗斯，不知道他的朋友因为把所有时间都花在学生音乐作品上而不是课堂作业上而被停学了。</p><p class="para">They split for college, Jeffers to the University of Colorado and Kay to Bethany College, a small West Virginia school with a decent program in biology. Academic disaster reunited them. As Kay tells the story, Bethany took umbrage at his charge that the administration imposed a Jewish quota to control the number of New Yorkers in its pre-medical program. The dean instructed him not to return to campus after Easter recess. Kay called Jeffers, unaware that his friend had himself been suspended for spending all his time on a student musical production instead of classwork.</p>
<p class="para">“你猜怎么着，克里斯，”凯说。“我刚刚被学校开除了！”</p><p class="para">“Guess what, Chris,” Kay said. “I just got thrown out of school!”</p>
<p class="para">“太好了，我也是！你什么时候出来？”</p><p class="para">“Great, me too! When you coming out?”</p>
<p class="para">杰弗斯决定留在丹佛，在联合航空的国家预订办公室找到一份工作，这家大型计算机仓库位于斯塔普尔顿国际机场附近，直到他能继续学业。这两个朋友住在跑道尽头不远处一栋废弃建筑的地下室里。凯在一家音乐商店找到了一份工作，在那里他可以等待闪电将他带入人生的下一个阶段。</p><p class="para">Jeffers had decided to stay in Denver, taking a job at the national reservations office of United Airlines, a vast computer depot located near Stapleton International Airport, until he could resume his education. The two friends took up residence in the basement of a condemned building not far from the end of the runway. Kay found work in a music store, where he could wait for lightning to jolt him into the next stage of his life.</p>
<p class="para">有一天，杰弗斯邀请他参观联合航空。凯对计算机的理解很抽象，就像那些好奇的孩子们在那个年代理解计算机一样，当时最不起眼的机器也代表着一千万美元的资本投资。联合航空的 IBM 305 RAMAC 是他接触的第一台计算机。它非常庞大，专门用于管理庞大的数据库，例如丹佛航空保管的五十二周的预订和座位记录。但真正让凯感到震惊的是它的操作程序的原始性。该系统由一排排的乘务员维护，这些全职的仆人什么也不做<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch06.html.page88"></a>比从一台机器取出一叠叠穿孔卡片再将它们装入另一台机器更精细。令他惊讶的是，数字电子产品竟然像铺设下水道一样不需要动脑筋，而且劳动强度大。当凯的目光追随着穿过济贫院的无人机时，一个想法萌芽了。机器的用途——简化人类的努力——与实现它所需的努力之间存在着巨大的差异。凯把这个见解存了起来。直到很久以后，在参加空军能力倾向测试的乐趣变成一项严肃的职业选择之后，他才开始理解它。</p><p class="para">One day Jeffers invited him to visit United. Kay understood computers in the abstract, the way curious kids understood them in the days when the most modest machine represented a ten-million-dollar capital investment. United’s IBM 305 RAMAC was the first one he ever touched. It was huge, specifically designed to manage colossal databases like the fifty-two weeks’ worth of reservations and seating records consigned to Denver’s safekeeping. But what really struck Kay was the primitiveness of its operational routine. The system was serviced by platoons of attendants, full-time menials doing nothing more <a></a>refined than taking stacks of punch cards from one machine and loading them in the next. To his amazement, digital electronics turned out to be as mindless and labor-intensive as laying a sewer line. As Kay’s eyes followed the drones traversing the workhouse floor, the germ of an idea took hold. There was an exorbitant discrepancy between the purpose of the machine—which was to simplify human endeavor—and the effort required to realize it. Kay banked the insight. He would not begin to understand it until much later, well after the lark of taking an Air Force aptitude test metamorphosed into a serious career choice.</p>

<p class="para">康威空军基地为他提供的为期两周的 IBM 课程效果不错，但还很初级。“编程分为两部分，”他后来说道。“砌砖部分是 IBM 教授的，而架构部分可能需要两到三年的时间。”</p><p class="para">The two-week IBM course he received courtesy of Conway AFB was effective, but rudimentary. “Programming is in two parts,” he said later. “The bricklaying part, which IBM taught, and the architecture part, which can take two or three years.”</p>
<p class="para">那时，每台计算机都是不同的。与今天的标准化架构完全不同。根据该架构，所有 IBM 兼容机都遵循同一套操作指令，尽管它们可能由不同的公司根据内存、数据存储甚至微处理器设计的广泛差异规格制造。标准化帮助计算机成为大众市场现象。它使用户可以合理地相信，无论谁制造了他们的计算机，现成的程序都能正常工作，就像他们知道无论他们的车是福特还是雪佛兰，油门和刹车踏板都会在同一个位置一样。</p><p class="para">In those days every computer was different. There was nothing like today’s standardized architectures, according to which all IBM-compatible machines, for instance, respond to the same set of operating instructions even though they may be manufactured by different companies according to widely variant specifications of memory, data storage, and even microprocessor design. Standardization has helped make computers a mass-market phenomenon. It allows users to be reasonably confident that a program bought off the shelf will work properly regardless of who manufactured their computer, just as they know they will find the accelerator and brake pedal in the same location regardless of whether their car is a Ford or a Chevrolet.</p>
<p class="para">20 世纪 60 年代的计算机世界里不存在任何此类东西。机器的形状、大小和结构各不相同，甚至连机柜内的电路以及向中央处理器传递指令的数字 1 和 0 序列也各不相同。同样的 8 位序列，比如“11110000”，可能会告诉 Burroughs 计算机将两个数字相加，而 Control Data 6600 计算机则将一个数字除以另一个数字。从将文件存储在磁盘或磁鼓上到执行基本的数学函数，每台机器都有自己独特的方法。这些差异完全是任意的，不会比<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch06.html.page89"></a>右脚踩踏板在福特汽车上是操作油门，但在雪佛兰汽车上是操作前灯。</p><p class="para">Nothing of the kind existed in the computer world in the 1960s. Machines differed in shape, size, and architecture down to the circuitry inside their cabinets and the sequences of digital ones and zeros delivering instructions to the central processing unit. The same eight-bit sequence, say “11110000,” might tell a Burroughs computer to add two numbers together and a Control Data 6600 to divide one by the other. Each machine had its unique method for everything from storing files on disk or drum to performing basic mathematical functions. The differences were entirely arbitrary, no more consistent than if the <a></a>pedal by the right foot operated the accelerator on a Ford but the headlights on a Chevy.</p>
<p class="para">制造商也没有看到销售与竞争对手相差无几的机器有什么好处。一旦 IBM 向联合航空公司出售了一套系统，它就可以放心了，重写软件、重新培训员工、移动成吨的钢铁机柜等繁重的工作将使联合航空公司在用霍尼韦尔等公司生产的系统替换 IBM 系统之前要深思熟虑。</p><p class="para">Nor did the manufacturers see any advantage to marketing machines even remotely like their competitors’. Once IBM sold a system to United Airlines it could rest assured that the frightful effort of rewriting software, retraining staff, and moving tons of iron and steel cabinets around would make United think very long and hard before replacing its IBM system by one made by, say, Honeywell.</p>
<p class="para">因此，凯伊被迫成为一名计算机架构学生，他曾编写过各种程序，从空军空中训练司令部的 Burroughs 5000 到美国国家大气研究中心 (NCAR) 的 Control Data 6600。他潜意识里正在吸收编程原理，这些原理几年后将在 PARC 发展成为软件设计的非凡进步。然而，正如他后来回忆的那样，当时“我几乎看不到它”。</p><p class="para">Therefore Kay, who had programmed everything from a Burroughs 5000 at the Air Force Air Training Command to a Control Data 6600 at NCAR, the National Center for Atmospheric Research, was compelled to become a student of computer architectures. Subconsciously his mind was absorbing the principles of programming that would grow a few years hence at PARC into an extraordinary advance in software design. As he recalled later, however, at the moment “I barely saw it.”</p>
<p class="para">同样，他在 1965 年于威斯康星州奇珀瓦福尔斯调试 NCAR 的巨型 CDC 6600 时，无意中看到了一本技术杂志上的一篇文章。这本杂志名为<span class="italic">《电子学》</span>。在其三十五周年纪念刊上，它邀请了几位行业领袖来绘制未来十年的技术曲线。仙童半导体公司的研究主管、才华横溢的工程师戈登·摩尔 (Gordon Moore) 撰写了一篇长达四页的文章，题为《在集成电路上塞入更多元件》。文章预测，随着电路中微型晶体管的密度越来越高，计算能力将逐年提高，成本也将降低。摩尔认为这种趋势可以用数学预测，因此 1965 年售价 50 万美元的内存到 1985 年将一路降至 3,000 美元——这一洞察对于随后计算机行业的增长和扩张至关重要，因此从那时起它就被称为“摩尔定律”。</p><p class="para">So too did he assimilate only subconsciously an article in a technical magazine he came upon while debugging NCAR’s giant CDC 6600 in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, in 1965. The magazine was <span class="italic">Electronics</span>. For its thirty-fifth anniversary issue it had invited a few industry leaders to plot a technology curve for the next ten years. The research director at Fairchild Semiconductor Co., a brilliant engineer named Gordon Moore, contributed a four-page piece insouciantly entitled “Cramming More Components onto Integrated Circuits.” The essay forecast that as circuits became more densely packed with microscopic transistors, computing power would exponentially increase in performance and diminish in cost over the years. Moore contended that this trend could be predicted mathematically, so that memory costing $500,000 in 1965 would come all the way down to $3,000 by 1985—an insight so basic to the subsequent growth and expansion of the computer industry that ever since then it has been known as “Moore’s Law.”</p>
<p class="para">然而，1965 年的那天，艾伦·凯浏览了摩尔的文章，然后就把它放在一边，无动于衷。一台缩小版的计算机为一个人服务的梦想，几年后才实现。当他在奇珀瓦福尔斯 (Chippewa Falls) 辛苦工作，研究一台房间大小、用氟利昂冷却的 CDC 6600 时，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch06.html.page90"></a>戈登·摩尔（Gordon Moore）曾做出惊人预测：电子器件将踏上不断小型化的道路，但这似乎与他的生活毫无关系。</p><p class="para">That day in 1965, however, Alan Kay skimmed Moore’s article and laid it aside, unmoved. The dream of a computer scaled down to serve a single human being would not come to him for another couple of years. As he toiled in Chippewa Falls on a room-sized, freon-cooled CDC 6600, <a></a>Gordon Moore’s astonishing prediction that electronics had embarked on a journey of unceasing miniaturization seemed to have no relevance to his life at all.</p>

<p class="para">1966 年，凯终于获得了科罗拉多大学的学士学位，主修数学和分子生物学。他能找到的唯一符合他严格要求的博士课程是戴夫·埃文斯在犹他州建立的，该课程得到了美国高级研究计划署鲍勃·泰勒的 500 万美元资助。令他自己都惊讶的是，他被学校规模很小的计算机科学系录取，成为第七名研究生。</p><p class="para">In 1966 Kay finally secured his bachelor’s degree from the University of Colorado, a double major in mathematics and molecular biology. The only doctoral program he could find to fit his exacting specification was the one Dave Evans had established at Utah with a $5 million grant from Bob Taylor at ARPA. To his own amazement he got accepted as the seventh graduate student in the school’s tiny department of computer science.</p>
<p class="para">“后来我发现埃文斯从来不看我的成绩，”凯说。“他不相信这一点。你必须给他发一份简历，而他只看简历。他就像奥克兰突袭者的阿尔·戴维斯；他的理论是让每个人都参加训练营，给他们一个真正体面的机会，然后非常野蛮地裁掉名单。我很高兴这个家伙似乎对我的能力如此看重。我下定决心的一件事就是永远不让他知道真相。”</p><p class="para">“I discovered later that Evans never looked at my grades,” Kay said. “He didn’t believe in it. You had to send him a resume, which was all he ever looked at. He was like Al Davis of the Oakland Raiders; his theory was to let everybody into training camp and give them a really decent chance, then be incredibly savage cutting the roster. I was completely thrilled that this guy seemed to think so much of my abilities. One thing I resolved was that he’d never find out the truth.”</p>
<p class="para">泰勒的 ARPA 资金让犹他州成为了计算机图形学的温床。凯在走进埃文斯的办公室与他的新导师会面的那天发现了这一点。埃文斯是一位内向、沉默寡言的绅士，他伸手去拿桌子上一叠一英尺高、用棕色纸张装订的文件。他递给凯一份文件，说：“拿去读一读。”</p><p class="para">Taylor’s ARPA money had turned Utah into a hotbed of computer graphics. Kay discovered that the day he walked into Evans’s office to meet his new mentor. Evans, an introverted gentleman of few words, reached over to a foot-high stack of documents bound in brown paper piled on his desk. He handed one to Kay and said, “Take this and read it.”</p>
<p class="para">标题是“Sketchpad：人机图形通信系统”。这篇论文是泰勒在 IPTO 的前任 Ivan Sutherland 在 1963 年发表的麻省理工学院博士论文，论文描述了一个程序，该程序已成为年轻交互式计算机图形科学的基石。Sketchpad 只能在一台机器上运行，即林肯实验室的 Wes Clark 的 TX-2。但它的原理可以无限地应用于当时越来越灵活和强大的一系列计算机<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch06.html.page91"></a>存在。根据 Evans 的要求，Sketchpad 也是他博士课程中计算机方面的入门课程。“基本上，”Kay 说，“你必须先理解这一点，然后才能真正成为犹他大学的一员。”</p><p class="para">The title read, “Sketchpad: A Man-Machine Graphical Communications System.” The 1963 MIT doctoral thesis of Ivan Sutherland, Taylor’s predecessor at IPTO, the paper described a program that had become the cornerstone of the young science of interactive computer graphics. Sketchpad worked on only one machine in the world, Wes Clark’s TX-2 at Lincoln Lab. But its precepts were infinitely applicable to a whole range of increasingly nimble and powerful computers then coming into <a></a>existence. Sketchpad was also, by Evans’s mandate, the cardinal introduction to computing in his doctoral program. “Basically,” Kay said, “you had to understand that before you were a real person at Utah.”</p>
<p class="para">萨瑟兰的系统可以创建复杂程度令人眼花缭乱的图形对象，考虑到当时硬件的严重局限性，这一切就更加令人惊叹了。使用 Sketchpad，用户可以将直线倾斜成曲线（“橡皮筋”），制作工程精确的线条和角度（系统可以拉直绘图员的草图），并放大和缩小显示分辨率。该程序开创了“虚拟桌面”，用户可以在理论绘图空间的可见部分（约三分之一平方英里）上进行绘制（不可见部分保存在计算机内存中，可以滚动到视图中）。凯后来表示，思考 Sketchpad 的强大功能“就像看到了天堂的一瞥”。 “它拥有计算机似乎承诺的所有东西。你可以把它看作是一盏为我们指明方向的光。”</p><p class="para">Sutherland’s system could create graphic objects of dazzling complexity, all the more amazing given the severe limitations of the contemporary hardware. With Sketchpad the user could skew straight lines into curves (“rubber-banding”), make engineering-precise lines and angles (the system straightened out the draftsman’s rough sketches), and zoom the display resolution in and out. The program pioneered the “virtual desktop,” in which the user sketched on the visible portion of a theoretical drawing space about one-third of a mile square (the invisible portions were held in the computer’s memory and could be scrolled into view). Contemplating the power of Sketchpad was “like seeing a glimpse of heaven,” Kay said later. “It had all of the kinds of things that the computer seemed to promise. You could think of it as a light that was sort of showing us the way.”</p>
<p class="para">图形可以成为计算机界面中可直接操作且可精细个性化的元素，这是 Kay 在犹他州的头几个星期里遇到的数十个新概念之一。他的脑子里充满了激情，他花了几个小时在图书馆书架上复印所有引起他兴趣的计算机文献。他写出了数百篇文章，这几乎是一部活生生的计算机历史，供他枯竭的智力吸收。</p><p class="para">That graphics could be a directly manipulable—and minutely personalized—element of the computer interface was one of dozens of new concepts that bombarded Kay in his first few weeks at Utah. His mind on fire, he spent hours in the library stacks photocopying everything that grabbed his interest in the computing literature. He emerged with hundreds of articles, virtually a living history of computing for his parched intellect to absorb.</p>
<p class="para">很快，他又受到了其他强有力的影响。在一次会议上，他听到了高瞻远瞩的马文·明斯基的演讲。明斯基是麻省理工学院的心理学家，也是计算机领域的先驱，是儿童心理学家让·皮亚杰的弟子，也是人工智能这一新科学的创始人，该科学旨在在计算机中重现人类的心理。他的演讲是一场“精彩的长篇大论”，讲述了传统教育如何摧毁儿童的学习能力，这个话题一定在早熟的凯的灵魂深处产生了共鸣。明斯基并没有明确指出计算机是解决问题的办法。但他有趣地提到了一位同事在设计一种计算机语言来帮助儿童学习编程方面所做的工作。</p><p class="para">He soon came under other powerful influences. At one conference he heard the oracular Marvin Minsky speak. Minsky was an MIT psychologist and a computing pioneer, a disciple of the child psychologist Jean Piaget and a founder of the new science of artificial intelligence, which aimed to reproduce human psychology in the computer. His speech was a “terrific diatribe” about how traditional education destroys the learning aptitude of children, a subject that must have resounded to the precocious Kay’s very soul. Minsky did not specifically prescribe computers as the answer. But he made intriguing mention of the work a colleague had done in designing a computer language to help children learn programming.</p>

<p class="para">第二年年初，凯见到了这位同事。西摩·派普特是一位身材魁梧、胡子浓密的南非人，剑桥大学培养的数学家，他成功地将一心一意的专注与儿童的学习技巧结合起来，对其他一切都心不在焉。派普特设计了一种简单的编程语言，称为“LOGO”，目的是通过为孩子们提供一种工具，让他们看到机器立即响应他们的命令，从而教他们使用计算机。LOGO 真的把电脑变成了一个玩具。它最显眼的特征是一个餐盘大小的乌龟形机器人。这个装置会根据孩子们在电脑屏幕上输入的简单命令在教室地板上爬行：“向前 100”指示它沿直线走 100 步，“向右 90”指示它向右转 90 度，等等。一支从乌龟腹部伸出的笔会在地板上描绘出它的路径，让更熟练的年轻程序员可以创造出几乎无限复杂的图案。</p><p class="para">Early the next year Kay got to meet this colleague. Seymour Papert was a burly, bushy-bearded South African, a Cambridge-trained mathematician who managed to combine a single-minded absorption with the learning skills of children with a profound absent-mindedness about everything else. Papert had devised a simple programming language known as “LOGO,” the aim of which was to teach children about computers by giving them a tool to see the machine instantaneously respond to their commands. LOGO literally turned the computer into a toy. Its most conspicuous feature was a turtle-shaped robot the size of a dinner plate. This device would crawl about on a schoolroom floor according to simple commands children could type onto a computer screen: “forward 100” directed it in a straight line 100 turtle steps, “right 90” dictated a 90-degree right turn, and so on. A pen protruding from the turtle’s belly would trace its path on the floor, allowing the more adept of its young programmers to create patterns of almost limitless intricacy.</p>
<p class="para">LOGO 的天才之处在于它能够将抽象（人们可以命令计算机做某事）转化为具体（人们可以指挥乌龟画一个平行四边形）。对于 Kay 来说，看到 Papert 的十岁、十一岁和十二岁受试者使用一台简单的计算机来创造设计是一种启示，否则人们会认为这些设计只能通过装载了复杂算法的大型机系统来实现。Papert 展示了如何将机器从半神变成工具（用 Wes Clark 的话来说），方法是让孩子们对它进行无情的审视。Kay 永远不会忘记这个教训。正如他后来写道的那样，“分时系统可以提供的最佳输出是粗糙的绿色线条画和方波音乐音调。然而，孩子们习惯了手指画、彩色电视和立体声唱片，他们通常发现用低容量分时系统可以完成的事情不足以激发他们的兴趣。”或者正如凯伊和他的同事阿黛尔·戈德堡后来写道的：“如果‘媒介即信息’，那么低带宽分时技术所传递的信息就是‘废话’。”</p><p class="para">LOGO’s genius was its ability to turn the abstract (one can command a computer to do something) into the concrete (one can direct the turtle to draw a parallelogram). To Kay it was a revelation to watch Papert’s ten-, eleven-, and twelve-year-old subjects use a simple computer to create designs one would otherwise assume could only be achieved by mainframe systems loaded with complex algorithms. Papert showed the way toward reducing the machine from demigod to tool (in Wes Clark’s phrase) by subjecting it to the unforgiving scrutiny of children. Kay never forgot the lesson. As he wrote later, “The best outputs that time-sharing can provide are crude green-tinted line drawings and square-wave musical tones. Children, however, are used to finger paints, color television and stereophonic records, and they usually find the things that can be accomplished with a low-capacity time-sharing system insufficiently stimulating to maintain their interest.” Or as Kay and his colleague Adele Goldberg wrote later: “If ‘the medium is the message,’ then the message of low-bandwidth time-sharing is ‘blah.’”</p>
<p class="para">当轮到他在 PARC 设计编程语言时，他会将 Papert 系统的几个明显元素融入其中：它的视觉反馈、对新手的可访问性以及对<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch06.html.page93"></a>童年的好奇心和创造力。部分出于对最后一个因素的尊重，他将其称为“闲聊”。</p><p class="para">When his turn came to design a programming language at PARC, he would invest it with several unmistakable elements of Papert’s system: its visual feedback, its accessibility to novices, and its orientation to the <a></a>wonder and creativity of childhood. Partially in deference to this last factor, he would call it “Smalltalk.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">当 Kay 首次进入 Ideaspace 时，犹他州的图形研究水平正在爆发式增长。Ivan Sutherland 加入了该学院，与他的朋友 Dave Evans 一起工作（他们最终合作制造了交互式军事模拟器）。Kay 的研究生同学 John Warnock 通过解决著名的“隐藏线问题”取得了图形学的里程碑，该问题适用于计算机如何绘制部分隐藏在另一个图形后面的图形轮廓（例如，隐藏在球后面的三角形的边），以便所有可见的边和角都令人信服地对齐。（Warnock 的解决方案非常<span class="italic">紧凑</span>，以至于他的博士论文（描述该解决方案）只有 32 页。）</p><p class="para">While Kay was taking these first mind-blowing excursions into Ideaspace, the caliber of graphics research at Utah was exploding. Ivan Sutherland had joined the faculty to work with his friend Dave Evans (they would eventually form a partnership to manufacture interactive military simulators). Kay’s fellow grad student John Warnock achieved a graphics milestone by solving the famous “hidden-line problem,” which applied to how computers could draw the outline of a form when it is partially hidden behind another—the sides of a triangle hidden behind a ball, for example—so all the visible sides and angles convincingly line up. (Warnock’s solution is a <span class="italic">tour de force</span> of such compactness that his doctoral thesis, in which it is described, runs to only 32 pages.)</p>
<p class="para">Kay 本人在 1969 年的论文中融入了这些想法和其他想法，这必定是有史以来最奇怪的科学博士学位论文之一，其中引用了 WH Auden、JS Bach 和 Kahlil Gibran 等人的题词（“你会用手指触摸你梦想中的裸体”）。手绘插图不仅包括复杂的功能图和逻辑树，还包括奇特的单用户机器的线条图。这些机器将屏幕、键盘和鼠标统一到一个桌面控制台上，这是两年前他在 ARPA 研究生会议上描述便携式多功能计算机时引发争议的“老大哥”。</p><p class="para">Kay’s own 1969 thesis incorporated these ideas and others into what must be one of the oddest dissertations ever submitted for a doctorate in a scientific discipline, featuring as it did epigraphs from, among others, W. H. Auden, J. S. Bach, and Kahlil Gibran (“You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams”). The hand-drawn illustrations included not only complex diagrams of functions and logical trees but line drawings of fanciful single-user machines. These had screen, keyboard, and mouse unified into a desktop console, a big brother to the portable all-purpose computer that had provoked such controversy when he described it at the ARPA grad students’ conference two years earlier.</p>
<p class="para">Kay 的论文概述了一台名为 FLEX 机器的交互式计算机，这是他与一位名叫 Ed Cheadle 的无名硬件天才合作设计的，Cheadle 是盐湖城一家航空航天公司的重要工程师。FLEX 融入了 Kay 在接下来的几年里在 PARC 开发的许多想法，包括紧凑性、面向对象编程和显示屏的使用。但它并不是他设想的个人计算机，部分原因是它不够强大，无法执行他的理想所需的所有功能，部分原因是它使用了一种复杂而呆板的语言，正如 Kay 回忆的那样，“用户觉得学习起来很令人反感。”</p><p class="para">Kay’s thesis outlined an interactive computer called the FLEX machine which he had designed in partnership with an unsung hardware genius named Ed Cheadle, who was an important engineer for a Salt Lake aerospace company. The FLEX incorporated many of the ideas Kay would develop in the coming years at PARC, including compactness, object-oriented programming, and the use of a display screen. But it was not quite the personal computer he envisioned, in part because it was not powerful enough to perform all the functions required by his ideal and in part because it utilized a complicated and stilted language which, as Kay recalled, “users found repellent to learn.”</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch06.html.page94"></a>
<p class="para">尽管有其独特之处（或者说正因为如此），凯的论文还是顺利通过了包括萨瑟兰和埃文斯在内的五人委员会的审核。但他却被一种半途而废的感觉所折磨。他的 FLEX 机器的某些部分可以在现有硬件上实现，但真正合适的技术似乎遥不可及。“对我来说最大的打击是在伊利诺伊大学的一次会议之旅中，在那里我看到了一块一英寸见方的玻璃和氖气，其中的各个点会根据指令亮起——这是第一台平板显示器。我在会议的剩余时间里一直在计算 FLEX 的硅片什么时候可以放在显示器的背面。”根据摩尔定律，答案似乎至少还需要十年。</p><p class="para">Despite its idiosyncrasies (or because of them), Kay’s thesis readily passed the muster of a five-man committee that included Sutherland and Evans. But he was tormented by a sense of things half-done. Parts of his FLEX machine could be implemented on existing hardware, but a truly suitable technology seemed to be tantalizingly just out of reach. “The big whammy for me came during a conference tour of the University of Illinois, where I saw a one-inch-square lump of glass and neon gas in which individual spots would light up on command—it was the first flat-panel display. I spent the rest of the conference calculating just when the silicon of the FLEX could be put on the back of the display.” The answer, according to Moore’s Law, seemed to be at least ten years off.</p>
<p class="para">如果当代机器不够用，凯的目标并没有改变。他的追求仍然是寻找足够简单的东西，让孩子可以使用，但又足够强大，可以满足人类对创造力的渴望。凯设想了一项名为“KiddiComp”或“Dynabook”的发明。为了让这个抽象概念变得切实可行，他为自己建造了一个大约 9 英寸乘 12.5 英寸深的模型盒，顶部画有一块平板屏幕和键盘，并在里面装满铅弹，以此来预测它的最佳重量（他判断大约 2 磅）。</p><p class="para">If contemporary machines were inadequate, Kay’s goals had not changed. The quest was still for something simple enough for a child to use yet powerful enough to slake the human thirst for creativity. Kay imagined an invention called the “KiddiComp” or “Dynabook.” To make the abstraction tangible, he built himself a model box about nine inches by twelve and a half inches deep, with a flat screen and keyboard drawn on the top surface, and filled it with lead pellets as a way of divining its optimum weight (about two pounds, he judged).</p>
<p class="para">他无所事事，因未能将自己的好主意变成现实而感到沮丧。在斯坦福人工智能实验室临时任职期间，他接受了一年的格式塔疗法（“非常加州的做法”）。当他即将接受卡内基梅隆大学的职位时，鲍勃·泰勒 (Bob Taylor) 打电话给他，告诉他一个令人震惊的消息：兰普森、萨克和他们的几位 BCC 同事将集体加入施乐 PARC <span class="italic">。</span>凯重新考虑了他的计划。巴特勒·兰普森是他心目中的智力英雄之一。通过 ARPA 研究生会议，他知道其他人都是一流的人才。如果所有这些人都聚集在鲍勃·泰勒 (Bob Taylor) 的 PARC，谁也不知道他们能取得什么成就——甚至能制造出他的 Dynabook。</p><p class="para">He was at loose ends, depressed over having failed to make his great idea materialize in more than cardboard form. While holding a temporary appointment at the Stanford artificial intelligence lab he underwent a year of gestalt therapy (“a very California thing to do”). He was on the verge of accepting a post at Carnegie-Mellon when Bob Taylor called him with the electrifying news that Lampson, Thacker, and several of their BCC colleagues were joining Xerox PARC <span class="italic">en masse</span>. Kay reconsidered his plans. Butler Lampson was one of his intellectual heroes. Through the ARPA grad student conferences he knew the others as first-class talents. If all these people were to converge at PARC under Bob Taylor, there was no telling what they could accomplish—even build his Dynabook.</p>
<p class="para">一天晚上，他和泰勒几乎熬夜到天亮，讨论着施乐公司的资金、凯的想法和<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch06.html.page95"></a>以及兰普森和萨克的工程技术。一台简单到连小孩都能操作的计算机！小到可以夹在胳膊下！功能强大到可以驱动全彩显示器！泰勒在某个时候告诉他，只有一件事。凯不会和其他人一起被分配到他的实验室，而是被分配到比尔·甘宁领导的竞争系统科学实验室。</p><p class="para">One night he and Taylor stayed up nearly until dawn, batting around the possibilities implicit in a conjuncture of Xerox’s money, Kay’s ideas, <a></a>and the engineering of Lampson and Thacker. A computer simple enough to be worked by children! Small enough to be carried under your arm! Powerful enough to drive a display in full color! There was only one thing, Taylor informed him at some point. Kay would not be assigned with the others to his lab, but to the competing Systems Science Lab under Bill Gunning.</p>
<p class="para">泰勒不让凯进入自己实验室的动机有很多。有人认为泰勒希望在竞争对手 SSL 中设置一个“模仿者”——凯说，这是一种“殖民”，“这样 PARC 的四个实验室中就有两个有前 ARPA 人员”，以便更有效地在整个组织中传播他的想法。泰勒的 BCC 政变很可能暂时填补了 CSL 的配额。既然他无论如何都在为冈宁提供招聘建议，那么向他提供艾伦·凯也没有什么不妥。</p><p class="para">Much has been made of Taylor’s motives in keeping Kay out of his own lab. Some believe Taylor wished to place a “ringer” in the rival SSL—a “colonization,” Kay said, “so two of the four labs at PARC would have ex-ARPA people” to more effectively propagate his ideas throughout the organization. It is just as likely that Taylor’s BCC coup had filled CSL’s allotted head count for the moment. Since he was advising Gunning on recruitment anyway, there was nothing untoward in offering him Alan Kay.</p>
<p class="para">毫无疑问，进入冈宁的 SSL 是凯的幸运。他倾向于独来独往——要么独自工作，要么作为小团队的领导者。他能在 CSL 中保持自己的知识自主权吗？CSL 中唯一的团队是泰勒的团队，而知识引擎是巴特勒·兰普森。在 SSL 之外工作让凯能够作为 CSL 项目的正式参与者工作，而不会放弃他的独立精神。他可以作为特权平等者与 CSL 互动，不受泰勒的直接监督和兰普森的知识支配。</p><p class="para">It is also certain that landing in Gunning’s SSL was Kay’s lucky break. He tended to work as a loner—either by himself or as leader of a small team. Could he have maintained his intellectual autonomy in CSL, where the only group was Taylor’s and the intellectual engine was Butler Lampson? Working out of SSL allowed Kay to work as a full participant in CSL’s program without ceding his independent spirit. He could interact with CSL as a privileged equal, outside Taylor’s direct supervision and Lampson’s intellectual domination.</p>
<p class="para">随着事件的展开，凯和泰勒分开时的力量比他们在一起时更强大。泰勒在描述计算机的未来时可能含糊不清，但凯却非常清楚。他来 PARC 面试的那天，里克·琼斯邀请他到办公室，问了他一个常见的问题。</p><p class="para">As events unfolded, Kay and Taylor apart proved more powerful a force than they would have been together. Where Taylor could be vague and inarticulate in describing computing’s future, Kay was never less than crystal-clear. The day he came to PARC for his job interview, Rick Jones invited him into his office and asked him a stock question.</p>
<p class="para">他问道：“您认为您在 PARC 取得的最大成就是什么？”</p><p class="para">“What do you think your greatest achievement will be at PARC?” he asked.</p>
<p class="para">凯回答道：“它将是一台个人电脑。”</p><p class="para">“It’ll be a personal computer,” Kay replied.</p>
<p class="para">“<span class="italic">那</span>是什么？”</p><p class="para">“What’s <span class="italic">that</span>?”</p>
<p class="para">凯伊看到琼斯的桌子上有一个扁平的文件夹，大小跟学生的笔记本差不多，于是拿起来翻开。“这将是一个平板显示器，”他指着竖起来的封面说道。“里面会有<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch06.html.page96"></a>底部有一个键盘，还有足够的电量来存储你的邮件、文件、音乐、艺术品和书籍。所有这些都装在这个大小差不多、重量只有几磅的包装里。这就是我要说的。”</p><p class="para">Spying a flat portfolio on Jones’s desk the size of a student’s notebook, Kay seized it and flipped it open. “This will be a flat-panel display,” he said, indicating the cover, which he held upright. “There’ll be <a></a>a keyboard here on the bottom, and enough power to store your mail, files, music, artwork, and books. All in a package about this size and weighing a couple of pounds. That’s what I’m talking about.”</p>
<p class="para">他走了出去，留下琼斯抓着头自言自语道：“是啊，<span class="italic">没错</span>。”</p><p class="para">He walked out, leaving Jones scratching his head and saying to himself, “Yeah, <span class="italic">right</span>.”</p>

They had the people and the leadership, a seemingly unlimited amount of money, and Xerox’s liberal commission to pursue whatever course of inquiry they wished.</p>

<p class="para">或者，他们几乎都来自学术界和政府部门，在工业企业工作方面还很青涩，无法理解为什么施乐公司的计算机公司 SDS 会拒绝泰勒的建议，即 PARC 购买其商业宿敌生产的机器作为其主计算机。尤其是当他们觉得这个选择是显而易见的时候。</p><p class="para">Or perhaps, having almost all come from academia and government service, they were simply too green at working for an industrial enterprise to understand why Xerox’s computer company, SDS, would take amiss Taylor’s proposal that PARC purchase as its main computer a machine manufactured by its commercial archenemy.

<p class="para">计算机系统实验室的首要任务是为所有 PARC 实验室选择主要计算硬件，从纯工程的角度来看，这似乎很简单。当实验室起草规格时<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch07.html.page98"></a>没有必要召开研讨会来权衡他们的选择。只有一种选择：由数字设备公司生产的 PDP-10。</p><p class="para">The Computer System Lab’s inaugural task of selecting the main computing hardware for all the PARC labs seemed straightforward enough from the standpoint of pure engineering. When the lab drew up the spec<a></a>ifications there was no need to hold a colloquium to weigh their options. There was only one: The PDP-10, manufactured by Digital Equipment Corporation.</p>
<p class="para">在过去的一年里，PDP-10 席卷了计算机界。PDP-10 是 DEC 一系列商业成功的产品之一，它源自麻省理工学院和斯坦福大学的人工智能项目，PDP-10 与众不同：它是一台相对紧凑的计算机（尽管它仍然占据了相当大的空间），具有分时硬件，迅速取代了数十所大学计算机中心和公司后台办公室中老化的 SDS 940。PDP-10 设计得如此出色，以至于在最后一台设备下线十多年后的今天，它仍然受到计算机爱好者的崇敬。</p><p class="para">Over the previous year the PDP-10 had taken the computing world by storm. One of DEC’s series of commercially successful units that had grown out of the artificial intelligence programs at MIT and Stanford, the PDP-10 was exceptional: A relatively compact computer (though it still took up a good-sized room) with time-sharing hardware that rapidly replaced the aging SDS 940s in scores of college computer centers and corporate back offices. The PDP-10 was so well designed that it is still treated with a cliquish reverence by computer jocks today, more than a decade after the last unit rolled off the factory line.</p>
<p class="para">PDP-10 也成为与蓬勃发展的 ARPANET 相连的研究部门的首选计算机，<span class="italic">事实上</span>已成为标准。它具有专门为运行 Lisp 而量身定制的特殊优点，Lisp 是一种流行的编程语言，ARPANET 研究人员大量使用这种语言开发软件。此外，它的操作系统 Tenex 是根据 ARPA 的合同使用政府资金开发的，因此任何人都可以免费使用。</p><p class="para">The PDP-10 was also becoming the computer of choice—a <span class="italic">de facto</span> standard—for research departments linked to the burgeoning ARPANET. It possessed the special virtue of having been specifically tailored to run Lisp, a popular programming language in which ARPANET researchers turned out software by the ream. Moreover, its operating system, Tenex, had been developed on an ARPA contract with government funds, and was thus available for anyone to use, free of charge.</p>
<p class="para">到 20 世纪 70 年代中期，由于这些和其他功能，美国的计算机科学将不再是几十台互不兼容的机器组成的巴别塔。相反，典型的计算机研究小组将是一个大学部门，使用配备 Tenex 操作系统并连接到 ARPANET 的 PDP-10。<span class="sup">*甚至早在 1971 年，就​​很难想象有比这更好的词来描述 CSL 的自我形象。毕竟，泰勒是 ARPANET 的元老，他们几乎都是 ARPANET 的“小子”，他们这样称呼自己。对于计算机科学实验室来说，PARC 应该是 PDP-10 节点</span><span class="italic">的典范，</span>这几乎是一个信条。</p><p class="para">By the mid-1970s, thanks to these features and others, computer science in the United States would cease to be a Babel of dozens of mutually incompatible machines. Instead, the prototypical computer research group would be a university department using PDP-10s equipped with the Tenex operating system and linked to the ARPANET.<span class="sup">*</span> Even as early as 1971, it was hard to imagine a better description of CSL’s self-image. After all, Taylor was the ARPANET’s patriarch and they were almost all ARPANET “brats,” as they labeled themselves. To the Computer Science Lab it was almost an article of faith that PARC should be the PDP-10 node <span class="italic">par excellence</span>.</p>
<p class="para">但实验室很快发现，为企业设施购买资本设备永远不可能像麻省理工学院等学院的教职部门那样简单。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch07.html.page99"></a>当鲍勃·泰勒计划在 PARC 安装 DEC 计算机的消息传出后，SDS 的高管们立即反应过来。这是可以理解的。1971 年，SDS 正在为生存而战，而 DEC 是其主要对手。</p><p class="para">But the lab was about to discover that purchasing capital equipment for a corporate facility could never be as straightforward a question of engineering as it might be for a faculty department at, say, MIT. For <a></a>when word got out that Bob Taylor was planning to install a DEC computer at PARC, the executives at SDS went off like Roman candles. This was understandable. In 1971 SDS was fighting for its life, and DEC was its principal foe.</p>
<p class="para">在完成对 SDS 的收购后不久，施乐公司就发现其新计算机部门的情况并不乐观。马克斯·帕列夫斯基从这笔价值 10 亿美元的交易中获利约 1 亿美元，他更乐意把钱花在民主党竞选活动和电影杂志投资上（“我肯定是城里所有傻瓜名单上的人物”，他兴高采烈地说），而不是埋头于旧公司的日常问题中。人们普遍怀疑他真正的商业天赋在于他知道如何趁势而出；甚至有传言说他向助手透露了 SDS 交易的情况：“我们在死马落地之前就把马卖给了他们。”他否认了这句警句，但承认在出售时他知道 SDS 已经进入了商业周期的艰难时期。</p><p class="para">Not long after completing its purchase of SDS Xerox had discerned that all was not well at its new computer division. Max Palevsky, who had personally pocketed some $100 million from the billion-dollar transaction, was happier spending his money on Democratic campaigns and movie and magazine ventures (“I must be on every sucker list in town,” he said cheerily) than burying himself in the day-to-day problems of his old firm. Suspicion was rife that his real business talent resided in his knowing how to get out while the getting was good; popular rumor even had him confiding to aides about the SDS deal: “We sold them a dead horse before it hit the ground.” He denied the epigram, but acknowledged knowing that at the time of the sale SDS had entered a rocky stretch of the business cycle.</p>
<p class="para">仿佛是为了证实所有人最坏的猜测，SDS 的利润在 1969 年 5 月达到顶峰，几乎就在所有权正式易手的那一刻。那一年，SDS 的净收入约为 1200 万美元。第二年是其销售额有史以来最好的一年——但每增加一美元收入，就会亏损两美元。该部门再也没有盈利。在接下来的三年里，亏损总额将达到近 1.2 亿美元。</p><p class="para">As though to confirm everyone’s worst suspicions, SDS profits peaked in May 1969, at almost the very moment that ownership formally changed hands. That calendar year SDS recorded about $12 million in net income. The following year was its best ever in terms of sales—but for every dollar it recorded in revenue, it lost two. The division never again showed a profit. Over the following three years the losses would add up to nearly $120 million.</p>
<p class="para">里格登·柯里 (Rigdon Currie) 回忆说，不迟于 1970 年初，“事情已经很明显了。”当时，作为销售主管的柯里被要求为管理会议准备一份关于 SDS 前景的详细报告，会议由脾气暴躁的前西点军校学员丹·麦古克 (Dan McGurk) 主持，麦古克曾是帕列夫斯基的中尉，在此次出售后成为该部门的总裁。</p><p class="para">No later than early 1970, Rigdon Currie recalled, “the handwriting was on the wall.” At that time Currie, as head of sales, was instructed to prepare a detailed presentation on SDS prospects for a management meeting to be chaired by the choleric ex-West Pointer Dan McGurk, a former Palevsky lieutenant who had become the division’s president following the sale.</p>
<p class="para">Currie 是佐治亚理工学院培养的工程师，他南方人的彬彬有礼掩盖了他邪恶的幽默感。他决心确保他的演讲不会被轻易遗忘。在约定的那天，他站在一张三英尺高的挂图旁，向在场的高管们致意。从一开始，消息就很明显不好。他说，公司的每一位主要客户的情况都很糟糕。政府<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch07.html.page100"></a>美国国家航空航天局和美国国家科学基金会等机构正在大幅削减预算。Tymshare 等分时公司在全国范围内使用 SDS 940 运行网络，但各级销售人员都遇到了阻力。由于教育、政府和航空航天业同时陷入低迷，SDS 服务的几乎所有市场都陷入困境。</p><p class="para">Currie was a Georgia Tech-trained engineer whose southern courtliness masked a wicked sense of humor. He was determined to make sure his presentation would not easily be forgotten. On the appointed day he greeted the assembled executives while standing by a flip chart three feet tall. From the outset it was clear the news was not good. The condition of every one of the company’s leading customers was dire, he said. Govern<a></a>ment agencies like NASA and the National Science Foundation were sharply cutting their budgets. Time-sharing companies like Tymshare, which ran its nationwide network on SDS 940s, were encountering sales resistance at all levels. With the education, government, and aerospace industries all slumping simultaneously, nearly every market SDS served was on the rocks.</p>
<p class="para">此外，由于 PDP-10 的出现，SDS 不再处于分时市场的前沿，而 Project Genie 的工作曾将其置于这一前沿。即使是长期客户在看到新的 DEC 机器后也放弃了对 SDS 940 的租约。这是一个不祥的趋势。旧的 SDS 租约是一颗财政定时炸弹：它们允许客户在到期前归还机器，以获得未到期期限的全额按比例抵免。不幸的是，SDS 早就将全期租赁付款记录为收入。这意味着，当计算机从故障或缺陷客户那里恢复时，SDS 将不得不重新计算其已报告的前几个季度的利润，并很可能将其重新列为亏损。</p><p class="para">Moreover, thanks to the PDP-10, SDS no longer found itself on the cutting edge of the time-sharing market, where it had been placed by the work of Project Genie. Even long-term customers turned in their leases on the SDS 940 once they got a look at the new DEC machine. That was an ominous trend. The old SDS leases were a fiscal time bomb: They permitted the customers to return their machines prior to expiration for a full pro-rata credit on the unexpired period. Unfortunately, SDS had long since recorded the full-term lease payments as revenue. This meant that as computers came back from failed or defecting clients SDS would have to recalculate the profits it had already reported for earlier quarters and quite possibly restate them—as losses.</p>

<p class="para">让市场萎缩的困境雪上加霜的是，彼得·麦考洛 (Peter McColough) 决心将 SDS 推向新的市场：由 IBM 统治的商业数据处理业务。</p><p class="para">Adding to the predicament of shrinking markets was Peter McColough’s determination to push SDS into a new one: the business data processing business ruled by IBM.</p>
<p class="para">尽管麦考洛因这一策略而受到严厉批评，但这一策略实际上可能源自马克斯·帕列夫斯基。这位 SDS 创始人一直将自己的公司与 IBM 进行比较。在局外人看来，这就像将小狗与马进行比较；无论小狗长得多大，都无法与 IBM 同场竞技。然而，在施乐出售后的几周内，帕列夫斯基公开幻想将施乐的资本基础置于 SDS 的工程技术之上，并联手对抗蓝色巨人。（很久以后，他暗示他只是告诉麦考洛施乐首席执行官想听到的话。）</p><p class="para">Although McColough has been roundly chastised for this strategy, it may actually have originated with Max Palevsky. The SDS founder had always weighed his company against IBM as a benchmark. To outsiders this resembled weighing a puppy against a horse; no matter how big it grows, it can never play in the same league. Yet in the weeks following the Xerox sale Palevsky had openly fantasized about placing Xerox’s capital base behind the engineering skills of SDS and marching jointly into war against Big Blue. (Much later he hinted he was only telling McColough what the Xerox CEO wanted to hear.)</p>
<p class="para">对于业内其他人来说，进入 IBM 的办公室似乎是一件<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch07.html.page101"></a>愚蠢之举。蓝色巨人并不总是提供市场上技术最先进的产品，而且经常收取最高的价格，但其销售和营销的残酷性弥补了这些不足（并引发了与联邦反垄断当局的激烈斗争）。那些试图将 IBM 从王位上赶下来的公司通常都会在尝试中惨败。即使是工业巨头通用电气和 RCA 也曾遭遇同样的命运，在十年的努力中总共损失了 6 亿美元后，它们放弃了。</p><p class="para">To the rest of the industry the act of stepping into IBM’s den seemed a <a></a>fool’s errand. Big Blue did not always offer the most technologically advanced products in the market and frequently charged the highest prices, but the ruthlessness of its sales and marketing more than made up for these shortcomings (and fomented an epic battle with federal antitrust authorities). Companies that tried to dislodge IBM from its perch generally got butchered in the attempt. That had been the fate even of the industrial powerhouses General Electric and RCA, which had given up after losing a combined $600 million in ten years of trying.</p>
<p class="para">市场上仅存的五家大型计算机制造商被称为“Bunch”。这个术语是这些公司名称的首字母缩写——Burroughs、（Sperry）Univac、NCR、Control Data 和 Honeywell——但也是描述性的。Bunch 远远落后于 IBM，就像一群纯种马在努力跟上 Secretariat 的步伐。从 1960 年到 1970 年，这五家竞争对手总共亏损了 1.67 亿美元，而 IBM 的利润却超过 35 亿<span class="italic">美元</span>。</p><p class="para">The only major competitors left in the market were five large computer makers known familiarly as the “Bunch.” The term was an acronym of their names—Burroughs, (Sperry) Univac, NCR, Control Data, and Honeywell—but it was also descriptivè. The Bunch trailed IBM in a distant cluster, like a field of thoroughbreds struggling to keep up with Secretariat. From 1960 through 1970 the five competitors lost a combined $167 million while IBM racked up profits of more than $3.5 <span class="italic">billion</span>.</p>
<p class="para">彼得·麦考洛现在提议驾驭 SDS 进入这个死亡之谷。这个想法几乎表明他对整个计算机行业，尤其​​是他自己的子公司一无所知，因为几乎没有哪家公司比他更不具备应对这场特殊战斗的资格。</p><p class="para">Into this valley of death Peter McColough now proposed to ride SDS. The very notion all but proclaimed his ignorance of the computer industry in general and his own subsidiary in particular, for there could scarcely exist a company less qualified to take on this particular fight.</p>
<p class="para">“我们没有工具来做这件事，”罗伯特·斯宾拉德回忆道。</p><p class="para">“We did not have the tools to do it,” Robert Spinrad recalled.</p>
<p class="para">鲍勃·斯宾拉德是一位经验丰富的科学家和工程师，他不张扬，但分析严谨。他是一位老派的绅士，圆脸，眉毛浓密，像感叹号一样。斯宾拉德于 1968 年加入 SDS，负责管理其软件组，此前他在布鲁克海文国家实验室工作了几年，当时首选的计算机就是 SDS 机器。现在，他发现自己不情愿地卷入了麦科洛鲁莽的讨伐。首席执行官下达命令后不久，斯宾拉德会见了施乐公司的几名官员，他们从斯坦福被派到埃尔塞贡多，评估该部门在新市场的竞争力。</p><p class="para">Bob Spinrad was an experienced scientist and engineer, unassertive but rigorously analytical. He was a gregarious gentleman of the old school, with a round face marked by eyebrows as dark and emphatic as exclamation points. Spinrad had joined SDS in 1968 to run its software group after several years at Brookhaven National Laboratory, where the computer of choice was an SDS machine. Now he found himself swept unwillingly into McColough’s foolhardy crusade. Shortly after the chief executive’s decree, Spinrad met with a couple of Xerox officials sent belatedly from Stamford to El Segundo to appraise the division’s competitive ability in the new market.</p>
<p class="para">他们问道：“你的 COBOL 编译器有多好？” COBOL 是一种繁琐的编程语言，用于重复且简单的业务程序，例如工资单和预算。听到这个问题后，鲍勃·斯宾拉德 (Bob Spinrad) 第一次意识到 COBOL 编译器的庞大规模<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch07.html.page102"></a>公司面临的任务。科学和研究程序员，就像那些为 SDS 及其传统客户工作的程序员一样，绝对不会使用 COBOL 语言，他们认为 COBOL 是一种蹩脚的语言，只适合办事员和杂工。他在椅子上不安地挪动着身子。</p><p class="para">“How good is your COBOL compiler?” they asked. COBOL was the tedious programming language used for repetitive and uncomplicated business programs such as payrolls and budgets. On hearing the question, Bob Spinrad recognized as though for the first time the enormity of <a></a>the task confronting the company. Scientific and research programmers, like those who worked for SDS and its traditional customers, would not be caught dead working in COBOL, which they considered a lame language suitable only for clerks and drones. He shifted uneasily in his chair.</p>
<p class="para">他告诉来访者：“问题不在于我们的 COBOL 编译器有多好。”</p><p class="para">“It’s not a question of how good our COBOL compiler is,” he told the visitors.</p>
<p class="para">“为什么不？”</p><p class="para">“Why not?”</p>
<p class="para">“因为我们没有。”</p><p class="para">“Because we don’t have one.”</p>
<p class="para">施乐完全误解了科学计算和商业计算之间的区别，SDS 可能需要付出很大努力才能在科学计算领域站稳脚跟，而商业计算领域它根本无法成功。该公司无法提供任何商业客户理所当然期望的产品线的一小部分，无论是高速行式打印机还是强大的数据库程序。正如斯宾拉德回忆的那样，“很多对于服务于商业环境的公司来说平淡无奇的标准操作程序根本不在我们的词汇或武器库中。”</p><p class="para">Xerox had thoroughly misunderstood the difference between scientific computing, in which SDS might with great effort manage to hold its own, and business computing, in which it was a non-starter. The company could not offer a fraction of the product line any business client would expect as a matter of course, whether high-speed line printers or robust database programs. As Spinrad recalled, “A lot of things that were ho-hum standard operating procedure for companies that served a commercial environment just weren’t in our lexicon or armament.”</p>
<p class="para">这一事件的后果是埃尔塞贡多的士气遭遇了严重危机，每一位员工都明白公司的局限性、改变方针有多么困难以及施乐公司无论如何都要改变方针的决心有多么坚定。</p><p class="para">The harvest was a profound morale crisis in El Segundo, where every employee understood what the company’s limitations were, how hard it would be to change course, and how determined Xerox was to do it anyway.</p>
<p class="para">一个周末，麦格克召集各部门主管到洛杉矶国际机场附近的一家酒店“休养”，以解决难题。他们分成几个学习小组，一直讨论到深夜，周日下午又围坐在一张很长的会议桌旁开会。</p><p class="para">One weekend McGurk summoned his department heads to a weekend “retreat” in a hotel near Los Angeles International Airport to iron out the difficulties.

<p class="para">在这种令人沮丧的气氛中，PARC 对 PDP-10 的要求像手榴弹一样爆炸了。就在几个月前，SDS 推出了其最新的科学计算机 Sigma 7，该计算机的设计专门针对<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch07.html.page103"></a>准备与 PDP-10 正面竞争。SDS 接到命令要对 IBM 市场发起正面攻击，但现在，它却感到被自己的公司兄弟发起的后卫行动绊倒了。</p><p class="para">In this cheerless atmosphere PARC’s request for a PDP-10 detonated like a grenade. It had been only a few months earlier that SDS had launched its latest scientific computer, the Sigma 7—designed specifi<a></a>cally to compete head to head with the PDP-10. Having been ordered to stage a frontal assault on IBM’s market, SDS now felt tripped up by the rearguard action launched by its own corporate brethren.</p>
<p class="para">SDS 高管立即在总部发起了一场运动，以否决该提案。“我支持任何能阻止他们购买那台电脑的事情，”Currie 回忆道，他向斯坦福高层概述了一种方案，即像<span class="italic">Datamation</span>这样的计算机行业杂志在其封面上刊登一张 DEC 卡车停在 Xerox PARC 装卸码头的照片。之后再尝试向其他客户销售 Sigma 机器吧！</p><p class="para">SDS executives wasted no time in starting a campaign at headquarters to kill the proposal. “I was for anything that would keep them from buying that computer,” recalled Currie, who outlined for the Stamford brass a scenario in which a computing trade magazine like <span class="italic">Datamation</span> splashed a photograph across its front cover of a DEC truck pulled up to the loading dock of Xerox PARC. Try selling a Sigma machine to another customer after that!</p>
<p class="para">泰勒坚称，他的团队认为 PDP-10 显然优于 Sigma，因此他们从未考虑过他们的要求在埃尔塞贡多会引起怎样的反响。但他们不可能完全忽视斯坦福老板将大型计算机视为可替代商品的事实，它们彼此之间非常相似。毕竟，这些人一开始就买错了计算机公司，然后又鼓励该公司在明显不合适的市场上竞争，这让失言更加严重。他们认为 PARC 坚持购买竞争对手的机器是一种纯粹的反常行为，这一点并不令人意外。</p><p class="para">Taylor maintained that his group considered the PDP-10 so self-evidently superior to the Sigma they never gave a moment’s thought to how their request would resonate in El Segundo. Yet they could not have been entirely blind to the fact that the Stamford bosses regarded big computers as fungible commodities, one very much like another. After all, these were the people who had bought the wrong computer company to begin with, then compounded the gaffe by urging it to compete in a manifestly inappropriate market. No one should have been surprised that they would regard PARC’s insistence on buying a rival company’s machine as an act of sheer perversity.</p>
<p class="para">正式否决该请求的任务落到了公司新任首席信息官保罗·斯特拉斯曼 (Paul Strassmann) 身上，他是一位系统专家。斯特拉斯曼的主要工作是在施乐目前运行 IBM 机器的地方安装一台 SDS 计算机。他具备出色的资质，因为他在前一家公司卡夫食品担任计算主管期间，最大的成就就是淘汰了性能不佳的 IBM 360 数据处理计算机系统，并用霍尼韦尔计算机取而代之。</p><p class="para">The task of formally vetoing the request fell to the company’s new chief information officer, a systems expert named Paul Strassmann. Strassmann’s primary job was to install an SDS computer wherever Xerox currently ran an IBM machine. He came with sterling qualifications, since his greatest accomplishment as the computing czar at his previous company, Kraft Foods, was to junk its system of underperforming IBM 360 data processing computers and replace them with Honeywells.</p>
<p class="para">IBM 试图以这种罕见的冒犯行为解雇斯特拉斯曼，但未能成功，这让他对自己的判断力充满信心。斯特拉斯曼性格严肃，操着日耳曼口音，很快在 PARC 赢得了“普鲁士人”的绰号，他认为自己最重要的角色是施乐的技术警察。他不抱幻想，认为强迫 SDS 与 IBM 竞争是愚蠢的，他认为这是管理层“事后才想到的”。但他也相信，自己的责任是控制施乐不兼容计算机的泛滥<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch07.html.page104"></a>世界各地的办公室。他不会为了取悦任何人（包括研究大拿）而草率批准一份价值 50 万美元的 DEC 计算机采购订单。他把 PDP-10 订单退回给 PARC，并指示 PARC 以书面形式逐点说明技术依据。</p><p class="para">IBM’s failed attempt to get him fired for this rare affront had left Strassmann with no shortage of self-confidence in his own judgment. A severe character whose Teutonic accent soon won him the nickname “the Prussian” at PARC, he imagined his greater role to be that of Xerox’s technological policeman. He harbored no illusions about the stupidity of forcing SDS to compete with IBM, a move he regarded as “just a spastic afterthought” by management. But he also believed his responsibility was to ride herd on the proliferation of incompatible computers at Xerox <a></a>offices around the globe. He was not about to rubber-stamp a half-million-dollar purchase order for a DEC computer to please anyone, research hotshots included. He boomeranged the PDP-10 order back to PARC with instructions to produce a point-by-point technical justification, in writing.</p>
<p class="para">这件事成为了施乐公司东海岸和西海岸之间长达 15 年沟通不畅和敌对关系的开始。“我告诉他们，让我看看 PDP-10 能做到什么，而 Sigma 7 做不到，”斯特拉斯曼回忆道。“这就是那些强硬的公司信息官们会做的事情。他们说，‘给我看一份竞争分析报告。’但 PARC 从来没有发过。他们认为向总部的人展示技术分析报告有失身份。他们不知道如何像企业公民一样行事。他们只是说，‘别问问题。’”</p><p class="para">This turned out to be the start of fifteen years of miscommunication and hostility between Xerox’s east coast and west. “I told them to show me what the PDP—10 would do that the Sigma 7 wouldn’t,” Strassmann recalled. “This is what hardass corporate information officers do. They say, ‘Show me a competitive analysis.’ But PARC never sent one. They thought it was beneath them to show a technical analysis to the headquarters guys. They didn’t know how to act like corporate citizens. They just said, ‘Don’t ask questions.’”</p>
<p class="para">这场争斗持续了数周。SDS 官方的说法是，PDP 在研究人员中比 Sigma 更受欢迎纯粹是时间上的巧合，很快就会得到纠正。正如 Currie 回忆的那样，他是一个精明的计算机专家，但他的判断力受到他在 SDS 的职位的影响，“PDP 比 Sigma 早一点推出，而且他们主要在软件方面领先于我们。”他认为这个问题归根结底是“宗教问题”，而 PARC 作为一家新的施乐工厂至少可以尝试一种新的神学。在斯坦福，这场争斗被看得更加简单。总部的高管们认为软件是使机器运转的官僚主义，就像仓鼠驱动轮子一样。他们无法理解为什么在 PDP-10 和 Sigma 之间的决定需要比选择一只白化啮齿动物而不是棕色啮齿动物更复杂。</p><p class="para">The battle raged for weeks. The official SDS line was that the PDP’s popularity over the Sigma among researchers was purely an accident of timing and would soon correct itself. As Currie, a savvy enough computer man but one whose judgment was colored by his position at SDS, recalled, “The PDP had come out a little earlier than the Sigma and they were ahead of us mostly in software.” He thought the issue boiled down to “a question of religion,” and the least PARC could do as a new Xerox facility was try a new theology on for size. In Stamford the battle was viewed even more simple-mindedly. Headquarters executives thought of software as the gobbledygook that made a machine run, like the hamster driving the wheel. They could not understand why the decision between the PDP—10 and the Sigma needed to be any more complicated than, say, choosing an albino rodent over a brown one.</p>
<p class="para">但从技术角度来看，这个问题并非那么简单。软件是决定 Sigma 和 PDP 机器之间根本不兼容以及后者在 PARC 中的优越性的因素。这两台计算机的架构截然不同，以至于为 PDP 编写的软件无法完全适应 Sigma 为数据分配的内存空间。即使程序可以运行（前景不乐观），它也<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch07.html.page105"></a>在 Sigma 上，需要的内存几乎是 PDP 10 的两倍。考虑到当时内存价格昂贵，这是一个重大缺陷。</p><p class="para">But from a technical point of view, the issue was hardly that casual. Software was the factor that defined the fundamental incompatibility between the Sigma and PDP machines and the superiority, for PARC’s purposes, of the latter. The architectures of the two computers were so radically different that software written for the PDP would not properly fit into the memory space the Sigma allocated for data. Even if the program could be made to run—a doubtful prospect—it would <a></a>require nearly twice as much memory to run as fast on the Sigma as it did on the PDP—10. Given the high price of memory at the time, this was a major shortcoming.</p>
<p class="para">尽管理论上可以简单地将所有 PDP 软件“移植”到 Sigma，但 CSL 工程师计算出这样的工作意味着重写每个 PDP 程序的每一行，这项任务将花费三年时间并耗费 400 万美元。</p><p class="para">Although it was theoretically possible to simply “port” all the PDP software over to the Sigma, the CSL engineers calculated that such a job would mean rewriting every single line of every PDP program, a task that would take three years and cost $4 million.</p>
<p class="para">兰普森后来表示，“我们所做分析中唯一的谎言是，我们实际上根本做不到这一点，因为你不可能激励人们去做这样一件毫无意义的事情。”</p><p class="para">“The only lie in the analysis we did,” Lampson later remarked, “was that we never could actually have done it because you couldn’t have motivated people to do such a pointless thing.”</p>
<p class="para">这确实正是斯特拉斯曼所要求的技术分析。他也收到了这份分析报告，作为实验室资金申请的一部分——但由于这份分析报告侧重于软件成本，因此并不是他所期望的那种分析，他所期望的应该是对两台机器进行逐个硬件的比较。</p><p class="para">This was, indeed, the very technical analysis Strassmann had demanded. He received it, too, as part of the lab’s capital request—but because it focused on software costs it was not the sort of analysis he expected, which would have been a hardware-by-hardware comparison of the two machines.</p>
<p class="para">“从某种程度上来说，我们是在做假账，”兰普森后来表示，“但实际上，这是一种非常准确的方式，可以将计算研究的事实转化为斯特拉斯曼能够理解的美元数字。”</p><p class="para">“In a way we were cooking the books,” Lampson stated later, “but actually this was a pretty accurate way of turning the facts about doing computing research into dollar numbers that Strassmann could understand.”</p>
<p class="para">与此同时，泰勒邀请了一群埃尔塞贡多的设计师到帕洛阿尔托，就技术问题进行了为期两天的“讨论”。他的目标是说服他们，Sigma 和 PDP-10 并不是真正在同一市场上竞争，因此他们应该退缩。然而，他的工程师们并没有像他所希望的那样进行文明对话，而是当着 Sigma 设计师和坐在旁边的 Pake 的面，毫不留情地剖析 Sigma 的缺点。</p><p class="para">Meanwhile, Taylor invited a group of El Segundo designers to Palo Alto for a two-day “discourse” on the technical issues. His goal was to persuade them that the Sigma and PDP—10 were not really competing in the same market, and they should therefore back off. Instead of engaging in the civil dialogue he had hoped for, however, his cocksure engineers pitilessly dissected the Sigma’s shortcomings in front of its designers and Pake, who was sitting in.</p>
<p class="para">泰勒不得不承认，这件事彻底不了了之。“最后就像是一场审判，”他说。“巴特勒和查克·萨克非常了解西格玛系统，他们刚刚摧毁了西格玛 7。他们让 SDS 的人大吃一惊。”当审讯终于结束时，帕克把泰勒拉到一边。“你肯定认识一群聪明人，”他说。“巴特勒·兰普森似乎比他们更了解那些家伙的机器。”</p><p class="para">Taylor had to admit that the affair was a complete frost. “It ended up like a trial,” he said. “Butler and Chuck Thacker knew the Sigma system very well, and they just demolished the Sigma 7. They gave the SDS people fits.” When the inquisition finally concluded, Pake took Taylor aside. “You sure know a bunch of smart people,” he said. “Butler Lampson seems to understand those guys’ machines better than they do.”</p>
<p class="para">尽管帕克努力寻找停战的理由，但双方似乎都无法让步。他回忆说：“我问我的伙计们，‘我们有没有办法<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch07.html.page106"></a>“我们可以重新配置 Sigma 机器并使其工作吗？”所有人的回答都是否定的。与此同时，我们与 SDS 进行了交谈，看他们是否有兴趣进行任何更改。他们没有兴趣。他们想把他们拥有的一切都卖给我们。”</p><p class="para">Neither side seemed able to budge, despite Pake’s efforts to find grounds for a truce. He recalled “I asked my guys, ‘Is there any way we <a></a>can reconfigure that Sigma machine and make it work?’ The answer kept coming back no from everybody. Meanwhile we talked to SDS to see if they were interested in making any changes. They weren’t. They wanted to sell us whatever they had.”</p>
<p class="para">帕克的绝望情绪传到了计算机科学家的耳朵里。选择确实很渺茫。他们可以接受 Sigma，这意味着他们要忍受一台不合格的机器<span class="italic">，并</span>在第一次利益冲突时屈服于公司的诉讼。或者他们可以坚持自己的立场，威逼施乐公司购买 PDP。“但这会让我们损失很多加分，我们认为这不是一个好主意，”兰普森回忆道。在激烈的讨论中，他们多次听到有人建议他们都应该辞职。</p><p class="para">Pake’s desperation communicated itself to the computer scientists. The choices indeed looked bleak. They could accept the Sigma, which meant suffering with an inadequate machine <span class="italic">and</span> knuckling under to the corporate suits the very first time their interests conflicted. Or they could stand their ground and browbeat Xerox into buying them the PDP. “But that would cost us so many brownie points we figured it was not a good idea,” Lampson recalled. Not a few times in the heat of discussion was the suggestion heard that they should all just quit.</p>
<p class="para">然而，一种不同的、更强大的冲动开始显现。这相当于工程师的“战斗或逃跑”综合症，即当遇到障碍时，本能不是退缩，而是冲过去。</p><p class="para">Yet a different impulse, one much more powerful, was beginning to assert itself. This was the engineer’s equivalent to the “fight or flight” syndrome, the instinct when confronted by an obstacle not to back off, but to barrel through it.</p>
<p class="para">“我们开始进行长时间的讨论，”艾伦·凯回忆道。“我说，‘我们先不要把徽章扔掉。让我们仔细考虑一下。’”另一个人建议，也许他们从错误的角度看待这个问题。他们把硬件（购买哪种机器）变成了一个问题，而他们真正关心的是软件（他们可以运行哪些程序）。如果他们只是自己制造一台机器来运行他们需要的程序会怎么样？</p><p class="para">“We started having these long discussions,” Alan Kay remembered. “I was saying, ‘Let’s not chuck our badges in just yet. Let’s think it through.’” Someone else suggested that perhaps they were looking at the question from the wrong end. They had made an issue out of hardware—what machine to buy—when their real concern was software—what programs they could run. What if they simply built their own machine to run the programs they needed?</p>
<p class="para">提出问题就等于回答问题。“讨论的焦点是，”凯说，“我们要花多长时间才能<span class="italic">制造</span>出自己的 PDP-10。”答案是大约一年，花费不到 100 万美元。事实是，施乐公司只是禁止实验室购买 PDP-10。没有人说过要克隆一台。</p><p class="para">Asking the question was the same as answering it. “The talk,” Kay said, “turned to how long it would take us to <span class="italic">build</span> our own PDP—10.” The answer was about one year and less than $1 million. The truth was that Xerox had only forbidden the lab to buy a PDP—10. Nobody had said anything about cloning one.</p>
<p class="para">“我们无所畏惧，”兰普森回忆道。“我们制造的 BCC 机器比 PDP-10 复杂得多，也精密得多。此外，底层技术发展非常迅速，所以我们实际上拥有更好的物理资源。我们非常有信心，我们可以用相当少的努力和很少的风险来制造这个东西。事实证明这是完全正确的。”他说，这台机器“<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch07.html.page107"></a>并不是因为施乐拒绝让我们购买 PDP-10，而是因为我们认为这是阻力最小的路径。”</p><p class="para">“We were fearless,” Lampson recalled. “We had built this BCC machine which was a substantially more complicated and elaborate machine than a PDP—10. And furthermore the underlying technology was evolving very rapidly, so we actually had much better physical resources at our disposal. We had great confidence that we could build this thing with a fairly modest investment of effort, and very little risk. Which turned out to be absolutely correct.” The machine, he said, “was <a></a>not built because Xerox refused to let us buy a PDP—10, but because we thought it was the path of least resistance.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">克隆工作于二月开始。萨克担任项目经理，并承担设计内部逻辑的基本任务。其他工作则随意分配给实验室成员，就像镇民在社区谷仓建造中一样，通常与他们最擅长的工作没有多大关系——但是，任何能通过泰勒的选拔程序的人都被认为足够聪明，可以学到任何东西。例如，兰普森是一位<span class="italic">无与伦比的</span>操作系统设计师，但 Tenex 已经有了自己的操作系统。因此，他被强迫设计中央处理器，这是一项他一生中从未做过的硬件任务。</p><p class="para">Work on the clone began in February. Thacker assumed the role of project manager as well as the bedrock task of designing the internal logic. The other jobs got apportioned out to the lab members willy-nilly, as among townspeople at a community barn-raising, often with little relation to the work in which they were most expert—but then, anyone who could make it through Taylor’s selection process was assumed to be smart enough to learn anything. Lampson was an operating systems designer <span class="italic">nonpareil</span>, for example, but with Tenex they already had their operating system. So he was dragooned into designing the central processor, a hardware task unlike anything he had ever undertaken in his life.</p>
<p class="para">另一个被卷入该项目的人是埃德·麦克雷特 (Ed McCreight)，他是波音公司的前工程师，性格开朗，刚上任才一两个星期，“四处寻找工作机会”。在 PARC，没有人能长时间保持这种状态。萨克说服他设计磁盘控制器，这是一种硬件单元，可以监控机器将数据移入和移出旋转磁性硬盘的方式。麦克雷特回忆道：“我告诉他，‘我对磁盘控制器一无所知，但我愿意。如果你答应回答我所有的问题，我就去做。’”</p><p class="para">Another who got swept into the project was Ed McCreight, an ex-Boeing engineer of unshakably sunny disposition who was still in his first week or two on the job, “rummaging around for something to do.” No one could remain in that state for long at PARC. Thacker lassoed him into designing the disk controller, a hardware unit that would supervise the way the machine moved data to and from a spinning magnetic hard disk. McCreight recalled, “I told him, ‘I don’t know squat about disk controllers but, hey, I’m game. If you promise to answer all of my questions I’ll do it.’”</p>
<p class="para">他们都很勇敢，因为他们认为这项任务就是建造自己的实验室。泰勒向他的员工传授的一条原则是，他们建造的东西必须设计成供日常使用。太多研究实验室生产出来的都是玩具和原型，设计成放在架子上，仿佛只是为了展示。</p><p class="para">They all were game because they viewed the task as the construction of their own laboratory. One principle Taylor imparted to his people was that the things they built had to be designed for daily use. Too many research labs turned out playthings and prototypes designed to go on a shelf, as though merely for display.</p>
<p class="para">“他们展示了许多精彩的东西，但最终却没有什么成果，”他抱怨道。在他的任期内，这种情况不会发生。他们不会制造任何不能投入使用的东西，因为这是最终发现这些东西是否有用的唯一方法。</p><p class="para">“They show wonderful things and nothing much ever comes of them,” he complained. That would not happen on his watch. They would build nothing that could not be put to work, because that was the only way to find out in the end if the stuff was any good.</p>
<p class="para">这条规则将成为 PARC 创造性方法的标志之一。毫无疑问，它对经历过伯克利计算机痛苦经历的 CSL 成员来说具有特殊意义，伯克利计算机的机器过于依赖理想主义的设计，而对<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch07.html.page108"></a>务实的工作态度。正如 Kay 回忆的那样，“BCC 的人出现几周后，Butler 在一次会议上站了起来。BCC 失败了，他还在发泄。他说他厌倦了 60 年代，那时你的东西‘有点’管用，通常可以让它工作足够长的时间进行演示，但仅此而已。他说我们应该决定永远不要在 PARC 制造不是为 100 个用户设计的任何东西。如果我们要建造一台分时计算机，它应该支持 100 个人，一个网络应该支持 100 个连接，等等。我们对此的最初反应是，‘哎呀，这真的会限制我们的风格。’但事实上，为了支持 100 个用户，我们必须在每件事上投入额外的思考，这让事情变得更好，甚至可能让我们的速度提高了三倍。”</p><p class="para">This rule would become one of the hallmarks of PARC’s creative method. Undoubtedly it held special meaning for the CSL members who had lived through the painful saga of Berkeley Computer, whose machine relied too much on idealistic designs and not enough on <a></a>working pragmatism. As Kay recalled, “Within a couple of weeks after the BCC people showed up Butler got up at a meeting. BCC had failed and he was still venting. He said he was sick and tired of the sixties, when your stuff ‘sort of’ worked and you could usually get it to work long enough for a demo, but that was about it. He said we should decide never to make something at PARC that isn’t engineered for a hundred users. If we were building a time-sharing computer, it should support a hundred people, a network should take a hundred connections, and so on. Our initial reaction to that was, ‘Gee, it’s really going to cramp our style.’ But in fact the extra thought we had to put into everything in order to support it for a hundred users made things work so much better that it probably sped us up by a factor of three.”</p>
<p class="para">他们正在构建自己的计算环境，这一想法激励他们以极快的速度工作，就像定居者在严冬来临之前匆忙搭建一个简陋的避难所一样。实验室发生了几乎炼金术般的变化，充满了纯粹的发现兴奋，研究经理一生中能见证一次这样的变化是幸运的。后来人们会争辩说，被迫克隆 PDP-10 是 CSL 经历过的最好的事情——甚至斯特拉斯曼最终也吹嘘说：“我让每个人都成了英雄。”他们指的是这个时期，一群不同的人才聚集在一起，欣赏共同应对几乎没有先例的挑战的优点，空气中充满了新的想法。然后还有测试他们对新技术的掌握的额外满足感。“很有趣，”兰普森后来说道，“看到它有多么容易。”</p><p class="para">The idea that they were building their own computing environment galvanized them into working at breakneck speed, like settlers hastening to erect a rudimentary shelter before the onset of a hard winter. An almost alchemical change overtook the lab, infusing it with the pure excitement of discovery that a research manager may be lucky to witness once in a lifetime. People would contend later that being forced to clone the PDP—10 was the best thing that ever happened to CSL—even Strassmann eventually bragged, “I made everyone a hero.” This is the period they were referring to, when a bunch of disparate talents came together in appreciation of the virtues of working together on challenges that had virtually no precedent and the air filled with new ideas. Then there was the added satisfaction of testing their mastery of a new technology. “It was fun,” Lampson said later, “to see how easy it was.”</p>
<p class="para">根本问题是，PDP-10 的物理设计属于数字设备公司，因此不能简单地复制，至少不能合法复制。无论如何，PARC 没有人花足够的时间在机器内部逐个电路复制它。诀窍是将这一限制转化为优势。由于手头的任务并不是真正制造一台 PDP-10，而只是制造一台遵循与 PDP-10 相同指令的机器，因此没有理由不寻找捷径。他们都知道，最好的捷径是用自己的微代码代替 PDP-10 的接线。</p><p class="para">The fundamental problem was that to the extent the PDP—10’s physical design belonged to Digital Equipment Corporation it could not simply be copied, at least not legally. In any case, no one at PARC had spent enough time inside that machine to reproduce it circuit for circuit. The trick was to turn this limitation into an advantage. Since the task at hand was not really to build a PDP—10, only a machine that would follow the same instructions as a PDP—10, there was no reason not to find a shortcut. The best shortcut, as they all knew, was to substitute their own microcode for the PDP—10’s wiring.</p>
<p class="para">事实上，DEC 的机器正是“硬<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch07.html.page109"></a>有线”计算机。它的运行取决于晶体管的物理配置；这些晶体管被排列成错综复杂的“门”——传统数字计算机的构建块，它们在一端接收电脉冲，并根据二进制数学和十九世纪布尔逻辑的规则传递、传播、阻止或修改它们。</p><p class="para">DEC’s machine, as it happened, was the epitome of the “hard<a></a>wired” computer. Its operation depended on the physical configuration of its transistors; these were arranged into intricately linked “gates”—the building blocks of traditional digital computers that received electrical impulses at one end and passed, propagated, blocked, or modified them according to the rules of binary mathematics and nineteenth-century Boolean logic.</p>
<p class="para">数以千计的这些设备经过精心布置，可以构造出一台能够进行加、减、乘、除运算的机器；能够从电传打字机读取字符并将其输出到阴极射线屏幕；或者能够预测发射导弹的轨迹。但是，不再需要用电线和晶体管来构造门电路。CSL 工程师计划用一类称为微代码的软件来代替 PDP-10 中的大部分复杂电路。</p><p class="para">From thousands of these devices, artfully arranged, could be constructed a machine able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide; read a character from a teletype and output it to a cathode-ray screen; or forecast the trajectory of a launched missile. But it was no longer necessary to fashion the gates out of wires and transistors. In place of much of the PDP—10’s intricate circuitry the CSL engineers planned to substitute a class of software known as microcode.</p>
<p class="para">我们可以把微码看作是一种允许数字信号复制硬接线机器电路的曲折而不必实际穿越物理路径的方法。微码检查编程指令，确定如果指令完全按照所有接线进行操作，最终会到达哪里，然后将其存放到正确的位置，而无需进行艰苦的陆路跋涉。</p><p class="para">One can think of microcode as a way of allowing digital signals to replicate the twists and turns of a hard-wired machine’s circuits without actually traversing the physical pathways. Microcode examines a programmed instruction, determines where it would end up if it primly followed all the wiring, and deposits it in the right place without making the arduous overland trek.</p>
<p class="para">微代码相对于硬接线的巨大优势在于，正如 Lampson 所指出的，“用程序指令或微指令来表达复杂的东西比直接用门来表达要容易得多。”如果要检测硬接线机器中的错误，您必须拆除错误的电路并焊接新的电路。使用微代码，您只需重写程序即可。这就像从波士顿穿越美国到旧金山，您会发现穿过辛辛那提的柏油公路不是通往旧金山，而是通往圣地亚哥。微代码相当于登上飞机并改变飞行路线，而不是拆除并重新定位高速公路。</p><p class="para">Microcode’s great advantage over hard-wiring is that, as Lampson notes, “it’s much easier to express something complicated in program instructions, or micro-instructions, than directly in gates.” Detect a bug in a hard-wired machine and you have to rip out the errant circuits and solder in new ones. With microcode you just rewrite the program. It is as though in traversing the United States from Boston to San Francisco you find that the paved highway through Cincinnati leads not to San Francisco but San Diego. Microcode would be the equivalent of getting on an airplane and changing the flight path rather than ripping up and relocating the highway.</p>
<p class="para">为了追求这种简单性，将硬件转换为软件的过程极其复杂——数字信号在微代码中比在硬接线机器中需要更多的曲折；但对于 Taylor 的团队来说，它的奥秘是一扇打开的书。BCC 500 是微代码，Kay 为获得犹他州博士学位而设计的 FLEX 机器也是微代码。</p><p class="para">Translating hardware into software in quest of this simplicity is, as processes go, fiendishly complex—the digital signals take a lot more twists and turns in microcode than in a hard-wired machine; but to Taylor’s group its mysteries were an open book. The BCC 500 was micro-coded, as was the FLEX machine Kay designed for his Utah doctorate.</p>
<p class="para">“我们对微代码了解很多，”后者回忆道，他贡献了<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch07.html.page110"></a>在旁观 CSL 实际设计和制造机器的过程中，我们提出了一些概念性想法。“世界上最伟大的微程序员之一 Ed Fiala 和我们在一起，所以这是一个很大的优势。最伟大的硬件设计师之一 Thacker 也在场，这是一个很大的优势。缺点是只有大约十个人来做所有事情。而且必须快速完成。”</p><p class="para">“We knew a lot about microcode,” recalled the latter, who contributed <a></a>some conceptual ideas while observing CSL’s actual design and construction of the machine from the sidelines. “One of the world’s great micro-coders, Ed Fiala, was with us, so that was a big plus. One of the great hardware designers, Thacker, was there, that was a big plus. The minus was that there were only about ten people to do it all. And it had to be done quickly.”</p>
<p class="para">一旦他们确定了新的行动方针，整个世界突然向他们敞开了大门。他们不仅可以克隆 PDP，还可以对其<span class="italic">进行改进</span>。首先要做的是改进内存。PDP 机器使用铁氧体磁芯内存，这是自 1951 年由麻省理工学院的 Jay Forrester 发明以来，该内存一直是业界的标准。磁芯内存由编织成铜丝垫的微型环（或“磁芯”）制成，每个环都可以磁极化。磁芯保持或“记住”其电荷，直到被故意覆盖，留下一个模式可以读回并解释为存储中的数据位。</p><p class="para">Once they settled on-the new course of action, a whole world of possibilities suddenly opened to them. They could not only clone the PDP—10; they could <span class="italic">improve</span> on it. The first place to do so was the memory. PDP machines used ferrite core memory, the standard in the industry since its invention in 1951 by Jay Forrester at MIT. Core memories were made of tiny rings (or “cores”) woven into a mat of copper filaments that allowed each ring to be magnetically polarized. The cores held, or “remembered,” their charge until deliberately overridden, leaving a pattern to be read back and interpreted as data bits in storage.</p>
<p class="para">核心的最大优点是可靠性。但它必须手工制造，而且体积大、速度慢。例如，韦斯·克拉克的 TX-2 的 300 千字节核心内存是一块手工制作的约一立方码的块，或一个大文件柜的大小，造价约为 50 万美元。这个内存容量在当时很大，但以今天的标准来看却微不足道，因为台式计算机的半导体内存可以在几张信用卡的物理体积中容纳大约 100 倍的信息，成本约为 40 美元。</p><p class="para">Core’s great virtue was its reliability. But it had to be manufactured by hand and suffered from the defects of great bulkiness and slow speed. The 300-kilobyte core memory of Wes Clark’s TX—2, for instance, was a handmade block of about a cubic yard, or the size of a large file cabinet, costing roughly half a million dollars. This volume of memory was large for its time but trivial by today’s standards, when a desktop computer’s semiconductor memory can hold about one hundred times as much information in the physical volume of a couple of credit cards, at a cost of about forty dollars.</p>
<p class="para">到 1971 年，核心存储器即将被一种基于硅半导体的全新技术所取代。前一年十月，英特尔推出了一款容量为 1 千比特的内存芯片（即每块芯片有 1,024 比特内存），英特尔是一家年轻的工程公司，由因“摩尔定律”而出名的戈登·摩尔 (Gordon Moore) 共同创立。</p><p class="para">By 1971 core memories were about to be supplanted by a brand-new technology based on silicon semiconductors. The previous October a one-kilobit memory chip (that is, 1,024 bits of memory per chip) had been introduced by Intel, a young engineering company co-founded by Gordon Moore of “Moore’s law” fame.</p>
<p class="para">英特尔的 1103 芯片在计算机行业中很难被接受，主要是因为它的特殊性让系统设计师头疼不已。1103 内存是“易失性的”，这意味着一旦芯片电量耗尽，所有存储的数据都会被清除。由于 1103 的电荷有逐渐泄漏的趋势，因此必须用电脉冲对芯片进行数千次充电或刷新<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch07.html.page111"></a>一<span class="italic">秒钟</span>来防止数据蒸发。（相比之下，内核是“非易失性的”，这意味着它们可以无限期地保存存储的数据，无论是否充电。）1103 需要用户为其提供各种“奇怪的电压”，正如 Lampson 后来所说的那样，而且看起来它可能容易出现大量数据错误，这是由于设计师在其中塞入了微型晶体管的密度所致。</p><p class="para">Intel’s 1103 chip was struggling for acceptance in the computer industry, largely because its peculiarities gave system designers migraines. The 1103 memories were “volatile,” meaning that all the stored data were wiped out whenever the chip’s charge was lost. Because the 1103’s charge had a tendency to gradually leak away, the chip had to be recharged, or refreshed, by zapping it with an electrical impulse several thousand times <a></a>a <span class="italic">second</span> to keep data from evaporating. (Cores, by contrast, were “nonvolatile,” meaning they held their stored data indefinitely, charged or not.) The 1103 required users to supply it with all sorts of “weird voltages,” as Lampson later put it, and looked like it might be prone to a host of data errors arising from the density at which designers crammed it with microscopic transistors.</p>
<p class="para">这些缺陷使得 1103 成为了一个极其顽固和反常的发明。它的创始人戈登·摩尔称其为“人类有史以来最难使用的半导体”。它也很难制造。英特尔很难生产出经济实惠的芯片，因此不得不指派整个工程师和技术人员团队从事从生产线上流出的无用硅片中挑选出好芯片的苦差事，这项工作是如此令人厌恶，以至于被称为“粪便抛光”。</p><p class="para">Such flaws made the 1103 a spectacularly stubborn and perverse contrivance. Its patriarch, Gordon Moore, termed it “the most difficult-to-use semiconductor ever created by man.” It was also hard to manufacture. Intel had so much difficulty turning out an economical volume of working chips that it had to assign entire teams of engineers and technicians to the drudgery of picking good chips out from the river of useless silicon coming off the fabrication line, a job so fervently detested it was labeled “turd polishing.”</p>
<p class="para">然而，对于 CSL 团队来说，1103 的缺点是需要克服的障碍。“我们很清楚，内存应该是半导体的，尽管我们不知道这些芯片是否真的有效——后来发现它们不行，”兰普森回忆道。“我们当然希望使用更强大的芯片。但我们非常有信心，通过加入纠错功能，我们可以构建一个非常令人满意的系统<span class="italic">。</span> ”这还只是轻描淡写。正如 CSL 所知道的，只要他们能克服 1103 的多重缺陷，他们的机器就会拥有地球上最快、最可靠的内存。</p><p class="para">To the CSL team, however, the 1103’s shortcomings were obstacles to be overcome. “It seemed pretty clear to us that the memory should be semiconductor, although we didn’t really know whether those chips worked—and it turned out later that they don’t,” Lampson recalled. “We certainly would have preferred a more robust chip. But we were very confident that by putting in error correction we could make up a very satisfactory system that <span class="italic">would</span> work.” That was an understatement. As CSL well knew, if they could only overcome the 1103’s manifold obstinacies, their machine would boast the speediest and most reliable memory on Earth.</p>

From El Segundo was heard continuous carping that PARC had caused the division insupportable embarrassment by spurning its top-of-the-line product. This provoked Pake into an outburst that settled the matter once and for all. In a blistering memo he reminded headquarters that his best new engineers had voluntarily agreed to suspend bona fide research projects for the year or more it would take them to satisfy SDS’s querulous concerns. “It is unthinkable to me that Xerox sets me the task of hiring creative, imaginative, top-rank researchers and then expects me to insist that <a></a>they handcuff themselves with inappropriate equipment,” he wrote. “I will do my best to provide them with the kind of first-rate technical support it is reasonable to expect in Xerox research laboratories. If that is the wrong way to build a first-rate corporate research center for Xerox, then I am the wrong man for the job.”</p>

<p class="para">“我们喝了不少啤酒，想着给这个东西起什么名字，结果大家闹了不少笑话，”萨克回忆起他们想出“多路访问施乐计算机”正式名称的那一天。这个名字听起来很普通，但现场的每个人都明白这个笑话的意思。为了纪念将自己糟糕的计算机公司卖给施乐的那个人，PARC 承担的第一个重大项目将永远以首字母缩写“MAXC”而闻名。实验室的成员们从不忘记提醒外人，“‘C’ 不发音。”</p><p class="para">“A moderate amount of beer had been consumed and we were trying to figure out what to name this thing and there was considerable hilarity,” Thacker recalled of the day they came up with the formal moniker of “Multiple Access Xerox Computer.” It sounded conventional, but everyone on the scene got the joke. In honor of the man who had sold his lousy computer company to Xerox, the first major project undertaken by PARC would be known for all time by the acronym “MAXC.” No member of the lab ever forgot to remind outsiders, “The ‘C’ is silent.”</p>

<p class="para">“我们从头到尾都做了，”McCreight 说道。他们不再拘泥于 PDP-10 设计，能够以更快或更便宜的方式运行数十种功能。McCreight 的磁盘控制器就实现了这样的壮举。传统的磁盘控制器通常配备有自己独立的处理单元，就像剑龙拥有第二个大脑一样，这大大增加了它们的成本和复杂性。有一天，他在办公室仔细研究系统原理图时突然意识到，在某些时候，MAXC 的中央处理器在执行完一条指令后还未收到下一条指令，因此处于空闲但可用的状态，就像车道上无人看管的汽车一样。</p><p class="para">“We did everything, from soup to nuts,” McCreight said. Liberated from slavish adherence to the PDP—10 design, they were able to get dozens of functions running faster or cheaper. McCreight performed one such feat with his disk controller. Conventional disk controllers were generally equipped with their own separate processing units, like Stegosauruses with their second brains, which added significantly to their cost and complexity. Poring over the system schematics in his office one day, he was struck by the realization that there would occur certain periods when, having executed one instruction and not yet received the next, MAXC’s central processor would be idle but available, like a car left running unattended in the driveway.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch07.html.page113"></a>
<p class="para">“我对处理器了解得足够多，意识到我可以使用其中的一些空闲周期，”他回忆道。“实际上，我可以劫持处理器来为磁盘控制器做一些算术运算。如果我可以定期借用处理器来计算一些我需要计算的东西，我就不必在磁盘控制器中放入那么多门电路”——节省了另外几千美元的硬件成本。” McCreight 的认识是他们第一次接受“多任务”的概念——让处理器同时处理多项工作。在 MAXC 中以这种适度规模实施，注定会在以后带来巨大的回报。</p><p class="para">“I learned enough about the processor to realize I could use some of those spare cycles,” he recounted. “In effect I could kidnap the processor to do some arithmetic for the disk controller. I wouldn’t have to put so many gates into the disk controller”—saving another few thousand dollars in hardware—” if I could periodically borrow the processor to compute some of the things I needed to compute.” McCreight’s realization was their first embrace of the concept of “multitasking”—giving the processor numerous jobs to juggle at once. Implemented on this modest scale in MAXC, it was destined to pay enormous dividends later.</p>
<p class="para">与此同时，他们继续对 PDP-10 设计进行改进。如果在此过程中他们发现一些缺陷，即原设计者犯下的粗俗或粗俗，他们会毫不犹豫地予以修复。至少有一次，这导致 MAXC 变得过于<span class="italic">完美</span>。这就是 Fiala 浮点错误的故事。</p><p class="para">Meanwhile, they continued to inject refinements into the PDP—10 design. If along the way they discovered some flaw, an inelegance or vulgarity committed by the original designers, they had no compunction about fixing it. At least once this resulted in making MAXC <span class="italic">too</span> good. This was the episode of Fiala’s floating-point bug.</p>
<p class="para">浮点运算允许计算机处理巨大的数字，方法是将数字分成两部分：尾数（由有效数字组成）和指数（十的幂）。因此，数字 632,100,000 将被分成尾数 6.321 和指数 8（即 10 的 8 次方）。要在浮点运算中将两个数字相乘，计算机只需将尾数相乘并将指数相加即可。</p><p class="para">Floating point operations allow computers to handle huge numbers by breaking them into two pieces: the mantissa, which comprises the significant digits, and the exponent, which is a power of ten. Thus the number 632,100,000 would be split into a mantissa of 6.321 and an exponent of eight (i.e., 10 to the 8th power). To multiply two numbers in a floating-point operation, the computer simply multiplies the mantissas and sums the exponents.</p>
<p class="para">浮点函数对于高效利用计算机资源至关重要。但它们是最难在硬件中正确实现的函数之一。果然，在编写浮点微代码时，Fiala 发现了 PDP 硬件中的许多错误，或者至少是他可以改进的地方。他毫不犹豫地这样做了。正如 McCreight 回忆的那样，“他认为这是他的浮点，他必须让它比 PDP 更精确。”</p><p class="para">Floating point functions are critical to the efficient use of a computer’s resources. But they are among the most difficult to properly implement in hardware. Sure enough, while coding the floating point microcode Fiala discovered a number of bugs in the PDP hardware, or at least places where he could improve on it. Without thinking twice, he did so. As McCreight recalled, “He figured it’s his floating point, and it was up to him to make it more accurate than the PDP’s.”</p>
<p class="para">系统设计中一个典型的挫折就是，修复一个地方的错误往往会在其他地方引发其他错误，就像挤压气球的一端会导致气球在另一端鼓起来一样。本例中就发生了类似的事情。</p><p class="para">One of the classic frustrations of systems design is that fixing a bug in one place often creates others elsewhere, the way squeezing a balloon at one end makes it bulge out at the other. Something like that happened in this case.</p>
<p class="para">当 MAXC 团队试图启动一款为原始 PDP-10 编写的名为 Interlisp 的程序时，“出于某种原因，我们无法启动它，”McCreight 说。“我们甚至找不到<span class="italic">nil</span>，这是第一个<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch07.html.page114"></a>你在 Lisp 中寻找的东西——如果你找不到<span class="italic">nil</span>，你就有麻烦了。”经过几个小时的繁琐调查，他们发现问题在于 Interlisp 利用 PDP 低效的浮点算法来执行自己的代码。Fiala 的修复让程序陷入了完全混乱的状态，就好像有人在黑暗中重新布置了它的家具一样。不幸的是，他们建造 MAXC 的原因之一就是运行 Lisp。因此，尽管非常不情愿，Fiala 还是屈服于实验室其他人的压力——并重新编写了错误。</p><p class="para">When the MAXC team tried to launch a program called Interlisp that had been written for the original PDP—10, “for some reason we couldn’t bring it up,” McCreight said. “We couldn’t even find <span class="italic">nil</span>, which is the first <a></a>thing you look for in Lisp—if you can’t find <span class="italic">nil</span>, you’re in trouble.” The problem, as they discovered after hours of tedious investigation, was that Interlisp utilized the PDP’s inefficient floating-point algorithms to execute its own code. Fiala’s fixes left the program hopelessly confused, as though someone had rearranged its furniture in the dark. Unfortunately, one reason they were building MAXC was to run Lisp. So with a great show of reluctance, Fiala acceded to pressure from the rest of the lab—and programmed the bugs back in.</p>
<p class="para">正如他们所料，英特尔的 1103 内存芯片被证明是一个大麻烦。据说经过“粪便抛光”阶段的芯片仍然完好无损地到达了 PARC，其严重缺陷的设计完好无损。其中一个令人头疼的问题就是它们所谓的模式敏感性：某些位组合会导致中间位“翻转”，因此 1001 序列可能会被错误地读成 1101 或 1011。</p><p class="para">As they anticipated, Intel’s 1103 memory chips proved to be a major nuisance. The reputedly serviceable chips that survived the “turd polishing” stage still arrived at PARC with their deeply flawed design intact. Among the headaches was their so-called pattern sensitivity: Certain combinations of bits would cause an intermediate bit to “flip,” so that a sequence of 1001 might read out incorrectly as 1101 or 1011.</p>
<p class="para">萨克利用一个可以识别和重新翻转错误位的纠错系统解决了这个问题。只要错误一次只发生一次，这个系统就能正常工作。然而，最终第二个位会失败。萨克回忆道：“然后，你就会得到一个无意的错误，系统就会崩溃，我们必须更换芯片。”这种情况并不像看起来那么罕见。有一段时间，MAXC 拥有世界上所有计算机中最大的半导体内存，这一成就使 PARC 暂时成为英特尔最大的客户。大约 25,000 块 1103 被塞进四个六英尺高的机柜里，每个机柜有四个卡笼，里面有十六块电路板，每块电路板的高度和宽度与一张标准打字纸相当，每个卡笼有 96 个芯片。</p><p class="para">Thacker overcame the fault with an error correction system that could identify and reflip erroneous bits. This worked as long as they only occurred one at a time. Eventually, however, a second bit would fail. “Then,” Thacker recalled, “you’d get an honest error and the system would crash and we’d have to change the chip.” That was not as rare an occurrence as it might seem. For a time MAXC boasted the largest semiconductor memory of any computer in the world, an achievement that temporarily made PARC Intel’s single biggest customer. Approximately 25,000 of the 1103s got packed into four cabinets standing six feet high, each one containing four card cages with sixteen circuit boards that in turn were each about the height and width of a standard sheet of typewriter paper and held ninety-six chips apiece.</p>
<p class="para">内存板是实验室送去制造的 MAXC 的唯一部件。“内存板数量非常多——256 块，不包括备件——因此，为内存制作一块印刷电路板非常经济，这在当时并不是一项小任务，”Thacker 回忆道。</p><p class="para">The memory boards were the only part of MAXC the lab sent outside for fabrication. “There were so many of them—two hundred and fifty-six, not including spares—that it was economical to make a printed circuit board for the memory, which was not an inconsiderable task in those days,” Thacker recalled.</p>
<p class="para">有一次，对可靠电路板制造商的需求威胁到了 Thacker 走上犯罪的道路。英特尔将 1103 的制造权转授给了一家名为 Microsystems International Ltd.（简称 MIL）的加拿大公司，该公司是这家加拿大电话公司的子公司。“他们提出<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch07.html.page115"></a>“我们制造的主板价格比我们支付的价格低得多，”Thacker 说。“我记得有一次去渥太华时随身带着一块内存板样品，当时它要价一千美元。”</p><p class="para">At one point the need for a dependable board-maker threatened to set Thacker on a life of crime. Intel had sublicensed the manufacture of 1103s to a Canadian company called Microsystems International Ltd., or MIL, a subsidiary of the Canadian telephone company. “They offered to <a></a>make boards at a substantially lower price than we were paying,” Thacker said. “I remember going to Ottawa one time carrying a sample memory board with me, at that time a one-thousand-dollar object.”</p>

<p class="para">萨克迅速思考了一下。“大约十五美元。”</p><p class="para">Thacker thought quickly. “About fifteen dollars.”</p>
<p class="para">“哦，”警官挥手示意他过去。“如果只是这样的话，就不用担心了。”</p><p class="para">“Oh,” the officer said, waving him through. “If that’s all, don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p class="para">尽管 1103 很顽固，但得益于 Thacker 的巧妙设计和实验室的精湛技艺，MAXC 仍是一款非常坚固的机器。由于 Thacker 设计的物理内存比所有逻辑操作所需的内存还要多，因此可以取出整个内存板进行维修，而无需停机一纳秒。经过全面调试后，该机器创下了 ARPANET 上不间断可用性的记录，轻松超越了工程师们花费数年时间设计的计算机。相比之下，PARC 的计算机科学实验室仅用了不到 18 个月就实现了 MAXC。施乐的成本约为 75 万美元，其中约三分之一用于内存。</p><p class="para">Notwithstanding the stubborn 1103s, MAXC proved a superbly robust machine thanks to Thacker’s inspired design and the lab’s resourceful craftsmanship. Because Thacker had designed in more physical memory than was needed for all its logical operations, whole memory boards could be pulled out for repair without taking the system down for even a nanosecond. Once fully debugged, the machine set records for uninterrupted availability on the ARPANET, handily outperforming computers that had taken squadrons of engineers years to design. In contrast, the Computer Science Lab at PARC implemented MAXC in scarcely more than eighteen months. The cost to Xerox was about $750,000, of which roughly a third went for the memory.</p>
<p class="para">所有这些都是在紧迫的最后期限压力下完成的。“每个人都在等待 MAXC 的诞生，”McCreight 回忆道，他的办公室位于 Porter Drive，里面堆满了设备——六英尺高的架子上有两个主轴，上面装着 24 个旋转磁盘，像披萨烤箱一样排列着——几乎没有人的空间。“每天都有人来到我的办公室，问‘现在什么时候能到？’所以我们知道这是一件非常令人向往的事情。我的意思是，实验室的目的是为了编程，而我们在有了计算机系统之前无法编程。”</p><p class="para">All this was accomplished under intense deadline pressure. “Everybody was waiting for MAXC to exist,” recalled McCreight, whose office at Porter Drive was so crammed with equipment—six-foot-high racks holding twenty-four spinning disks on two spindles, arranged one on top and one below like pizza ovens—there was barely room for human beings. “Every day guys would show up in my office and say, ‘How soon, is it coming now?’ So we knew it was a very much desired thing. I mean, the point of the lab was to program and we couldn’t program until we had the computer system.”</p>
<p class="para">此外，正如泰勒所预料的那样，这个看似创造就业机会的项目在群体动态中产生了指数级的回报。乍一看，投入如此多的时间<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch07.html.page116"></a>花费大量时间和金钱来复制一台在公开市场上可以买到的计算机似乎是一种挥霍。但从泰勒的角度来看，生产一台真正的机器的任务给了他的工程师一个独特的机会来分析自己的优势和劣势，而泰勒自己永远无法设计出这种方式。项目结束时出现的是一个无缝、非常强大的单元。</p><p class="para">As Taylor anticipated, moreover, the seemingly make-work project paid exponential dividends in group dynamics. At first glance, devoting so <a></a>much time and money to reproducing a computer available on the open market seemed sheer profligacy. But from Taylor’s point of view, the assignment to produce a real machine had given his engineers a unique opportunity to parse out their own strengths and weaknesses in ways Taylor could never have devised himself. What emerged at the end of the program was a seamless, remarkably powerful unit.</p>
<p class="para">Kay 观察到：“小团队的动态就像一支优秀篮球队的动态一样。每个人都必须能够打好整场比赛。每个人都应该有自己比别人更擅长的某些事情，但每个人都应该在所有事情上都相当擅长。” MAXC 证明了他们在所有重要的事情上都非常擅长：硬件、软件、微编码、编程。“他们把做 MAXC 变成了一种美德。无论你如何看待它，这份工作都很棒。它并不简单。甚至一点也不简单。”</p><p class="para">“In a small group the dynamics are like those on a good basketball team,” Kay observed. “Everybody has to be able to play the whole game. Each person should have certain things they’re better at than the others, but everyone should be pretty good at everything.” MAXC proved they were all pretty good at everything that mattered: hardware, software, microcoding, programming. “They made having to do MAXC into a virtue. No matter how you slice it, the job was amazing. It was not trivial. Not even close to trivial.”</p>
<p class="para">然而，这只是漫长旅程的第一步。MAXC 才刚刚完工，他们就开始考虑下一步该怎么做。</p><p class="para">It was, however, merely the first step in a long journey. MAXC was barely finished before they started thinking about what to do next.</p>

<p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">1971 年春，当</span></span>实验室工作人员忙于实施 MAXC 时，泰勒着手完成帕克为他设定的一项关键任务：招募自己的老板。</p><p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">W</span></span>hile his lab staff occupied themselves with implementing MAXC in the spring of 1971, Taylor got around to one of the keystone tasks Pake had set down for him: He recruited his own boss.</p>
<p class="para">这件事发生得并不算早。泰勒迫切需要一个缓冲，来缓解自己和组织其他成员之间的矛盾。他和帕克仍然保持着联系，但两人的关系已经没什么可说的了。“这就像一段糟糕的婚姻，两个人因为孩子而在一起，”里克·琼斯评论道。</p><p class="para">This did not happen a moment too soon. Taylor was in critical need of a buffer between himself and the rest of the organization. He and Pake were still on speaking terms, but there was little more to say about their relationship. “It was like a bad marriage where two people stay together because of the kids,” remarked Rick Jones.</p>
<p class="para">没有人会质疑“孩子们”值得付出努力。CSL 在 MAXC 上的工作只是暗示了他们一旦达到巅峰状态后可能会有什么样的能力。但接受泰勒的团队进入这个级别需要一种摩尼教式的交易：也许计算机科学实验室在波特大道上产生的智力张力有助于刺激其他实验室与他们的能量和创造力相匹配，但他们也让事情变得比必要的更困难。帕克为了 MAXC 真的把自己的工作置于危险之中，他私下里说，如果 CSL 工程师没有抓住一切机会贬低埃尔塞贡多的工作，他为在 PARC 和 SDS 之间建立桥梁所做的努力实际上可能会取得成果。帕克的专业<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch08.html.page118"></a>克莱蒂通过一刀两断解决冲突的主张和泰勒在当地社会中确立并保持自己地位的主张截然相反，这种情况注定不会改善。</p><p class="para">No one would dispute that “the kids” were worth the effort. CSL’s work on MAXC provided just a hint of what they might be capable of once they hit their stride. But accepting Taylor’s crew at this level involved a sort of Manichean bargain: Perhaps the intellectual tension the Computer Science Lab generated on Porter Drive helped goad the other labs into matching their energy and creativity, but they also made things harder than was necessary. Pake, who had literally put his job on the line for MAXC, observed privately that his efforts to build a bridge between PARC and SDS might actually have borne fruit if only the CSL engineers had not taken every opportunity to belittle El Segundo’s work. Pake’s pro<a></a>clivity for solving conflicts by splitting them down the middle and Taylor’s for establishing and holding his position in the local pecking order stood in direct opposition to each other. This situation was not destined to improve.</p>
<p class="para">至少泰勒有智慧地认识到，他与外界的沟通桥梁在训练和经验上应该更像帕克，而不是他自己。这个人是 ARPANET 家族的另一位创始成员。20 世纪 60 年代末，杰罗姆·I·埃尔金德 (Jerome I. Elkind) 曾负责 Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman (BBN) 的计算机研究，BBN 是一家波士顿工程咨询公司，人们通常简称为 BBN。在那里，他监督该公司成功竞标建造了泰勒珍视的全国性网络的关键部分。这就是“IMP”系统，即接口消息处理器。IMP 形成了一个标准化计算机子网络（它们是经过改造的霍尼韦尔小型计算机），作为每个主机的大型机和中央网络之间的网关。实际上，它们充当了通用翻译器，使网络能够连接数十台不兼容的计算机，而不会变成一个嘈杂的巴别塔。 （这个概念是韦斯·克拉克 (Wes Clark) 的创意，解决了困扰 ARPANET 设计师的一个基本技术难题。）</p><p class="para">At least Taylor had the wisdom to see that his buffer to the outside world should in training and experience resemble Pake more than himself. The man in question was yet another charter member of the ARPANET clan. In the late 1960s Jerome I. Elkind had been in charge of computer research at Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman (BBN), a firm of Boston engineering consultants known familiarly as BBN. There he had supervised the firm’s successful bid to build a critical piece of Taylor’s cherished nationwide network. This was the system of “IMPs,” or Interface Message Processors. The IMPs formed a subnetwork of standardized computers (they were remodeled Honeywell minicomputers) that stood as a gateway between each host’s mainframe and the central network. In effect they functioned as universal translators, allowing the network to interconnect dozens of incompatible computers without turning into a cacophonous Babel. (The concept, which solved one of the fundamental technical problems bedeviling the ARPANET’s designers, was the brainchild of Wes Clark.)</p>
<p class="para">得益于在 ARPANET 上的大量工作，Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman 成为 ARPA 最大的私人承包商之一。这种情况使艾尔金德和泰勒之间建立了友好的关系。艾尔金德还与 PARC 的其他几位员工建立了联系，其中包括巴特勒·兰普森 (Butler Lampson)，他在 BBN 部门购买第一批 SDS 940 时认识了兰普森，还有彼得·多伊奇 (Peter Deutsch)，他在高中时和伯克利暑假期间曾在 BBN 工作过。</p><p class="para">Thanks mostly to its extensive work on the ARPANET, Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman became one of ARPA’s largest private contractors. This circumstance had forged an amicable relationship between Elkind and Taylor. Elkind also had bonds with several other PARC people, including Butler Lampson, who he had met when his BBN division bought one of the first SDS 940s, and Peter Deutsch, who had worked at BBN as a high school student and during summer vacations from Berkeley.</p>
<p class="para">艾尔金德是一位经验主义的科学家，但怀疑论的倾向十分明显。他的这种性格引起了同行们的强烈反响。有些人欣赏他的谨慎——毕竟，对于一个敢于探索未知领域的实验室经理来说，这种性格不会成为什么缺点。另一些人则认为他是一个令人难以忍受的悲观主义者，他的性格迟早会与泰勒的热情劝诱发生冲突。塞韦罗·奥恩斯坦观察到，即使在 BBN，“杰瑞也不是所有人都喜欢的技术主管。我认为他没有正确的风格。”</p><p class="para">Elkind was an empirical-minded scientist with a conspicuous streak of skepticism. This temperament elicited sharply divergent reactions from his peers. Some appreciated his discretion—a trait which, after all, would not be such a drawback for the manager of a lab venturing to the edge of the unknown. Others found him an insufferable pessimist whose disposition was certain to clash sooner or later with Taylor’s enthusiastic cajolery. Even at BBN, observed Severo Ornstein, “Jerry was not universally liked as a technical supervisor. I think he didn’t have the right touch.”</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch08.html.page119"></a>
<p class="para">然而，泰勒向实验室保证，他和艾尔金德的性格互补，不会争吵。他认为艾尔金德扮演的是他自己的“内线先生”的“外线先生”——就像一个人类小人，为 CSL 和 PARC 之间提供无痛接口。艾尔金德可以处理泰勒无法忍受的官僚主义垃圾，让他可以自由地继续扮演他的传道者、大师和全能父亲形象的角色。这种安排如此抽象地呈现，几乎似乎是合理的。</p><p class="para">Taylor reassured the lab, however, that his and Elkind’s personalities would be complementary, not contentious. He saw Elkind as playing “Mr. Outside” to his own “Mr. Inside”—as a sort of human IMP providing a painless interface between CSL and PARC. Elkind could handle the bureaucratic rubbish for which Taylor had no patience, leaving him free to keep to his role of evangelist, guru, and all-around father figure. Presented so abstractly, the arrangement almost seemed rational.</p>
<p class="para">泰勒为招募艾尔金德做了精心准备。他请艾尔金德在麻省理工学院时的崇拜者韦斯·克拉克 (Wes Clark) 向佩克转达一份热情洋溢的推荐信，并在与佩克会面之前亲自打电话给艾尔金德，向他推销他的“Outside/Inside”计划。艾尔金德听了之后很感兴趣，但他对这一安排的理解与泰勒并不完全一致。“我一直认为鲍勃的角色是担任非常强大的副主任，”他后来说道。“我的角色是管理实验室。”</p><p class="para">Taylor laid the groundwork carefully for Elkind’s recruitment. He asked Wes Clark, an Elkind admirer from his MIT days, to pass on a glowing recommendation to Pake, and called Elkind himself to sell him on his Outside/Inside plan before he met with Pake. Elkind listened, intrigued, but his understanding of the arrangement never fully matched Taylor’s. “I always thought Bob’s role was to be there as a very strong associate director,” he said later. “My role was that I was going to be managing the lab.”</p>
<p class="para">艾尔金德并非有意对研究人员进行微观管理。相反，作为研究主管，他一直认为应该给予最优秀的员工很大的独立性。“我在 BBN 所习惯的研究风格当然是非常强大的首席研究员通常独自工作，”他回忆道。但他也认为经理有责任推行一种集体哲学——“在某些领域有一个方向”，这样他们就不会“随意行事”。至于 PARC 的正确研究方向，“我们是施乐的一部分，这意味着人们会花费大量时间和精力去做对公司有用的事情。”如果泰勒听到这些话后有任何冲动想告诉艾尔金德把方向留给他，他会暂时抑制住这种冲动。</p><p class="para">It was not that Elkind was intent on micromanaging his researchers. On the contrary, as a research chief he had always believed in granting his best people a large measure of independence. “The style of research that I had been used to at BBN was certainly one of very strong principal investigators ordinarily doing work on their own,” he recollected. But he also viewed it as the manager’s responsibility to impose a group philosophy—“a vector in certain areas” so they would not be “proceeding off at random.” As for the proper vector of research at PARC, “the fact that we were a part of Xerox meant that one would spend a great amount of time and effort doing things that were useful to the corporation.” If upon hearing these words Taylor felt any impulse to tell Elkind to leave the vectoring to him, he stifled it—for the moment.</p>
<p class="para">一个阳光明媚的春日，乔治·帕克来到位于波士顿西部一个安静郊区的艾尔金德家，想了解一下他的情况。他们从未见过面，但帕克听到的关于艾尔金德的一切，包括韦斯·克拉克的溢美之词，都让他喜欢上了他。在清爽的新英格兰阳光下，经过几个小时的愉快相处，他发现艾尔金德具备泰勒所不具备的一切：一位冷静的科学家，拥有无可争议的冷静资历，其中包括麻省理工学院的工程博士学位（在利克莱德的指导下获得）。艾尔金德的研究经验无可挑剔，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch08.html.page120"></a>是他在企业环境中管理大型研究团队的经验。他的严肃性丝毫没有让帕克感到不安，帕克认为这是他目标的严肃性。杰瑞·艾尔金德正是他自 PARC 成立以来就梦想着让其负责实验室的那种高素质经理。（相反，他得到的是心不在焉、不情愿的比尔·甘宁和学术上可疑的鲍勃·泰勒。）</p><p class="para">One glorious spring day George Pake made his way to Elkind’s house in a quiet suburb west of Boston to take his measure. They had never met, but everything Pake had heard about Elkind, including Wes Clark’s fulsome praise, predisposed him to like the man. Over the course of a few gratifying hours under the crisp New England sun he satisfied himself that Elkind was everything Taylor was not: a sober scientist with indisputably sober credentials, among them an MIT engineering doctorate (achieved under Licklider, no less). Elkind’s research experience was unassailable, as <a></a>was his experience managing large research teams in a corporate setting. His gravity did not for a minute faze Pake, who interpreted it as seriousness of purpose. Jerry Elkind was exactly the sort of high-caliber manager he had dreamed about placing in charge of the labs ever since PARC had opened its doors. (Instead he had gotten the reluctant and distracted Bill Gunning and the academically suspect Bob Taylor.)</p>
<p class="para">然而，艾尔金德肯定感觉到了自己被提供的职位有些奇怪。“为什么不让鲍勃管理实验室呢？”他问道。</p><p class="para">Yet Elkind must have sensed something vaguely eccentric about the position he was being offered. “Why not just let Bob manage the lab?” he asked.</p>
<p class="para">“我需要一个受过更多科学训练的人，而不仅仅是计算机领域的，”帕克顺利地回答道。“计算机方面现在只有二十个人，但会增长。一旦计算机科学实验室拥有三四十名科学家，我们就需要能够将其与物理和信息科学融合在一起的经理。”他暗示艾尔金德就是那种经理。融合实验室？鲍勃·泰勒的议程似乎完全在于<span class="italic">消灭</span>其他实验室。</p><p class="para">“I need someone with more scientific training than just in the computer field,” Pake replied smoothly. “The computer side is only twenty people now, but it will grow. Once the Computer Science Lab gets to thirty or forty scientists we’ll need managers who can meld it with the physical and information sciences.” Elkind, he implied, was just that sort of manager. Melding the labs? Bob Taylor’s agenda seemed to lay entirely in <span class="italic">obliterating</span> the other labs.</p>
<p class="para">“乔治说得非常激动人心，”艾尔金德回忆道。“这个实验室将得到大力支持，而且动力十足。看起来已经有一群非常非常有才华的人来到这里了。”</p><p class="para">“George made it sound very exciting,” Elkind recalled. “Here was a lab that was going to be supported well and the motivation was solid. It seemed like a very, very talented group of people had already come there.”</p>
<p class="para">他来到西部，是为了配合 CSL 的惯例，即让所有员工对新成员进行连续面试。泰勒最初建立了这种审查球队新成员的制度，并规定候选人必须获得近乎全票的批准。</p><p class="para">He came west to indulge CSL in its ritual of subjecting prospective new members to serial interviews with the entire staff. Taylor had originally established this system of vetting recruits to the team, along with the rule that a candidate was required to win approval by a near-unanimous vote.</p>
<p class="para">“这个系统意味着 Joe Blow 入职后会拥有巨大的优势，”他解释道，“因为一大群人会致力于他的成功。”让他们未来的老板经历同样的全天流程有点奇怪，但因为他们已经入职而 Elkind 不在，所以他们坚持了下来。据说 Elkind 表现得很好。“他确实有 BBN 的良好书面资历，”Jim Mitchell 回忆道。“但我不认识他，所以我根据面试结果来判断，他的面试表现很好。”</p><p class="para">“The system meant Joe Blow would have a huge advantage coming in,” he explained, “because a whole bunch of people would have committed themselves to his success.” Subjecting their future boss to the same all-day process was a bit on the bizarre side, but since they were already in place and Elkind was not, they went through with it. By all accounts Elkind acquitted himself well. “He certainly had good paper credentials from BBN,” recalled Jim Mitchell. “But I didn’t know him so I went on the basis of the interview, and he gave good interview.”</p>
<p class="para">佩克很高兴，尽管有点惊讶，但看到艾尔金德和泰勒“似乎互动得很好。我怀疑泰勒从未<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch08.html.page121"></a>对自己评价很低，觉得自己真的不需要这个人。但一开始这并不成问题。”</p><p class="para">Pake was cheered, if a bit surprised, to see that Elkind and Taylor “seemed to interact pretty well. I would suspect that Taylor, who never <a></a>had a low opinion of himself, felt that he really didn’t need this other guy. But there was no problem about that, not at first.”</p>
<p class="para">无论如何，随着 MAXC 建设的顺利进行，CSL 的“载体”无需微调。如果艾尔金德关心或甚至注意到他的大多数新员工绕过他的办公室，在隔壁与鲍勃·泰勒一起集思广益，他并没有表现出来。然而，他确实招募了自己的骨干，从 BBN 挖来丹尼尔·鲍勃罗和沃伦·泰特尔曼，他鼓励这两位才华横溢的 Lisp 程序员继续研究人工智能。鲍勃罗在接下来的冲突中一直对艾尔金德忠心耿耿，他几乎立刻就察觉到 CSL 的氛围有些令人不安。有一天，他与泰勒对质。</p><p class="para">In any event with construction of MAXC well under way, CSL’s “vector” needed no fine-tuning. If Elkind cared, or even noticed, that most of his new staff bypassed his office and did their brainstorming next door with Bob Taylor, he did not show it. He did, however, recruit a cadre of his own, raiding BBN for Daniel Bobrow and Warren Teitelman, two talented Lisp programmers he encouraged to continue their work on artificial intelligence. Bobrow, who would remain deeply loyal to Elkind throughout the strife to come, almost immediately detected something unsettling about CSL’s ambiance. One day he confronted Taylor about it.</p>
<p class="para">“我问他为什么要找个人当自己的老板，”他回忆道。泰勒重复了他的口头禅，即需要一个资历更好的人来领导 CSL，这样他就可以更自由地对两个计算机实验室（包括 SSL）施加影响。鲍勃罗并不完全满意。“我认为他觉得，就像在 ARPA 他是许多权力背后的力量一样，他也可以在这里成为许多权力背后的力量，”他观察到。然而，尚未回答的问题是，如果他真的渴望自己坐上王位，会发生什么。</p><p class="para">“I asked him why he recruited somebody to be his own boss,” he recalled. Taylor repeated his mantra about needing someone with better credentials to head CSL so he could be more free to exert his influence over both computer labs, SSL included. Bobrow was not completely satisfied. “I thought he felt that, just as at ARPA he was the power behind a lot of thrones, he could be the power behind a lot of thrones here, too,” he observed. The unanswered question, however, was what might happen if he ever got a hankering to sit on the throne himself.</p>

<p class="para">如果 PARC 的计算机工程师认为 MAXC 的设计和建造会让他们摆脱 PDP-10 争议，那他们就错了。在施乐总部，这些争吵让 PARC 获得了永远无法摆脱的傲慢名声。随着时间的推移，这种名声又被上千次侮辱所强化，最终演变成 PARC 与斯坦福总部关系的一大障碍。然而，起初，这只是给施乐一个借口，让他们更加关注该研究中心的动向。这项不成文政策的代理人是一个名叫唐·彭德利的人。</p><p class="para">If PARC’s computer engineers thought the design and construction of MAXC would place the PDP-10 controversy behind them, they were mistaken. At Xerox headquarters the contretemps earned PARC a reputation for insolence it would never entirely shake. Reinforced by a thousand further affronts over time, this would evolve into a major handicap in its relations with headquarters in Stamford. At first, however, it simply gave Xerox a pretext to pay closer attention to what the research center was up to. The agent of this unwritten policy was a man named Don Pendery.</p>
<p class="para">作为施乐公司的企业规划主管，彭德利主持了一个总部工作组——无数这样的机构之一——致力于监测可能影响公司商业计划的技术变化。为了寻找答案，他经常与 PARC 的人联系，这些人往往认为他的担忧目光短浅、心胸狭隘。艾伦·凯是该中心自诩的常驻未来学家，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch08.html.page122"></a>尤其令凯伊感到气愤的是彭德利的做法，他把未来视为对利润构成威胁的潘多拉魔盒。凯伊和他的同事更愿意把它看作是无限机遇的预兆。他们认为，只在视野中寻找施乐未来的线索，会迫使公司提出错误的问题，并确保无论答案是什么，都会被误解或忽视。</p><p class="para">A Xerox corporate planning executive, Pendery chaired a headquarters task force—one of innumerable such bodies—devoted to monitoring technological changes that might affect the company’s business plan. In pursuit of the answers, he made frequent contact with the people at PARC, who tended to regard his concerns as shortsighted and parochial. Alan Kay, the center’s self-defined futurist-in-residence, <a></a>took particular umbrage at Pendery’s approach, which treated the future largely as a Pandora’s Box of threats to the bottom line. Kay and his colleagues preferred to consider it more as a harbinger of limitless opportunity. To scan the horizon only for hints of Xerox’s future, they thought, forced the company to ask the wrong questions and ensured that whatever answers came would be misinterpreted or ignored.</p>
<p class="para">凯回忆说，彭德利“真的不明白我们在说什么”。相反，他“感兴趣的是‘趋势’和‘未来会是什么样子’，以及施乐如何‘抵御它’。”</p><p class="para">Pendery “really didn’t understand what we were talking about,” Kay recalled. Instead he was “interested in ‘trends’ and ‘what was the future going to be like’ and how Xerox could ‘defend against it.’”</p>
<p class="para">在一次令人沮丧的会面中，凯伊脱口而出，这句话注定会成为他（和 PARC）的非官方信条。“看，”他说，“预测未来的最好方法就是创造<span class="italic">未来</span>！”</p><p class="para">In the course of one frustrating encounter Kay blurted out the line destined to become his (and PARC’s) unofficial credo. “Look,” he said, “the best way to predict the future is to <span class="italic">invent</span> it!”</p>
<p class="para">但 PARC 却不得不直面一种自然力量，即企业的自我保护本能。凯伊敦促施乐公司要有耐心，要相信科学的偶然性，而彭德利则要求施乐公司对其愿景做出定义，以便将其简化为纸质文件并在董事会会议上展示。最后，他如愿以偿。1971 年中期，乔治·帕克向总部寄送了一个半英寸厚的文件夹，里面有七份文件，每份文件都由一位 PARC 科学家撰写，总共不到 60 页。有人厚颜无耻地将其标记为“PARC 彭德利和规划目的文件”。从此，实验室的速记中就称它们为“彭德利文件”。</p><p class="para">But PARC had come face to face with a force of nature, the corporate instinct for self-preservation. While Kay urged upon Xerox the virtues of patience and trust in scientific serendipity, Pendery pressed for a definition of its vision that could be reduced to paper and presented in a boardroom. Finally he got it. In mid-1971 George Pake sent up to headquarters a half-inch-thick folder containing seven documents, each written by an individual PARC scientist—scarcely sixty pages altogether. Someone had cheekily labeled it “PARC Papers for Pendery and Planning Purposes.” In lab shorthand they were henceforth known as the “Pendery Papers.”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">自从万尼瓦尔·布什在《大西洋月刊》</span>上发表文章预测我们的思维方式以来，还没有人以书面形式记录下如此全面的技术和未来愿景。彭德利论文既是对未来最有前途的技术的调查，也是 PARC 十年探索之旅的路线图。有些预测过高。例如，凯伊（也许是一厢情愿）预计到 1980 年便携式平板显示器将以象征性的价格问世。吉姆·米切尔在撰写有关未来办公系统的文章时，设想了无错误和无限可定制的软件，通过网络连接从卖方传输到买方，在各种不兼容的机器上完美运行（截至撰写本文时，这仍然是一个朦胧的梦想）。但总的来说，这一计划与布什的计划一样，都是科学预言的非凡壮举。</p><p class="para">Not since Vannevar Bush had forecast how we might think in his essay for <span class="italic">The Atlantic</span> had such a comprehensive vision of technology and the future been set down in writing. The Pendery Papers were at once a survey of the most promising technologies on the horizon and a road map for PARC’s ten-year exploratory journey. Some of the forecasts overshot their marks. Kay, for instance, anticipated (perhaps wishfully) portable flat-screen displays at nominal cost by 1980. Jim Mitchell, writing on future office systems, envisioned error-free and infinitely customizable software, transmitted from vender to buyer over network connections, running flawlessly on a full spectrum of incompatible machines (as of this writing still a hazy dream). But on the whole the package stands with Bush’s as a remarkable feat of scientific prognostication.</p>
<p class="para">米切尔未来的办公室里，到处都是未完成的备忘录，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch08.html.page123"></a>信件和报告将完全存在于计算机上，只有在需要最终硬拷贝时才打印出来。（“当今办公室中许多当前的‘纸质文件’工作将被人们通过个人终端花费大量时间使用计算机所取代。”）他预测了电子邮件的传播，并预言了它独特的能力，可以让人们“同时交流和处理信息，而无需物理接近”。软盘将取代文件柜成为文件和信息的主要存储库。</p><p class="para">Mitchell’s office of the future was one in which uncompleted memos, <a></a>letters, and reports would exist solely on computer, to be printed out only when a final hard copy was needed. (“Much of the current ‘paper pushing’ in today’s offices will be replaced by people spending a large portion of their time using a computer via some personal terminal.”) He forecast the propagation of electronic mail and divined its unique ability to allow people to “communicate and manipulate information simultaneously, without the necessity of physical proximity.” The floppy disk would replace the file cabinet as the principal repository of documents and information.</p>
<p class="para">报道集成电路技术的迪克·舒普 (Dick Shoup) 预测了“智能”家电的发展，例如配备简单但功能强大的芯片的烤面包机和闹钟。约翰·乌尔巴赫 (John Urbach) 关于“档案存储器”的论文描述了类似于当今 CD-ROM 和紧凑型音频光盘的数字光介质。他写道：“似乎没有什么理由以模拟形式存储声音”，他观察到声音信息很容易被压缩为数字比特的突发 — — 因此，LP 唱片在真正遭遇这种命运之前十五年就被扔进了垃圾箱。</p><p class="para">Dick Shoup, reporting on integrated circuit technology, anticipated the development of “smart” appliances such as toasters and alarm clocks equipped with simple but powerful chips. John Urbach’s paper on “archival memory” described digital photo-optical media resembling today’s CD-ROMs and compact audio discs. “There seems little reason to store sound in analog form,” he wrote, observing that acoustical information is easily reduced to bursts of digital bits—thus consigning the LP record to the dustbin more than fifteen years before it actually met such a fate.</p>
<p class="para">公平地说，彭德利论文作者提出的许多惊人创新都是空穴来风：它们只是从研究界（如果不是广大公众）众所周知的技术中适度推断出来的。米切尔对未来文本编辑和办公系统的描述大量借鉴了道格·恩格尔巴特 1968 年的演示。舒普对集成电路的研究几乎没有超出已经上市或已知正在积极开发的设备。不过，未来学家没有义务只涉足魔法和水晶球的领域；有时对下一个转折点的清晰愿景就足够了。就目前情况而言，彭德利论文对 PARC 和施乐有三方面的重要意义。</p><p class="para">To be fair, many of the startling innovations posited by the Pendery authors were ringers: They were only modest extrapolations from technologies well-known throughout the research community, if not among the broad public. Mitchell’s description of tomorrow’s text-editing and office systems drew heavily from Doug Engelbart’s 1968 demonstration. Shoup’s survey of integrated circuitry scarcely ventured much beyond devices that were already on the market or known to be under active development. Still, futurists have no obligation to venture solely into the realm of magic and crystal balls; sometimes a clear vision of what lies around the next bend will do. As things stood, the Pendery Papers were important for PARC and Xerox in three ways.</p>
<p class="para">首先，他们暗中接受了摩尔定律的巨大威力，尽管这一威力仍未得到广泛重视。这一术语在彭德利论文中从未出现过，但其意义却渗透到了每一页。摩尔文章的暗示是，1965 年不切实际的技术将在一二十年内变得司空见惯。在彭德利论文中，PARC 告知施乐公司，今天在绘图板上设计的设备将在十年内上市，所以是时候做好准备了。</p><p class="para">The first was that they implicitly embraced the immense but still widely unappreciated power of Moore’s Law. The term appeared nowhere in the Pendery Papers, but its significance permeated every page. The implication of Moore’s article had been that technologies impractical in 1965 would be commonplace within a decade or two. In the Pendery Papers PARC informed Xerox that the devices on the drawing board today would be marketable in ten years, so it was time to get ready.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch08.html.page124"></a>
<p class="para">“这是他们版的古老猎人名言，‘永远不要瞄准鸭子的屁股’，”杰克·戈德曼的助手乔治·怀特 (George White) 说道，他曾是彭德利 (Pendery) 工作组的成员，“PARC 告诉我们，如果你想在帕洛阿尔托投资研究，你就必须走在前面。否则，等到你的研究逐渐成熟时，事情就会赶上你了。”</p><p class="para">“This was their version of the old hunter’s saying, ‘Never aim at the ass end of a duck,’” remarked George White, Jack Goldman’s assistant, who served on Pendery’s task force, “PARC was telling us that if you want to invest in research at Palo Alto you’ve got to get way ahead. Otherwise, by the time the ripening and maturing process from your research comes through events will have overtaken you.”</p>
<p class="para">PARC 进一步认识到，摩尔定律将在计算机与人类之间的视觉交互中发挥最大作用。几乎每篇论文都涉及这个主题，有些论文对此进行了长篇大论（Kay 的论文完全致力于显示技术）。实验室似乎终于吸取了 Bob Taylor 一年多来一直强调的教训：计算机是一种通信设备，其中显示器是<span class="italic">重点</span>。</p><p class="para">PARC further understood that Moore’s Law would pack its greatest wattage in the visual interaction between computer and man. Virtually every paper touched on this topic and some dwelled on it at length (Kay’s was devoted entirely to display technology). It was as though the lab had finally absorbed the lesson Bob Taylor had been pressing on it for more than a year: The computer is a communications device in which the display is <span class="italic">the whole point</span>.</p>
<p class="para">Pendery 论文的第三个好处只对 PARC 有利。“这关系到实验室的主要焦点，”Peter Deutsch 回忆道。“尽管我们内心里没有人相信十年后每张桌子上都会有一台便携式计算机，但行业趋势和各种事物的曲线都表明了这一点。十年后，你将能够在每个人的桌子上放置与 MAXC 相当的东西。”</p><p class="para">The third benefit of the Pendery Papers inured to PARC alone. “It was a matter of setting the primary focus for the lab,” recalled Peter Deutsch. “Even though in our guts nobody believed that you would be able to put a portable computer on every desk ten years from now, that was what was said by the industry trend and the curves of various things. You’d be able to put something equivalent to MAXC on everybody’s desk in ten years.”</p>
<p class="para">有人可能会说，彭德利文件是另一个例子，就像斯特拉斯曼否决 PDP-10 一样，证明了总部的威吓如何因祸得福。他们以总部的折磨者的名字命名他们的白皮书档案，但他们为自己撰写了这份文件。米切尔、凯、乌尔巴赫和其他人以惊人的胆量确定了他们的目的地。现在，他们所有人必须齐心协力，开辟一条通往目的地的道路。</p><p class="para">One might argue that the Pendery Papers were another example, like Strassmann’s veto of the PDP-10, of how a hectoring from headquarters proved itself to be a blessing in disguise. They named their file of white papers after their tormentor from the home office, but they wrote it for themselves. With dazzling audacity Mitchell, Kay, Urbach, and the others had fixed on their destination. Now it was up to all of them, working together, to blaze the path that would take them there.</p>

<p class="para">斯塔克韦瑟在物理学这一神秘的分支专业中受过良好的训练，但他看起来并不像人们想象中的物理学大师。他身材魁梧，面容友善、坦率，更像是你家附近的电话接线员。但对帕洛阿尔托研究中心的同事来说，他是个特别的人。他是被排斥的科学家，被韦伯斯特的老板称为叛徒，仅仅因为他证明了激光新技术可以用来在静电复印鼓上“绘制”图像，速度和精度都比普通白光快。</p><p class="para">Starkweather was highly trained in an arcane subspecialty of physics, but he did not look like anyone’s idea of a master physicist. With his stocky frame and friendly, guileless features, he more resembled your neighborhood phone lineman. But to his colleagues at PARC he was a special catch. He was the scientist outcast, the man who got branded a renegade by his bosses at Webster simply for proving that the novel technology of lasers could be used to “paint” an image onto a xerographic drum with greater speed and precision than ordinary white light.</p>
<p class="para">他不仅没有得到表扬和鼓励，反而被勒令放弃研究，并威胁要失去实验室助理。他的老板暗示，如果他不能将精力重新转向镜头和白光等紧迫问题，他在施乐的未来将一片黯淡。“我们几乎已经到了最疏远的地步，”他回忆道，当时人们终于意识到，他唯一的去处就是帕洛阿尔托的那座疯人院。</p><p class="para">Instead of garnering praise and encouragement he was ordered to abandon his research and threatened with the loss of his lab assistants. His bosses hinted that his future at Xerox would be bleak if he failed to redirect his energies back to the pressing issues of lenses and white light. “We had almost reached the point of maximum disconnect,” he recalled, when it was finally recognized that the only place for him was that madhouse out in Palo Alto.</p>
<p class="para">在 PARC，他发明了激光打印机，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch09.html.page128"></a>这与施乐公司从未从帕洛阿尔托研究中心赚过一分钱的谣言相矛盾。这个故事的讽刺之处在于，尽管杰克·戈德曼不遗余力地努力让帕洛阿尔托研究中心不受韦伯斯特的复印机思维的影响，但帕洛阿尔托研究中心生产的最赚钱的产品却出自韦伯斯特的头脑。</p><p class="para">And there at PARC he invented the laser printer, the success of <a></a>which contradicts the canard that Xerox never earned a dime from the Palo Alto Research Center. It is one of the ironies of the story that despite Jack Goldman’s tireless efforts to keep PARC insulated from Webster’s copier-duplicator mentality, the most profitable product PARC ever produced sprang from the mind of a Webster man.</p>
<p class="para">在 PARC，他们从未这样想过。“加里·斯塔克韦瑟被赶出了韦伯斯特，”艾伦·凯表示赞同。“我们认为他是我们中的一员。”</p><p class="para">Not that they ever thought of him that way at PARC. “Gary Starkweather had been thrown out of Webster,” Alan Kay remarked with manifest approval. “We considered him one of us.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">尽管加里·斯塔克韦瑟在操纵光线方面拥有非凡的技能，但他从事光学事业却或多或少地出于一时兴起。1960 年，他刚刚从密歇根州立大学获得物理学学士学位，面临的职业选择非常有限。“我当时的选择是，要么从事核能，这是 1960 年的热门领域，要么从事光学。但我看了核能，然后说，我不这么认为。我不确定人们会如何面对这些问题，因为核能一旦失败，后果将不堪设想。所以我选择了光学。”这是一个幸运的选择。在罗彻斯特大学攻读硕士学位仅一年左右后，整个领域就出现了巨大的机会。</p><p class="para">For all his considerable skills at manipulating light, Gary Starkweather’s career in optics began more or less on a whim. In 1960, having just received his bachelor’s degree in physics from Michigan State University, he faced a limited spectrum of career options. “The choices were I could go into nuclear power, which was a hot thing in 1960, or I could go into optics. And I looked at nuclear and said, I don’t think so. I wasn’t sure how people would live with the problems, because when nuclear fails, it fails big. So I went into optics.” It was a lucky choice. Just a year or so into his master’s studies at the University of Rochester, the entire field blew wide open.</p>
<p class="para">在马里布的休斯研究实验室，西奥多·梅曼将一根电子管绕在一根两端抛光成镜面光泽的粉色红宝石圆柱体上。他触发了线圈内的电子闪光，激发红宝石从一端瞬间发射出单一波长的红光。光学科学从此发生了翻天覆地的变化。</p><p class="para">At Hughes Research Laboratory in Malibu, Theodore Maiman had coiled an electronic tube around a cylinder of pink ruby polished at either end to a mirrored sheen. He touched off a flash of electrons within the coil, exciting the ruby into firing an instantaneous burst of single-wavelength red light from one end. The science of optics was never the same.</p>
<p class="para">在激光出现之前，光是一种粗糙的工具。光学科学家可以用透镜和镜子来撞击光，用棱镜将其分成不同的波长。但这些过程就像用风镐进行手术一样精细。相比之下，激光切割起来就像手术刀一样。</p><p class="para">Before the laser’s appearance, light was a crude implement. Optical scientists could knock it about with lenses and mirrors and sort it into its constituent wavelengths with prisms. But these processes bore all the delicacy of surgery performed with a jackhammer. By contrast, the laser cut like a scalpel.</p>
<p class="para">热产生的白光（由灯泡和电弧产生）包含光谱的所有颜色，以不同的波长振荡，并由彼此异相产生的光子组成。在这种情况下，光不可避免地会散射和扩散到远处，就像海浪在海滩上消散一样。梅曼的<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch09.html.page129"></a>然而，红宝石装置发射的光束不受散射效应的影响。它具有空间相干性（光束中的所有光都是相同波长）和时间相干性，这意味着它的光子是同相的。激光可以像​​无线电天线一样“调谐”，亮度和精细度都很高，以至于从地球发出的光束可以明显照亮月球上的某个点。</p><p class="para">White light generated thermally—by bulbs and electric arcs—comprises all the colors of the spectrum, oscillating at different wavelengths and consisting of photons generated out of phase with one another. Under such conditions light inevitably scatters and diffuses over distance, like ocean waves spending themselves on the beach. Maiman’s <a></a>ruby device, however, emitted a beam immune to the scattering effect. It had spatial coherence (all the light in the beam was the same wavelength) and temporal coherence, meaning that its photons were in phase. The laser could be “tuned,” like a radio antenna, to be so bright and fine that a beam shined from the Earth could visibly illuminate a spot on the moon.</p>
<p class="para">光学科学家对新技术表示欢迎，认为它是将理论具体化的工具。现在可以在实验室中测试某些光电效应和其他现象存在的假设。在罗彻斯特大学，加里·斯塔克韦瑟放弃了他原来的硕士课题——经典光学，重新将注意力集中在激光上，并以一篇探索全息术（一种激光辅助三维图像创建技术）的论文获得了学位。他满怀期待地将自己的知识带回了施乐公司的韦伯斯特实验室，他曾在那里努力学习，但却被告知不要像疯子一样说话。</p><p class="para">Optical scientists welcomed the new technology as a tool for making the theoretical concrete. Hypotheses of the existence of certain photoelectric effects and other phenomena could now be tested in the lab. At the University of Rochester Gary Starkweather abandoned his original master’s topic in classical optics, refocused his attention on lasers, and received his degree for a thesis exploring holography, the laser-aided creation of three-dimensional images. With great anticipation he brought his knowledge back to Xerox’s Webster lab, where he had worked his way through school, only to be instructed to stop talking like a madman.</p>
<p class="para">对于一家依靠光的操纵获得巨额财富的公司来说，施乐在利用特德·梅曼的发现方面始终落后于时代。斯塔克韦瑟看到韦伯斯特的所有项目都以失败告终，因为它们使用的光源太弱了。每当他指出激光器的亮度是传统光源的 10,000 倍时，他都会遭到嘲笑，尤其是当他暗示新设备可能在静电复印成像中发挥作用时。他的同事们对此的反应是，激光器难以操作，而且烧坏的速度比一堆干木头还快。它们布满电极，发出刺眼的光芒，放在办公室机器里似乎和核弹头一样不安全。而且它们价格昂贵——一台激光器的价格为 2,500 至 25,000 美元。</p><p class="para">For a company whose vast corporate fortune depended on the manipulation of light, Xerox remained resolutely behind the curve in exploiting Ted Maiman’s discovery. Everywhere Starkweather turned at Webster he saw projects coming to naught because they employed light sources too feeble. Whenever he pointed out that the laser packed 10,000 times the brightness of a conventional light source he encountered sneers, especially when he suggested that the new devices might play a role in xerographic imaging. Lasers were difficult to handle and burned out faster than a rick of dry timber, his colleagues responded. Bristling with electrodes and emitting bursts of blinding light, they seemed about as safe to put into an office machine as nuclear warheads. And they were expensive—$2,500 to $25,000 for a single unit.</p>
<p class="para">接下来的几年里，斯塔克韦瑟别无选择，只能自己做实验。他的直觉告诉他，如此精确的光束可以进行调制（即改变强度），以传输信息，就像无线电波或电话线上的脉冲一样。假设有人可以训练光束可靠地传输数字位：然后这些数字位可以转化为空白纸上的标记，这一壮举将使人们能够将机器内部产生的想法和图像记录在纸上。</p><p class="para">For the next few years Starkweather had no choice but to experiment on his own. His instincts told him that a beam so precise could be modulated—that is, altered in intensity—to carry information, just like radio waves or the pulses on a phone line. Suppose one could educate a light beam to reliably transmit digital bits: These could then be translated into marks on a blank sheet, a feat that would allow one to consign to paper the thoughts and images created inside a machine.</p>
<p class="para">在几个实验室助理的帮助下，他制作了一个笨拙的原型<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch09.html.page130"></a>他把一台激光设备挂在一台现在没人用的每分钟七页的老式复印机上，发明了一种新型复印机。只要能在清晨或深夜抽出一两个小时的时间，他就会进行一些同样笨拙的测试，用激光束轰击未使用的静电复印鼓。最后，他学会了如何扫描原始图像并制作出副本。诚然，他的第一批样本粗糙而苍白，根本无法在黄金时段使用。然而，它们几乎不会比切斯特·卡尔森在厨房里用一台粗糙的仪器复印的褪色潦草的“10-22-38 阿斯托利亚”更糟糕。斯塔克韦瑟不断提醒自己，从卡尔森粗糙而苍白的样本中，一个令人惊叹的新产业已经涌现。谁能保证他的产业不会这样做呢？</p><p class="para">Enlisting the help of a couple of lab assistants, he built a clumsy proto<a></a>type, hitching a laser apparatus to an old seven-page-a-minute copier no one used anymore. Whenever he could steal an hour or two early in the morning or late at night he would run some equally clumsy tests by bombarding an unused xerographic drum with laser beams. Eventually he learned how to scan an original image and turn out a duplicate. True, his first samples were crude and pale, not at all ready for prime time. Still, they were scarcely any worse than the faded, scrawled “10-22-38 Astoria” Chester Carlson had reproduced on a coarse apparatus in his kitchen. From Carlson’s crude and pale sample, Starkweather kept reminding himself, an awesome new industry had sprung. Who was to say that his might not do the same?</p>
<p class="para">尽管如此，斯塔克韦瑟获得的尊重并不比卡尔森在自己研究之初获得的尊重多。“理论家们给了我各种借口，”他回忆道。“全是废话。他们告诉我，光束移动得如此之快，光感受器永远看不到它。他们谈到了‘光电导体疲劳’，并问，你将如何调制？他们认为这没有实际价值。‘我们有需要发货的复印机，你需要为此处理镜头……绘制激光束，这些东西很贵，它们用不了多久，而且看起来像业余无线电装置。这是一个完全无用的应用。如果你以每英寸 200 个点的速度绘制，那就是一百万比特的数据，你将从哪里获得一百万比特的信息？’在 1968 年，这可能是一个有效的问题。但如果你看看这项技术可能的发展方向，这就不是一个有效的问题了。”</p><p class="para">Nevertheless, Starkweather got scarcely more respect than Carlson had at the start of his own researches. “The theoreticians gave me every excuse,” he recalled. “All hogwash. They told me the beam would be moving so rapidly the photoreceptor would never see it. They talked about ‘photoconductor fatigue’ and asked, How will you modulate? They thought there was no practical value in it. ‘We got copiers we need to ship, you need to work on the lenses for that…Painting laser beams, these things are expensive, they never last very long and they look like a ham radio set. It’s a completely useless application. If you paint at 200 dots per inch that’s a million bits of data, where will you ever get a million bits of information?’ In 1968 that was probably a valid question. But it wasn’t a valid question if you looked at where the technology might go.”</p>
<p class="para">经过数月和数年的尝试，在驱动自然发明家的内心信念的推动下，他设计了能够回答所有异议的实验。他可以通过改变输入功率来调节光束，并通过巧妙地使用一组镜子来扫描光束。他最自豪的是驳斥了关于“光导体疲劳”的古老传说。这指的是复印机静电复印鼓的硒涂层的一种假设特性，其静电荷必须被光中和，才能使复印过程正常进行。</p><p class="para">Over months and years of trying, fueled by the inner conviction that drives natural inventors, he fashioned experiments that answered every objection. He could modulate the beam by varying the power input and scan it by the clever application of a set of mirrors. He was proudest of disproving the old bugaboo about “photoconductor fatigue.” This referred to a hypothetical property of the selenium coating of the copier’s xerographic drum, the electrostatic charge of which must be neutralized by light in order for the duplicating process to work.</p>
<p class="para">实验室的教条认为，过亮的光线会使中和效应深入硒层，就像锤子将钉子钉入软木一样。一旦光电导体因此变得过于“疲劳”，无法持续恢复到空白、静止状态，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch09.html.page131"></a>会看到早期副本的“影子”一直留在空白纸上，全部转移到空白纸上。反对意见严格来说是理论上的，很难忽视。“这只是一个预兆，”斯塔克韦瑟解释说，“因为之前从来没有人尝试过在几十亿分之一秒内曝光东西。”</p><p class="para">Laboratory dogma maintained that excessively bright light would drive the neutralization effect deep into the selenium layer, like a hammer driving a nail through soft wood. Once the photoconductor thus became too “fatigued” to consistently snap back to a blank, quiescent state, one <a></a>would see persistent “ghosts” of earlier copies, all transferred together to the blank paper. The objection, being strictly theoretical, was hard to discount. “It was only an inkling,” Starkweather explained, “because no one had ever tried to expose things in a few billionths of a second before.”</p>
<p class="para">斯塔克韦瑟的实验证明这种猜测是错误的。他证明，用激光的超强光束照射感光体几分之一秒，其效果与普通静电复印术中用传统光照射更长时间的效果相同。短暂的曝光抵消了光束的强度，硒完好无损。</p><p class="para">Starkweather’s experiments proved the inkling false. He showed that bathing a photoreceptor with the laser’s extraordinarily potent beam for a fraction of a second had the same effect as applying conventional light for the much longer period employed in ordinary xerography. The brevity of the exposure canceled out the strength of the beam, and the selenium survived just fine.</p>
<p class="para">至于对设备成本的抱怨，斯塔克韦瑟认为激光器的价格肯定会下降。毕竟，激光器是什么？一根两端装有镜子的霓虹灯管。一块写着“在 Joe's 吃饭”的招牌展开成一条直线。“你内心深处有一种感觉，你确信这东西有潜力，”他回忆起那些孤独的日日夜夜。“你必须克服一切困难，相信这东西会成功。”</p><p class="para">As for the complaints about the devices’ cost, Starkweather figured lasers were bound to come down in price. What, after all, was the laser? A neon tube with mirrors on the ends. A sign that says “Eat at Joe’s,” unfurled into a straight line. “There’s a feeling down in your stomach where you’re sure the thing has potential,” he recalled of those solitary days and nights. “You have to believe against all odds that the thing will work.”</p>
<p class="para">他还意识到自己可能已经找到了计算机科学尚未圆满解决的一个问题的答案：如何将一串数字比特转换成纸上可理解的内容。激光可以以足够的速度寻址感光鼓，打印出每英寸 500 个微小点，每个点都对应一个数字数据位。“我说，如果我不是像办公室静电复印那样扫描图像，而是直接在计算机上创建数据，会怎么样？如果我可以调节光束以匹配数字比特，我就可以真正用这个东西打印。我在罗切斯特做了一些测试实验，我的直属上司觉得这可能是他们一生中见过的最疯狂的项目。就在那时，我的部门经理说，‘停下来，否则我要把你的人带走。’”</p><p class="para">He also realized he might have an answer to a problem computer science had not yet solved satisfactorily: how to transform a stream of digital bits into something intelligible on paper. A laser could address a photosensitive drum with enough speed to print microscopic dots as fine as 500 to the inch, each one corresponding to a bit of digital data. “I said, what if instead of scanning the image in, as is done in office xerography, I actually just created the data on the computer? If I could modulate the beam to match the digital bits, I could actually print with this thing. I did some test experiments in Rochester, which my immediate management felt was probably the most lunatic project they’d ever seen in their lives. That’s when my section manager said, ‘Stop, or I’m going to take your people away.’”</p>

<p class="para">1970 年的一天，斯塔克韦瑟在罗切斯特施乐广场办公大楼顶层的乔治·怀特办公室里向他吐露心声。斯塔克韦瑟抱怨自己陷入了困境。他觉得自己的才华被浪费了，更糟糕的是，他的才华让他在施乐的职业生涯陷入了死胡同。</p><p class="para">One day in 1970 Starkweather poured out his heart to George White in White’s office high atop Rochester’s Xerox Square office tower. Starkweather complained that he had been caught in a vise. He felt as though his talents had been wasted and, worse, that they had led his career at Xerox to a dead end.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch09.html.page132"></a>
<p class="para">他坚信自己可以学会安全地操纵激光束，让施乐有机会推出一种全新的成像机器。然而公司里似乎没人愿意理会他。他已经无计可施了。</p><p class="para">He was convinced he could learn to safely manipulate the laser beam in a way that would give Xerox the opportunity to market an entirely new kind of imaging machine. Yet no one in the company seemed willing to pay him the slightest heed. He had run out of places to turn.</p>
<p class="para">他告诉怀特，公司曾有一线希望。今年夏天，他在员工通讯中看到了一条消息，称公司正在帕洛阿尔托建造新实验室。</p><p class="para">There had been one glimmer of hope, he told White. During the summer he had seen an item in the employee newsletter about the new lab being built out in Palo Alto.</p>
<p class="para">“我想我当时飞奔了一百码到最近的电话那里，然后打电话过去，”他回忆道。“他们说，‘好吧，我们不会真的调动人员，我们会从西海岸招聘。’我说，‘我可以出来告诉你我在做什么吗？’”</p><p class="para">“I think I did the hundred-yard dash to the nearest phone and called out there,” he recounted. “They said, ‘Well, we won’t really transfer people, we’re going to hire from the West Coast.’ I said, ‘Can I come out and tell you what I’m working on?’”</p>
<p class="para">凭借着坚持不懈的努力，他获得了在加州接受乔治·帕克 (George Pake) 采访的机会，但回到家后，他感觉自己陷入了两难境地。实验室对他的工作很感兴趣，但拒绝为他申请调职。帕克解释说，韦伯斯特已经因为太多顶尖人才被调到 PARC 而恼火了。“我们不会要求你，”他说。“我们不想引发雪崩。但如果你能自己调职，我们会接受你。”</p><p class="para">His persistence won him an interview in California with George Pake, but he came home feeling like the victim of a Catch-22. The lab was fascinated with his work, but refused to put in for his transfer. Webster was already aggravated that too many of its top people had been relocated to PARC, Pake explained. “We won’t ask for you,” he said. “We don’t want to start an avalanche. But we’d take you, if you could happen to get a transfer on your own.”</p>
<p class="para">韦伯斯特的顶头上司不仅拒绝了他的调职，而且似乎对这个想法非常恼火。“算了吧，加里，”他说，“你永远不会被调到西海岸。而且你不要再玩激光了。”</p><p class="para">His immediate boss at Webster had not only turned down his transfer but seemed infuriated at the very idea. “Forget it, Gary,” he said, “you’re never going to be moved to the West Coast. And you’re to stop playing around with that laser stuff.”</p>
<p class="para">怀特是斯塔克韦瑟的上司，比他高出几级，但他之前从未听说过这件事。听完这个故事，他越来越沮丧。毫无疑问，实验室对待斯塔克韦瑟的方式很愚蠢，而这种地方主义正是他的老板杰克·戈德曼决心要根除的。怀特试图向斯塔克韦瑟保证，一定有答案。</p><p class="para">White was Starkweather’s superior a couple of levels removed, but had heard nothing of this before. He listened to the saga with mounting frustration. There was no question that the lab’s treatment of Starkweather had been asinine, exactly the sort of parochialism his own boss, Jack Goldman, was determined to eradicate. White tried to reassure Starkweather that there was an answer.</p>
<p class="para">“稍等一下，”他说。“我需要一些时间。”</p><p class="para">“Sit tight,” he said. “I’ll need some time.”</p>
<p class="para">“还要多久？这家伙威胁要把我所有的人都带走。”</p><p class="para">“How much time? This guy’s threatening to take all my people away.”</p>

<p class="para">幸运的是，乔治·怀特是施乐公司为数不多的与斯塔克韦瑟一样欣赏激光的人之一。他在爱荷华大学获得核物理学博士学位，在激光领域拥有丰富的经验。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch09.html.page133"></a>1962 年，作为斯佩里兰德 (Sperry Rand) 实验室的一名年轻员工，他亲自接触了这项新技术。凭借这项工作，他被帕萨迪纳的一家名为 Electro-Optical Systems (EOS) 的小公司招募，该公司后来被出售给施乐公司。</p><p class="para">By lucky chance, George White was one of the few people at Xerox who shared Starkweather’s appreciation for the laser. Having earned his Ph.D. in nuclear physics from the University of Iowa, he had exper<a></a>imented with the new technology himself as a young lab employee at Sperry Rand in 1962. On the strength of that work he had been recruited by a small Pasadena company called Electro-Optical Systems (EOS), which was subsequently sold to Xerox Corporation.</p>
<p class="para">怀特也对斯塔克韦瑟感同身受，因为他亲身经历过这位年轻同事的狭隘思想。“在 EOS，我们了解激光，而我们刚刚被施乐收购，所以我们将两者结合起来，展示了如何利用激光束曝光静电复印鼓，”他回忆道。怀特向约翰·德绍尔展示了激光静电复印的这一第一项原始成果。“他没有方向或背景来理解这个时代最热门的新科学突破，”怀特回忆道。“他只是把它放下了。”</p><p class="para">White also empathized with Starkweather because he had personally experienced the same narrow-mindedness as his younger colleague, at its source. “At EOS we understood lasers and we’d just been acquired by Xerox, so we hitched the two together and showed how you could take a laser beam and expose a xerographic drum,” he recalled. The man to whom White demonstrated this first raw achievement of laser xerography was John Dessauer. “He didn’t have the orientation or the context to understand the hottest new scientific breakthrough of the age,” White recalled. “He just let it drop.”</p>
<p class="para">怀特现在意识到命运又给了施乐一次机会。德绍尔离开了。他的继任者杰克·戈德曼任命怀特为高级产品开发主管。作为戈德曼的突击部队之一，怀特认为他的工作有两个部分：改进现有的复印机技术，使其更清晰、更快地复制传统图像；完善旧技术无法处理的新形式的文档成像。</p><p class="para">White now perceived that fate had granted Xerox another crack at the gold ring. Dessauer was gone. His successor, Jack Goldman, had appointed White head of advanced product development. As one of Goldman’s shock troops, White figured there were two components to his job: refining existing copier technology to reproduce conventional images sharper and faster; and perfecting new forms of document imaging that the old technology could not handle.</p>
<p class="para">但这两个目标需要完全不同的心态。“韦伯斯特可以花费无数的钱来做他们那一丝不苟的化学研究，并在复印机上微调二级效应，”他说。“但他们永远找不到通往新世界的路。”</p><p class="para">But these two goals demanded completely different mentalities. “Webster could spend an infinite amount of money doing their prissy little chemistry and fine-tuning second-order effects in copiers,” he said. “But they would never find their way to the new world.”</p>
<p class="para">强迫 Gary Starkweather（这个新世界的产物）生活在旧世界是没有意义的。就像任何试图在韦伯斯特追求全新方向的人一样，他几乎肯定会被压垮。“加里的项目最好的情况下会因为没有足够的力量让他发挥全部生产力而勉强进行，”怀特总结道。“最坏的情况下，它会被取消，如果他不愿意只为传统复印机设计镜头和照明器，他就不得不另谋高就。”</p><p class="para">There was no point in forcing Gary Starkweather, a creature of that new world, to live in the old. Like anyone who tried to pursue a radical new vector at Webster, he was almost certain to get squashed. “Gary’s project at best would have limped along without enough power to allow his full productivity,” White concluded. “At worst it would have got canceled, and if he wasn’t willing to just design lenses and illuminators for classical copiers he’d have had to look for another job.”</p>
<p class="para">于是怀特跳槽到高盛。“斯塔克韦瑟做了一些了不起的事情，”他告诉老板。“但他在韦伯斯特无法取得成功。没人会听他的，即使有人听，他们也做不到那么先进。”</p><p class="para">So White went up the ladder to Goldman. “Starkweather’s doing some amazing things,” he told his boss. “But he can’t thrive at Webster. Nobody will listen to him, and even if they did they’ll never do anything that far advanced.”</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch09.html.page134"></a>
<p class="para">戈德曼几乎不假思索就解除了对斯塔克韦瑟转会的禁令。韦伯斯特见鬼去吧。如果他们不能利用这个人的才能，他不会袖手旁观，看着他的才能白白浪费。</p><p class="para">With scarcely a second thought Goldman lifted the hold on Starkweather’s transfer.

<p class="para">1971 年 1 月，斯塔克韦瑟作为 PARC 的第 26 名员工来到实验室，被分配到光学科学实验室，他的老同事是韦伯斯特大学的约翰·乌尔巴赫。他为获得这份工作费尽心机，和许多新来者一样，实验室的简陋令他感到震惊。</p><p class="para">Starkweather arrived in January 1971 as PARC employee number 26, assigned to the optical science lab under his old Webster colleague John Urbach. Having scratched and clawed for the assignment he was appalled, as many of his fellow newcomers had been in their turn, by the sheer barrenness of the facility.</p>
<p class="para">他的住处原来是波特大道对面的实验室大楼里四面光秃秃的墙壁和一个插座。不管你怎么说韦伯斯特，那里的每个项目都是从一个闪闪发光、设备齐全的实验室开始的。相比之下，这个地方只是用煤渣砌块墙隔开的空旷空间。斯塔克韦瑟的目光落在墙壁的一个奇怪特征上——它们都与地板接触的地方有一个奇怪的矩形开口。“那些是干什么用的？”他问某人。</p><p class="para">His quarters turned out to be four bare walls and a plug outlet in the lab building fronting on Porter Drive. Say what you would about Webster, every project there started out with a gleaming, fully equipped laboratory. By contrast, this place was nothing but vacant spaces partitioned off by cinder block walls. Starkweather’s glance fell on a strange feature of the walls—they all had some sort of curious rectangular opening down by where they met the floor. “What are those for?” he asked someone.</p>
<p class="para">答案并不令人振奋。原来，这栋建筑以前是动物行为实验室。这些开口让四足动物可以自由地从一个房间移动到另一个房间。每个房间都以其前住户的名字命名；有一个狗房，一个猫房。“你被分配到老鼠房了，”他们告诉他。</p><p class="para">The answer was not exactly cheering. The building, it turned out, formerly had been an animal behavior lab. The openings gave its four-legged inhabitants the freedom to move from room to room. Each room was known by the name of its former inhabitants; there was a dog room, a cat room. “You’ve been assigned the rat room,” they told him.</p>
<p class="para">至少其他人似乎也都是从零开始。当斯塔克韦瑟向他的一位同事询问如何获得一些工具时，那人向他翻了一本来自科学用品商店的破旧目录。</p><p class="para">At least everyone else also seemed to be starting from scratch. When Starkweather asked one of his co-workers how to get his hands on a few tools, the man flipped him a dog-eared catalog from a scientific supply house.</p>
<p class="para">“只需订购您需要的东西即可。”</p><p class="para">“Just order what you need.”</p>
<p class="para">那天晚上，他被放弃在韦伯斯特安全、舒适的生活，而选择……老鼠屋的想法折磨着！回去做复印机工作真的有那么糟糕吗？</p><p class="para">That night he was tormented by the thought of having given up his secure, comfortable existence in Webster in favor of…the rat room! Would going back to copier work really have been that bad?</p>

<p class="para">然而，PARC 的魔力很快就显现出来了。几天之内，他就发现了这种朴素朴素的好处：钱可以用来养老鼠<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch09.html.page135"></a>房间里似乎无限地流淌着。在韦伯斯特，实验室管理层对购买一台价值 2,500 美元的激光机感到不满和抱怨。在这里，没有人对他订购的 15,000 美元的半瓦庞然大物（或必须专门建造以保持冷却的水管和泵）感到惊讶。斯塔克韦瑟没有将就使用旧的剩余复印机进行实验，而是订购了一台能够每分钟打印 60 页的 Model 7000。这台机器准时到达，一位施乐现场技术人员对他的任务感到困惑，他要在一个没有家具的实验室的光秃秃的水泥地上安装一台顶级的办公复印机。</p><p class="para">Yet PARC’s magic-did not take long to assert itself. Within a few days he discovered the upside of its ascetic bareness: Money to furnish the rat <a></a>room seemed to flow in a limitless cascade. At Webster the lab management had pissed and moaned about the purchase of a single $2,500 laser. Here no one so much as blinked at his order for a $15,000 half-watt behemoth (or for the water lines and pump that had to be specially constructed to keep it cooled). Rather than make do with an old surplus copier for his experiments, Starkweather ordered up a Model 7000 capable of turning out sixty pages a minute. This duly arrived, attended by a Xerox field technician perplexed at his assignment to set up a top-of-the-line office copier on the bare concrete floor of an unfurnished lab.</p>

<p class="para">计算机打印机已经存在多年，但从未有一台拥有足够的智能来充分利用数字比特。它们体积庞大、笨拙，由螺线管驱动锤子敲击碳条的机械系统组成，非常像苏联设计团队设想的电动打字机——这是工程师们认为的“拼凑物”（发音为“klooge”）的典型代表。从功能角度来看，它们速度慢、笨拙，并且缺乏图形灵活性。大多数打印机只能打印 128 个字符，即所谓的 ASCII 字符集（该首字母缩写代表“美国信息交换标准代码”）。</p><p class="para">Computer printers had existed for years, yet none had ever been endowed with enough brainpower to take full advantage of the digital bit. They were huge, awkward affairs, messy mechanical systems of solenoids driving hammers into carbon strips, rather like electric typewriters as imagined by a Soviet design team—the epitome of the sort of contraption engineers dismissed as a “kludge” (pronounced “klooge”). From a functional standpoint they were slow, clumsy, and lacked any graphic flexibility. Most were limited to printing the 128 characters comprising the so-called ASCII character set (the acronym stood for “American Standard Code for Information Interchange”).</p>
<p class="para">ASCII 将每个数字和英文字母以及少数行设置字符编码为 7 位数字序列，因此字符数被限制为 128，这是 7 位二进制数字可以表示的最大字符数。如果你想要一些不寻常的字符，比如德语<span class="italic">ü</span>或法语<span class="italic">ç</span>，更不用说非常规大小和花哨字体的字母，你就没那么幸运了。计算机设计师们很高兴，因为七位代码至少允许他们使用大写<span class="italic">和</span>小写字母。</p><p class="para">ASCII encoded every numeral and English-language letter, along with a handful of line-setting characters, as a sequence of seven digital bits—hence the constraint to 128 characters, the maximum number that can be expressed in seven binary digits. If you wanted something unusual, like a German <span class="italic">ü</span> or French <span class="italic">ç</span>, much less lettering of an unconventional size and a fancy typeface, you were out of luck. Computer designers were happy enough that the seven-bit code at least allowed them to have upper-<span class="italic">and</span> lower-case letters.</p>
<p class="para">Starkweather 的任务是制造一台机器，可以打印几乎所有计算机可以创建的图像。他需要解决的第一个问题是如何制造一台机器，可以像他所说的那样“以每秒一页的速度在纸张上做出智能标记”，以匹配 7000<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch09.html.page136"></a>容量。这实际上是他在韦伯斯特大学多年来一直在研究的课题的加速版。在 PARC 解决这个问题又花了 11 个月，直到 1971 年 11 月。</p><p class="para">Starkweather’s assignment was to build a machine that could print on paper almost any image a computer could create. The first problem he needed to solve was how to build a machine that could make, as he put it, “intelligent marks on the sheet at a page a second” to match the 7000’s <a></a>capacity. This was essentially a speeded-up version of the task he had been working on at Webster all those long years. Solving it at PARC took another eleven months, or until November 1971.</p>
<p class="para">他的设计看似简单，其实核心是一个旋转的圆盘，大小和形状与冰球差不多。圆盘边缘铣削有 24 个平面镜面，使其看起来像迪斯科球的横截面。圆盘旋转时，每个镜子都会拾取激光束，并将其重新定向到感光器上，形成一条调制光的扫描线。（想象一下灯塔光束水平扫过墙壁——每秒数千次。）该过程产生的图像在肉眼看来清晰而坚实，但实际上它由感光器上蚀刻的数百万个微小点组成（并依次转移到空白页上），分辨率为每英寸五百条水平线。</p><p class="para">His design was deceptively uncomplicated. At its heart was a spinning disk about the size and shape of a hockey puck. Milled around the rim were twenty-four flat mirrored facets, which gave it the appearance of a cross-sectional slice of a discotheque ball. As the disk spun, each mirror picked up the beam of the laser and redirected it onto the photoreceptor as a sweeping line of modulated light. (Think of a lighthouse beam sweeping horizontally across a wall—thousands of times per second.) The process produced an image that looked clean and solid to the naked eye, but was in fact comprised of millions of minute dots etched on the photoreceptor (and transferred in turn to a blank page) at a resolution of five hundred horizontal lines to the inch.</p>
<p class="para">为使这个复杂的系统保持正常运转，需要进行大量的微调。组装硬件和同步组件就像让一群猫齐声唱歌一样。由于多边形磁盘以每分钟 10,000 转的速度旋转（最初的玻璃原型很快被铝取代），即使是刻面边缘“划动”空气的方式也会产生可测量的阻力。激光本身必须通过“快门”调制高达每秒 5000 万次，该“快门”由一个由 10,000 美元的压电电池驱动的偏振滤光片制成。而且由于它必须符合复印机的速度，斯塔克韦瑟的激光设备必须在每秒在页面上标记超过 2000 万个点。</p><p class="para">Considerable fine-tuning was necessary to keep this complicated system humming along. Assembling the hardware and synchronizing the components was like getting a herd of cats to sing in unison. Since the polygonal disk spun at 10,000 revolutions per minute (the original glass prototype was soon replaced by aluminum), even the way the facet edges “paddled” the air produced measurable resistance. The laser itself had to be modulated up to fifty million times a second by a “shutter” fashioned from a polarizing filter driven by a $10,000 piezoelectric cell. And because it had to conform to the speed of the copier, Starkweather’s laser apparatus had to mark more than 20 million dots on a page every second.</p>
<p class="para">不过，最棘手的问题并不是电子问题，而是传统光学领域的问题。斯塔克韦瑟知道，如果镜面的垂直方向出现哪怕是微小的偏差，扫描线也会错位，最终的图像也会失真或难以辨认，就像摇晃的磁带录音机会让录音带发出刺耳的声音，仿佛是在水下录制的一样。他计算出，要产生清晰的图像，镜面的垂直方向偏差不能超过一角秒——这是一个微观差异。从视觉角度来看，从一英里外看，镜面的偏差不能超过一角硬币的直径。</p><p class="para">Still, the most troublesome problem was not electronic. Instead it fell squarely within the domain of traditional optics. Starkweather knew that if the mirrored facets were even microscopically out of alignment, the scan lines would be out of place and the resultant image distorted or unintelligible, for the same reason a wobbly tape deck makes an audio-cassette warble as though recorded under water. To produce clean images, he calculated, the facets could not be out of vertical alignment by more than an arc-second—a microscopic variance. In visual terms, the mirrors could not be off by more than the diameter of a dime as viewed from a mile away.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch09.html.page137"></a>
<p class="para">按照如此严格的标准制造的磁盘每张至少要花费 10,000 美元——假设这在技术上可行，但斯塔克韦瑟对此表示怀疑。确实存在伺服机械和光学设备，可以非常有效地将错误的扫描重定向回原位。但它们更加昂贵，而且另一个缺点是，这意味着在他的打印机上添加另一个复杂且容易发生故障的组件。斯塔克韦瑟明白公差问题至关重要。如果他不能解决这个问题，他设计的机器就无法以经济高效的方式制造。</p><p class="para">Disks fabricated to such an exacting standard would cost at least $10,000 each—assuming this were technically possible, which Starkweather doubted. It was true that there existed servo-mechanical and optical devices that could quite effectively redirect an errant scan back in place. But they were even more expensive and, as a further drawback, meant adding another complicated and failure-prone component to his printer. Starkweather understood that the tolerance issue was critical. If he could not solve it, he would have designed a machine that could not be cost-effectively manufactured.</p>
<p class="para">他花了两个多月的时间来解决这个难题。“我会坐下来列出所有困难的问题。它们一个接一个地消失，但镜子仍然会留下来。”</p><p class="para">For more than two months he wrestled with the puzzle. “I would sit and write out a list of all the problems that were difficult. One by one they would all drop away, but the mirrors would still be left.”</p>
<p class="para">一天，他闷闷不乐地坐在光学实验室里。实验室的墙壁漆成哑光黑色，灯光也调暗了，以适应附近安装的感光鼓，感光鼓对过度曝光的敏感度与照相底片一样。斯塔克韦瑟在笔记本上涂鸦，重温他在密歇根州立大学一年级时学到的光学基本原理。折射光线的常规方法是什么？当然是棱镜。他画了一个金字塔形的棱镜，一个叠在另一个上面，每个棱镜都比下面的棱镜小，以适应必要的更尖锐的偏转角度。他把纸拿到手臂远处，意识到这些棱镜让他想起了旧教科书上的一个东西：一个普通的圆柱形透镜，中间宽，顶部和底部变窄。“我记得我对自己说，‘小心，这可能行不通。这太简单了。’我把它展示给我的一位实验室助理看，<span class="italic">他</span>说：“这不是太简单了吗？”</p><p class="para">One day he was sitting glumly in his optical lab. The walls were painted matte black and the lights dimmed in deference to a photoreceptor drum mounted nearby, as sensitive to overexposure as a photographic plate. Starkweather doodled on a pad, revisiting the rudimentary principles of optics he had learned as a first-year student at Michigan State. What was the conventional means for refracting light? The prism, of course. He sketched out a pyramid of prisms, one on top of another, each one smaller than the one below to accommodate the sharper angle of necessary deflection. He held the page at arm’s length and realized the prisms reminded him of something out of the old textbooks: an ordinary cylindrical lens, wide in the middle and narrowed at the top and bottom. “I remember saying to myself, ‘Be careful, this may not work. It’s way too easy.’ I showed it to one of my lab assistants and <span class="italic">he</span> said, ‘Isn’t that a little too simple?’”</p>
<p class="para">它<span class="italic">很</span>简单，但效果也令人眼花缭乱。斯塔克韦瑟的奇思妙想是，在磁盘和感光鼓之间以适当的距离放置一个圆柱形透镜，它会捕捉过高或过低的光束，并自动将其偏转到鼓上的正确位置，就像眼镜片将风景图像重新聚焦到人眼错位的视网膜上一样。</p><p class="para">It <span class="italic">was</span> simple. But it was also dazzlingly effective. Starkweather’s brainstorm was that a cylindrical lens interposed at the proper distance between the disk and the photoreceptor drum would catch a beam coming in too high or low and automatically deflect it back to the proper point on the drum, exactly as an eyeglass lens refocuses the image of a landscape onto a person’s misaligned retina.</p>
<p class="para">“我跑到电话机前，打电话给我的供应商 Edmund Scientific，给他们我的信用卡，买了价值 10 美元的战争剩余镜片，”他回忆道。“在他们收到货的两天里，我几乎睡不着觉。”<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch09.html.page138"></a>到了。但后来他们来了，我把它们放进去，果然它们起作用了。”镜头方案万无一失。它涉及一个简单的物理关系，所以它永远不会失败。它没有移动部件，所以它永远不会发生故障。它允许多边形圆盘像甜甜圈一样被冲压出来——不是每台 10,000 美元，而是 100 美元。</p><p class="para">“I ran to the phone and called Edmund Scientific, my supply house, gave them my credit card, and bought ten bucks’ worth of war surplus lenses,” he recalled. “I could hardly sleep the two days before they <a></a>arrived. But then they came, I put them in, and sure enough they worked.” The lens scheme was foolproof. It involved a simple physical relationship, so it could never fail. It had no moving parts, so it could never malfunction. And it permitted the polygonal disks to be stamped out like doughnuts—not at $10,000 apiece, but $100.</p>
<p class="para">“镜子不再需要在一英里的距离上调整到一角硬币的直径，”斯塔克韦瑟回忆道。“它们可以调整到桌面的直径，这是任何人都可以达到的标准。我在建造那台机器的过程中发现了很多东西，但柱面透镜让我说‘尤里卡！’”</p><p class="para">“The mirrors no longer had to conform by the diameter of a dime at a mile’s distance,” Starkweather recalled. “They could be off by the diameter of a tabletop, which was a standard anyone could meet.

<p class="para">这一半的问题由兰普森和新聘用的工程师罗恩·赖德发明的所谓研究字符生成器 (RCG) 解决了，RCG 是另一块健康的铁和硅。RCG 高几英尺，宽十九英寸，装有 33 个绕线存储卡，存储卡上装有近 3,000 个集成电路，是一种超级内存缓冲器，空间足够接收来自计算机的数字文件，逐行扫描评估它，并告诉打印机在哪个点打印哪些点。这在纸上生成了纯电子创建的图像。</p><p class="para">That half was solved by the invention of the so-called Research Character Generator (RCG), another healthy piece of iron and silicon, by Lampson and a newly hired engineer named Ron Rider.

<p class="para">在 1972 年，由于内存成本高昂，这样的事情并不简单。对于 Rider 的机器来说，仅生成传统行式打印机的乏味标准化 ASCII 文本也不够。RCG 必须整合大量自定义字体，这些字体必须手工绘制，转换成数字位，并存储在内存中的某个位置，直到需要时为止，就像在电子货架上一样。</p><p class="para">Nothing like this was simple in 1972 because of the cost of memory.

<p class="para">这意味着任务的复杂性呈指数级增长。ASCII 字符大小相同，每个字符都适合相同的方形。传统文档通常所需的唯一格式化是指示打印机何时移动到下一行的命令。相比之下，PARC 希望打印的定制字符将按比例间隔排列：一些粗体，一些细体，一些超出打印行，一些悬空；一些是罗马体，一些是<span class="italic">斜体</span>，一些<span class="bold">是粗体</span>。</p><p class="para">This meant an exponential increase in the complexity of the task. ASCII characters were all the same size and each fit into the same squared-off shape. The only formatting a conventional document normally required was a command instructing the printer when to move to the next line. By contrast, the custom-designed characters PARC desired to print would be proportionately spaced: some fat, some thin, some reaching above the print line, some dangling below; some roman, some <span class="italic">italic</span>, some <span class="bold">BOLD</span>.</p>
<p class="para">最后，字符生成器必须适应 7000 型的宽边进纸系统，该系统使纸张以更快的速度通过机器。对于复印机来说，这不成问题——只需将原件沿同一轴对齐即可。然而，对于打印机来说，这是一件可怕的事情。来自计算机的图像必须以某种方式旋转才能打印出来。SLOT 不必像打字机那样以原始的线性顺序打印页面，而是必须以垂直切片的方式复制字符，以某种方式将其保持在每页 20 或 30 行打印的位置。</p><p class="para">Finally, the character generator had to adapt to the Model 7000’s system of feeding in pages wide-edge-first, which moved paper through the machine at a faster rate. For copiers this posed no problem—one simply aligned the originals along the same axis. For a printer, however, it was a horror. The image coming from the computer would somehow have to be rotated before it could be printed out. Instead of printing a page in prim linear order like a typewriter, SLOT would have to reproduce the characters in vertical slices, somehow keeping its place on twenty or thirty lines of print per page.</p>
<p class="para">最终，Rider 认为复杂功能的增多是因祸得福。“它迫使你以更普遍的方式思考打印问题，因此解决方案变得更加强大。”尽管名字叫研究字符生成器，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch09.html.page140"></a>并不是逐个字符地传递图像，而是以计算机指定的形式传输数字化图像。就像 PARC 在最初几年开发的许多东西一样，这最终解答了许多当时甚至没有人问过的问题。</p><p class="para">Rider ultimately came to see the proliferation of complications as a blessing in disguise. “It forced you to think about the problem of printing in a much more generalized fashion, so the solution turned out to be much more robust.” Despite its name, the research character generator <a></a>was less about delivering images character-by-character than about transmitting digitized images in whatever form the computer dictated. Like so much PARC developed in those first few years, this turned out to be the answer to a multitude of questions no one was yet even asking.</p>
<p class="para">斯塔克韦瑟和赖德一直合作协调 SLOT 和字符生成器，​​直到 1972 年初，他们遇到的阻碍并非技术障碍，而是一个完全人为的障碍。PARC 的 70 名科学家中有 20 多名搬迁到山上的一栋新从 Singer 公司租用的大楼里，该大楼被称为 34 号楼（因为其地址是 3406 Hillview）。包括赖德在内的计算机科学实验室被转移到新宿舍，而斯塔克韦瑟在内的其他人则暂时留在波特。这次搬迁使两者之间相隔一公里的土地——太远了，无法架设架空线，而且由于四车道的 Foothill 高速公路挡住了路，无法通过地面电缆连接。</p><p class="para">Starkweather and Rider worked together on coordinating the SLOT and character generator until early 1972, when they were stymied not by a technical obstacle but one entirely man-made. This was the relocation of more than twenty of PARC’s seventy scientists up the hill to a building newly rented from the Singer Company and known as Building 34 (because its address was 3406 Hillview). The Computer Science Lab, including Rider, got bundled off to the new quarters while everyone else, including Starkweather, temporarily stayed behind on Porter. The move separated the two by a kilometer of real estate—too far to string an overhead line and, with the four-lane Foothill Highway in the way, impossible to link via a ground cable.</p>
<p class="para">“管理人员说，‘别担心。一年后你们就会重新团聚了，’”斯塔克韦瑟回忆道。“我说，‘太好了，那我们这段时间该做些什么呢？’”</p><p class="para">“The administrators said, ‘Don’t worry. You’ll be back together in another year,’” Starkweather recalled. “I said, ‘Great, what are we supposed to do in the meantime?’”</p>
<p class="para">但搬家后不久的一个周日下午，斯塔克韦瑟坐在家里时灵光一现。他立即跳上车，开车前往波特大道，爬上楼梯来到屋顶。正如他所想的那样，他可以从他所站的位置直视 34 号楼的屋顶。他可能无法通过电缆或电线跨越这段距离——但他可以用激光束做到这一点。</p><p class="para">But one Sunday afternoon shortly after the move Starkweather got a brainstorm while sitting at home. He immediately jumped in his car, drove to Porter Drive, and mounted a stairwell to the roof. Just as he had thought, he could take line-of-sight aim from where he stood to the rooftop of Building 34. He might not be able to span the distance by cable or wire—but he could do it by laser beam.</p>
<p class="para">第二天，他从埃德蒙公司订购了四台望远镜，每台约 300 美元。他和赖德将其中两台望远镜的目镜换成了低功率激光器，将其他望远镜的目镜换成了灵敏的光电探测器。他们在每个屋顶上都安装了一个激光望远镜和一个探测器，将它们对准对面的配套望远镜，以建立可见光数据链路。电路几乎在任何天气下都能完美运行，即使是在雾天，不过暴雨过后，积水的重量会使屋顶略微下陷，因此通常需要进行一些小的调整。</p><p class="para">The next day he ordered four telescopes from Edmund’s for about $300 apiece. He and Rider replaced the eyepieces of two with low-power lasers and the others with sensitive photodetectors. They bolted one laser scope and one detector on each roof, aiming each at its complement across the way, to create a visible light data link. The circuit worked flawlessly in almost any weather, even fog, although minor adjustments were often necessary after a rainstorm, when the weight of accumulated water made the roofs sag slightly.</p>
<p class="para">“当 SLOT 运行时，我会向山上发送一个光脉冲，向字符生成器发出信号，让其将一行数据发送到我屋顶上的探测器，然后探测器会将其发送到这台激光器，然后再发送到打印机，”<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch09.html.page141"></a>斯塔克韦瑟回忆道，“毕竟，我们只是对 1 和 0 进行编码。这就像在由光而不是铜制成的长线上传输二进制数据。”</p><p class="para">“When SLOT was running I’d send a pulse of light up the hill to signal the character generator to send a line of data down to the detector on my roof, which would send it down to this laser and then to the printer,” <a></a>Starkweather recalled. “After all, we were only encoding ones and zeros. It was like sending binary data on a long wire made out of light, instead of copper.”</p>
<p class="para">唯一真正的问题来自于这种安排本身的诡异性。一天雾蒙蒙的夜晚过后，里克·琼斯 (Rick Jones) 被叫到办公室处理一名恼怒的帕洛阿尔托警察的投诉。据称，一名当地司机前一天晚上被头顶上鬼鬼祟祟的红色光束吓到，从山麓公路 (Foothill Highway) 冲进了沟里。无论 PARC 想做什么，它都造成了交通隐患，必须停止。</p><p class="para">The only real problem arose from the arrangement’s elemental spookiness. One morning after a foggy night Rick Jones was summoned from his office to field a complaint from a peeved Palo Alto police officer. It seemed that a local motorist startled by a ghostly red beam crossing overhead had run herself off Foothill Highway into a ditch the night before. Whatever PARC was up to, it had created a traffic hazard and would have to stop.</p>
<p class="para">琼斯安抚了警官，并将问题报告给了斯塔克韦瑟，斯塔克韦瑟通过稍微调低焦距避免了进一步的事故。从那时起，光束会变得太宽，即使在雾中也看不见，但也不会太宽，以至于无法重新聚焦到接收器端的足够容差。</p><p class="para">Jones placated the officer and brought the issue to Starkweather, who averted further mishaps by coarsening the focus just a bit. From then on the beam would be too broad to be seen even in the fog, but not so much that it could not be refocused to adequate tolerance at the receptor end.</p>
<p class="para">“这样，我们就能让实验持续一年，直到我们能把所有人都带到山上，”斯塔克韦瑟回忆道。“除了那次事故和几只鸟被一道明亮的红色闪光击中外，我们没有遇到任何问题。”</p><p class="para">“That way we were able to keep the experiment going for a year, until we could move everybody up the hill,” Starkweather recalled. “Outside of that and a couple of birds that got hit with a bright red flash, we never had a single problem.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">Starkweather 的 SLOT 和 Rider 的字符生成器是 PARC 正在即时创建的完整交互式办公环境的四个支柱中的两个。在同一时期，Thacker、McCreight 和 Lampson 正在开发 Alto；Alan Kay 和他的学习研究小组正在设计一个图形用户界面，旨在使计算机直观易用；Bob Metcalfe 和 David Boggs 正在设计一个网络（以太网），以将所有其他组件连接在一起。“我们的想法是，您应该能够在 Alto 上创建一个文件，并通过以太网将其发送到打印服务器 [即管理每个人的打印订单的公用计算机]，该服务器会将其转换为光栅并打印出来，”Rider 回忆道。当它最终实现时，整个阵列将以相当不雅的首字母缩写 EARS 而闻名，代表“以太网-Alto-RCG-SLOT”。</p><p class="para">Starkweather’s SLOT and Rider’s character generator were two of the four legs of the complete interactive office environment PARC was creating on the fly. In the same period Thacker, McCreight, and Lampson were building the Alto; Alan Kay and his Learning Research Group were designing a graphical user interface aimed at making computers intuitively simple to use; and Bob Metcalfe and David Boggs were designing a network—the Ethernet—to tie all the other components together. “We had in mind that you ought to be able to create a file on the Alto and ship it via the Ethernet to a print server [that is, a communal computer managing everyone’s print orders], which would convert it to a raster and print it out,” Rider recalled. When it was finally implemented, the whole array would be known by the rather inelegant acronym EARS, which stood for “Ethernet-Alto-RCG-SLOT.”</p>
<p class="para">在这四款产品中，激光打印机是最接近上市的，因为它是对标准施乐复印机的相当简单的修改。然而，它的商业化之路将是漫长而“血腥的”，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch09.html.page142"></a>正如杰克·戈德曼后来所说的那样——预示着在将 PARC 的发明推向市场的战争中还会有其他战斗。</p><p class="para">Of the four, the laser printer was closest to being marketable, representing as it did a fairly straightforward modification of a standard Xerox copier. Yet its road to commercialization would be a long and “gory” one, <a></a>as Jack Goldman later remarked—presaging other battles to come in the war to bring PARC’s inventions to market.</p>
<p class="para">第一次失误发生在 1972 年，当时 EARS 的其他组件尚未投入使用。那一年，劳伦斯利弗莫尔国家实验室（一家一直致力于推广新技术的机构）公开招标五台激光打印机。只是表面上看，这是一次公开招标，因为利弗莫尔知道只有 PARC 开发了适用技术。</p><p class="para">The first stumble occurred in 1972, even before EARS’s other components were operational. That year the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, an institution always primed to promote new technologies, publicly requested bids for five laser printers. Only on the surface was this a public solicitation, for Livermore knew that PARC alone had developed the applicable technology.</p>
<p class="para">杰克·戈德曼急于投标，他认为利弗莫尔的合同将保证 PARC 的第一个上市产品立即成名。出乎意料的是，他被前福特汽车公司财务人员、负责施乐工程和制造集团的詹姆斯·奥尼尔否决了。</p><p class="para">Jack Goldman was eager to fill the bid, figuring that the Livermore contract would guarantee instant celebrity for PARC’s first marketable product. Unexpectedly, he was overruled by James O’Neill, a former Ford Motor Company finance man who was in charge of Xerox’s engineering and manufacturing group.</p>
<p class="para">高德曼非常愤怒。“我向他大吵大闹，”他回忆道。“我说，‘你为什么拒绝？’他说，‘我拒绝是因为我们会亏钱。施乐 7000 的可靠性无法承受利弗莫尔的复印量。我们将派出很多维修人员，合同期内我们将损失 15 万美元。’”</p><p class="para">Goldman was furious. “I raised a fuss with him,” he recalled. “I said, ‘Why are you turning it down?’ He said, ‘I’m turning it down because we’ll lose money. The reliability of the Xerox 7000 can’t stand the copy volume Livermore will be turning out. We’ll be sending so many repairmen out there we’ll lose $150,000 over the life of the contract.’”</p>
<p class="para">戈德曼认为，奥尼尔完全搞错了。PARC 已经证明，当机器以激光模式运行时，其可靠性提高了十倍以上，因为激光打印绕过了最容易发生故障的移动部件。“我们在这种机器的可靠性方面拥有丰富的经验，”他说。“我们已经在实验室里打印了数百万份，每个人都在使用它。”</p><p class="para">O’Neill had it all wrong, Goldman argued. PARC had shown that the machine’s reliability improved by more than tenfold when it operated in laser mode, because laser printing circumvented the moving parts most prone to failure. “We had a lot of experience in the reliability of this thing,” he said. “We had turned out millions of copies already in the lab, where everyone was using it.”</p>
<p class="para">然而，两位高管的分歧不仅仅是技术上的误解。它反映了营销价值观的根本冲突。奥尼尔认为，让施乐公司销售一款目前没有大批量生产前景或营销支持前景的机器毫无意义。施乐公司不会向利弗莫尔出售复印机原型；为什么要卖给它激光打印机原型呢？</p><p class="para">Yet the two executives’ disagreement was more than a technical misunderstanding. It reflected a fundamental clash of marketing values. O’Neill saw little point in committing Xerox to selling a machine for which there was no immediate prospect of high-volume production or marketing backup. The company would not sell Livermore a prototype copier; why sell it a prototype laser printer?</p>
<p class="para">高盛的反驳是，推出旧复印机的新版本和推出一项全新技术之间有着天壤之别；实现后者的唯一方法是满足“早期采用者”的胃口——客户愿意冒险尝试不熟悉的产品，只是为了看看它们能做些什么。但他输了。</p><p class="para">Goldman’s rejoinder was that there was a world of difference between introducing a new version of an old copier and launching an entirely new technology; the only way to accomplish the latter was to feed the appetite of “early adopters”—clients willing to take a chance on unfamiliar products just to see what they might do. But he lost the argument.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch09.html.page143"></a>
<p class="para">“如果你要推出新产品，就必须冒一定的风险，”他后来说。“奥尼尔拒绝让我们完成那份订单，看看他做出了多大的牺牲。那台机器本来可以掌控整个世界。”</p><p class="para">“You have to take certain chances if you’re going to introduce a new product,” he said later. “O’Neill refused to let us fill that order, and look what he sacrificed. That machine would have had the world by the tail.”</p>
<p class="para">但激光打印机却在产品规划的停滞状态中又过了两年，这时高盛不得不再次出手相助——这一次更为成功——才使它免于灭绝。</p><p class="para">Instead the laser printer spent another two years in product planning limbo, at which point Goldman had to intercede again—this time more successfully—to save it from extinction.</p>
<p class="para">1974 年，施乐公司的产品评审委员会就该向市场推出哪种计算机打印机展开了辩论。该委员会的成员中，企业规划人员占多数，而工程师几乎为零。在最后关头，戈德曼发现委员会计划推荐韦伯斯特设计的一款名为“超级打印机”的机器，它使用 CRT 或阴极射线管（比激光暗数千倍）将图像投射到感光器上。</p><p class="para">That happened in 1974 when Xerox’s product review committee, on which corporate staff planners were overrepresented and engineers almost nonexistent, debated which kind of computer printer Xerox should bring to market. At the eleventh hour Goldman discovered that the committee planned to recommend a Webster-designed machine known as the “Superprinter,” which used CRTs, or cathode ray tubes—thousands of times dimmer than a laser—to project an image onto a photoreceptor.</p>
<p class="para">“一群对技术一无所知的蠢货做出了这个决定，”戈德曼回忆道。他认为超级打印机根本无法满足高速打印的要求。“当时 Starkweather 已经开发出了激光打印技术，而罗切斯特的人则在考虑 CRT，这绝对是一种落后的做法。”</p><p class="para">“A bunch of horse’s asses who didn’t know anything about technology were making the decision,” Goldman recollected. The Superprinter, he contended, was hopelessly unequal to the demands of high-speed printing. “Here laser printing had already been developed by Starkweather, and the guys back in Rochester were thinking in terms of CRTs, which was absolutely a backward way of doing it.”</p>
<p class="para">这次，戈德曼不仅争辩，还强行叫来一架公司飞机，催促委员会的两名关键成员——规划副总裁唐·彭德利 (Don Pendery) 和他的老板、员工副总裁比尔·苏德斯 (Bill Souders) 上机，参加 PARC 匆忙安排的激光打印演示。</p><p class="para">This time Goldman did more than argue. Commandeering a company plane, he hustled two key committee members onto it—Don Pendery, the planning vice president, and his boss, a staff vice president named Bill Souders—for a hastily arranged demo of laser printing at PARC.</p>
<p class="para">“那是周一晚上。我说，‘我们今晚出去，明晚回来，赶上周三早上的会议。’我们让他们信服了。帕洛阿尔托的人非常出色地介绍了它。一切都顺利进行。这两个人看了看，说，‘嘿，这确实是可行的办法。’我们能够推翻韦伯斯特的提议。”</p><p class="para">“It was Monday night. I said, ‘We’re going out tonight and coming back tomorrow night in time for Wednesday morning’s meeting.’ And we made believers out of them. The guys at Palo Alto did a masterful job of presenting it. Everything worked without a hitch. These two guys looked at it and said, ‘Hey, this is really the way to go.’ And we were able to override the proposal from Webster.”</p>
<p class="para">尽管如此，这仍然是一场施乐式的胜利，充其量只是一场惨胜。尽管委员会接受了激光技术，但它拒绝了戈德曼提出的制造激光改装的 Model 7000 复印机的请求，就像斯塔克韦瑟所做的那样。这<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch09.html.page144"></a>该公司本可以在一年内推出激光打印机。但专家组决定等到施乐公司推出下一代高速复印机 9000 系列时再推出，而这还要等三年。</p><p class="para">Still, it was a Xerox-style victory, Pyrrhic at best. Although the committee accepted laser technology, it rejected Goldman’s appeal to build laser-adapted Model 7000 copiers, as Starkweather had done. This <a></a>would have allowed the company to market a laser printer within a year. The panel decided instead to wait until the launch of Xerox’s next generation of high-speed copiers, the 9000 series—which was not scheduled for another three years.</p>
<p class="para">这是一次危险的拖延。在此期间，激光打印机商业化的计划被扼杀又复活了三次，幸亏一位名叫杰克·刘易斯 (Jack Lewis) 的高管的固执才得以挽救。他负责公司的打印部门，无​​视上级的命令，放弃了这个项目。最终，加里·斯塔克韦瑟的激光设备于 1977 年作为 9700 打印机推出，成为施乐有史以来最畅销的产品之一，实现了其发明者的信念。</p><p class="para">It was a perilous delay. The plan to commercialize the laser printer would be killed and resurrected three times in that period, saved only by the obstinacy of an executive named Jack Lewis, who ran the company’s printing division and ignored the orders from higher-ups to deep-six the project. Finally launched in 1977 as the 9700 printer, Gary Starkweather’s laser device fulfilled its inventor’s faith by becoming one of Xerox’s best-selling products of all time.</p>
<p class="para">即便如此，对于韦伯斯特的白光复印机工程师来说，激光打印机始终摆脱不了外星技术的恐怖面貌。</p><p class="para">Even so, for the white-light copier engineers of Webster the laser printer never shed the frightening aspect of an alien technology.</p>
<p class="para">“多年后我回到了那里，”斯塔克韦瑟说。“我遇到了我的前老板，他曾试图阻止我离开。他对我说的最后一句话是，‘你还在玩那些激光玩意儿吗？’”</p><p class="para">“Years afterwards I went back there,” Starkweather said. “I ran into my old boss, the one who had tried to keep me from leaving. His last words to me were, ‘Are you still playing around with that laser stuff?’</p>
<p class="para">“那时，激光打印机的年产值已经达到 20 亿美元。”</p><p class="para">“By then the laser printer was a $2 billion-a-year business.”</p>

<p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">克里斯</span></span>·杰弗斯深吸了一口气，走进波特大道角落的大会议室。艾伦·凯招募了他的儿时好友加入 PARC，担任文书和参谋长，指导他通过了严格的面试程序，并完成了最后一道障碍，即在全体会议上向未来的同事发表技术报告。房间里有大约 20 名科学家和工程师在等待杰弗斯，他们都不可思议地躺在铺着可怕的芥末黄色织物的豆袋椅上。即将召开的每周会议被简称为“经销商”。它已经是 PARC 的一个机构。</p><p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">C</span></span>hris Jeffers took a deep breath before walking into the big corner conference room on Porter Drive. Alan Kay, who had recruited his childhood friend to join PARC as a sort of amanuensis and chief of staff, had guided him through the rigorous interview process and as far as this last hurdle, the delivering of a technical presentation to his future colleagues sitting in a sort of plenary session. Waiting for Jeffers inside the room were about twenty scientists and engineers, all lounging improbably on beanbag chairs upholstered in a ghastly mustard-yellow fabric. The weekly meeting about to convene had come to be known simply as “Dealer.” It was already a PARC institution.</p>
<p class="para">鲍勃·泰勒喜欢告诉人们，他管理 CSL 的风格结合了他所知道的所有研究实验室的最佳特点。但它的结构主要源于一个小核心：ARPA 开发的管理原则。泰勒的前任留给他的格言是，管理研究的最佳方式是选择特定领域的最佳人才，然后放手让他们自由发挥。伊万·萨瑟兰说，具备 ARPA 所要求的崇高技能的科学家“是那些有想法的人，你可以支持他们，也可以不支持他们，但他们很难被影响。你可以<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch10.html.page146"></a>也许可以让他们相信某件事是有趣且重要的，但你不能告诉他们该做什么。”</p><p class="para">Bob Taylor liked to tell people that his style of managing CSL combined the best features of all the research labs he had ever known. But its structure sprouted largely from a small kernel: the management principles developed at ARPA. Taylor’s predecessors had bequeathed him the axiom that the best way to manage research was to select the best people in a given field and set them loose. Scientists with the lofty skills ARPA demanded, Ivan Sutherland said, “are people who have ideas you can either back or not, but they are quite difficult to influence. You can <a></a>maybe convince them that something’s of interest and importance, but you cannot tell them what to do.”</p>
<p class="para">另一方面，你可以找到一种方法让他们互相交流。泰勒在 ARPA 承包商会议上毫不妥协的交流让 PARC 以“经销商”的形式再现了这一点。</p><p class="para">On the other hand, you can find a way for them to tell each other. The uncompromising give-and-take of Taylor’s ARPA contractor meetings lent itself to reproduction at PARC in the form of “Dealer.”</p>
<p class="para">这个名字源自《<span class="italic">打败庄家》</span>一书，作者是爱德华·O·索普，他是麻省理工学院的数学教授，他开发了一种在 21 点游戏中获胜的万无一失的系统——“打败庄家”——通过计算手中发出的高牌和低牌。（这个真正有效的系统让谦逊的爱德华·索普成为专业 21 点算牌的教父。）</p><p class="para">The name derived from the book <span class="italic">Beat the Dealer</span>, by Edward O. Thorp, an MIT math professor who had developed a surefire system for winning at blackjack—“beating the dealer”—by counting the high- and low-value cards dealt out in hands. (This truly effective system would make the unassuming Ed Thorp the godfather of professional blackjack card-counting.)</p>
<p class="para">泰勒并不是一个二十一点游戏迷。<span class="italic">《打败庄家》</span>吸引他的是它的一个引人入胜的比喻，一个勇敢的人面对一群训练有素、意志坚定的对手的挑战。在赌场二十一点游戏中，庄家与桌上的每个人对战。在泰勒的版本中，一位研究人员会提出一个想法或项目，然后独自捍卫它，抵御同行的分析。</p><p class="para">Taylor was not much of a blackjack buff. What interested him about <span class="italic">Beat the Dealer</span> was its compelling metaphor of a doughty individual fielding the challenge of a group of trained and determined adversaries. In casino blackjack the dealer plays against everyone at the table. In Taylor’s variant a single researcher would propose an idea or project, then stand alone to defend it against dissection by his peers.</p>
<p class="para">Dealer 很快成为 CSL 专业机构的心脏，整个实验室的人都会聚集在一个房间里，房间里摆放着 Peter Deutsch 和他的妻子 Barbara 在伯克利朋友的商店里发现的豆袋椅。会议通常在星期二举行（尽管指定的日期会不时更改），时间大致安排在午餐时间，通常持续一个小时。Taylor 的所有下属都必须出席，这是他严格执行的唯一实验室规则，其他实验室的人也可以参加，至少一开始是这样。后来，随着 PARC 的扩张，Dealer 的人群几乎变得无法管理，非 CSL 人员只有在受到邀请或获得特别许可的情况下才会受到欢迎。（Kay 虽然是 SSL 成员，但拥有永久通行证。）</p><p class="para">Dealer was soon institutionalized as the beating heart of CSL’s professional organism, a time when the entire lab would gather in a room furnished with the beanbag chairs that Peter Deutsch and his wife, Barbara, had discovered at a friend’s shop in Berkeley. The meetings, which were usually on a Tuesday (although the designated day changed from time to time), were scheduled more or less at lunchtime and generally lasted an hour. Attendance was mandatory for all of Taylor’s subordinates, the only lab rule he rigidly enforced, and the other labs were welcome to attend, at least at first. Later, as PARC expanded and the crowd at Dealer threatened to become unmanageable, non-CSL personnel became welcome only upon invitation or special dispensation. (Kay, though an SSL member, owned a permanent pass.)</p>
<p class="para">泰勒在每场会议开始时都会花 10 到 15 分钟讨论一些常规事项，然后才将发言权交给当周的指定发牌人。此时，游戏就变成了一种更像扑克的游戏。发牌人不仅有权设定讨论的主题，还有权设定辩论的规则。</p><p class="para">Taylor would open each session with ten to fifteen minutes of housekeeping items before yielding the floor to that week’s designated dealer. At that point the game transmuted into something more like poker. It was the dealer’s prerogative to set not only the topic of discussion, but the rules of debate.</p>
<p class="para">“我希望有条件让某人能够站到谈判桌上<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch10.html.page147"></a>并像沙皇一样制定规则，”泰勒回忆道。“你可以说，不许打断；或者你想打断就打断。或者我只辩论 x、y 或 z；或者只有右撇子可以辩论。”讨论主题同样不受限制。当然，他们倾向于实验室的重要问题，但这一类别定义广泛。CSL 图形专家鲍勃·弗莱格尔 (Bob Flegal) 曾向他的同事演示如何拆开自行车并润滑零件，而埃德·菲亚拉 (Ed Fiala) 因一次令人难忘的演讲而闻名，演讲内容是编程算法如何类似于厨房食谱。</p><p class="para">“I wanted to have conditions where someone could get up to the table <a></a>and set rules as czar,” Taylor recalled. “You could say, no interruptions; or interrupt whenever you want. Or I’ll only debate x, y, or z; or only righthanders can argue.” The discussion topics were similarly unconstrained. Certainly they tended toward issues of importance to the lab, but that category was broadly defined. Bob Flegal, a CSL graphics expert, once demonstrated for his colleagues how to take a bicycle apart and lubricate the parts, and Ed Fiala was famous for a memorable presentation on how programming algorithms resemble kitchen recipes.</p>
<p class="para">有影响力支持的局外人获得了额外的自由，比如凯伊告诉杰弗斯他将在下一届 Dealer 上发表演讲，这让杰弗斯大吃一惊。杰弗斯根本不是一个训练有素的计算机科学家，他之前几年先是在尼泊尔担任和平队志愿者，然后在该机构的华盛顿办事处担任官员。他告诉凯伊，他无法为 PARC 的数字选民们准备一份合适的演讲稿。</p><p class="para">Outsiders arriving with influential backing got extra latitude, as happened when Kay surprised Jeffers with the news that he would be making a speech at the next Dealer. Jeffers, the farthest thing from a trained computer scientist, had spent the previous few years first as a Peace Corps volunteer in Nepal and then as an official in the agency’s Washington office. He told Kay there was no way he could cook up an appropriate presentation to the digital elect of PARC.</p>
<p class="para">Kay 建议道：“只谈论你知道的事情。”</p><p class="para">Kay advised, “Just talk about something you know.”</p>
<p class="para">“所以我做了一个关于尼泊尔语言和文化的社会语言学的演讲，我们玩得很开心，”杰弗斯如释重负地回忆道。“实际上，我感觉很自在。”</p><p class="para">“So I gave a speech about the sociolinguistics of Nepalese language and culture, and we had a good time with that,” Jeffers recalled with relief. “Actually, I felt quite at home.”</p>
<p class="para">这也是泰勒计划的一部分。一旦被实验室录取，你就不会受到大学各部门常见的琐碎骚扰。“你是大家庭的一员，”凯实验室的成员约翰·肖克 (John Shoch) 说道。“没有人会问，‘你到底是谁，你在这里做什么？’”泰勒认为，另一种选择是，以一己之力阻碍思想的自由交流。“如果有人试图推行自己的个性而不是自己的论点，他们会发现这是行不通的。”</p><p class="para">This was also part of Taylor’s scheme. Once accepted into the lab, you were immune to the petty harassments common to university departments. “You were part of the extended family,” related John Shoch, a member of Kay’s lab. “No one ever asked, ‘Who the hell are you and what are you doing here?’” The alternative, Taylor believed, was for one-upmanship to hobble the unfettered exchange of ideas. “If someone tried to push their personality rather than their argument, they’d find that it wouldn’t work.”</p>
<p class="para">但最好仔细考虑一下这个论点。任何试图偷偷向这个群体提出不合理概念的人，肯定会被 Thacker 的一声“<span class="italic">胡说八道！</span> ”或 ARPANET 资深专家 Severe Ornstein 的“<span class="italic">胡说八道！</span> ”打断。然后会是一连串愤怒的谴责：“你不知道自己在说什么！”“这绝对行不通！”“这是我听过的最愚蠢的想法！”Lampson 可能会以极快的速度逐行解构演讲者可悲的推理。如果这位受训的经销商很幸运（并且仍然<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch10.html.page148"></a>当人们谈论他第一次尝试时（站立），讨论可能最终会转向如何改进他糟糕的第一次尝试。</p><p class="para">But the argument had best be carefully thought out. Anyone trying to slip an unsound concept past this group was sure to be stopped short by an explosive “<span class="italic">Bullshit!</span>” from Thacker or “<span class="italic">Nonsense!</span>” from the beetle-browed ARPANET veteran Severe Ornstein. Then would follow a cascade of angry denunciations: “You don’t know what you’re talking about!” “That’ll never work!” “That’s the stupidest idea I’ve ever heard!” Lampson might add a warp-speed chapter-and-verse deconstruction of the speaker’s sorry reasoning. If the chastened dealer was lucky (and still <a></a>standing), the discussion might finally turn to how he might improve on his poor first effort.</p>
<p class="para">当 Dealer 开始批评应聘者的资质时，批评可能特别无情。科学天才们花了半生时间在充满敌意的教职委员会面前捍卫深奥的研究，而这小群懒洋洋地坐在豆袋椅上，粗鲁地发表尖锐的毁灭性评论，很容易让他们感到不安。新人离开 Dealer 时几乎总是心神不宁。</p><p class="para">The criticisms could be particularly ruthless when Dealer turned to the qualifications of a job candidate. Scientific prodigies who had spent half their lives defending abstruse research before hostile faculty committees were easily unnerved by this small group slouched in their beanbags, rudely firing off comments of annihilating incisiveness. Newcomers almost always came away from Dealer profoundly unsettled.</p>
<p class="para">但即使是最有经验的讲师也会被人为操纵。在一次令人难忘的 Dealer 会议上，特邀演讲人是卡内基梅隆大学 (CMU) 的杰出教授艾伦·纽厄尔 (Alan Newell)，他不仅是在场六名工程师的朋友，也是他们的导师。纽厄尔实际上撰写了计算机架构教科书。这次会议议程要求他在摄像机前解决一个棘手的编程问题，以便匹兹堡的学生能够一步一步地研究他的思维过程，就像调试代码行一样。然而，在最初的几个步骤中，他无意中犯了一个低级错误。学生们听到的却是满屋子机灵的工程师向越来越慌乱的纽厄尔直言不讳地提出如何从错误中恢复的建议。</p><p class="para">But even the most experienced lecturers could get themselves man-handled. The featured speaker at one memorable Dealer was Alan Newell, a distinguished professor at Carnegie-Mellon University, or CMU, who was not only friend but mentor to a good half-dozen of the engineers in the room. Newell literally had written the textbook on computer architectures. On this occasion the agenda called for him to solve a tricky programming problem in front of a video camera so his students back in Pittsburgh would be able to study his thought process step by step, as though debugging lines of code. Within the first few steps, however, he unwittingly committed a rudimentary mistake. What the students got on tape instead was a roomful of smartassed engineers peppering the increasingly flustered Newell with bluntly phrased suggestions about how to recover from his blunder.</p>
<p class="para">人们只记得有一次，该小组被特别命令要对一位客人手下留情。1973 年初，帕克决定聘请哈罗德·霍尔 (Harold Hall)，一位曾在 ARPA 和福特工作过的和蔼可亲的研究主管，来接替比尔·甘宁 (Bill Gunning) 担任 SSL 负责人。霍尔没有免于接受集体采访的仪式，但帕克也不想让他受到粗暴对待。</p><p class="para">Only once could anyone recall the group’s being specifically ordered to go easy on a guest. In early 1973 Pake decided to hire Harold Hall, an avuncular research executive who had worked at ARPA and Ford, to be the long-awaited replacement for Bill Gunning as SSL chief. Hall was not exempt from the ritual of the mass interview, but Pake did not want him roughhoused, either.</p>
<p class="para">“显然，泰勒被告知，他必须确保哈罗德得到尊重和热情的接待，”CSL 工程师查克·格什克回忆道。“所以，鲍勃没有让他在 Dealer 一开始就进来，而是先给我们讲了一堂关于适当行为方式的小课，以及施乐公司大多数高管对 Dealer 的正常行为有何不同。”吉姆·莫里斯是一位来自卡内基梅隆大学的尖酸刻薄的移植者，他坐在后面。“突然，”格什克回忆道，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch10.html.page149"></a>“莫里斯说：‘等一下！我明白了！你是想告诉我们，你正准备把一块瓷器送进牛市商店！’”</p><p class="para">“Taylor obviously had been told that he had to make sure Harold got a nice respectful reception,” recalled the CSL engineer Chuck Geschke. “So rather than have him come in right at the beginning of Dealer, Bob first gave us a little lecture on appropriate modes of behavior and how most executives in the Xerox Corporation wouldn’t be accustomed to what normally went on in Dealer.” Jim Morris, an acid-tongued transplant from CMU, was sitting in the back. “Suddenly,” Geschke recalled, <a></a>“Morris said, ‘Wait a minute! I get it! You’re trying to tell us that you’re just about to send a piece of china into the bull shop!’”</p>
<p class="para">但这种特殊处理很少见。Dealer 的无情评判源自工程师的精神，他们被教导答案可以是对的也可以是错的，“一”或“零”，但不能介于两者之间。人们认为，如果你错了，被告知你是对的、半对的或已经做了不错的尝试，对你没有任何好处。“这跟个人恩怨无关，”奥恩斯坦说。“我们不想被溺爱，也不想浪费时间。”</p><p class="para">But such special handling was rare. The pitiless judgments dispensed at Dealer derived from the ethos of the engineer, who is taught that an answer can be right or wrong, “one” or “zero,” but not anything in between. It was felt that if you were wrong you were done no favor in being told you were right, or half-right, or had made a decent try. “There was nothing personal about it,” said Ornstein. “We didn’t want to be coddled or have our time wasted.”</p>
<p class="para">这并不是说这个系统完全客观。鲍勃·梅特卡夫 (Bob Metcalfe) 认为实验室偶尔会利用 Dealer 的粗暴精神来执行自己的偏见，他于 1972 年来到 CSL，拥有哈佛大学和麻省理工学院的可靠学历。梅特卡夫说话尖刻、直言不讳，他从未遇到过他无法刺穿的自负者。在 Dealer，他的雷达经常能探测到那些摆架子的人发出的明显“砰砰”声。</p><p class="para">That is not to say that the system was entirely objective. One who thought the lab occasionally used the brutish spirit of Dealer to enforce its own prejudgments was Bob Metcalfe, who arrived at CSL in 1972 with the reassuring credentials of a Harvard and MIT education. Metcalfe was acerbic and free-speaking, a man who never met an ego he couldn’t pierce. At Dealer his radar often detected the unmistakable “ping” of people pulling rank.</p>
<p class="para">“我现在有点怀疑了，但如果你来自伯克利、麻省理工学院，尤其是卡内基梅隆大学，你会发表演讲，你会被问到一些问题，你会得到祝贺，你会得到一份工作机会，”他说。“但如果你是亚利桑那大学的可怜虫，他们会盘问你，然后就完事了。换句话说，如果卡内基梅隆大学的系主任说你很酷，那对他们来说就足够了。”</p><p class="para">“I’m being cynical now, but if you were from Berkeley or MIT or, especially, CMU, you’d give your talk, you’d get some questions, you’d get congratulated, and you’d get a job offer,” he said. “But if you were some poor schmuck from the University of Arizona, they’d grill you and it was all over. In other words, if the department head at CMU said you were cool, that was good enough for them.”</p>
<p class="para">其他人也没有忽视泰勒在 CSL 促进群体意识的努力的反面。如果实验室内部没有墙壁，那么肯定有屏障与外界隔绝。“这几乎就像一个邪教组织，”SSL 工程师 Lynn Conway 回忆道，她的背景包括 IBM 超级计算机。“我不容易被邪教吸引，它总是让我有点不舒服。泰勒的个性非常强大。在这里，他站在幕后，前面是这些枪手，后面是追星族。”</p><p class="para">Others did not overlook the converse of Taylor’s effort to promote a group sensibility at CSL. If there were no walls within the lab, there were certainly barriers erected against the outside. “It was almost a cult-like thing,” remembered Lynn Conway, an SSL engineer whose background included work on an IBM supercomputer. “I’m not easily attracted to cults and it always made me a little uncomfortable. Taylor’s a very powerful personality. Here he was in the background with these gunslingers out front and the groupies in back.”</p>
<p class="para">泰勒的首席枪手是巴特勒·兰普森。他集敏锐的才智和无与伦比的辩论技巧于一身，将新想法的门槛提高到了令人生畏的高度。与兰普森辩论并非不可能，但他赢得辩论也并不罕见<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch10.html.page150"></a>即使他错了。即使是像艾伦·凯这样经验丰富的 Ideaspace 导航员，当他的奇思妙想遇到兰普森对务实工程的严格要求时，也会被逼到墙角。凯在战斗中溃败，有时不得不撤退并重新集结，再次冲向围栏。“我不记得在同一天与巴特勒争论过，”他后来说。“第二天我可以赢很多。他的思维速度是其他人的两倍。”</p><p class="para">Taylor’s chief gunslinger was Butler Lampson. His combination of a razor-sharp intellect with peerless debating skills raised the bar for new ideas to an intimidating height. It was not impossible to win an argument with Lampson, but it was not at all rare for him to win one <a></a>even when he was wrong. Even as practiced a navigator of Ideaspace as Alan Kay could be backed to the wall when one of his flights of fancy came up against Lampson’s rigorous command of pragmatic engineering. Routed in the battles, Kay sometimes had to retreat and regroup for another run at the fence. “I can’t ever remember winning an argument with Butler on the same day,” he said later. “I could win quite a few on the second day. His mind worked about twice as fast as anyone else’s.”</p>
<p class="para">兰普森非常聪明，是一个天生的旁观者，他精心实现的见解和设计经常记录在黄纸上，成为 PARC 发明中不可或缺的要素，数量多得无人能及。他也可能脾气暴躁，在受到阻挠或反驳时会尖叫和发脾气，令人生畏。有一次，沃伦·泰特曼设法激怒了兰普森，让他向他扔了一个玻璃烟灰缸。“巴特勒倾向于恐吓别人，”直言不讳的泰特曼回忆道。“他让那些思维不如他快或不那么聪明的人很难相处。”</p><p class="para">Lampson was fiercely intellectual, an inveterate kibitzer whose finely realized insights and designs, often recorded on the run on scraps of yellow paper, became indispensable ingredients of more PARC inventions than anyone has bothered to count. He could also be ferociously temperamental, a fearsome screamer and tantrum-thrower when thwarted or contradicted. Once Warren Teitelman managed to goad Lampson into firing a glass ashtray at him. “Butler tended to intimidate people,” recalled the outspoken Teitelman. “He made it very difficult for those who didn’t think quite as fast as he did or weren’t quite as smart.”</p>
<p class="para">泰特曼回忆说，有一次“巴特勒说‘这太荒谬了！’，我只是回答说‘为什么？因为你说这太荒谬了？’然后他就把烟灰缸扔向我。”烟灰缸在他身后的墙上摔得粉碎，但泰特曼明白了其中的教训，“他是实验室里 400 磅重的大猩猩。你必须非常小心。”泰特曼的朋友建议他戴着安全帽参加未来的经销商活动。</p><p class="para">On this occasion “Butler was doing one of these ‘That’s ridiculous!’ things, and I just replied, ‘Why? Because you say it’s ridiculous?’ and he heaved the ashtray at me,” Teitelman recalled. The ashtray shattered harmlessly on the wall behind him, but Teitelman understood the lesson, “He was the 400-pound gorilla in that lab. You had to be real careful.” Teitelman’s friends suggested he attend future Dealers wearing a hard hat.</p>

<p class="para">除了 Dealer 刻意的智力对决之外，PARC 在这一时期是随意合作的典范。这个地方保留了大学校园的氛围，这并不奇怪。毕竟，大多数员工都是刚从研究生院毕业（有些人在 PARC 全职工作的同时仍在攻读高级学位）。未婚或有年轻家庭的他们，社交范围不会超出实验室同事的范围，直到很久以后，这些家庭开始成长并发挥自己的引力。现在，在追求共同愿景的刺激下，他们会整天一起工作到深夜。</p><p class="para">Outside Dealer with its deliberate intellectual gunplay, PARC in this period was a model of casual collegiality. The place retained the ambiance of a college campus, which was unsurprising. Most of the staff, after all, were fresh out of grad school (some were still working toward their advanced degrees while working full-time at PARC). Unmarried or with young families, their social spheres would not extend much beyond their laboratory colleagues until much later, when those families began to grow and exercised their own gravitational pull. For now, driven by the thrill of pursuing a common vision, they would work together all day and late into the night.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch10.html.page151"></a>
<p class="para">为了发泄压力，他们举行了家庭野餐，并组织了一支垒球队参加帕洛阿尔托社区联赛。1972 年初，计算机和系统科学实验室搬迁到 34 号楼后面的宽敞露天庭院里，挂着一张排球网，供每天午餐时间比赛使用。</p><p class="para">To let off steam there were family picnics and a softball team Rick Jones organized to play in a Palo Alto community league. In the spacious open yard behind Building 34, to which the computer and systems science labs relocated in early 1972, was strung a volleyball net for daily lunchtime matches.</p>
<p class="para">对于计算机科学实验室的大家庭来说，鲍勃·泰勒充当着某种社交指导员的角色。周末，在他位于帕洛阿尔托的家中，可能会有触式橄榄球（四分卫：鲍勃·泰勒）或马拉松式的“外交”会议，这是一款棋盘游戏，其框架是谈判、联盟和背叛，满足了主人对阴谋的胃口。“这很有趣，当你在周六或周日整整八到十个小时无事可做的时候，”一位参与者回忆道。</p><p class="para">For the extended family of the Computer Science Lab, Bob Taylor served as a sort of social director. On weekends there might be touch football (quarterback: Bob Taylor) or marathon sessions of “Diplomacy,” a board game whose framework of negotiation, alliance, and betrayal fed the host’s appetite for intrigue, at his Palo Alto house. “That was great fun, when you had nothing to do for a whole eight or ten hours on a Saturday or Sunday,” one participant recalled.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">这是泰勒性格中阳光的一面。当他扮演一家之主的</span>角色时，而不是嘲笑物理学家或用拳头抓住对手的球衣来反驳足球裁判的判罚，人们可以欣赏到他 95% 的时间里都是“一个绝对迷人的人”，正如琼斯回忆的那样，而不用考虑他作为一头粗鲁傲慢的野兽时剩下的 5%。即使是他那被围攻的上司也会嘲笑他的缺点和挑剔的习惯，就像他们在万圣节那天所做的那样，当时 CSL 的一半人都打扮成鲍勃·泰勒，穿着几乎一模一样的格子长裤、蓝色西装外套和白色高领毛衣，然后一起坐在自助餐厅的一张桌子旁，一手拿着烟斗，一手拿着 Dr Peppers。</p><p class="para">This was the sunny side of Taylor’s personality. When he was playing the role <span class="italic">of paterfamilias</span>, as opposed to sneering at the physicists or disputing a football ref’s call with an opponent’s shirt grasped in his fist, one could appreciate the 95 percent of the time he could be “an absolutely charming person,” as Jones recalled, without thinking of the other 5 percent when he was a rude and arrogant beast. Even his beleaguered superiors could laugh at his foibles and persnickety habits, as they did one Halloween when half of CSL came dressed as Bob Taylor, in nearly identical plaid slacks, blue blazers, and white turtleneck sweaters, then sat together at a table in the cafeteria with pipes in one hand and Dr Peppers in the other.</p>
<p class="para">“没有一个新成立的组织没有经历一段蜜月期，人们之间建立了特殊的纽带，”杰弗斯回忆道，他从和平队中认识到了这种现象。“那里是这样的，在 PARC 也是这样的。任何新事物都是这样的。这是一个伟大的时期。每个人都应该在开始时成为其中的一部分。”</p><p class="para">“There isn’t an organization newly begun where you don’t find those honeymoon years where there’s a special bond among people,” reflected Jeffers, who recognized the phenomenon from the Peace Corps. “It was true there, it was true in PARC. It’s true in anything that’s new. It’s a great period. Everyone should be a part of something at the beginning.”</p>
<p class="para">这种专业和个人友谊的氛围是该中心一些早期项目（包括 MAXC）背后的强大因素。他们将非正式合作的过程称为“汤姆索耶式合作”。就像汤姆拿着画笔和粉刷一样，有人会提出他的想法或项目——无论是在正式会议上还是在走廊闲聊中——以动员一些感兴趣的人<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch10.html.page152"></a>同事们一起努力实现这一目标。如果你看到了如何在微代码中实现新操作的曙光，你就会把几个专家程序员聚集在一个房间里，一起研究这个问题，直到房间里的每一块白板上都写满了方框、箭头和像北欧符文一样神秘的符号。如果你有一个大项目需要做很多焊接工作，那么每个知道如何使用焊枪的人都会把枪套在枪套上。</p><p class="para">This atmosphere of professional and personal fellowship was a powerful factor behind some of the center’s earliest projects, including MAXC. They called the process of informal collaboration by the name “Tom Sawyering.” Like Tom with his paintbrush and whitewash, someone would set forth his idea or project—whether it was in a formal meeting or a hallway bull session was unimportant—to mobilize a few intrigued <a></a>colleagues in an attempt to make it happen. If you saw a glimmer of how to implement a new operation in microcode, you would gather a few expert coders in a room and have at the problem until every whiteboard in the place was filled with boxes and arrows and symbols as arcane as Nordic runes. If you had a big project with a lot of soldering to be done, everyone who knew how to wield a soldering gun strapped on his holster.</p>
<p class="para">如果一个想法可行，团队就会在接下来的三到六个月内团结一致完成工作；如果不行，每个人都会像自由电子一样分散开来，寻找新的创意价。萨克认为这个系统是“一种持续的同行评审形式。令人兴奋和具有挑战性的项目获得了比财务和行政支持更重要的东西。他们得到了帮助和参与……结果，高质量的工作蓬勃发展，而不那么有趣的工作则趋于枯萎。”</p><p class="para">If an idea worked, the team stuck together for the next three or six months to complete the job; if not, everyone simply dispersed like free electrons in search of a new creative valence. Thacker viewed this system as “a continuous form of peer review. Projects that were exciting and challenging received something much more important than financial and administrative support. They received help and participation…As a result, quality work flourished, less interesting work tended to wither.”</p>
<p class="para">本着这种精神，系统科学实验室的工程师为计算机科学实验室硬件编写了代码，CSL 的设计师帮助 SSL 构建了原型，而普通科学实验室的物理学家则对材料特性和电气行为提出了宝贵的见解（例如，戴夫·比格尔森 (Dave Biegelsen) 告诉斯塔克韦瑟如何使用声波来调制光束，并将他的随口建议融入世界上第一台激光打印机中）。</p><p class="para">In this spirit Systems Science Lab engineers wrote code for Computer Science Lab hardware, CSL designers helped SSL build prototypes, and the General Science Lab’s physicists chipped in with valuable insights into material properties and electrical behavior (as when Dave Biegelsen told Starkweather how to use sound waves to modulate a light beam and got his offhand suggestion incorporated into the world’s first laser printer).</p>
<p class="para">有一次，汤姆·索耶甚至发起了一个大胆的课外项目。这就是所谓的“Bose 阴谋”，它诞生于里克·琼斯家的一场扑克游戏中。琼斯、凯、萨克、迪克·舒普、查克·格什克和其他几个人讨论了立体声扬声器的优点。凯是最先进的 Bose 901 的忠实粉丝，它配有自己的电子均衡器，一套售价 1,100 美元（以 20 世纪 70 年代初石油危机前的美元计算）。他也是小组中唯一拥有一对 Bose 扬声器的人，他用 PARC 的预算购买了这对扬声器，作为他小组正在开发的实时音乐合成器的一部分。</p><p class="para">At one point Tom Sawyering even begot an audacious extracurricular project. This was the so-called “Bose Conspiracy,” which was hatched at a poker game at Rick Jones’s house. Jones, Kay, Thacker, Dick Shoup, Chuck Geschke, and a couple of others had fallen into a discussion of the merits of stereo speakers. Kay was a particular fan of the state-of-the-art Bose 901s, which came with their own electronic equalizer and cost $1,100 the set (in the pre-oil shock dollars of the early 1970s). He was also the only one in the group who owned a pair, having acquired them on his PARC budget as part of a real-time music synthesizer his group was developing.</p>
<p class="para">“你知道吗，”有人说道，背景中传来卡片翻动的声音，“我们没有理由不能让电子设备发挥同样的作用。而且花费更少。”</p><p class="para">“You know,” someone said as cards riffled in the background, “there’s no reason why we couldn’t make the electronics work just as well. And for a lot less money, too.”</p>
<p class="para">该组织占用了 34 号楼的一个地下室，拆毁了<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch10.html.page153"></a>Kay 的扬声器，并煞费苦心地分析了设计。他们从为 Bose 供应扬声器的肯塔基工厂购买了锥形扬声器，在 Jones 的车库里，他们用发出尖锐声响的金刚石齿径向锯从高密度刨花板上切割和塑造了隔音板。（马拉松式的组装让 Kay 身上覆满了一英寸厚的锯末，而 Jones 则患上了终生耳鸣。）然后，他们分配了组装任务——一个合谋者负责焊接，另一个安装扬声器锥体，等等——就像他们在 MAXC 上分配任务一样，而 MAXC 恰好在几扇门之外的空调房里心满意足地运转着。总共，他们制造了 40 多对，每对售价 125 美元。他们的 PARC 同事中的买家可以通过选择格栅布来定制设备，但除此之外，他们很难区分仿冒品和真品。没有人能做到。</p><p class="para">Appropriating a basement room in Building 34, the group took apart <a></a>Kay’s speakers and painstakingly analyzed the design. They bought cone speakers from the same Kentucky factory that supplied them to Bose, and on a shrieking diamond-toothed radial saw in Jones’s garage they cut and shaped the sound baffles out of high-density particle board. (The marathon session left Kay covered with an inch-thick coating of sawdust and Jones with a lifelong case of tinnitus.) Then they apportioned the assembly tasks—one conspirator handled the soldering, another installed the speaker cones, and so on—the same way they had distributed the tasks on MAXC, which happened to be running contentedly in its own air-conditioned room a few doors away. All told, they manufactured more than forty pairs at $125 each. The buyers among their PARC colleagues could customize the units with their choice of grille cloth but were otherwise challenged to tell the knockoffs apart from the real thing. No one could.</p>
<p class="para">“这是 PARC 的典型做法，”凯回忆道。“如果你不知道某件事是怎么做的，你就自己想办法。”</p><p class="para">“It was so typical of PARC,” Kay recalled. “If you didn’t know how something was done, you just rolled your own.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">很快，计算机科学界开始意识到帕洛阿尔托山坡上正在酝酿着一些非凡的事物，这在一定程度上要归功于研究人员们渴望向来自斯坦福、伯克利或卡内基梅隆的朋友展示演示。员工名册上的名字更是锦上添花。将兰普森、凯和德意志聚集在一个屋檐下，足以让 PARC 成为代名词；但该中心还雇用了十几位名声同样响亮的人。凯喜欢宣称，在美国最优秀的 100 名计算机科学家中，有 56 人在 PARC 工作。</p><p class="para">The realization that something extraordinary was germinating on a Palo Alto hillside soon started permeating the world of computer science, thanks in part to the researchers’ eagerness to give demos to friends visiting from Stanford, Berkeley, or Carnegie-Mellon. The names on the employee roster added further luster. Gathering Lampson, Kay, and Deutsch under one roof would have been enough on its own to make PARC a byword; but the center employed a dozen others with reputations nearly as luminous. Kay was fond of proclaiming that of the top hundred computer scientists in the country, fifty-six worked at PARC.</p>
<p class="para">有时人们会引用他的话说五十八或七十八。凯的公式有上百种不同的版本，但从数学意义上来说，没有一种是正确的（PARC 从未雇用过多达七十八名计算机科学家）。但从比喻上讲，所有版本都是准确的。PARC 已成为该国最优秀计算机科学家的首要吸引力，就像七岁儿童的迪士尼乐园一样。在这种情况下，很容易想象，该国几乎所有有才华的年轻科学家或工程师都已经进入了这里。</p><p class="para">Or sometimes he was quoted saying fifty-eight, or seventy-eight. Kay’s formulation has appeared in a hundred different versions, none of which is correct in a mathematical sense (PARC never employed as many as seventy-eight computer scientists). But all are accurate metaphorically PARC had become the premier draw for the country’s best computer scientists, like Disneyland for seven-year-olds. Under the circumstances it was easy to imagine that almost every talented young scientist or engineer in the land was already inside.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch10.html.page154"></a>
<p class="para">“人们指责我们垄断了该领域，”杰克·戈德曼回忆道。一天，在一次正式午餐会上，他被麻省理工学院校长杰罗姆·威斯纳堵住了嘴。“威斯纳指责我破坏了大学教授计算机的能力，因为我们抢走了所有优秀人才。”</p><p class="para">“People were accusing us of monopolizing the field,” recalled Jack Goldman. One day at a formal luncheon he was cornered by Jerome Wiesner, the president of MIT. “Wiesner accused me of destroying the ability of universities to teach computing because we were grabbing all the good people.”</p>
<p class="para">尽管戈德曼对这一投诉感到高兴，但他也意识到 PARC 成功的关键不在于研究人员的数量，而是他们非凡的天赋。他发现很难不去打扰这个被宠坏的孩子。晚上，他乘坐公司的飞机抵达帕洛阿尔托，有时妻子也随行（“我唯一不同意她随行的原因是，这会妨碍我和朋友们打扑克”），然后直接开车去实验室，感受那里的氛围。</p><p class="para">Delighted as he was by the complaint, Goldman recognized that the key to PARC’s success was not the head count of researchers but their exceptional gifts. He found it hard to keep away from his pampered child. Arriving in Palo Alto in the evening on a company plane, sometimes with his wife along (“My only inhibition to her coming along was it stifled my ability to play poker with the guys”), he would drive directly to the lab to drink in the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="para">“即使已经是晚上九点或十点，灯也会亮起来，周围也会围上几十个人，”他回忆道。“他们经常玩电脑游戏。现在，请记住，那时候的电脑游戏和今天不一样。这是新鲜事物。这些人实际上是在发明电脑游戏，并学习如何使用机器。”</p><p class="para">“The lights would all be lit and dozens of people around, even it if was nine or ten at night,” he recalled. “Often they were playing computer games. Now, just remember, in those days computer games were not what they are today. This was a new thing. These guys were literally inventing computer games and learning how to use the machine.”</p>
<p class="para">然而，高盛在 PARC 看到的这种愉快的孤立和游戏性也有缺点。首先，该中心的态度问题越来越严重。施乐总部沮丧地发现了这一点，因为这种态度被刊登在一本相当令人反感的杂志上。</p><p class="para">Yet there was a downside to the cheery insularity and game-playing that Goldman so enjoyed witnessing at PARC. For one thing, the center’s attitude problem was growing worse. Xerox headquarters discovered this to its dismay the day that attitude got laid out for public view in the pages of a rather unsavory magazine.</p>

<p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">1972 年 12 月初的一天</span></span>，里克·琼斯和格洛丽亚·华纳驱车前往旧金山机场，接乔治·帕克从纽约起飞的飞机。通常他们不会这样做。帕克每次从施乐总部回来，华纳都会派一辆车来接他。这次她取消了这项安排。帕克一看到他的两个助手在登机口等着，心里就有一种不祥的预感。</p><p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">O</span></span>ne day early in December 1972, Rick Jones and Gloria Warner drove to the San Francisco airport to meet George Pake’s plane from New York. Normally they would not have made the effort. The established routine whenever Pake returned from a visit to Xerox headquarters was for Warner to send a car for him. This time she canceled the arrangement. The moment Pake saw his two assistants waiting at the gate, he got a bad feeling.</p>
<p class="para">“发生什么事了？”他问。</p><p class="para">“What’s the matter?” he asked.</p>
<p class="para">“乔治，你最好看看这个，”琼斯说。他递给他一本小报大小的双周刊，这是他今天早上在斯坦福校园对面的报摊买的。帕克看了一眼封面和上面不熟悉的横幅：《<span class="italic">滚石》</span>。</p><p class="para">“George, you better have a look at this,” Jones said. He handed over a tabloid-sized biweekly magazine he had bought that morning at a newsstand across from the Stanford campus. Pake’s glance took in the cover and its unfamiliar banner: <span class="italic">Rolling Stone</span>.</p>
<p class="para">“这是什么？”帕克问道。</p><p class="para">“What is this?” Pake asked.</p>
<p class="para">“从第五十页开始。”琼斯回答道。</p><p class="para">“Start on page fifty,” Jones replied.</p>
<p class="para">帕克翻开杂志，看到了一篇专题文章，题为《太空战争：计算机迷的狂热生活和象征性死亡》。文章语言随意粗俗，对计算机科学的态度个人主义、反企业，其中主要人物<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch11.html.page156"></a>是施乐帕洛阿尔托研究中心那些不太上镜的科学家，他们穿着凉鞋和 T 恤闲逛。封面上的日期是 12 月 7 日。如果 Pake 碰巧注意到那天是珍珠港事件纪念日，他会认为这非常恰当。</p><p class="para">Pake opened the magazine to a feature article entitled “Spacewar: Fanatic Life and Symbolic Death among the Computer Bums.” Its language was loose and profane, its attitude toward computer science individualistic and anti-corporate, and among its leading characters <a></a>were the not particularly presentable scientists of Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, shown lounging about in their sandals and T-shirts. The date on the cover was December the seventh. If Pake happened to notice it was Pearl Harbor Day he would have thought it grimly appropriate.</p>
<p class="para">“当我们从机场开车回来时，”琼斯回忆道，“我听到的只是乔治坐在后座上，翻阅着这篇文章，然后说，‘哦，不……哦，不……哦，<span class="italic">不！</span> ’”</p><p class="para">“As we were driving back from the airport,” Jones remembered, “all I could hear was George sitting in the back seat, leafing through the article and going, ‘Oh, no…Oh, no…Oh, <span class="italic">no!</span>’”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">在接下来的几周里，这篇让施乐和 PARC 感到如此痛苦的文章，在某种意义上是由施乐的资金支持的。当时， <span class="italic">《滚石》</span>杂志已经创刊五周年。它的创始人是伯克利辍学生詹恩·温纳，他以极少的资金创办了这本杂志，最近得到了一位主流人士的支持：马克斯·帕列夫斯基，他于当年 5 月离开了施乐董事会。帕列夫斯基一直在寻找进入反主流文化生活的更时髦环境的机会，他将自己从 SDS 出售中获得的部分收益交给温纳支配，并自封为《<span class="italic">滚石》</span>杂志董事会主席。</p><p class="para">The piece that was to cause Xerox and PARC so much distress over the following few weeks had in a sense been underwritten by Xerox money. <span class="italic">Rolling Stone</span> was then five years old. Its founder, a Berkeley dropout named Jann Wenner who had started the magazine on a shoestring, had recently turned up backing from a decidedly mainstream source: Max Palevsky, who had left the Xerox board that May. Always in search of entrée to the snazzier milieus of countercultural life, Palevsky had placed some of his gains from the sale of SDS at Wenner’s disposal and taken for himself the title of <span class="italic">Rolling Stone’s</span> chairman of the board.</p>
<p class="para">此时，<span class="italic">《滚石》</span>已不再只是摇滚新闻界的一支新声音，而是成熟起来，成为报道各种问题的另类而又尖锐的媒体，包括总统政治和经济政策。但它的受众基本上仍是大学年龄的人群，他们喜欢亨德里克斯、乔普林和感恩而死乐队的音乐，也喜欢亨特·汤普森的作品。</p><p class="para">By this time, <span class="italic">Rolling Stone</span> had matured well beyond its origins as a fresh voice in rock journalism and had turned into a purveyor of offbeat but incisive reporting on a wide range of issues, including presidential politics and economic policy. But its audience was still essentially a college age crowd, as tuned in to the music of Hendrix, Joplin, and the Grateful Dead as to the writing of Hunter S. Thompson.</p>
<p class="para">那天早上，格洛丽亚·沃纳 (Gloria Warner) 敲门来告诉里克·琼斯 (Rick Jones)，一位朋友刚刚从旧金山打电话告诉她 PARC 已经被注销，在此之前，里克·琼斯从未听说过这个消息。</p><p class="para">Rick Jones had never heard of it before that morning, when Gloria Warner knocked on his door to report that a friend had just called her from San Francisco to say PARC had been written up.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">他问道：“ 《滚石》</span>到底是什么？”</p><p class="para">“What the hell is <span class="italic">Rolling Stone</span>?” he asked.</p>
<p class="para">“这是一些毒品杂志，”她报道说。</p><p class="para">“It’s some druggie magazine,” she reported.</p>
<p class="para">琼斯咽了口唾沫。“我们最好去看看。”</p><p class="para">Jones swallowed hard. “We’d better get a look at it.”</p>
<p class="para">他们一起开车去了校外的报摊，在那里他们发现这本杂志摆在显眼的位置。在他们读完《太空战争》之前，他们就知道他们面临一场重大危机。</p><p class="para">Together they drove to an off-campus newsstand where they found the magazine prominently displayed. Before they had read to the end of “Spacewar” they knew they had a major crisis on their hands.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch11.html.page157"></a>
<p class="para">在鲍勃·泰勒 (Bob Taylor) 的许可下，但 PARC 管理层的其他人却对此一无所知，作家斯图尔特·布兰德 (Stewart Brand) 数周来一直在计算机科学实验室随意走动。布兰德是一名技术爱好者，他最近出售了《<span class="italic">全球概览》(Whole Earth Catalog)</span>，这本广受欢迎的另类指南让他有钱有时间亲自参观旧金山湾区领先的计算机研究设施。（几年后，他以开创性的在线计算机服务 The Well 的创始人身份重新出现。）他后来说，一开始，道格·恩格尔巴特 (Doug Engelbart) 实验室的一些老朋友让他与 PARC 的比尔·英格利什 (Bill English) 取得了联系。但他回忆说，实际上是泰勒安排他走进实验室，经过唯一的接待员，而那位接待员当时是 PARC 的全部安保人员。</p><p class="para">With Bob Taylor’s apparent permission, but to the complete ignorance of anyone else in PARC management, the writer Stewart Brand had apparently been ranging freely through the Computer Science Lab for weeks. Brand was a technology fancier whose recent sale of the <span class="italic">Whole Earth Catalog</span>, his popular offbeat guidebook, had left him with the money and time to conduct a personal grand tour of the Bay Area’s leading computer research facilities. (A few years later he would resurface as a founder of The Well, a pioneering on-line computer service.) At the outset, he said later, some old friends at Doug Engelbart’s lab put him in touch with Bill English at PARC. But it was Taylor, he recalled, who actually arranged for him to walk into the lab past the lone receptionist who counted, for the moment, as PARC’s entire security force.</p>
<p class="para">《太空战争》是布兰德的旅行报告。文章从戏剧性的开场开始，即 1962 年麻省理工学院发明的同名互动式太空飞船和鱼雷电脑游戏玩家之间的一场假想战斗，抓住了计算机文化核心的青春期骚动。《太空战争》呼应了黑客最爱 EE“Doc”史密斯的宇宙侠的幻影基调（“能量光束、棒子和长矛燃烧着……”），将其主角描绘成英俊的年轻人，与邪恶的国家展开激烈的战斗。</p><p class="para">“Spacewar” was Brand’s travel report. From its dramatic opening scene, an imaginary battle among players of the eponymous interactive spaceship-and-torpedo computer game invented at MIT in 1962, the article captured the adolescent ferment at the heart of the computer culture. Echoing the phantasmagoric tone of hacker favorite E. E. “Doc” Smith’s cosmic swashbucklers (“Beams, rods, and lances of energy flamed and flared…”), “Spacewar” painted its subjects as dashing young figures engaged in dynamic battle with a sinister state.</p>
<p class="para">在这些英雄中，艾伦·凯尤为引人注目。布兰德将他介绍为黑客界的杰出人物，并给出了自己对“标准计算机迷”的定义：“他就像你想象中的狂热车手一样直率。就是那种狂热。真正的黑客不是群居动物。他喜欢熬夜，他和机器的关系是爱恨交织的……他们是一群聪明的孩子，但对传统目标不太感兴趣。”凯对计算机科学家职业道德的评价再合适不过了，这激怒了斯坦福高管。“如果你有任何一点能力，人们就愿意付钱给你，”他观察到，“而且你有足够的时间胡闹。”</p><p class="para">Conspicuous among those heroes was Alan Kay, who Brand introduced as something of a hacker eminence offering his own definition of “the standard Computer Bum”: “He’s someone about as straight as you’d expect hot-rodders to look. It’s that kind of fanaticism. A true hacker is not a group person. He’s a person who loves to stay up all night, he and the machine in a love-hate relationship…They’re kids who tended to be brilliant but not very interested in conventional goals.” Kay’s assessment of the computer scientist’s professional mores could not have been better designed to raise hackles in the Stamford executive suite. “People are willing to pay you if you’re any good at all,” he observed, “and you have plenty of time for screwing around.”</p>
<p class="para">他的话里有很多东西，也有很多他自己的东西。他所唤起的黑客是那种更容易在<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch11.html.page158"></a>他一生中大部分时间都待在大学校园里，而不是传统的公司总部，而公司总部在《太空大战》中根本没有出现，只是作为敌人的巢穴。</p><p class="para">There was much in what he said, and much of himself. The hackers he evoked were the kind of independent souls more easily found on <a></a>the university campuses where he had spent much of his life than in traditional corporate headquarters, which did not figure in “Spacewar” except as the enemy lair.</p>
<p class="para">凯独特的技术浪漫主义为布兰德的整部作品增添了色彩。他真挚地认为计算机是一种可以同时简化和丰富人类生活的工具，这一点在他轻松将黑客奉为游戏王的过程中得到了明确体现。</p><p class="para">Kay’s idiosyncratic techno-romanticism colored Brand’s entire piece. His heartfelt view of the computer as a tool for at once simplifying and enriching human life came through unambiguously in his breezy apotheosis of the hacker as gamester-king.</p>
<p class="para">然而，就 PARC 的内部和外部政治而言，泰勒在文章中的描述必定会引起更大的反响。他和他那群快乐的前 ARPA 战士给人的感觉就像他们拥有这个地方，或者至少好像 PARC 除了他们的工作之外什么都没有。他们说话的语气就好像他们赢得了计算机未来的战斗，并且已经在书写它的历史。</p><p class="para">In terms of PARC’s internal and external politics, however, Taylor’s depiction in the article was bound to reverberate even more. He and his happy band of ex-ARPA warriors came across as if they owned the place, or at least as though there was nothing much more to PARC than their work. They talked as if they had won the battle for the computer’s future and were already writing its history.</p>
<p class="para">布兰德将 PARC 的科学家描述为弹珠游戏中的 Aggies，将泰勒描述为该中心的“首席弹珠收集者”（目前看来，这个说法还算准确）。当被问及他的职位时，泰勒很谨慎：“这个职位没有明确的定义。你可以称我为研究规划师。”</p><p class="para">Brand described PARC’s scientists as aggies in a game of marbles and Taylor as the center’s “chief marble collector” (which was accurate enough, for the moment). Asked about his job title, Taylor got cagey: “It’s not very sharply defined. You could call me a research planner.”</p>
<p class="para">但他没有必要说得更具体。当布兰德将实验室的“总体研究倾向”描述为“柔和，远离庞大和中心，注重小而个人，致力于将最大的计算机能力交到每个想要的人手中”时，毫无疑问他所阐述的哲学是谁的。至于正式任命的 CSL 主任杰里·埃尔金德在《太空大战》中没有被提及一次，这是他权力脆弱的不祥象征。</p><p class="para">But there was no need for him to be more specific. When Brand described the lab’s “general bent of research” as “soft, away from hugeness and centrality, toward the small and the personal, toward putting maximum computer power in the hands of every individual who wants it,” there was no mistaking whose philosophy was being articulated. As for the duly appointed director of CSL, Jerry Elkind merited not a single mention in “Spacewar,” an ominous token of his tenuous authority.</p>
<p class="para">“太空大战”让 PARC 的计算机科学家们欣喜若狂，尤其是刚从研究生院毕业的年轻一代。他们为什么不高兴呢？他们欢迎布兰德，在他的笔记本中写下他们的雄心壮志，并温顺地坐在《<span class="italic">滚石》杂志的</span>迷人摄影师安妮·莱博维茨面前，后者正在休假，不再拍摄电影和摇滚明星，而是把未来的建筑师拍成电影。</p><p class="para">“Spacewar” delighted PARC’s computer scientists, particularly the younger set fresh out of graduate school. And why not? They had welcomed Brand, fed his notebook with their ambitions, and sat docilely for <span class="italic">Rolling Stone’s</span> glamorous photographer Annie Leibovitz, who was taking a sort of sabbatical from her usual fare of movie and rock stars to get the architects of the future down on film.</p>
<p class="para">但他们的态度让公司感到很不愉快。施乐庞大的官僚机构服务的客户群正是庞大、集中和冷漠的定义。它制造大型机器，其产量以数百万页为单位。斯坦福的规划人员<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch11.html.page159"></a>他们不会考虑将计算能力交到个人手中，就如同他们不会考虑在每个秘书的桌子上安装一台复印机一样。</p><p class="para">But their attitude came as a disagreeable shock to the company. Xerox’s enormous bureaucracy served a customer base that was the very definition of huge, centralized, and impersonal. It manufactured big machines whose output got measured by the millions of pages. Stamford’s planners <a></a>no more anticipated placing computing power in individual hands than they would think of installing a copier at every secretary’s desk.</p>
<p class="para">如果 PARC 的计算机科学家们打算向那些支付他们薪水的人发起挑战，他们几乎不可能选择更具有挑衅性的方式。施乐公司曾经是一家小公司，斗志旺盛，敢于冒险，但多年的垄断已经将这种激情从权力走廊中驱赶出去。到 1972 年，取而代之的是专业财务和销售管理的冷静心态。没有意外的余地，特别是在涉及公司形象时。总部雇用了一批专业形象打磨者来保护公司免受这种伏击。规则很明确：任何员工，从首席执行官到最低级的收发室职员，在没有公关人员陪同的情况下都不能与媒体交谈。通讯部门无情地监控着所有的新闻报道，对那些在高管头衔上犯错的报纸或杂志发出严厉的纠正。</p><p class="para">If the computer scientists of PARC had intended to throw down a challenge to those who paid their salaries, they could scarcely have chosen a more provocative way to do so. Xerox had once been a small, scrappy, risk-taking company, but the long years of monopoly had driven that sort of passion clear out of the corridors of power. What had replaced it by 1972 was the sober mentality of professional finance and sales management. There was no room for the unexpected, especially where the corporate image was concerned. Headquarters employed platoons of professional image-polishers to protect the corporation against exactly this sort of ambush. The rules were explicit: No employee, from the chief executive down to the lowliest mailroom clerk, could talk to the press without a PR minder in tow. The communications department ruthlessly monitored all press coverage, issuing stern correctives to newspapers or magazines that erred on so much as an executive title.</p>
<p class="para">然而，这家耗资数百万美元的新研究中心却在一本破旧的摇滚音乐杂志上无人监管地向公众开放，照片中真实的施乐科学家身穿 T 恤和牛仔裤，赤脚，悠闲地躺在豆袋椅上。鉴于当时的时代背景和<span class="italic">《滚石》杂志</span>一贯的报道，公司高管只能从他们在斯坦福的孤立地位得出结论，PARC 正在失控，无耻地将研究机构的预算浪费在青少年的技术幻想之旅上，而不是扎实、有市场价值的科学追求上。多年后，帕克（不准确的）回忆表明了这一点，《<span class="italic">滚石》</span>杂志的文章“直截了当地说，这些人中很多人都是出色的瘾君子。这不是公司想要的那种宣传。”</p><p class="para">Yet here was its new multi-million-dollar research center spread out for unsupervised public view in a ratty rock music magazine, with actual Xerox scientists photographed in their T-shirts and jeans, barefooted, lounging self-indulgently in beanbag chairs. In the light of the times and in the context of <span class="italic">Rolling Stone’s</span> usual fare, corporate executives could only conclude from their insular perch in Stamford that PARC was reeling out of control, shamelessly squandering the research facility’s budget on adolescent techno-fantasy trips rather than solid, marketable scientific pursuits. This was symbolized by Pake’s (inaccurate) recollection years later that the <span class="italic">Rolling Stone</span> article “flat out stat[ed] that a lot of these guys were brilliant druggies. [That] wasn’t the kind of publicity the corporation wanted.”</p>
<p class="para">事实上，这篇文章既没有提到，也没有暗示过 PARC 吸毒的情况。布兰德不是肯·克西 (Ken Kesey)，他记录了一群吸毒成瘾的派对狂欢者的冒险经历，而是一位自封的社会理论家，在那个时代的政治背景下解释新技术。然而，对于居住在 PARC 的那些冷漠的传统主义者来说<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch11.html.page160"></a>施乐总部“太空大战”的文字和图片不可避免地唤起了人们对道德的松懈和加州嬉皮士的联想。</p><p class="para">In fact, the article neither stated nor even remotely implied anything about drug use at PARC. Brand was no Ken Kesey chronicling the escapades of a merry band of stoned-out party guys but a self-styled social theorist interpreting the new technologies against the era’s political backdrop. Nevertheless, for the stolid traditionalists who inhabited <a></a>Xerox headquarters “Spacewar’s” text and pictures inescapably evoked lax morals and California hippiedom.</p>
<p class="para">帕克对“太空大战”感到苦恼，因为他比研究中心的几乎任何人都更清楚 PARC 在总部的地位岌岌可危。约翰·巴丁拯救 PARC 中心还不到一年。PARC 尚未推出具有无可争议价值的产品；也没有获得贝尔实验室那样的声誉，无法抵御进一步的攻击。（<span class="italic">滚石杂志</span>上一篇文章的恶名远播也难以填补这一空白。）但至少他与最严重的冲击波隔绝了距离。杰克·戈德曼就不一样了，他被困在东海岸，以度过这场风暴。管理层的每个角落都潜伏着责备的声音：你们为了<span class="italic">这些</span>懒汉们索要 20% 的工资差额？更糟糕的是，他被指责为严重违反安全规定。</p><p class="para">Pake was anguished about “Spacewar” because more than almost anyone else at the research center, he was intensely aware of PARC’s shaky standing at headquarters. It had been scarcely a year since John Bardeen had saved the center from extinction. PARC had yet to turn out a product of indisputable value; nor had it garnered the Bell Labs-like renown that would have been proof against further attack. (The notoriety of an article in <span class="italic">Rolling Stone</span> would hardly fill that void.) But at least he was insulated by distance from the worst of the shock waves. The same could not be said about Jack Goldman, who was stuck on the East Coast to weather the storm. Murmurs of reproach lurked around every corner on the executive floor: For <span class="italic">these</span> slobs you cadged a 20 percent pay differential? More ominously, he was getting blamed for a serious breach of security.</p>
<p class="para">起初，戈德曼试图转移批评，他辩称，总的来说，PARC 的形象是正面的，尽管《<span class="italic">滚石》</span>对斯坦福的愤慨官员来说很陌生，但对 PARC 招募最佳人才的人群来说，它具有不可否认的吸引力。“这可能表明了 PARC 盛行的文化，他们将《<span class="italic">滚石》</span>视为他们社区的合适载体，”他后来说。“是他们的同龄人会读到那里发生的事情。”但他承认，这一论点不出所料地未能说服“那些白鞋法律人士，他们把《<span class="italic">滚石》</span>视为可鄙的东西。”“太空大战”一半以上的内容涉及旧金山湾区实验室，而不是 PARC（事实上，《太空大战》游戏很少在 PARC 上玩），这一点毫无意义。这篇文章将永远被人们铭记，因为它以一种完全不体面的眼光向世界介绍了 PARC。</p><p class="para">At first Goldman tried to deflect the criticism by arguing that on balance the portrait of PARC was a positive one and that <span class="italic">Rolling Stone</span>, alien as it was to the indignant mandarins of Stamford, had an undeniable appeal to the population from which PARC drew its best recruits. “It’s probably indicative of the culture that was prevalent at PARC that they looked up to <span class="italic">Rolling Stone</span> as a proper vehicle for their community,” he said later. “It was their peer group who would read about what’s going on there.” But this argument, he acknowledged, unsurprisingly failed to sway “the white-shoe legal types, who looked at <span class="italic">Rolling Stone</span> as something to be disdained.” There was no use arguing that more than half of “Spacewar” dealt with Bay Area labs other than PARC (where “Spacewar” the game was in fact seldom played). The piece would be forever remembered as the one that introduced PARC to the world in an entirely undignified light.</p>
<p class="para">最后，戈德曼别无选择，只好出面遏制 PARC 的自由精神。在公司律师的陪同下，他飞到 PARC 去向他宠爱的研究人员发出警告，特别关注那些愚蠢到允许他们直接引用自己研究成果的人，比如泰勒和凯。</p><p class="para">In the end Goldman had no choice but to make a show of reining in PARC’s free spirits. Accompanied by a corporate lawyer, he flew out to read the riot act to his pet researchers, paying special attention to those unwise enough to have allowed themselves to be directly quoted, Taylor and Kay.</p>
<p class="para">“我记得杰克·戈德曼当时几乎有些伤心，”大卫回忆道<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch11.html.page161"></a>索恩伯格说：“我们在这里工作，环境非常自由，但不知怎的，我们感觉信任被违背了。我们很清楚，这是<span class="italic">不对</span>的。如果再次发生，实验室<span class="italic">将</span>被关闭。”</p><p class="para">“I recall almost a sadness on Jack Goldman’s part,” recalled David <a></a>Thornburg. “Here we were operating in a very free environment, and somehow there was a sense that a trust had been violated. It was made crystal clear to us that this was <span class="italic">not</span> all right. If it happened again, the lab <span class="italic">was</span> going to be shut down.”</p>
<p class="para">几周之内，后果就变得具体起来。自建院以来，尤其是在计算机科学领域，一直盛行的“囚犯管理精神病院”的民主制度被终结了。所有员工都获得了身份识别徽章，并被要求随时展示它们。大楼入口处设有安保站，访客会被拦下并被交给一份保密承诺书，要求他们签署。（奇怪的是，这份承诺书证明访客不会将自己的任何想法“带入” <span class="italic">PARC ，这与禁止访客将专有信息带</span><span class="italic">出</span>实验室的常规协议不同。无论如何，目标是保护施乐公司免受 PARC 盗用他人创意的指控，截至撰写本文时，该承诺书仍在使用中。）</p><p class="para">Within weeks the consequences became concrete. The inmates-running-the-asylum democracy that had prevailed since the founding, particularly on the computer science side, was ended. All employees were issued identification badges and instructed to keep them displayed at all times. The building entrances were outfitted with security stations, where visitors were stopped and handed a nondisclosure pledge to sign. (Quirkily enough, the pledge attested that the visitor would not “import” any of his or her ideas <span class="italic">into</span> PARC, a departure from customary agreements, which bar visitors from carrying proprietary information <span class="italic">out</span> of the lab. In any case, the goal was to protect Xerox from a claim that PARC had misappropriated someone else’s ideas, and it was still in use as of this writing.)</p>
<p class="para">施乐公司还严厉限制了 PARC 与媒体（尤其是大众媒体）的接触。尽管允许继续在同行评议的技术期刊上发表文章，但公司审查人员对文章进行了严格审查，因为他们意识到 PARC 可能存在值得保护的进展。</p><p class="para">Xerox also clamped down hard on PARC’s contacts with the media, especially the popular press. Although publication in peer-reviewed technical journals was allowed to continue, the articles were closely vetted by corporate examiners newly aware that there might be developments at PARC worth safeguarding.</p>
<p class="para">一些人试图轻视这种新安排。徽章被放大成 T 恤印花，这样佩戴起来会更时髦。一名员工将徽章变成了皮带扣。如果保安和接待员注意到其他人的身份证照片被巧妙地粘贴上了米老鼠的头像或从一美元钞票上剪下来的乔治·华盛顿的头像，他们绝不会这么说。</p><p class="para">A few people tried to make light of the new arrangements. Badges got blown up into T-shirt imprints, so they could be more fashionably worn. One employee turned his into a belt buckle. If the guards and receptionists noted that the ID photographs on others had been artfully pasted over with the heads of Mickey Mouse or the face of George Washington cut from a dollar bill, they never said so.</p>
<p class="para">但 CSL 和 SSL 的气氛却发生了微妙而永久的变化。从某种意义上说，《<span class="italic">滚石》</span>杂志的风波催化了一个无论如何都会发生的进程。随着 MAXC 的结束以及计算机实验室人数接近临界点，是时候认识到他们的工作太有创新性、太重要了，不能再成为无忧无虑的八卦话题。是时候让他们抛弃神童的幼稚了。他们正在从事更伟大的探索。</p><p class="para">But the atmosphere at CSL and SSL subtly and permanently changed. In a sense the <span class="italic">Rolling Stone</span> flap catalyzed a process that was bound to take place anyway. With MAXC behind them and the computer labs’ head counts approaching critical mass, it was time to recognize that their work was too innovative and important to be any longer the grist of carefree gossip. It was time for them to abandon the childishness of prodigies. They were engaged in a greater quest.</p>
<p class="para">但与此同时，“太空大战”也承载着<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch11.html.page162"></a>PARC 的神秘感比以往任何时候都要超出其范围。在它出版之前，该中心的名声仅限于一个孤立的计算机专业人士圈子。后来，艾伦·凯 (Alan Kay) 与斯图尔特·布兰德 (Stewart Brand) 时髦而敏感的读者分享了他对同事的评价：“这真是一个可怕的群体，就天赋和创造力而言，这是迄今为止我所知道的最好的群体。这里的人都习惯用双手处理闪电。”</p><p class="para">At the same time, however, “Spacewar” carried the seed of the <a></a>PARC mystique farther beyond its boundaries than ever before. Before its publication the center’s fame extended only to the limits of an insular circle of computer pros. Then came Alan Kay, sharing with Stewart Brand’s hip and impressionable readers his assessment of his colleagues as “really a frightening group, by far the best I know of as far as talent and creativity. The people here all are used to dealing lightning with both hands.”</p>
<p class="para">1972 年秋天，凯伊对布兰德说出这些话时，可谓大胆之极。但几个月后，PARC 推出了最新的机器，这些话听起来却像是轻描淡写。</p><p class="para">These were bold words when Kay uttered them to Brand in the fall of 1972. Once PARC unveiled its newest machine a few short months later, they would sound like an understatement.</p>

<p class="para">“艾伦，”他们说，“你有钱吗？”</p><p class="para">“Alan,” they said, “do you have any money?”</p>
<p class="para">“当然可以，”他回答道。“我的预算大约有 23 万美元。为什么？”</p><p class="para">“Sure,” he replied. “I’ve got about $230,000 in my budget. Why?”</p>
<p class="para">“你希望我们如何使用它来制造你的小机器？”</p><p class="para">“How would you like us to use it to build your little machine?”</p>
<p class="para">“我很乐意，”凯回答道。“但有什么好着急的？”</p><p class="para">“I’d like it fine,” Kay replied. “But what’s the hurry?”</p>
<p class="para">“好吧，我们无论如何都会这么做的，”兰普森回答道。“但查克刚刚打赌说他可以在三个月内设计出一整台机器。”</p><p class="para">“Well, we were going to do it anyway,” Lampson replied. “But Chuck’s just made a bet that he can design a whole machine in just three months.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">对于凯来说，走廊尽头两位同事的出现标志着漫长而艰难的夏天的结束。</p><p class="para">For Kay, the appearance of his two colleagues from down the hall marked the end of a long, difficult summer.</p>
<p class="para">今年的开局充满乐观。凯伊觉得他可能终于可以把他的一些伟大想法变成现实了。他将 Dynabook 概念重新设计成一种他称之为“miniCom”的东西，即键盘、屏幕和处理器，它们被捆绑在一个手提箱大小的便携式包装中。与此同时，他召集的软件高手们作为 PARC 的学习研究<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch12.html.page164"></a>Group 将他提出的简化编程语言的大纲变成了真正的代码，并给它取了一个典型的顽皮名字“Smalltalk”。（他解释说，大多数编程系统“被命名为宙斯、奥丁和托尔，几乎什么都不做。我认为‘Smalltalk’ 这个标签非常无害，如果它真的做了什么好事，人们会感到惊喜。”）</p><p class="para">The year had started with a glimmer of optimism. Kay had the feeling he might finally be within striking distance of turning some of his great ideas into reality. He had reworked his Dynabook concept into something he called “miniCom,” a keyboard, screen, and processor bundled into a portable, suitcase-sized package. Meanwhile, the software aces he had brought together as PARC’s Learning Research <a></a>Group had turned his outline for a simplified programming language into real code, to which he gave the characteristically puckish name “Smalltalk.” (Most programming systems “were named Zeus, Odin, and Thor and hardly did anything,” he explained. “I figured that ‘Smalltalk’ was so innocuous a label that if it ever did anything nice people would be pleasantly surprised.”)</p>
<p class="para">Kay 的团队已经通过在 Bill English 的设计团队构建的视频显示系统上运行计算机生成的图形和动画的简陋但令人眼花缭乱的程序，展示了 Smalltalk 的隐性威力。Kay 本人是一位狂热的推广者，他不断撰写文章和会议摘要，通常配上他亲手绘制的田园场景中的孩子玩 Dynabook 的图画，以宣告大型机的消亡和“个人电脑”的到来。</p><p class="para">Kay’s team had already demonstrated Smalltalk’s implicit power by running rudimentary but dazzling programs of computer-generated graphics and animation on a video display system built by Bill English’s design group. Kay himself was a compulsive promoter, producing a steady stream of articles and conference abstracts, often illustrated with his own hand drawings of children in bucolic settings playing with their Dynabook, to proclaim the death of the mainframe and the advent of the “personal computer.”</p>
<p class="para">到 1972 年春天，他已经准备好迈出下一步。在借鉴了 Seymour Papert 的 LOGO 来设计 Smalltalk 的一些基本思想（尽管这两种语言在表面下的工作方式截然不同）之后，Kay 急切地想对 Smalltalk 进行 Papert 风格的测试。这意味着让孩子们（其理想对象）尝试在 miniCom 上执行简单的编程任务。他估计他需要大约 30 台小型机器，由计算机科学实验室的顶尖硬件工程师来制造。</p><p class="para">By the spring of 1972 he was ready for the next step. Having drawn on Seymour Papert’s LOGO for some of Smalltalk’s basic ideas (although the two languages worked much differently under the surface), Kay was anxious to give it a Papert-style test run. That meant giving children, its idealized subjects, a shot at performing simple programming tasks on miniComs. He figured he would need about thirty of the small machines, to be built by the Computer Science Lab’s crack hardware engineers.</p>
<p class="para">剩下要做的就是说服 CSL 接受这份工作。</p><p class="para">The only thing left to do was persuade CSL to take the job.</p>
<p class="para">那年 5 月，在 CSL 实验室会议上，凯发表了自己的观点。实验室工作人员坐在豆袋椅上懒洋洋地坐在他面前，凯阐述了制造世界上第一台个人电脑的理由。他明白，这意味着要突破显示技术的极限——PARC 使用的最小屏幕仍然只有家用电视机那么大，尽管大楼里的许多研究人员已经测试了数字位控制“像素”或显示屏上的点的系统。他们必须花费数千美元购买半导体内存来驱动 miniCom 的高性能图形显示器，但他们都知道价格注定会大幅下降。事实上，蓝图中几乎没有什么不能在十年内为普通用户提供商业化服务。这不就是他们来这里的原因吗——<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch12.html.page165"></a>构建他们所能想象到的最强大的系统，并领先于时代潮流，以便在世界其他国家赶上来时，他们能够弄清楚如何使用它？</p><p class="para">That May at a CSL lab meeting, Kay made his pitch. As the lab staff lounged in front of him in their beanbag chairs, he laid out the argument for building the world’s first personal computer. He understood this would mean pushing the envelope on display technology—the smallest screens used at PARC were still the size of household television sets, although systems in which digital bits controlled “pixels,” or dots on the display screen, had been tested by numerous researchers in the building. They would have to spend thousands of dollars on semiconductor memory to drive the miniCom’s high-performance graphical display, but they all knew the price was destined to fall sharply. In fact, there was hardly anything in the blueprint that would not be commercially accessible to the average user within ten years. And wasn’t that why they were here—<a></a>to build the most capable system they could imagine, so far ahead of the curve that they could figure out what to do with it by the time the rest of the world caught up?</p>
<p class="para">“我们知道一切，”他告诉听众。“我们知道像素到底有多大，知道我们能用多少像素，知道我们需要多少计算能力。个人设备作为编辑器、阅读器、家庭环境和智能终端的用途相当明显。现在让我们制造三十个这样的东西，这样我们就可以继续了。”他重新坐回座位，像往常一样自信地提出了一个无可辩驳的论点。</p><p class="para">“We know everything,” he told his audience. “We know exactly how big the pixels are, we know how many pixels we can get by with, we know how much computing power we need. The uses for a personal gadget as an editor, reader, take-home context, and intelligent terminal are fairly obvious. Now let’s build thirty of these things so we can get on with it.” He regained his seat, confident as always of having made an incontestable case.</p>
<p class="para">随后杰瑞·艾尔金德发言。</p><p class="para">Then Jerry Elkind took the floor.</p>
<p class="para">在 CSL，艾尔金德掌握着财政大权。没有他的许可，任何像凯这样的大型硬件项目都无法进行。但杰瑞·艾尔金德和艾伦·凯就像来自不同星球的生物，一个是严谨、按部就班的工程师，另一个是傲慢、哲学家。让其他人眼中充满星光吧——艾尔金德不是那种会被凯的浪漫光芒迷惑的人。作为一名经理，他回应书面上的理由和提出和回答的严谨问题，而不是孩子们在草地上玩电脑的朦胧景象。他是一个难缠的顾客，要求高，态度粗鲁。他问的问题太多了，更可惜的是，这些问题往往都是好问题。正如吉姆·米切尔曾经说过的，“杰瑞·艾尔金德知道的太多了，以至于很危险。”</p><p class="para">At CSL Elkind held the purse strings. No large-scale hardware project like Kay’s could be undertaken without his say-so. But Jerry Elkind and Alan Kay were like creatures from different planets, one an austere by-the-numbers engineer and the other a brash philosophical freebooter. Let others have stars in their eyes—Elkind was not the type to be beguiled by Kay’s romantic glow. As a manager he responded to rationales on paper and rigorous questions asked and answered, not hazy visions of children toying with computers on grassy meadows. He was a tough customer, demanding and abrasive. He asked too many questions and, more’s the pity, they were often good ones. As Jim Mitchell once remarked, “Jerry Elkind knows enough to be dangerous.”</p>
<p class="para">就在此时，他说出了大多数 CSL 工程师都害怕的死亡之吻。</p><p class="para">At this moment he pronounced the words that most CSL engineers had learned to dread as his kiss of death.</p>
<p class="para">“让我来扮演魔鬼的代言人吧，”他说。</p><p class="para">“Let me play devil’s advocate,” he said.</p>
<p class="para">他开始无情地详细分析凯的提议。他指出，这项技术只是推测，没有经过测试。miniCom 的设计初衷是让孩子玩，因此它不属于 PARC 创造未来办公系统的职责范围。即使它符合该职责范围，它也完全走错了方向。</p><p class="para">He proceeded to pick apart Kay’s proposal in pitiless detail. The technology was speculative and untested, he pointed out. To the extent that the miniCom was geared toward child’s play, it fell outside PARC’s mandate to create the office system of the future. To the extent that it fell within that mandate, it was on entirely the wrong vector.</p>
<p class="para">Kay 可能没有注意到，但 PARC 尚未完全探索分时的可能性。这正是建造 MAXC 的全部意义所在，毕竟 MAXC 是一台分时微型计算机。Kay 后来回忆道，当时的感受依然清晰：“他基本上是说，我们<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch12.html.page166"></a>已经使用了太多的绿色邮票让施乐公司为分时 MAXC 提供资金，而这种将资源用于个人机器的做法会让他们感到困惑。”</p><p class="para">Perhaps Kay had not noticed, but PARC had not yet finished exhausting the possibilities of time-sharing. That was the whole point of building MAXC, which was after all a time-sharing minicomputer. As Kay recalled later, the sting still fresh: “He essentially said that we <a></a>had used too many Green Stamps getting Xerox to fund the time-shared MAXC, and this use of resources for personal machines would confuse them.”</p>
<p class="para">那么，帕洛阿尔托研究中心的整体资源部署问题又如何呢？艾尔金德问道。凯自己的实验室里，一个重要的办公计算机项目已经在顺利进行中。凯有没有想过，他的项目如何融入这个项目呢？</p><p class="para">And what about the issue of PARC’s overall deployment of resources, Elkind asked. A major office computer program was already well under way in Kay’s own lab. Had Kay given any thought to how his project might fit in with that one?</p>
<p class="para">艾尔金德指的是 POLOS，即所谓的“PARC 在线办公系统”，这是比尔·英格利希 (Bill English) 试图在名为 Nova 800s 的大型商用小型计算机网络上复制恩格尔巴特系统。他正确地指出，POLOS 是 PARC 在信息架构竞赛中的正式参赛作品。部分原因是英格利希巧妙地为 Novas 下了订单，这让施乐公司决心跟进。这些小型多功能机器已经在 SSL 上大量出现，就像冰箱大小的<span class="italic">星球大战</span>机器人一样。</p><p class="para">Elkind was referring to POLOS, the so-called “PARC On-line Office System,” which was Bill English’s attempt to reproduce the Engelbart system on a large network of commercial minicomputers known as Nova 800s. He was correct in stating that POLOS ranked as PARC’s official entry in the architecture-of-information race. This was so in part because English had cannily put a stake in the ground with a round of purchase orders for the Novas, which committed Xerox to following through. The small, versatile machines were already proliferating at SSL like refrigerator-sized <span class="italic">Star Wars</span> droids.</p>
<p class="para">但凯认为 POLOS 与他的项目无关。POLOS 显然是一个大型系统原型，是一款昂贵的豪华车型，与凯心中的温馨、个性化套装相去甚远，就像林肯城市车与双座汽车相去甚远一样。但在艾尔金德居高临下的攻击下，凯惯常的流利口才消失了。他坐在那里一言不发，而艾尔金德则居高临下地将他一生的工作视为一个不切实际的梦想。</p><p class="para">But Kay considered POLOS irrelevant to his project. POLOS was explicitly a big-system prototype, an expensive luxury model as far removed from the homey, individualistic package Kay had in mind as a Lincoln Town Car is from a two-seat runabout. But under Elkind’s condescending assault Kay’s customary fluency deserted him. He sat mute while Elkind patronizingly dismissed his life’s work as a quixotic dream.</p>
<p class="para">“我惊呆了，”他后来说，“我爬走了。”走出房间后，观众听不到他说话的声音，他不堪忍受这种折磨，泪流满面。</p><p class="para">“I was shocked,” he said later. “I crawled away.” Once outside the room and beyond the hearing of his audience, he succumbed to his ordeal and broke down in tears.</p>
<p class="para">几天后，凯回到系统科学实验室，找到了比尔·英格利什。艾尔金德认为英格利什和凯是争夺 PARC 资源的竞争对手，但他错了。事实上，英格利什已经成为凯的父亲形象，他在犹他州接受的学术培训给他留下了这样的印象：只要给 ARPA 打电话要钱，就能获得研究资金。他们俩到达 PARC 后不久，英格利什就主动向凯介绍了一些基本的企业概念，比如研究预算。（“恐怕我真的问过比尔，‘什么是预算？’”凯回忆起英格利什给他上的第一课。）</p><p class="para">A few days later, back in the Systems Science Lab, Kay sought out Bill English. To the extent Elkind thought of English and Kay as rivals for PARC resources, he was mistaken. In truth, English had become something of a father figure for Kay, whose academic training at Utah had left him with the impression that one acquired research funds simply by calling up ARPA and asking for money. Shortly after they both arrived at PARC, English had taken it upon himself to introduce Kay to such elementary corporate concepts as research budgets. (“I’m afraid I really did ask Bill, ‘What’s a budget?’” Kay recalled of the first lesson English ever gave him.)</p>
<p class="para">现在，英格利士主动向他受伤的年轻人提出了一些进一步的建议<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch12.html.page167"></a>同事。在 PARC 高层中，凯缺乏可信度。在乔治·帕克之前，人们都认为凯是个早熟的孩子，在自己的岗位上投入了足够的精力，但非常需要成人的监督。他梦想家的名声让杰里·埃尔金德这样的官僚更容易驳回他的想法，而不对其进行认真审查。英格利希告诉凯，他赤脚穿越 Ideaspace 的旅程已经行不通了。他必须学会制定书面研究计划、编制预算和做笔记——简而言之，要看起来像一个严肃的研究人员，并且表现得像个严肃的研究人员。</p><p class="para">Now English volunteered some further advice to his wounded young <a></a>colleague. Among the PARC brass, Kay lacked credibility. All the way up to George Pake he was regarded tolerantly as a sort of precocious child, engaging enough in his place but profoundly in need of adult supervision. His reputation as a dreamer only made it easier for bureaucratic types like Jerry Elkind to dismiss his ideas without affording them serious scrutiny. English informed Kay, in essence, that his barefooted treks through Ideaspace would no longer do. He had to learn to develop written research plans, compile budgets, and keep notes—in short, to look and act like a serious researcher.</p>
<p class="para">Kay 把这个建议牢记在心。在接下来的几个月里，他起草了一份详细的计划，计划开发一个音乐、绘画和动画系统，教孩子们在 Novas 上进行创造性编程。他没有放弃他珍爱的 miniCom，但他认识到，他必须通过一系列较小的步骤来实现目标，并致力于几年的计划。这项努力取得了成果。到夏天结束时，他获得了 230,000 美元的拨款，为一组 Novas 配备了字符生成器，​​这些字符生成器可以生成文本和简单的图形，以便在高质量的屏幕上显示。他的一小群学习软件专家正要开始为这个临时拼凑的系统开发编程环境，这时 Lampson 和 Thacker 带着一个不同的想法敲开了他的门。</p><p class="para">Kay took the advice to heart. Over the next few months he drafted a detailed plan for a music, drawing, and animation system to teach kids creative programming on Novas. He did not abandon his cherished miniCom, but recognized that he would have to reach the grail via a series of smaller steps and commit himself to a program of several years. The effort bore fruit. By summer’s end he had acquired a $230,000 appropriation to equip a bank of Novas with character generators that produced text and simple graphics for display on a high-quality screen. His small group of learning software specialists had been about to begin developing the programming environment for this jury-rigged system when Lampson and Thacker knocked at his door with a different idea.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">艾尔金德并非最后一次走上了与他的主要研究科学家不同的道路。事实上，许多 CSL 工程师都认为分时技术的潜力<span class="italic">已经</span>完全耗尽。兰普森和萨克曾认真思考如何重新分配计算机能力，这样就不必与其他人共享处理周期。他们同意凯的观点，这意味着要建造几十台单独的机器，而不仅仅是一台。这需要钱。并不是说 PARC 的资金稀缺；而是资金分散得太广，任何一个小组都没有足够的资金来资助他们设想的大规模工程项目。他们需要的是财政版的“汤姆索耶历险记”，他们将收集每一位感兴趣的研究人员的捐款，并把它们集中起来。</p><p class="para">Elkind, not for the last time, had been following a different vector from that of his principal research scientists. As it happened, many CSL engineers were convinced that time-sharing’s potential <span class="italic">was</span> thoroughly exhausted. Lampson and Thacker had thought hard about how to redistribute computer power so no one would have to share processing cycles with anyone else. They agreed with Kay that this meant building dozens of individual machines, not just one. This would take money. Not that funds were scarce at PARC; but they were scattered too widely for any single group to have enough to finance the massive engineering program they envisioned. What was required was a fiscal version of “Tom Sawyering,” in which they would collect contributions from every interested researcher and rake them together in one great pile.</p>
<p class="para">萨克和兰普森认为凯是主要捐赠者。首先，他珍爱的 Dynabook 或 miniCom 或<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch12.html.page168"></a>Kiddicomp（无论他如何称呼其最新版本）与他们自己对理想个人电脑的设想完全吻合：对于 Lampson 来说，MAXC 是一个手提箱大小的电脑，零部件成本约为 500 美元；而对于 Thacker 来说，它是一台具有 Nova 800 功能且速度是其十倍的电脑。</p><p class="para">Thacker and Lampson regarded Kay as a prime donor. For one thing, the architecture of his cherished Dynabook, or miniCom, or <a></a>Kiddicomp—whatever he was calling the thing in its latest incarnation—corresponded neatly with their own visions of the ideal personal computer—for Lampson a suitcase-sized MAXC with a component cost of about $500; and for Thacker a computer with the Nova 800’s capabilities and ten times its speed.</p>
<p class="para">三人的想法都集中在一个共同的目标上：一台快速、紧凑、具有高分辨率显示屏的机器。“这东西必须装进一个合理大小的盒子里，而且价格不能太高，”兰普森说。“小巧简单至关重要，因为它的全部意义在于让每个人都拥有一台。”通过将最新的电子元件与自己强大的智慧相结合，他们也许就能成功。也许不是 Dynabook 的全部互动功能，而是朝着正确方向迈出的一大步——用凯的话来说，是“临时的 Dynabook”。</p><p class="para">The notions of all three intersected at one common goal: a fast, compact machine with a high-resolution display. “The thing had to fit in a reasonable sized box and it couldn’t cost too much,” said Lampson. “Small and simple was critical, because the whole point of it was to have one for everybody.” By combining the latest electronic components coming into the market with their own powerful intellects, they might just pull it off. Not the Dynabook in all its interactive glory, perhaps, but a giant leap in the right direction—in Kay’s words, an “interim Dynabook.”</p>
<p class="para">听到他们的提议，凯几乎抑制不住内心的兴奋——但他意识到他们可能仍然面临一个重要的障碍。</p><p class="para">Hearing their offer, Kay could barely contain his excitement—until he realized they might still face one important obstacle.</p>
<p class="para">“你打算怎么处理杰里？”他闷闷不乐地问道。艾尔金德仍然控制着 CSL 的预算。他击落 miniCom 的那天兰普森和萨克都在场。他真的希望自己能以不同的眼光看待这个新项目吗？</p><p class="para">“What are you going to do about Jerry?” he asked glumly. Elkind still controlled the CSL budget. Lampson and Thacker had both been present the day he shot down the miniCom. Was there really any hope that he would see this new project any differently?</p>
<p class="para">“杰瑞要去公司工作几个月，”兰普森回答道。“也许我们可以在他回来之前偷偷把事情办好。”</p><p class="para">“Jerry’s out of the office for a few months on a corporate task force,” Lampson replied. “Maybe we can sneak it in before he gets back.”</p>
<p class="para">“你能这么快完成吗？”</p><p class="para">“Can you get it done that quickly?”</p>
<p class="para">“我们必须这么做。无论如何，还有另一个理由让我们加快行动。”</p><p class="para">“We’ll have to. Anyway, there’s another reason to move fast.”</p>
<p class="para">“它是什么？”</p><p class="para">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="para">就在那时，他们告诉了他有关塔克的赌注。</p><p class="para">That was when they told him about Thacker’s bet.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">“比尔·维泰克是 SDS 的副总裁，”萨克后来回忆道。“我曾因某种我不记得的原因去埃尔塞贡多拜访 SDS。我们建造 MAXC 时并没有在那里交到很多朋友，而且只花了 18 个月就建成，这让他们认为我们作弊了，尽管他们不太明白是怎么回事。</p><p class="para">“Bill Vitek was a vice president at SDS,” Thacker recalled later. “I had been down in El Segundo visiting SDS for some reason I don’t remember. We didn’t make a lot of friends there when we built MAXC, and the fact it took only eighteen months led them to think that somehow we had cheated, although they couldn’t quite figure out how.</p>
<p class="para">“所以我和比尔·维泰克就这个问题争论了起来，作为一个自大而傲慢的人，我说，‘你知道，如果计算机足够小，你可以在三个月内制造出一台计算机。’维泰克说，‘啊，胡说！’我说，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch12.html.page169"></a>“一点也不胡说！”最后我们打赌了一瓶酒或者一顿晚餐，我甚至不记得是哪一个了。</p><p class="para">“So I was arguing about that with Bill Vitek, and being a cocky and fairly arrogant guy I said, ‘You know, you can build a computer in three months if it’s small enough.’ And Vitek said, ‘Aw, bullshit!’ And I said, <a></a>‘Not bullshit at all!’ And we ended up betting a bottle of wine or a dinner, I don’t even remember which.</p>

<p class="para">查克·萨克 (Chuck Thacker) 于 1972 年 11 月 22 日开始设计 Alto。他邀请了艾德·麦克雷特 (Ed McCreight) 协助进行工程设计，并在 2 月底之前完成了设计，超过了维泰克 (Vitek) 的最后期限。</p><p class="para">Chuck Thacker started designing the Alto on November 22, 1972. He enlisted Ed McCreight to help with the engineering and completed the design before the end of February, beating Vitek’s deadline.</p>
<p class="para">最初的计划是制造多达 30 台 Altos，分发给计算机科学实验室的工程师和 Kay 的学习研究小组（他的种子资金用于资助前 10 台）。但 Alto 从诞生之日起就引起了轰动。正如 Taylor 早就预料到的那样，交互式显示器的强大功能不言而喻。Alto 的屏幕尺寸和排列方式与 8.5 x 11 英寸的纸张完全相同，给人留下了如此生动的印象，以至于实验室的简陋建设计划很快就得到了扩大。最终，施乐公司制造的 Altos 不只是 30 台，而是近 2000 台。</p><p class="para">The original plan was to manufacture up to thirty Altos for distribution to the engineers in the Computer Science Lab and to Kay’s Learning Research Group (his seed money was allocated to finance the first ten). But from the moment of its birth the Alto created a sensation. As Taylor had long anticipated, the power of the interactive display spoke for itself. The Alto’s screen, whose dimensions and alignment replicated that of an 8½-by-11-inch sheet of paper, produced such a vivid impression that the lab’s modest construction plan was soon expanded. In the end Xerox would build not thirty Altos, but nearly two thousand.</p>
<p class="para">Alto 绝不是当时速度最快或性能最强大的计算机。MAXC 可以在任何现有的性能指标上超越它，并且在相当长的一段时间内仍然是 PARC 进行重度计算的首选机器。即使没有点亮全屏显示器的负担，Alto 的运行速度也相对较慢，处理器速率不到 6 兆赫（截至本文撰写时，普通台式个人计算机的运行速率为 400 MHz 或更快）；显示器使其速度进一步减慢了三倍。</p><p class="para">The Alto was by no means the fastest or most powerful computer of its time. MAXC could blow it away on any performance measure in existence and for a considerable time remained the machine of choice at PARC for heavy-duty computation. Even without the burden of illuminating the full-screen display, the Alto ran relatively slowly, with a processor rate of less than 6 megahertz (the ordinary desktop personal computer as of this writing runs at a rate of 400 MHz or faster); the display slowed it further by a factor of three.</p>
<p class="para">但 Alto 的受欢迎程度还源于其他特点。对于那些一生中大部分时间都在午夜和黎明之间工作的计算机科学家来说，Alto 的主要优点不是速度，而是可预测性。没有人比 CSL 工程师 Jim Morris 说得更好：“Alto 的伟大之处在于它在夜间不会运行得更快。”</p><p class="para">But the Alto’s great popularity derived from other characteristics. To computer scientists who had spent too much of their lives working between midnight and dawn to avoid the sluggishness of mainframes burdened by prime-time crowds, the Alto’s principal virtue was not its speed but its predictability. No one said it better than the CSL engineer Jim Morris: “The great thing about the Alto is that it doesn’t run faster at night.”</p>
<p class="para">然后是其工程设计上的奇妙流畅。从某种程度上说，这是 Thacker 匆忙的产物，因为紧迫的期限抹去了他可能想要创建 MAXC 的第二个系统变体的任何冲动。根本没有机会实现更大的目标。</p><p class="para">Then there was the marvelous sleekness of its engineering. To some extent this was an artifact of Thacker’s haste, for his tight deadline erased any impulse he might have felt to create a second system variation on MAXC. There was simply no opportunity for biggerism.</p>
<p class="para">相反，为了节省时间和金钱，Thacker 和他的团队完全<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch12.html.page170"></a>另一种方式。Alto 就像一块精致的钟表，不知怎么就用实验室里闲置的硬件组装起来了。他们没有设计新的内存组件，而是巧妙地重新使用了已经为 MAXC 制造的电路板。Ed McCreight 重新审视了他自己设计的 MAXC 磁盘控制器，并设法为 Alto 剥离了一些电路。甚至显示器也是从 POLOS 那里借来的，POLOS 已经远远落后于计划，其特别订购的视频显示终端仍然放在盒子里。</p><p class="para">Instead, to save time and money Thacker and his team went entirely <a></a>the other way. Alto was like a fine timepiece somehow assembled from pieces of stray hardware lying around the lab. Rather than design new memory components, they ingeniously reused boards that had already been built for MAXC. Ed McCreight revisited his own design of the MAXC disk controller and managed to strip out a few more circuits for the Alto. Even the display monitors were appropriated from POLOS, which had fallen so far behind schedule that its specially ordered video display terminals were still sitting around in boxes.</p>
<p class="para">Alto 的设计几乎在各个方面都非常紧凑和简单，以至于在最初的几个月里，尽管原型机仍然很少，但渴望得到它的工程师们被邀请到实验室组装自己的 Alto。Ron Rider 几个月前刚从华盛顿大学毕业就加入了 PARC，一位实验室经理回忆道：“在 Alto 很难买到的时候，他就有一台 Alto。当我问他是如何得到它的，他告诉我，他去了各个实验室，收集人们欠他的零件，然后自己组装起来。”</p><p class="para">In almost every respect the Alto design was so compact and uncomplicated that during the first months, while prototypes were still scarce, engineers desperate to get their hands on one were invited to come into the lab and assemble their own. Ron Rider, who had joined PARC only a few months earlier upon graduating from Washington University, “had an Alto when Altos were impossible to get,” recalled one of the lab managers. “When I asked him how he got one, he told me that he went around to the various laboratories, collected parts that people owed him, and put it together himself.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">当然，萨克并不是真的在短短三个月内从头开始设计 Alto。他与比尔·维泰克的赌注可以说是一场愚蠢的赌注。Alto 设计的几个基本元素多年来一直为计算机科学所知，而其他元素自 MAXC 完成以来一直在 CSL 中讨论。1972 年夏天，萨克甚至在一份长达十页的备忘录中为 CSL 概述了小型机器的设计要点，备忘录名为“具有微并行处理功能的个人计算机”。</p><p class="para">Of course Thacker did not really design the Alto from scratch in three short months. His wager with Bill Vitek was something of a sucker bet. Several basic elements of Alto’s design had been known to computer science for years, and others had been kicking around CSL ever since the completion of MAXC. During the summer of 1972 Thacker had even outlined for CSL the design points for a small machine in a ten-page memo entitled “A Personal Computer with Microparallel Processing.”</p>
<p class="para">设计的哲学核心来自鲍勃·泰勒 (Bob Taylor)，他也提供了该机器的名称（艾伦·凯 (Alan Kay) 从未完全停止称其为“临时 Dynabook”）。正如泰勒不断告知他的顶级工程师的那样，分时技术在定量上使用户更容易获得计算的成功只是方程式的一部分：在改善“人机交互<span class="italic">质量</span>”方面尚未取得任何成就。完成这项工作涉及三个步骤：将计算能力交到个人手中，通过高性能显示器将信息直接传递到眼球，并通过高速网络连接计算机。</p><p class="para">The philosophical core of the design came from Bob Taylor, who also supplied the machine’s name (Alan Kay never entirely ceased calling it the “interim Dynabook”). As Taylor constantly informed his top engineers, time-sharing’s success in making computing more accessible to the user quantitatively was only part of the equation: Nothing had yet been accomplished in terms of improving “the <span class="italic">quality</span> of man-machine interaction.” Finishing the job involved three steps: placing computing power in individual hands, delivering information directly to the eyeball via a high-performance display, and linking the computers together on a high-speed network.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch12.html.page171"></a>
<p class="para">直到 1971 年，这三个步骤在技术上似乎仍然不可行。计算能力和内存显然过于昂贵，无法单独提供，尤其是当时用于图形导向型计算机的所谓“书法”显示管消耗了大量计算能力和内存。此外，由于这些显示器费力地逐笔构建图像，而不是像电视显像管那样每秒数千次地将荧光光束扫描到发光表面上，因此它们容易出现恼人的闪烁。这些特性不利于人机之间的轻松交流。至于现有的网络技术，它们要么复杂而缓慢，要么像 ARPANET 一样，需要安装数十万美元的专用硬件。</p><p class="para">As late as 1971, all three steps still seemed technically unfeasible. Computing power and memory were plainly too expensive to hand out in individual parcels, especially since they were consumed insatiably by the so-called “calligraphic” display tubes then in use with graphics-oriented computers. Moreover, because these displays laboriously constructed their images stroke by stroke, rather than by scanning a phosphor beam across a luminous surface thousands of times a second like television tubes, they were prone to annoying flicker. These were not qualities that would lend themselves to relaxed communication between man and machine. As for existing network technologies, they were either complex and slow or, like the ARPANET, required the installation of hundreds of thousands of dollars in specialized hardware.</p>
<p class="para">然后，当泰勒无法用精确的工程术语表达自己的想法时，他习惯用比喻的方式说话。“当我们建造 MAXC 时，泰勒告诉了查克和我一堆我们当时完全听不懂的东西，”兰普森饶有兴致地回忆道。“我们认为那只是一位不懂技术的经理的胡言乱语。但两年后回想起来，他试图告诉我们要做的事情一清二楚：<span class="italic">建造 Alto</span>。”</p><p class="para">Then there was Taylor’s habit of speaking in parables when he could not articulate his ideas in the precise argot of engineering. “When we were building MAXC, Taylor told Chuck and me a bunch of stuff we couldn’t understand at all at the time,” Lampson recalled in amusement. “We dismissed it as the ravings of a technically illiterate manager. But looking back on it two years later, it was crystal clear what he was trying to tell us to do: <span class="italic">Build the Alto</span>.”</p>
<p class="para">到 1972 年中期，他们意识到内存和计算能力的成本曲线下滑速度有多快，但情况发生了变化。“只有当我们意识到内存会变得非常便宜，当我们理解摩尔定律并将其内化时，”Thacker 回忆道，“我们才明白这就是 Bob 一直在说的话。突然间，制造一台使用三分之二处理器周期和四分之三内存来运行显示器的计算机变得非常合理。从那时起，一切都走下坡路了。工程设计很简单。但要理解这个基本想法，就需要理解，最终机器将拥有如此强大的功能，运行显示器根本不需要三分之二的功能。”</p><p class="para">What had changed by mid-1972 was their recognition of how quickly memory and computing power were sliding down the cost curve. “It was only when we realized that memory would get really cheap, when we understood Moore’s Law and internalized it,” recalled Thacker, “that it became clear that this is what Bob had been saying all along. All of a sudden it was perfectly sensible to build a computer that used two-thirds of its processor cycles and three-fourths of its memory to run the display. From then on it was all downhill. The engineering was easy. But getting that basic idea required understanding that eventually you’d have so much power in a machine that running the display wouldn’t require anywhere near two-thirds of it.”</p>
<p class="para">Thacker 仍然需要解决许多问题，以设计出一台实用的个人电脑，它既要快速、紧凑，又不能牺牲多功能性和功能，还要有足够清晰、锐利和灵活的显示屏，以跟上没有驱动器的处理器。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch12.html.page172"></a>他对用户一无所知。最后他在 PARC 内部找到了关键答案。</p><p class="para">Thacker still had to solve numerous problems in designing a serviceable personal computer that would be fast and compact without sacrificing versatility and power, and that would also have a display clear, sharp, and nimble enough to keep up with the processor without driv<a></a>ing the user blind. In the end he found the crucial answers inside PARC itself.</p>
<p class="para">他的第一个灵感来自“微并行处理”的概念。这一基本思想来自 MAXC 操作的一个独特方面——Ed McCreight 将其描述为“劫持”中央处理器。由于计算机架构中存在一个常见瓶颈，典型机器的处理器或大脑与机器的所有外围设备共享对计算机主内存的访问。由于一次只能服务一个设备，处理器经常处于闲置状态，而其他组件则暂时独占内存。“例如，当磁盘访问内存时，”Thacker 说，“处理器基本上会停止，因为它在等待轮到自己。”</p><p class="para">His first inspiration was the concept of “microparallel processing.” The basic idea came from a singular aspect of MAXC’s operation—what Ed McCreight had described as “hijacking” the central processing unit. Thanks to a common bottleneck in computer architectures, the processor, or brain, of a typical machine shared access to the computer’s main memory with all the machine’s peripheral devices. Because only one device could be serviced at a time, the processor was often left idle while some other component temporarily monopolized the memory. “While the disk was accessing the memory, for instance,” Thacker said, “the processor essentially stopped because it was waiting its turn.”</p>
<p class="para">Thacker 的灵感是将瓶颈从内存转移到处理器本身。在他的设计中，只有 CPU（毕竟是机器最重要的组件）才被允许随时访问主内存。CPU 将接管所有外围设备（磁盘驱动器、键盘和显示器）的计算功能，并自行决定何时需要维修以及维修多长时间。</p><p class="para">Thacker’s inspiration was to shift the bottleneck from the memory to the processor itself. In his design, only the CPU, which after all was the most important component of the machine, would be permitted to address the main memory at any time. The CPU would take over the computing functions of all the peripherals—disk drive, keyboard, and display—deciding on its own when they needed servicing and for how long.</p>
<p class="para">萨克认为，如果计算机的每项日常任务都能按紧急程度排序，并按适当的顺序通过处理器，那么他就可以让处理器几乎全天候忙碌。如果排序正确，那么每项任务都会在需要时得到处理，不早也不晚。低优先级任务可以短暂中断，为更紧急的任务让路，然后在没有更紧急的任务时恢复。效率、速度和硬件方面的收益可能是巨大的。作为磁盘驱动器和其他单元的辅助大脑的整个电路板可以省去。Alto 的 CPU 将被调动来为所有这些任务进行思考。</p><p class="para">Thacker reasoned that if each of the computer’s routine tasks could somehow be ranked by urgency and funneled through the processor in appropriate order, he could keep the processor occupied almost full-time. If the ranking was correct, every task would be handled when it needed to be, no sooner and no later. Low-priority tasks could be interrupted for brief periods to make way for more urgent ones, then resumed later, when nothing more pressing was in the way. The gain in efficiency, speed, and hardware was potentially huge. Whole circuit boards that served as the ancillary brains of disk drives and other units could be dispensed with. The Alto’s CPU would be drafted into doing the thinking for all of them.</p>
<p class="para">萨克的第二个重要灵感涉及如何在不超出内存预算的情况下为高性能显示器供电的问题。这并非易事：他明白显示器的质量将决定他的新电脑的成败。</p><p class="para">Thacker’s second crucial inspiration involved the question of how to power a high-performance display without busting the budget on memory. This was not trivial: He understood that the quality of the display would make or break his new computer.</p>
<p class="para">在此之前，希望提供交互式显示屏的计算机设计师面临着两个同样令人不快的选择：他们可以<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch12.html.page173"></a>显示器几乎不支持内存，这会导致闪烁和性能缓慢，或者他们可以通过字符生成器提供备用内存，这意味着系统会承受另一个洗衣机大小且容易出错的外围设备的负担。</p><p class="para">Up until then, computer designers wishing to provide an interactive display faced two equally unappetizing choices: They could give the <a></a>display little memory support, which led to flickering and slow performance, or they could provide backup memory through a character generator, which meant burdening the system with another and bug-prone peripheral the size of a washing machine.</p>
<p class="para">萨克花了很长时间思考如何在不增加额外硬件的情况下将适量的信息直接显示到屏幕上。有一天，他在系统科学实验室观看凯的一个图形程序演示时，找到了答案。</p><p class="para">Thacker struggled at length with the riddle of how to direct a suitable volume of information to the screen without adding excess hardware. The answer came to him one day while he was watching a demonstration of one of Kay’s graphics programs in the Systems Science Lab.</p>
<p class="para">该演示使用了由前 Engelbatt 工程师 Roger Bates（在 Lampson 的帮助下）设计的字符生成器。该设备内部有价值数千美元的内存，与 Ron Rider 后来为 SLOT 制造的那个设备有远亲关系。它旨在通过允许每个字符占用一小块矩形内存来存储自定义字体，直到被召唤到屏幕上。大多数 PARC 工程师都对此感到失望，主要是因为设计师希望在 POLOS 屏幕上重现书籍质量的页面，但事实证明，这比他们预期的编程挑战要艰巨得多。</p><p class="para">The demo utilized a character generator designed by a former Engelbatt engineer named Roger Bates (with Lampson’s assistance). This unit, which had thousands of dollars’ worth of memory inside, was a distant relative of the one Ron Rider would later build for the SLOT. It was designed to store custom fonts by allowing each character to occupy a small rectangular patch of memory until summoned to the screen. Most of the PARC engineers considered it a disappointment, largely because the designers’ ambition to reproduce book-quality pages on the POLOS screen turned out to be a tougher programming challenge than they anticipated.</p>
<p class="para">Kay 的团队是个例外。他们对在屏幕上绘制文本的想法感到厌倦，但对显示图像的可能性却很着迷，他们挪用了该系统——用 Lampson 的不贬义的说法是“滥用它”——用于他们的图形和动画程序，在其内存中加载的不是印刷字符，而是图形设计。结果是一个基本的黑白“位图”——一个内存块，其中每个位对应于显示屏上的一个点。将给定的内存位翻转为“开”，相应的点就会在显示屏上亮起；按照给定的模式打开这些位，您就可以将相同的图像映射到屏幕上。</p><p class="para">Kay’s group was an exception. Bored with the idea of painting text on the screen but fascinated with the possibility of displaying images, they had appropriated the system—“perverted it,” in Lampson’s unpejorative phrase—to use for their graphics and animation programs by loading its memory not with print characters, but graphical designs. The result was a rudimentary black-and-white “bitmap”—a block of memory in which each bit corresponded to a dot on a display screen. Flip a given memory bit “on” and the corresponding dot lit up on the display; turn on these bits in a given pattern and you could map the same image to the screen.</p>
<p class="para">正如兰普森所解释的那样，“在正常情况下，字体内存中会有字符‘A’的小位图，还有‘B’和‘C’等的位图，然后字符内存会显示‘A’、‘h’和‘a’，然后你就得到了‘啊哈’。艾伦说，‘我们将有一大堆编号为 1 到 500 的人工字符，字符内存会显示 1，然后是 2，然后是 3。’结果是采用字体<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch12.html.page174"></a>内存并将其转换为位图”——也就是说，早在实验室拥有构建全尺寸位图的资源之前。</p><p class="para">As Lampson explained, “In the normal deal there would be a little bitmap for the character ‘A’ in the font memory and a bitmap for ‘B’ and ‘C’ and so on, and then the character memory would say display an ‘A,’ an ‘h,’ and an ‘a,’ and aha, you have ‘Aha.’ Alan said, ‘We’ll have a whole bunch of artificial characters numbered 1 through 500, and the character memory will say display 1, then 2, then 3.’ The result was to take the font <a></a>memory and turn it into a bitmap”—that is, well before the lab had the resources to build a full-scale bitmap.</p>
<p class="para">Kay 的团队才刚刚开始研究这种新信息显示方式的潜力（尽管他们已经做了足够多的工作，帮助说服 Thacker 和 Lampson 为 Alto 配备高分辨率显示屏的必要性）。他们开发的第一个简单程序是可以在文本块中嵌入“图标”或缩略图大小的图片。另一个是绘画系统，用户可以使用宽度达 4 个像素的方形“画笔”在屏幕上绘制或擦除线条和曲线。</p><p class="para">Kay’s group had only begun to investigate the potential of this new way of displaying information (although they had done enough to help persuade Thacker and Lampson of the need to equip the Alto with a high-resolution display). Among their first simple programs was one that could embed “icons,” or thumbnail-sized pictures, within blocks of text. Another was a painting system in which users wielded square “brushes” up to four pixels wide to draw or erase lines and curves on the screen.</p>
<p class="para">尽管这些应用程序给他留下了深刻的印象，但 Thacker 更被 Kay 的系统使用内存块的基本原理所震撼。他意识到，就像 Kay 的团队将字符生成器变成了一个简单的位图一样，他可以将 Alto 主内存的空闲块转换为显示屏的位图。强制内存执行这项双重任务将消除对单独字符生成器的需求。这需要偷工减料，因为显示器现在必须与机器的所有其他功能竞争内存块。例如，当 Alto 在屏幕上放置文本文档时，它会通过从位图中省略页面中缺少文本的任何部分来节省成本，例如行与行之间和所有四个边距的空白。此外，每当数据和显示对内存的需求相互竞争时，显示器就会失败。必须提醒用户注意一个奇怪的现象：在工作期间，他们正在编写或编辑的文档的图像会逐渐缩小，就像窗帘从底部卷起一样。原因是，随着数据量和复杂性的增加，占用的内存越来越多，留给位图的内存越来越少。同样的现象也解释了 Alto 显示全屏图形图像时发生的情况。在这种情况下，它往往运行得非常慢，部分原因是绘制屏幕消耗了太多处理器周期，但也因为显示器消耗了太多内存，几乎没有足够的内存来维持程序的运行。</p><p class="para">Impressed as he was by these applications, Thacker was struck more by the underlying principle by which Kay’s system used the memory blocks. He realized that just as Kay’s team had turned the character generator into a simple bitmap, he could convert idle blocks of the Alto’s main memory into a bitmap for the display screen. Forcing the memory to perform this double duty would eliminate the need for a separate character generator. This required cutting a few corners, because the display would now have to compete with all of the machine’s other functions for memory blocks. When the Alto placed a text document on its screen, for example, it would economize by omitting from the bitmap any part of the page that lacked text, such as the white spaces between lines and at all four margins. Also, whenever there were competing demands for memory from data and display, the display lost. Users had to be alerted to expect a strange phenomenon: During a work session the image of the document they were writing or editing would gradually shrink, like a window shade rolling up from the bottom. The reason was that as the increasing volume and complexity of the data claimed more memory, less remained for the bitmap. The same phenomenon accounted for what happened whenever the Alto displayed a full-screen graphical image. On those occasions it tended to run agonizingly slowly, in part because so many processor cycles were consumed in painting the screen, but also because the display consumed so much memory there was barely enough left to keep the program percolating along.</p>
<p class="para">如果没有这种巧妙的设计，Alto 的显示屏根本就不可能实现。即使在其极限范围内，它也对<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch12.html.page175"></a>机器；其分辨率为 606 x 808 像素，这意味着每秒需要刷新近五十万位三十次。（Kay 设想他的 Dynabook 拥有一百万像素的显示屏，但他不得不对得到的结果感到满意。）</p><p class="para">Without this sort of artfulness the Alto display would not have been possible at all. Even within its limits it made severe demands on the <a></a>machine; its resolution of 606 by 808 pixels meant that nearly a half-million bits needed to be refreshed thirty times per second. (Kay envisioned a one-million-pixel display for his Dynabook, but had to be satisfied with what he got.)</p>
<p class="para">然而，一旦它开始运行，就让怀疑者变成了信徒。其中最重要的一位就是杰瑞·艾尔金德。</p><p class="para">Once it was running, however, it made believers out of skeptics. Not the least important of these was Jerry Elkind.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">艾尔金德于深秋结束了他的特别小组任务，回到了 PARC。在离开近六个月后，他已经对重新确立权威的必要性感到不安，更让他恼火的是，他发现有人背着他启动了一场全面的“臭鼬工厂”，以执行一个他质疑其价值的项目。</p><p class="para">Elkind had returned to PARC from his task force assignment in the late fall. Already uneasy at the necessity of reasserting his authority following a nearly six-month absence, he was even more put out to find that a full-scale skunk works had been launched behind his back to pursue a project whose value he questioned.</p>
<p class="para">瞥了一眼 34 号楼的地下室车间，他意识到现在做太多事情可能已经太迟了。显然，Alto 已经失去了生命。但他也认为，他向兰普森、萨克和凯提出的重要问题仍未得到解决。</p><p class="para">One peek into the basement workshop of Building 34 told him it might be too late to do much about it. Clearly the Alto had taken on a life of its own. But he also thought the important issues he had raised with Lampson, Thacker, and Kay remained unaddressed.</p>
<p class="para">“我们是否要投入大量实验室资源和大量资金来开发五六个原型，而我们不确定它们是否能正常工作？”他问道。尽管 Thacker 和 Lampson 向他保证最终产品会非常酷，但看了一眼原理图后，他的担忧并没有减轻——尤其是在他注意到需要占用大量内存来维护显示屏之后。</p><p class="para">“Are we going to invest a major hunk of the lab’s resources and a lot of money in developing five or six prototypes of something we’re not sure will work?” he asked. For all that Thacker and Lampson assured him the finished product would be the epitome of cool, a glance at the schematics failed to ease his concerns—especially after he noticed the huge proportion of memory that would be devoted to maintaining the display.</p>
<p class="para">“我认为，如果不亲眼看到它的效果，我就无法理解它能做什么，”他后来说。“我当然对最终结果的成本以及我们能负担得起多少感到疑惑。”他指示兰普森以书面形式给他一些答案。</p><p class="para">“I don’t think I had the skills to appreciate what could be done with it without seeing it work,” he said later. “I certainly had questions about what the end result was going to cost and how many we could afford.” He instructed Lampson to give him some answers, in writing.</p>
<p class="para">兰普森的回应是 12 月 19 日的一份备忘录，标题很简单，就是“为什么是 Alto”​​。在三页半的严谨论证中，他为该项目提供了所需的所有技术和哲学依据。虽然他承认 Alto 的一些“最初动机”来自 SSL 工程师 Alan Kay，但他也将其描述为计算机科学实验室中每个人都会喜欢的机器。Alto 几乎可以执行 PDP-10（即 MAXC）可以执行的任何计算。它将比 Bill English 设计的视频终端系统更强大<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch12.html.page176"></a>POLOS，图形效果更好。它可以运行 PARC 各个实验室编写的所有办公系统软件，而且电力充足。它会让昂贵的 Novas 变得过时。</p><p class="para">Lampson’s response was a December 19 memo entitled simply “Why Alto.” In three and a half sharply reasoned pages he furnished the project all the technical and philosophical justification it would ever need. While acknowledging that some of the “original motivation” for the Alto came from Alan Kay, an SSL engineer, he also portrayed it as a machine of tantalizing potential for everyone in the Computer Science Lab. The Alto would be capable of performing almost any computation a PDP-10 (that is, MAXC) could do. It would be more powerful than the video terminal system Bill English was designing for <a></a>POLOS, with better graphics. It would run all the office system software being written in various labs at PARC with power to spare. And it would render the costly Novas obsolete.</p>
<p class="para">兰普森指出，Alto 计算机每台售价 10,500 美元，仅为 PARC 为建造 MAXC 而为每位 CSL 成员花费的一半。（事实证明，配备全套内存后，前几台 Altos 计算机的价格接近 18,000 美元。然而，在对原始设计进行重新设计以提高效率并实施大批量生产计划后，价格降至约 12,000 美元。）兰普森认为自己有充分的理由表明，这台计算机的价格足够便宜，足以让 PARC 为实验室的每位成员都买得起一台。</p><p class="para">Lampson pointed out that at $10,500 per machine the Altos would cost barely half what PARC had spent per CSL member in building MAXC. (With a full complement of memory, as it turned out, the first few Altos cost closer to $18,000. After the original design was reengineered for efficiency and a high-volume manufacturing program was put in place, however, that dropped down to about $12,000.) Lampson considered himself on firm ground in stating that the machine would be cheap enough to enable PARC to afford one for every member of the lab.</p>
<p class="para">“如果我们关于廉价、功能强大的个人电脑的实用性的理论是正确的，”他总结道，“我们应该能够在 Alto 上令人信服地证明它们。如果它们是错误的，我们可以找出原因。”</p><p class="para">“If our theories about the utility of cheap, powerful personal computers are correct,” he concluded, “we should be able to demonstrate them convincingly on Alto. If they are wrong, we can find out why.”</p>

<p class="para">到 4 月初，第一台原型机已准备好开始计算。Thacker 和 McCreight 一起确定了 16 项基本计算任务争夺处理器注意力的优先级。这基本上涉及确定每项任务在失败前必须多快完成，以及它对机器其余部分的重要性。例如，在磁盘和内存之间传输数据尤其重要，因为如果内存中没有数据，其他一切都无法进行。因此，磁盘操作获得了最高优先级。接下来是显示（实际上是三个任务——一个刷新水平扫描，一个刷新垂直扫描，第三个将显示数据传输到内存和从内存中传输数据）。这里的任何不愉快的延迟都意味着屏幕无法理解。列表的更下方是监控本地网络（以太网，由 Bob Metcalfe 和 David Boggs 同时发明）和运行 Alto 的基本程序，这是 Nova 的一个变体。</p><p class="para">By early April the first prototype was ready to start computing. Thacker and McCreight together had worked out the priority by which sixteen essential computing tasks would contend for the processor’s attention. This basically involved determining how quickly each task had to be completed before it failed, and how important it was for the rest of the machine. Transferring data between the disk and the memory was particularly critical, for instance, because without data in memory nothing else would work. Therefore disk operations earned the highest priority. Next came the display (actually three tasks—one to refresh the horizontal scan, one for the vertical, and a third to transfer display data into and out of memory). Any untoward delay here would mean rendering the screen unintelligible. Farther down the list came monitoring the local network (the Ethernet, being invented concurrently down the hall by Bob Metcalfe and David Boggs) and running the Alto’s basic program, a variant of the Nova’s.</p>
<p class="para">萨克和麦克雷特对他们的任务转换方案非常满意，他们开始准备专利申请，但此时他们非常尴尬地发现，有人已经先行一步。这个令人震惊的消息就是韦斯·克拉克，他就是这个方案的先驱。克拉克一如既往地身材苗条，下巴突出，担任高级顾问。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch12.html.page177"></a>计算机科学实验室的顾问。在一次定期的咨询访问中，他了解到了这项专利提案。之后的一天，他出现在了 Alto 工作室。</p><p class="para">Thacker and McCreight were so pleased with their task-switching scheme they started preparing a patent application, at which point they discovered to their great embarrassment that someone had got there first.

<p class="para">前两台 Altos 原型机在 34 号楼的地下车间成型。它们赤裸裸、盲目地来到这个世界，就像刚孵化出来的雏鸟一样无助，因为硬件建造得太快，而运行它的软件却需要几个月才能完成，其基本程序必须从最近的 Nova 引导。</p><p class="para">The first two prototype Altos took shape in the basement workshop of Building 34.

<p class="para">身材魁梧、体魄强健的男子走进车间，手里拿着一卷黄色的同轴电视电缆，就像消防员拿着一根软管一样。他绕过 Bose Conspiracy 堆在角落里用来制造假 901 的一堆木头和刨花板，把一千英尺长的电缆卷放到工作台上，然后把示波器和脉冲发生器放在工作台上。然后他开始用烙铁笨拙地操作。</p><p class="para">Burly and athletic, the man came down into the shop carrying a yellow reel of coaxial television cable like a fireman toting a length of hose. He sidestepped the piles of wood and particle board the Bose Conspiracy had piled up in a corner to build their fake 901s; and man-handled the thousand-foot reel up to a workbench, on which he deposited an oscilloscope and a pulse generator. Then he started fumbling around with a soldering iron.</p>
<p class="para">博格斯好奇地看着。“我知道他在做什么，”他后来说。“他要通过电缆发射脉冲，然后通过示波器查看输出。”他还意识到，这个人不会使用烙铁，就像骑手对待从未骑过马的新手一样。</p><p class="para">Boggs watched with curiosity. “I knew what he was doing,” he said later. “He was going to be firing pulses down the cable and looking at the output through the scope.” He also recognized, the way a horseman does a greenhorn who has never been in a saddle before, that this individual was no artist with a soldering iron.</p>
<p class="para">相比之下，博格斯在成长过程中就开始接触业余无线电接线。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch13.html.page179"></a>在华盛顿特区长大的他，在大学假期里一直使用各种电器来保证当地 NBC 电视发射机的正常运转。他穿着莫卡辛鞋，金色的马尾辫来回摆动，向陌生人伸出了援助之手。这是他和鲍勃·梅特卡夫第一次合作，但绝不会是最后一次。在接下来的两年里，他们形影不离，在 PARC 被称为鲍勃西双胞胎。</p><p class="para">Boggs, in contrast, had cut his teeth wiring ham radios while growing <a></a>up in Washington, D.C., then had spent his college breaks wielding all manner of electrical implement to keep the local NBC television transmitter on the air. He padded over in his moccasins, his blond ponytail swinging to and fro, to offer the stranger a helping hand. It was the first time he and Bob Metcalfe would work together, but not the last. Over the next two years they would be so inseparable they would become known throughout PARC as the Bobbsey Twins.</p>
<p class="para">很少有人会认为他们是合适的合作伙伴。梅特卡夫自称来自布鲁克林和长岛，他毕业于哈佛大学和麻省理工学院，拥有电气工程、商业和应用数学学位，可以说是一路走来都抱怨不已。博格斯是典型的内向者，一个苦行僧般的电台歌迷，拥有普林斯顿大学的本科学位。梅特卡夫是个尖锐、固执己见、喜欢对抗的人，如果他没有嗅到足够的冲突，他就会大吵大闹。博格斯独来独往，在谈话中，他说话缓慢而谨慎，眼睛盯着地面或太空，仿佛在仔细斟酌着每一个字。</p><p class="para">Few would have cast them as plausible partners. Metcalfe hailed, as though at the top of his lungs, from Brooklyn and Long Island. He had graduated from Harvard and MIT—bitching every step of the way, to hear him tell it—with degrees in electrical engineering, business, and applied mathematics. Boggs was the quintessential introvert, an ascetic radiohead with an undergraduate degree from Princeton. Metcalfe was all sharp elbows, opinionated and confrontational, not above giving the caldron a stir if he did not sniff enough conflict in the air. Boggs kept to himself—in a conversation he spoke slowly and carefully, his eyes focused on the ground or off into space, as though scrupulously weighing every word.</p>
<p class="para">他们的志向似乎也不一致。梅特卡夫决心寻找主要机会。（他最终离开 PARC，创办了一家价值数百万美元的网络公司。）“我第一次听到‘风险投资’这个词，”一位同事回忆道，“是从鲍勃·梅特卡夫那里听到的。”但博格斯总是说，他一辈子都满足于做纯粹的研究。</p><p class="para">Their aspirations appeared to be at odds, too. Metcalfe was embarked on a determined search for the main chance. (He would eventually leave PARC to start a multimillion-dollar networking company.) “The first time I ever heard the term ‘venture capital,’” one colleague remembered, “I heard it from Bob Metcalfe.” But Boggs always talked as though he would be content doing pure research all his life.</p>
<p class="para">总而言之，除了他们都喜欢的 Brooks Brothers 纽扣衬衫（尽管博格斯更喜欢黄色，而梅特卡夫更喜欢蓝色）之外，他们似乎没有什么共同之处。他们是 PARC 有史以来最古怪的合作伙伴，也是最有效率的合作伙伴。他们以神秘的和谐方式合作，发明了一种让计算机相互通信的新方式，即被称为以太网的伟大数字共用线路。</p><p class="para">In sum, they seemed to have little in common beyond the Brooks Brothers button-down shirts they both favored (though Boggs preferred yellow and Metcalfe blue). They were the most eccentric partnership PARC ever knew, and the most productive. Working together in mysterious harmony they invented a new way for computers to talk to each other, the great digital party line known as Ethernet.</p>

<p class="para">生性傲慢、直言不讳的梅特卡夫于 1972 年 6 月来到帕洛阿尔托，但承受着巨大的屈辱：哈佛大学拒绝了他的博士论文。</p><p class="para">Brash and outspoken by nature, Metcalfe arrived in Palo Alto in June 1972 bearing a humiliating burden: Harvard had rejected his doctoral thesis.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch13.html.page180"></a>
<p class="para">这次侮辱结束了一段漫长而艰难的关系。梅特卡夫后来在麻省理工学院获得了双学士学位（电气工程和商学）。他认为，作为一所研究生院，哈佛永远无法与理工学院相提并论。“这可能是一种怪癖，”多年后，他尖刻地说道。“但我讨厌哈佛。在麻省理工学院，学生必须做事，而在哈佛，他们不需要。在麻省理工学院，你通过实践来学习，因为你是一名工程师。在哈佛，他们希望你成为一名科学家，而科学家永远不会<span class="italic">因为</span><span class="italic">做事</span>而玷污自己。”</p><p class="para">This affront had capped a long and difficult relationship. Metcalfe had earned his dual bachelor’s degrees (electrical engineering and business) down the road at MIT. As a graduate school, he believed, Harvard could never measure up to Tech. “It’s probably an idiosyncratic thing,” he related acerbically years later. “But I hated Harvard. At MIT students got to do stuff and at Harvard they didn’t. At MIT you learn by doing because you’re an engineer. At Harvard they want you to be a scientist, and scientists would <span class="italic">never</span> soil themselves by <span class="italic">doing</span> things.”</p>
<p class="para">在他开始兼职研究 ARPANET 后不久，他意识到了这种差异。作为一名热切的应届毕业生，他提出帮助哈佛大学加入该系统，为其 PDP-10 和 IMP 之间建立必要的接口，IMP 是每个节点通往主网络的门户。这并不是什么高深的科学；他计划只是复制他已经为麻省理工学院建造的装置。但哈佛大学拒绝了他。</p><p class="para">The difference had been driven home to him shortly after he started working part-time on the ARPANET. As an eager new grad student he offered to help Harvard get on the system by building the necessary interface between its PDP-10 and the IMP, one of the stand-alone machines that was every node’s portal to the main network. This was not rocket science; he planned simply to duplicate the unit he had already built for MIT. But Harvard turned him down.</p>
<p class="para">“他们说，‘你只是个研究生，我们要找一家叫 Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman 的公司来做这件事，’”他回忆道。“BBN 把这项工作分配给了他们员工中一个叫 Ben Barker 的兼职员工，结果发现他和我一样，也是哈佛的研究生。”</p><p class="para">“They said, ‘You’re just a grad student, and we’re going to have it done by a company named Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman,’” he recalled. “And BBN assigned the job to a part-time employee on their staff named Ben Barker, who turned out to be a grad student at Harvard, just like me.”</p>
<p class="para">但是，如果说这次冷落让他对哈佛大学产生了厌恶，那对他对阿帕网的痴迷却毫无影响。梅特卡夫和鲍勃·泰勒一样，对将计算机直接数字化连接的想法非常痴迷。但他从事这项工作的水平更接近机器——他感兴趣的不是通过连接计算机可以实现什么，而是如何真正将比特从一个节点移动到另一个节点。寻找实现这一目标的新方法将成为他一生的工作。</p><p class="para">But if the snub helped sour him on Harvard, it had no effect on his burgeoning enchantment with the ARPANET. Metcalfe was every bit as preoccupied as Bob Taylor with the idea of placing computers in direct digital conjunction. But he engaged in it at a level closer to the machine—he was less interested in what could be accomplished by linking computers than in how to actually move the bits from node to node. Finding new ways to make that happen would become his life’s work.</p>
<p class="para">在哈佛大学完成学业的同时，他继续在麻省理工学院兼职从事 ARPANET 链路工作。到 1972 年，当他准备攻读博士学位时，他已经与 ARPANET 官僚机构紧密相连，以至于被选为所谓的“协调员”——一种技术保姆，护送 IMP 到全国各地的新家，确保它们正确连接并启动。他的人脉使他在外界成为一笔宝贵的财富。“我之所以很受欢迎，是因为 ARPANET 很受欢迎，而 ARPA 是主要的资金来源，”他<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch13.html.page181"></a>回忆道。那个春天，他被潜在雇主们热情款待，最终收到了 9 份工作邀请，其中包括 BBN、Doug Engelbart 和一些顶尖大学。最好的工作邀请来自 PARC 的 Jerry Elkind 和 Bob Taylor，这并不令人意外。这不仅是最高的薪水（19,000 美元，比其他所有人都多出几千美元），“而且这是世界上最干净、最直接的交易，一份高薪工作，在一个美丽的地方，没有教学责任。没有终身职位的废话，也没有学生，你可以和 Butler Lampson、Alan Kay 和 Chuck Thacker 一起工作。”</p><p class="para">While completing his studies at Harvard, he continued to work part-time on the ARPANET link at MIT. By 1972, when he was ready to take his doctorate, he was so securely bound into the ARPANET bureaucracy that he was chosen as a so-called “facilitator”—a sort of technical nurse-maid who escorted IMPs to their new homes around the country to make sure they got properly hooked in and booted up. His connections made him a valuable property on the outside. “I was hot stuff because the ARPANET was hot stuff and ARPA was a major source of funding,” he <a></a>recalled. He spent that spring getting wined and dined by prospective employers, eventually landing nine job offers from supplicants that included BBN, Doug Engelbart, and a number of leading universities. The best offer—no surprise—came from Jerry Elkind and Bob Taylor at PARC. Not only was it the most money ($19,000, beating everyone else by several thousand dollars), “but it was the cleanest, most straightforward deal in the world, a high-paying job in a beautiful place with no teaching responsibilities. There was no tenure bullshit and no students, and you got to work with Butler Lampson and Alan Kay and Chuck Thacker.”</p>
<p class="para">梅特卡夫回到剑桥，和妻子收拾行装，并忍受着他剩下的唯一学术义务——在教职委员会面前为他的博士论文进行答辩。他以为答辩会很轻松，因为他的论文研究的是网络如何以离散数字数据包传输数据，而他刚刚花了两年时间埋头研究 IMP 电路。结果，委员会正拿着一只装满湿沙的袜子等着他。他走进委员会会议室进行口头答辩，当场就得到了答复：委员会裁定他的论文“理论性不足”。他对物理系统的所有费力讨论？对麻省理工学院的工程专业来说已经足够好了，但这是哈佛大学的科学。换句话说，他应该添加一些带有希腊符号的公式，然后稍后再试。</p><p class="para">Metcalfe returned to Cambridge to pack with his wife and suffer through his one remaining academic obligation, the defense of his doctoral thesis before a faculty committee. He expected it to be a breeze, insofar as his thesis was a study of how networks transmitted data in discrete digital packets and he had just spent two years with his head buried in IMP circuitry. The committee, as it happened, was waiting for him with a sock filled with wet sand. He went into the committee room for his oral defense and received his answer on the spot: His thesis was “insufficiently theoretical,” the committee ruled. All his laborious discussion of physical systems? Good enough for MIT engineering, but this was Harvard science. In other words, he should add some formulas with Greek symbols, and try again later.</p>
<p class="para">被拒后，梅特卡夫大吃一惊。他认为自己知道真正的问题是什么：问题不在于他的工作“理论性不足”，而在于他这么多年一直在麻省理工学院校园里闲逛，而不是为碰巧是他论文委员会成员的哈佛教授打气。鲍勃·梅特卡夫对哈佛大学嗤之以鼻，现在是报复的时候了。“我的论文导师不应该让这种事情发生，”他后来说道。“但我没有和他合作，所以他也没有和我合作。”</p><p class="para">Metcalfe was stunned by the rejection. He thought he knew what the real problem was: Not that his work was “insufficiently theoretical,” but that he had spent all those years hanging around the MIT campus instead of carrying water for some Harvard professor who happened to be on his thesis committee. Bob Metcalfe had thumbed his nose at Harvard, and it was payback time. “My thesis advisor should never have let that happen,” he said later. “But I wasn’t playing ball with him, so he didn’t play ball with me.”</p>
<p class="para">无论如何，再多的责骂也无法解决他眼前的困境。他接受了 PARC 的工作，并知道他能拿到哈佛博士学位。他忐忑不安地从家里给泰勒打电话，告诉他这个坏消息。</p><p class="para">In any case no amount of fulmination would solve his immediate dilemma. He had accepted a job from PARC with the understanding that he would arrive properly garlanded with a Harvard Ph.D. Apprehensively he called Taylor from home to deliver the bad news.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch13.html.page182"></a>
<p class="para">“他甚至没有犹豫，”梅特卡夫回忆道。“他说，‘快出来，在这里完成你的论文。’那感觉真是太好了。”</p><p class="para">“He didn’t even hesitate,” Metcalfe recalled. “He said, ‘Just come on out and finish your thesis here.’ That felt very, very good.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">鲍勃·梅特卡夫的个性为 CSL 的混乱局面增添了新的酸味。他是一个单人的通货紧缩大军，随时准备打击他那些才华横溢的同行的虚张声势。如果有人在 Dealer 吹嘘说他只用两三个小时就严格运用脑力就实现了某个很酷的程序，梅特卡夫很可能会说：“真的吗？那你昨晚为什么坐在我旁边的实验室里呆了十个小时？”</p><p class="para">Bob Metcalfe’s personality added a tart new ingredient to the CSL stew. He was a one-man deflation brigade, ever poised to puncture the bravado of his talented peers. Let someone boast at Dealer of having implemented some cool program in just two or three hours of stringently applied brainpower and Metcalfe was likely to remark, “Really? Then what were you doing sitting next to me in the lab for ten hours last night?”</p>
<p class="para">“顺便说一句，”二十五年后他回忆道，“我做得不好。我不是一个好人。”</p><p class="para">“And by the way,” he recalled some twenty-five years later. “I didn’t do it nicely. I was not a nice person.”</p>
<p class="para">他最喜欢的目标是查克·塔克 (Chuck Thacker)。</p><p class="para">His favorite target was Chuck Thacker.</p>
<p class="para">很难判断是什么导致了梅特卡夫和萨克之间的不和。有些人认为这是自尊心的冲突——只是实验室里几乎所有其他人都具有同样高昂的自尊心，并不是每个人都像愤怒的巨象一样配对。“这只是随机的人际化学反应，”梅特卡夫后来说。“我有博士学位，他没有。他是世界级的处理器设计师，我不是。我不是一个容易相处的人，他也不是，所以我一直在找他的麻烦，他也一直在找我的麻烦。不是说他不是好人。他<span class="italic">是</span>个好人。但我们就是合不来。”</p><p class="para">It is hard to gauge what produced the bad chemistry between Metcalfe and Thacker. Some thought it a clash of like egos—except that a similarly elevated self-esteem characterized pretty much everyone else in the lab and not everyone paired off like raging mastodons. “It was just random interpersonal chemistry,” Metcalfe said later. “I have a Ph.D.; he doesn’t. He’s a world-class processor designer; I’m not. And I’m not an easy-to-get-along-with person and neither was he, so I was on his case all the time and he was on my case all the time. It’s not that he’s not a good guy. He <span class="italic">is</span> a good guy. But we just didn’t get along.”</p>
<p class="para">一些人甚至认为，这种敌意可能主要存在于梅特卡夫的想象中，因为萨克从未像他那样大肆宣扬。事实上，他们的一些同事根本不知道他们之间有任何不和。然而，就连泰勒也认识到，梅特卡夫/萨克是梅特卡夫/博格斯的阴阳关系，这种关系的冷淡将持续多年。他后来表示，萨克和梅特卡夫陷入了他所谓的“一级分歧”。</p><p class="para">Some even believed the animus might reside mostly in Metcalfe’s imagination, for Thacker never made as much of it as he did. Indeed, some of their colleagues were unaware that there was any bad blood between them at all. Yet even Taylor recognized that Metcalfe/Thacker was the yang to the yin of Metcalfe/Boggs, a relationship whose iciness would resonate for years. Thacker and Metcalfe, he said later, were locked in what he called a Class One disagreement.</p>
<p class="para">“这就是两个人意见不一致，而且双方都无法让对方满意地解释对方的观点，”他说。“第二类分歧是指双方都无法让对方满意地解释对方的观点<span class="italic">。</span>第二类分歧使人们即使在意见不一的情况下也能一起工作。第一类分歧是破坏性的。大多数动乱和国际危机以及大多数痛苦和苦难以及<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch13.html.page183"></a>世界上的困难都是建立在第一类分歧之上的。萨克和梅特卡夫永远无法达成第二类分歧，从那以后他们就一直是敌人。”</p><p class="para">“That’s when two people disagree and neither can explain to the other person’s satisfaction that other person’s point of view,” he said. “A Class Two disagreement is when each <span class="italic">can</span> explain to the other’s satisfaction the other’s point of view. Class Two disagreements enable people to work together even when they disagree. Class One is destructive. Most disturbances and international crises and most of the pain and suffering and <a></a>difficulty in the world are based on Class One disagreements. Thacker and Metcalfe could never reach a Class Two disagreement, and they’ve been enemies ever since.”</p>
<p class="para">梅特卡夫认为，在加入 PARC 几天后，萨克就发现了 MAXC 内存故障，而萨克早已宣布机器已完工，因此他招致了萨克的永久仇恨。这就是所谓的“芒格”事件。梅特卡夫的首项任务是将 MAXC 连接到 ARPANET。对于像他这样经验丰富的人而言，这本不是什么难事。但不知为何，MAXC 却让他苦不堪言。每次他尝试建立连接时，这台该死的机器就会崩溃。他反复检查自己的工作，直到最终确信问题出在 MAXC 本身。他认为，这台机器存在内存错误。</p><p class="para">Metcalfe believed he had earned Thacker’s undying enmity within days of his joining PARC by identifying a memory fault in MAXC long after Thacker had declared the machine finished. This was the incident of the so-called “Munger.” Metcalfe’s inaugural assignment was to connect MAXC to the ARPANET. This should not have been a hard job for someone of his experience. But for some reason MAXC was giving him a hell of a time. Every time he tried to launch the connection, the damn machine crashed. He checked and rechecked his work until he finally became convinced that the problem was MAXC itself. The machine, he decided, was suffering from a memory bug.</p>
<p class="para">作为 MAXC 的首席设计师，Thacker 对此并不知情。因为他已经实施了错误纠正和内存诊断的故障安全系统。他被叫到地下室，MAXC 在高容量空调的强劲气流下嗡嗡作响，他为这个来自哈佛和麻省理工学院的新人进行了自己的测试。据他所知，一切都运行正常。</p><p class="para">As MAXC’s principal designer, Thacker would not hear of it. Not with the fail-safe system of error correction and memory diagnostics he had implemented. Summoned down to the basement room where MAXC hummed away under the powerful draft of high-capacity air conditioning, he conducted his own tests for the newcomer from Harvard and MIT. As far as he could tell, everything ran flawlessly.</p>
<p class="para">他宣称：“这台机器非常可靠。”</p><p class="para">“The machine is reliable,” he declared.</p>
<p class="para">“所以查克离开了，”梅特卡夫说。“他坚称 MAXC 完全没问题，并把问题归咎于我，而他一开始并不太看好我这个人。”</p><p class="para">“So Chuck left,” Metcalfe said. “He insisted MAXC was absolutely fine and chalked up the problems to me, a guy he didn’t think much of in the first place.”</p>
<p class="para">因此，梅特卡夫设计了自己的测试。他称其为“芒格”，是他与萨克开的私人玩笑。这个词源于麻省理工学院的黑客俚语“mung”，意为“捣乱到无用”，表示对计算机文件进行大规模、永久且（通常）恶意的更改。梅特卡夫的非破坏性芒格只是将一串随机的比特输入到 MAXC 的内存中，然后再次读出。如果序列在此过程中发生哪怕一个比特的变异，程序就会在附近的电传打字机上发出铃声并记录差异。梅特卡夫启动芒格，等着看会发生什么。他不必等太久。几秒钟之内，电传打字机就像火警一样响了起来。</p><p class="para">Therefore Metcalfe devised his own test. Calling it “Munger” was his way of enjoying a private joke at Thacker’s expense. The word derived from “mung,” MIT hacker slang that meant “Mash Until No Good” and signified the making of large, permanent, and (generally) malicious changes to a computer file. Metcalfe’s nondestructive Munger simply fed a random stream of bits into MAXC’s memory and read them out again. If the sequence mutated along the way by so much as a single bit, the program would clang a bell on a teletype nearby and log the discrepancy. Metcalfe fired Munger up and waited to see what would happen. He did not have to wait long. Literally within seconds the teletype went off like a fire alarm.</p>
<p class="para">事实证明确实如此。MAXC 存在<span class="italic">内存</span>缺陷——但不是在哪里<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch13.html.page184"></a>每个人（包括 Thacker）都在寻找它。他们忽略了 MAXC 实际上有两个内存端口，一个通过中央处理器，另一个通过磁盘控制器。由于 Thacker 的测试程序在机器内部运行，因此它只调查了处理器端口，该端口工作正常。但 Munger 就像阻碍 Metcalfe 的 ARPANET 链接一样，作为磁盘的外部程序运行——内存端口确实坏了。“我的程序发现了这个错误，”Metcalfe 回忆道，“而 Chuck 从未原谅我。”</p><p class="para">That proved it. There <span class="italic">was</span> a memory flaw in MAXC—only not where <a></a>everyone (including Thacker) had been searching for it. What they had overlooked was that MAXC actually had two ports into memory, one via the central processor and the other through the disk controller. Because Thacker’s test program ran from inside the machine, it surveyed only the processor port, which worked fine. But Munger, like the ARPANET link that had stymied Metcalfe, ran as an external program from the disk—where the memory port was indeed broken. “My fucking program found the bug,” Metcalfe recalled, “and Chuck never forgave me.”</p>
<p class="para">“直到今天，我都坚信梅特卡夫误解了查克，”泰勒后来说。“萨克喜欢别人指出错误，因为他喜欢修复它们。”另一方面，萨克的同事中很少有人像梅特卡夫那样喜欢指正错误。他甚至还制作了一个橡皮图章，上面印着电影《<span class="italic">爱情故事》</span>中的一句台词。上面写着：“可靠性就是永远不必说抱歉。”</p><p class="para">“I believe firmly to this day that Metcalfe misread Chuck,” Taylor said later. “Thacker liked to have bugs pointed out, because he loved to fix them.” On the other hand, not many of Thacker’s colleagues displayed Metcalfe’s pure delight in rubbing it in. He even had a rubber stamp made up echoing a catchphrase from the movie <span class="italic">Love Story</span>. It read, “Reliability is never having to say you’re sorry.”</p>
<p class="para">“我过去总是在写的所有备忘录上盖上这个印章，”梅特卡夫多年后回忆起这件事时仍不禁笑了起来。“查克讨厌它。可怜的萨克！”</p><p class="para">“I used to stamp that on all the memos I was writing,” Metcalfe said many years later, still grinning at the thought. “Chuck hated it. Poor Thacker!”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">在最终将 MAXC 接入 ARPANET 后，梅特卡夫开始着手解决将他和博格斯联系在一起的挑战。这需要找到一种简单可靠的方法将 PARC 的 Altos 连接起来。泰勒认为，局域网是交互式分布式计算的<span class="italic">必要条件</span>：他追求的不仅仅是一个人和一台机器的共生关系，而是将众多人和机器连接在一起必然会产生的独特能量。</p><p class="para">After finally getting MAXC hooked up to the ARPANET, Metcalfe moved on to the challenge that was to bring him and Boggs together. This involved finding a simple and reliable way to connect PARC’s Altos to each other. The local network was the <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> of interactive distributed computing, Taylor believed: He was after more than the symbiosis of one man and one machine, but rather the unique energy sure to issue from joining together a multitude of people and machines all as one.</p>
<p class="para">不幸的是，当时使用的网络架构都不符合 PARC 的规格。ARPANET 规模太大，需要太多额外的硬件才能以合理的成本将计算机连接到离散的本地网络中。IBM 和其他几家计算机制造商开发了自己的专有系统，但这些系统专门针对自己的机器量身定制，很难适应其他机器。当本地环路太大时，它们也容易崩溃。POLOS 小组对其 Nova 小型计算机采用 Data General 提供的网络技术，突显了这些缺点。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch13.html.page185"></a>网络的最大容量是 15 台计算机。POLOS 试图将数量增加一倍，但结果却带来了多条线缆和硬件的恐怖。“我们能够将多达 29 台 Nova 联网，但那是极限了，”Metcalfe 回忆道。“最终的 29-Nova 菊花链有 28 条 40 芯线缆、60 个 40 芯连接器，而且一旦这些脆弱设备中的任何一个受到干扰，就会崩溃。”PARC 所有这些线缆汇集在一起​​的地下室被恰当地称为“鼠窝”。</p><p class="para">Unfortunately, none of the network architectures then in use suited PARC’s specifications. The ARPANET was too large-scale and required too much extra hardware to link computers together in discrete local networks at a reasonable cost. IBM and several other computer manufacturers had developed their own proprietary systems, but they were specifically tailored to their own machines and difficult to adapt to others. They also tended to break down when the local loop got too large. The POLOS group’s adaptation of a network technology provided by Data General for its Nova minicomputers underscored these shortcomings. <a></a>The network’s maximum capacity was fifteen computers. POLOS’s attempt to double the number had produced a multi-tentacled horror of cable and hardware. “We were able to network up to 29 Novas, but that was the limit,” Metcalfe recalled. “The ultimate 29-Nova daisy chain had twenty-eight 40-conductor cables, sixty 40-conductor connectors, and the nasty habit of crashing if any one of these fragile devices was disturbed.” The basement room at PARC where all these cables came together was aptly labeled the “rat’s nest.”</p>
<p class="para">显然，这对泰勒来说是行不通的，他设想的系统将数百台 Altos 连接起来。他的其他规格也同样严格。网络必须便宜——不超过所连接计算机成本的 5%。它必须简单，没有任何繁琐的新硬件，以促进长期可靠性。它必须易于扩展——不像 POLOS，在 POLOS 中，添加 Nova 意味着关闭网络并在鼠窝中接驳一条新线路。它必须速度快，因为它会将文件传送到加里·斯塔克韦瑟的快速激光打印机，需要跟上速度。</p><p class="para">Obviously this would not do for Taylor, who envisioned a system linking hundreds of Altos. His other specifications were similarly stringent. The network had to be cheap—no more than 5 percent of the cost of the computers it was connecting. It had to be simple, without any fussy new hardware, in order to promote long-term reliability. It had to be easily expandable—unlike POLOS, where adding a Nova meant taking down the network and splicing a new line into the rat’s nest. And it had to be fast, because it would be feeding files to Gary Starkweather’s swift laser printer and would need to keep up.</p>
<p class="para">梅特卡夫刚到 PARC 时发现，CSL 已搁置了几种网络方案，但没有一种是他喜欢的。其中一种是 ARPANET 的本地版本（但速度快 1,000 倍），由查尔斯·西蒙尼 (Charles Simonyi) 设计，他终于重新加入了 PARC 的伯克利计算机学院老同事。西蒙尼的设计被昵称为 SIGnet，代表“西蒙尼无限辉煌的网络”。梅特卡夫研究了该规范大约一周，然后否决了它，因为“对于本地网络来说，移动部件太多”。</p><p class="para">When Metcalfe first got to PARC he found several networking schemes already percolating on CSL’s back burner, none of them to his liking. One was a local version of the ARPANET (but 1,000 times faster) devised by Charles Simonyi, who had finally rejoined his old Berkeley Computer colleagues at PARC. Simonyi’s design was nicknamed SIGnet, which stood for “Simonyi’s Infinitely Glorious Network.” Metcalfe studied the specifications for about a week before rejecting it for having “too many moving parts for a local network.”</p>
<p class="para">当最后期限逼近时，他开始另寻他处。萨克的 Alto 示意图（大约在 1972 年底完成）在原本应该安装网络控制器的位置留有空白。如果梅特卡夫无法想出办法来填补这个空白，这件事情就将不再由他来处理——这不仅是对他作为网络专家的学术权威的挑战，也是对他自尊心的打击。</p><p class="para">He started to look elsewhere while a deadline loomed. Thacker’s Alto schematics, which were coming together around the end of 1972, left a blank space where the network controller was supposed to fit. If Metcalfe could not come up with something to fill the blank, the matter would be taken out of his hands—which would be not only a challenge to his intellectual authority as the network guy, but a blow to his pride.</p>
<p class="para">当他突然想起几个月前第一次遇到的一个概念时，这个令人沮丧的结果被避免了。今年 6 月，在因 ARPANET 业务访问华盛顿时，他住在了<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch13.html.page186"></a>他的朋友史蒂夫·克罗克（Steve Crocker，ARPA 项目经理）在房间里的沙发床上躺了一天。那天深夜，他从一个方便的书架上取下厚厚的一册论文，来自一个鲜为人知的技术会议，称其为“治疗时差失眠的良方”，然后慢慢地读完了夏威夷大学教授诺曼·艾布拉姆森（Norman Abramson）写的一本。</p><p class="para">That dismal outcome was averted when he suddenly recalled a concept he had first encountered months earlier. Back in June, while visiting Washington on ARPANET business, he had lodged on the guest <a></a>room sofa-bed of his friend Steve Crocker, an ARPA program manager. Late that night he pulled down from a handy bookshelf a heavy volume of papers from an obscure technical conference, “a sure cure for jet-lag sleeplessness,” and lumbered his way through one written by a University of Hawaii professor named Norman Abramson.</p>
<p class="para">艾布拉姆森的论文描述了 ALOHAnet，这是一种无线电网络，旨在让夏威夷群岛上的计算机相互通信。ALOHAnet 大致源自 ARPANET，从其中央控制计算机的昵称可以看出：Menehune，一个神话中的夏威夷“小鬼”。梅特卡夫对这个双关语很反感，但对这个方案很感兴趣。ALOHAnet 信息以离散数字包的形式通过大气传输。由于空气是一种被动介质（与带电电话线不同），这一特性使系统变得非常简单。艾布拉姆森进一步描述了该网络处理两个或多个站点试图同时传输时发生的干扰的巧妙方法。如果他们没有收到接收站确认他们的消息已安全到达的确认，他们会在等待一个随机间隔后重新传输，这样消息就不会再次发生冲突。梅特卡夫认为，这在本地网络中将是一个非常有用的功能，因为数十台计算机可能试图在同一线路上发送消息。</p><p class="para">Abramson’s paper described ALOHAnet, a radio network designed to allow computers to communicate with one another along the Hawaiian archipelago. ALOHAnet was loosely derived from the ARPANET, as could be seen from the nickname of its central control computer: Menehune, a mythical Hawaiian “imp.” Metcalfe was annoyed by the pun but intrigued by the scheme. ALOHAnet messages were transmitted in discrete digital packets through the atmosphere. Because air is a passive medium (in contrast to, say, an electrically charged phone line), that feature made the system fetchingly simple. Abramson further described the network’s clever means of handling the interference that occurred whenever two or more stations tried to transmit simultaneously. If they failed to hear an acknowledgment from the receiving station indicating that their messages had arrived safely, they retransmitted after waiting a random interval so the messages would not collide a second time. This, Metcalfe perceived, would be a highly useful feature in a local network where scores of computers might be trying to send messages on the same line.</p>
<p class="para">ALOHAnet 的主要限制似乎是它容易陷入僵局。论文指出，该通道只能加载其容量的 17%，然后就会崩溃，变成一连串不连贯的、不断重发和不断冲突的消息。</p><p class="para">The main limitation of ALOHAnet appeared to be its tendency toward gridlock. The paper suggested that the channel could be loaded up to only 17 percent of its capacity before breaking down into a incoherent jabber of retransmitted and recolliding messages.</p>
<p class="para">“这不可能，”梅特卡夫靠在克罗克的沙发床上自言自语道。他注意到艾布拉姆森的数据并非基于经验——现有的 ALOHAnet 只连接了 7 台计算机——而是基于理论，而且是理论的误用。他意识到艾布拉姆森做出了两个不可能的假设：用户数量是无限的，并且每个用户在确认停止后仍继续无意识地打字。难怪模型中充满了消息和重传，直到像超载飞艇一样崩溃。“完全不可接受，”梅特卡夫想。</p><p class="para">“That can’t be right,” Metcalfe said to himself, propped up on Crocker’s sofa-bed. It had not escaped his notice that Abramson’s figures were not based on experience—the existing ALOHAnet linked only seven computers—but on theory, and misapplied theory at that. He realized Abramson had made two impossible assumptions: That the number of users was infinite, and that each one kept mindlessly typing even after the acknowledgments stopped coming. No wonder the model filled up with messages and retransmissions until it crashed like an overloaded blimp. “Totally unacceptable,” Metcalfe thought.</p>
<p class="para">但假设有人对亚伯兰提出了一些现实生活中的假设<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch13.html.page187"></a>梅特卡夫的模型如何？例如，系统终端数量有限——30、40，甚至 100——如果系统停止响应，用户将停止传输。在这种情况下，梅特卡夫计算出，即使容量达到 90%，系统也应该保持稳定。</p><p class="para">But suppose one imposed a couple of real-life assumptions on Abram<a></a>son’s model? Such as that the system had a finite number of terminals—thirty, forty, even a hundred—and that users stopped transmitting if the system stopped responding. In that case, Metcalfe calculated, the system should remain stable even at 90 percent of capacity.</p>
<p class="para">便宜、简单、容量大：回到 PARC 后，他意识到 ALOHAnet 具备实验室在本地网络中寻求的大多数品质。在接下来的几个月里，梅特卡夫努力使它适应中心的高容量、高性能规格。他放弃了中央控制计算机 Menehune，因为每个 Alto 都可以控制自己的传输速率。他设计了一个方案，每个站都会监听线路，一旦听到任何干扰，就会立即停止传输，而不是继续喋喋不休。他建议通过某种物理线路连接 Altos，而不是通过无线电传输。</p><p class="para">Cheap, simple, and capacious: Back at PARC, he realized that ALOHAnet possessed most of the qualities the lab sought in a local network. Over the next few months Metcalfe worked to adapt it to the center’s high-volume, high-performance specifications. He junked the central control computer, Menehune, because each Alto would control its own transmission rate. He designed a scheme by which each station would listen to the line and stop transmitting the instant it heard any interference, instead of continuing to chatter. And rather than transmit via radio, he proposed joining the Altos by some sort of physical line.</p>
<p class="para">关键因素是介质必须是惰性的。梅特卡夫明白，如果线路必须承载电流以协助传输，就像电话线一样，那么墨菲定律就会占上风。线路电压将成为最容易发生故障的部件。但如果线路上没有电，墨菲定律就会失效。他推断，将信息发送到被动介质中是可能的，而且效果要好得多，比如“曾经被认为是遍布宇宙的光传播介质的‘光以太’”。</p><p class="para">The key element was that the medium had to be inert. Metcalfe understood that if the line had to carry an electrical current to aid transmission, like a phone line, Murphy’s Law would take over. The line voltage would become the component most vulnerable to failure. But if there was no power on the line, Murphy would be defeated. It was possible and much better, he reasoned, to send messages into a passive medium, like the “‘luminiferous aether’ once thought to pervade the universe as the medium for the propagation of light.”</p>
<p class="para">1973 年 5 月 22 日，他起草了第一份备忘录，向 PARC 的专利律师描述了这一概念。主题是：“ETHER 网络”。此后不久，他第一次见到了 David Boggs。</p><p class="para">On May 22, 1973, he drafted his first memo describing the concept for PARC’s patent attorneys. Subject: “The ETHER Network.” Soon after that, he met David Boggs for the first time.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">与此同时，博格斯也找到了前往 PARC 的单独方式——和其他许多人一样，由艾伦·凯陪同。</p><p class="para">Meanwhile, Boggs had found his own separate way to PARC—escorted, as had been so many others, by Alan Kay.</p>
<p class="para">和斯坦福大学电气工程专业的研究生一样，博格斯每周都要打瞌睡，参加系里最大的演讲厅里为期一小时的研讨会，听取行业知名人士的演讲。目的是让正在成熟的“双 E 生”们感受到现实世界中工程学的兴奋。然而，大多数情况下，这些课程都变成了一个持续十周的令人昏昏欲睡的单调课程。</p><p class="para">Like all of Stanford’s grad students in electrical engineering, Boggs had been sentenced to snooze through a weekly one-hour seminar in the department’s largest lecture hall featuring a talk from some person prominent in industry. The point was to inoculate the ripening “double-E’s” with the excitement of engineering in the real world. For the most part, however, the sessions merged into a single soporific ten-week drone.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch13.html.page188"></a>
<p class="para">直到 1972 年圣诞节前不久 Kay 出现，他才开始泛泛地谈论施乐公司在校园对面开设的研究中心正在进行的有趣工作。然后，他放映了一系列幻灯片，展示了他和同事们为模仿 PDP-10 而制造的机器。Boggs 摆脱了麻木，坐直了身子。高性能计算是他的专长。他明白，任何能够从头开始制造 PDP-10 的团队都是非常了不起的。当研讨会在五点结束，每个人都可以离开时，他冲到前面，对 Kay 进行了严密的提问。</p><p class="para">That is, until Kay showed up shortly before Christmas 1972. He started speaking in general terms about the interesting work taking place at the research center Xerox had opened up across the street from the campus. Then he put up a series of slides of a machine he and his colleagues had built to mimic the PDP-10. Boggs shook off his torpor and sat upright. High-performance computing was his field. He understood that any group that could build a PDP-10 from scratch was something special. When the seminar ended at five and everyone was free to leave, he bolted down front and subjected Kay to close questioning.</p>
<p class="para">后者总是在寻找潜在的招募对象，他称这些人“眼中闪烁着特殊的光芒”，他注意到博格斯眼中闪烁着明显的光芒。他知道 POLOS 团队每周会收到两到三台 Novas，他们需要有人来组装它们，以确保没有机器在到达时出现故障，于是他将博格斯的简历转发给了比尔·英格利什，后者聘请他兼职工作到斯坦福学年结束。博格斯被任命为测试台的管理员，测试台是 34 号楼地下室竖立的一个钢架。它放置着一台功能完好的 Nova，盖子被取下，零件排列得便于取用，以防需要与故障机器的零件互换，以确定哪个零件导致了故障。对实验室的其他人来说，博格斯似乎是地下室巢穴中一个孤独的人物。但当鲍勃·梅特卡夫拖着一捆黄色同轴木材跌跌撞撞地经过时，他却愿意旁听。</p><p class="para">The latter, who was always on the lookout for potential recruits with what he called “special stars in their eyes,” noticed the telltale stellar glow in Boggs’s. Knowing that Novas were starting to arrive at the rate of two or three a week for the POLOS team and that they needed someone to assemble them to make sure nothing was dead on arrival, he forwarded Boggs’s resume to Bill English, who hired him to work part-time through the end of the Stanford school year. Boggs was duly anointed keeper of the test stand, which was a steel rack erected in the basement of Building 34. It held a perfectly functional Nova, the cover removed and the parts arranged to be easily accessible in case they needed to be swapped with those of a balky machine to determine which piece was causing the glitch. To the rest of the lab Boggs seemed rather a solitary figure in his basement lair. But he was available for kibitzing the day Bob Metcalfe stumbled by, hauling his bale of yellow co-ax.</p>
<p class="para">梅特卡夫在一系列备忘录中勾勒出了以太网的轮廓，其中大量信息来自萨克和兰普森——“实时发明网络，逐一解决构想”，博格斯后来回忆道。但在此之前，他从未努力确定这些部分在现实世界中是否能像纸面上那样协同工作。最关键的问题与电缆有关——被动以太本身。梅特卡夫明白，电脉冲在电线上传播时会衰减或拉伸。距离越长，稀释越严重，接收器重新捕获原始数据就越困难。当他和博格斯将测试设备焊接在一起时，他解释说，这就是他需要向电缆发射脉冲并读取另一端输出内容的原因。</p><p class="para">Metcalfe had sketched Ethernet out in a series of memos with a fair amount of input from Thacker and Lampson—“inventing the network in real time, working out bits and pieces of the idea,” as Boggs later recalled. But until then he had made no effort to determine if the parts would work together in the real world as well as they did on paper. The most critical question concerned the cable—the passive ether itself. An electrical pulse, Metcalfe understood, becomes attenuated, or stretched, as it travels along a wire. The longer the distance, the worse the resulting dilution and the more difficult for a receiver to recapture the original data. As he and Boggs soldered the test apparatus together, he explained that this was the reason he needed to fire pulses down the cable and read what came out at the other end.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch13.html.page189"></a>
<p class="para">“我必须知道情况有多糟糕，”他说。</p><p class="para">“I have to know how bad it is,” he said.</p>
<p class="para">那天之后，他们有几个月没有见面，直到一天下午，梅特卡夫再次出现在地下室，这次他手里拿着一小块他设计的硬件，用来将 POLOS Novas 连接到 ARPANET。</p><p class="para">After that day they did not encounter each other for a couple of months, until Metcalfe reappeared in the basement one afternoon, this time holding a small piece of hardware he had designed to connect the POLOS Novas to the ARPANET.</p>
<p class="para">“我能在你的架子上进行烟雾测试吗？”他问博格斯。（这个暗示指的是一个工作方式与字面意思完全相同的程序：向电路中发射一个电压浪涌，以测试是否存在一些隐藏的故障会导致电路突然起火。）</p><p class="para">“Can I smoke test this on your rack?” he asked Boggs. (The allusion was to a procedure that works exactly as it sounds: You shoot a voltage surge through a circuit to test whether some hidden fault will make it burst into flame.)</p>
<p class="para">他们花了一两个星期每天一起测试几个小时的电路。调试复杂的电子设备几乎和在战时在潜艇上服役一样能增进感情，梅特卡夫了解到了很多关于他的搭档的信息：他是一个数字奇才，擅长使用示波器，而且最有趣的是，他在 POLOS 工作中没有得到充分的利用。不久，两人出现在比尔·英格利什的办公室门口，手里拿着画笔和一桶粉刷。“梅特卡夫想让我和他一起做一段时间，”博格斯说。“你同意吗？”</p><p class="para">They spent a week or two testing the circuit together for a few hours each day. Debugging a complex electronic device being almost as powerful a bonding experience as, say, serving on a submarine in wartime, Metcalfe learned a lot about his partner: That he was a digital whiz, accomplished at wielding the oscilloscope, and, most interesting, underemployed in his POLOS work. Presently the pair showed up at Bill English’s office door, figuratively holding paintbrushes and a bucket of whitewash. “Metcalfe wants me to work on something with him for a while,” Boggs said. “Is that okay with you?”</p>
<p class="para">在获得英格利希的默许后，他们沿着走廊走到梅特卡夫的办公室，梅特卡夫在那里整理了一沓厚厚的备忘录，里面是他为施乐专利部门整理的以太网发明记录。“去读一下这个，”他说。</p><p class="para">Having secured English’s acquiescence they walked on down the hall to Metcalfe’s office, where Metcalfe raked together a thick wad of memos comprising the Ethernet invention record he had assembled for Xerox’s patent department. “Go read this,” he said.</p>
<p class="para">“那次，”博格斯回忆道，“几乎是 SSL 最后一次让我工作了。在接下来的十二个月里，我至少每天都和梅特卡夫在一起。”</p><p class="para">“That,” Boggs recalled, “was pretty much the last time SSL got any work out of me. For the next twelve months at least I spent every working day with Metcalfe.”</p>
<p class="para">他们累了就睡觉，其余时间都在工作，就像赌场玩家一样，对闹钟和太阳毫不在意。“以太网板上没有我们不知道的芯片，”梅特卡夫回忆道。“我的微代码中没有一行博格斯不懂。我们一起研究整个事情，分分秒秒，一丝不苟。”博格斯在暑假被全职录用，甚至在学年恢复后仍留在公司，暂停了斯坦福大学的博士学位学习。他又花了九年时间才完成博士学位。</p><p class="para">They slept when they were exhausted and the rest of the time they worked, as unconscious of alarm clocks or the sun as casino players on a roll. “There was no chip on the Ethernet board that both of us didn’t know about,” Metcalfe recalled. “There was no line of my microcode that Boggs did not understand. We worked on the whole thing together, every minute, every piece of it.” Boggs was placed on the payroll full-time for the summer and stayed even after the school year resumed, placing his Stanford Ph.D. studies on hold. He did not finish his doctorate for another nine years.</p>
<p class="para">相比之下，梅特卡夫则将自己的博士论文重新提交给了哈佛大学，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch13.html.page190"></a>用一篇关于 ALOHAnet 的理论题外话来充实自己。1973 年 6 月，他的论文《分组通信》终于被接受了（他后来抱怨说“没有热情”）。</p><p class="para">Metcalfe, by contrast, resubmitted his doctoral dissertation to Harvard, <a></a>fattened up with a properly theoretical digression covering the ALOHAnet. In June 1973 his thesis, entitled “Packet Communication,” was finally accepted (“without enthusiasm,” he later groused).</p>
<p class="para">以太网作为一个工作系统，在一个关键细节上不同于 PARC 的其他发明：它被明确设计为不完美。梅特卡夫将网络称为“尽力而为”系统，也就是说，计算机被指示不要依赖一切完美运行。这确保了系统不会因为出现一个小故障（甚至是大量数据）而崩溃，而这种情况肯定会出现在容易出错的实验计算机网络中。“我喜欢它，”凯说，它是最早的粉丝之一。“它是有史以来最伟大的技巧之一，当你不知道如何让某样东西运转良好时，它就是一个实例，教会你如何让某样东西运转起来。”</p><p class="para">As a working system Ethernet differed from other PARC inventions in one crucial detail: It was explicitly designed to be imperfect. Metcalfe labeled the network a “best efforts” system—that is, the computers were instructed not to rely on everything working perfectly. This ensured that the system would not crash in the event of a single minor glitch (or even a torrent), of the sort certain to crop up in a network of bug-prone experimental computers. “I loved it,” said Kay, one of its earliest fans. “It was one of the great finesses of all time, an object lesson in how to make something work when you don’t know how to make it work well.”</p>
<p class="para">以太网的基本流程类似于在拥挤的图书馆里用最有效但最粗暴的方法引起某人的注意：大喊。以太网（即连接 Altos 的同轴电缆）通常是无声的。当一台机器准备发送消息时，它会向以太网发送一个唤醒位，提醒其他所有机器即将发生某事。然后，它发送一个数据包，该数据包连续包含一个八位目标地址（消息要发送到的 Alto 的数字标签）、它自己的地址、消息本身以及一串称为“校验和”的验证位。接收站将检查目标地址以查看该消息是否是发给他们的。如果是，它们会将整个数据包复制到内存中；如果不是，则返回睡眠状态。</p><p class="para">Ethernet’s basic procedure resembled getting somebody’s attention in a crowded library by the most efficient, if crude, method: by shouting. The ether—that is, the coaxial cable connecting the Altos—was usually silent. When a machine was ready to transmit a message, it shot a wakeup bit onto the ether, alerting every other machine that something was about to happen. Then it sent a packet comprising, consecutively, an eight-bit destination address (the digital tag of the Alto for which the message was intended); its own address; the message itself; and a string of verification bits known as a “checksum.” Receiving stations would check the destination address to see if the message was intended for them. If so, they would copy the whole packet into memory; if not, back to sleep.</p>
<p class="para">与此同时，发送站会监听其数据包是否与其他机器的数据包发生冲突。如果检测到干扰，它会立即停止发送，计算一个随机延迟（冲突消息的发送者也会这样做），然后再次发送。监听和重发过程可以重复多达 15 次，直到机器放弃。</p><p class="para">Meanwhile, the transmitting station would listen for any sign that its packet had collided with another machine’s. If it detected interference, it would instantly stop sending, count off a random delay (as would the transmitter of the conflicting message), and send again. The listen-and-retransmit process could be repeated as many as fifteen times before the machines would give up.</p>
<p class="para">与 Thacker 一样，Metcalfe 也是“大而化之”的反对者，他将系统精简到只剩基本部件，在 Alto 设计分配给以太网的一块电路板上实现了这些复杂的电子元件。最初的以太网电路板甚至没有自己的计时器，而是依靠 Alto 的内部时钟来完成同步传输这一关键任务。</p><p class="para">As much an enemy of “biggerism” as Thacker, Metcalfe implemented these complicated electronics on the single circuit board the Alto design allotted to Ethernet by stripping the system down to its bare essentials. The original Ethernet board did not even have a timer of its own, relying instead on the Alto’s internal clock for the critical duty of synchronizing transmissions.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch13.html.page191"></a>
<p class="para">然而，在设计阶段即将结束时，博格斯坚持要添加一项他认为至关重要的功能。这就是“校验和”，这是一种比特序列，它可以让接收站验证信息在传输过程中没有被巧妙地篡改。</p><p class="para">Toward the end of the design phase, however, Boggs insisted on adding one feature he deemed crucial. This was the “checksum,” a bit sequence that would enable the receiving station to verify that a message had not been subtly garbled in transmission.</p>
<p class="para">“当然可以，大卫，”梅特卡夫说，“如果你能在电路板上找到空间来安装校验和逻辑，你就可以把它加进去。”</p><p class="para">“Sure, David,” Metcalfe said. “If you can find room on the board to fit the checksum logic, you can add it.”</p>
<p class="para">这让博格斯觉得有点愤世嫉俗。一个校验和系统至少需要八个集成电路或芯片。他们使用的电路板上有 60 个芯片位置，其中 59 个已经被占用。然后他注意到边缘处只剩下足够的空间可以再塞入几个芯片。等他完成时，几乎没有一毫米的空闲空间。一些芯片实际上挂在电路板边缘，就像难民紧紧抓住挤满人的救生艇一样。但以太网还是得到了校验和。</p><p class="para">This struck Boggs as a little cynical. A checksum system would require at least eight integrated circuits, or chips. Of the sixty chip positions on the boards they were using, fifty-nine were already occupied. Then he noticed that just enough space remained around the margins to wedge in a few more chips. By the time he was done there was scarcely a millimeter of unused room. Some chips literally hung off the edge of the board, like refugees clinging to a packed lifeboat. But Ethernet got its checksum.</p>
<p class="para">由此，梅特卡夫和博格斯的发明被证明如他们所希望的那样简单易用。在系统中添加新机器或“节点”而不中断服务哪怕是一瞬间，都是小菜一碟：在主同轴电缆上打一个小孔，使用一种称为“杰罗德分接头”的简单有线电视硬件，将分支电缆的针状末端插入其中。（这一策略是由 POLOS 工程师、梅特卡夫的篮球好友大卫·利德尔提出的，他对杰罗德分接头的熟悉可以追溯到他大学时担任有线电视安装工的工作。）事实证明，该网络几乎可以无限扩展，同时又保持了非常简单，只不过是一根两端都有终端的电缆，任何人都可以像接水管一样轻松地接入。</p><p class="para">With that, Metcalfe and Boggs’s invention proved as facile and forgiving as they had hoped. Adding new machines, or “nodes,” to the system without interrupting service for even a split second was a cinch: One punched a tiny hole in the main co-ax and, using a simple piece of cable TV hardware called a “Jerrold tap,” plugged the needle-like end of a branch cable into it. (This stratagem was suggested by David Liddle, a POLOS engineer and a basketball-playing crony of Metcalfe’s, whose familiarity with Jerrold taps dated from his college job as a cable TV installer.) The network proved almost infinitely expandable while remaining emphatically simple, not much more than a cable terminated at both ends that anyone could tap into as easily as a water line.</p>
<p class="para">然而，Alto 的第一批用户却迟迟没有加入以太网的潮流，这让他们很为难。由于网络连接是第一批机器上一项昂贵的 500 美元预算选项，许多 PARC 工程师选择完全放弃它。这种情况尤其如此，因为网络似乎主要用于在计算机之间发送文件——这是一个多余的功能，因为 Altos 配备了可移动磁盘，可以轻松地从一台机器传输到另一台机器。“从一开始，以太网就面临着‘sneakernet’的竞争，”Metcalfe 回忆道。</p><p class="para">Yet the Alto’s first users were disconcertingly slow to get on the Ethernet bandwagon. Because the network connection was a costly $500 budget option on the first machines, many PARC engineers chose to dispense with it altogether. This was especially true as long as the network appeared to be useful mainly for sending files between computers—a superfluous function, since the Altos were equipped with removable disks that could easily be transferred from one machine to another. “Ethernet was up against ‘sneakernet’ from the very start,” Metcalfe recalled.</p>
<p class="para">1975 年，斯塔克韦瑟的激光打印机 SLOT 的出现让这一切一夜之间发生了改变。以太网、Alto、研究字符生成器和<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch13.html.page192"></a>SLOT 的强大令人无法忽视。现在，人们可以撰写备忘录、信件、文章或论文，只需按一下按钮，即可看到以专业质量的字体打印出来。（“在此之前，你必须让文章被接受出版，才能看到你的文字如此精美地呈现，”利德尔后来尖刻地评论道。“现在，即使它完全是垃圾，看起来仍然很漂亮。”）</p><p class="para">All that changed overnight in 1975 with the advent of SLOT, Starkweather’s laser printer. The virtues of the combined system called “EARS”—the Ethernet, the Alto, the research character generator, and <a></a>SLOT—were too powerful to ignore. One could now write a memo, letter, article, or dissertation and with the push of a button see it printed in professional-quality type. (“Before that, you had to have an article accepted for publication to see your words rendered so beautifully,” Liddle mordantly observed much later. “Now it could be complete rubbish, and still look beautiful.”)</p>
<p class="para">直到 EARS 推出后不久的一天，梅特卡夫本人才意识到，他的后代已经成为 PARC 生活方式中不可或缺的一部分。在意外移除一块硬件导致以太网瘫痪后，他发现“我的同事一个接一个地跳出来，想知道网络为什么瘫痪了。”显然，Sneakernet 已经死了。</p><p class="para">Metcalfe himself did not realize the extent to which his offspring had become a indispensable part of PARC’s lifestyle until one day shortly after EARS was launched. After accidentally disabling the ether by removing a piece of hardware he noticed “one after another of my colleagues popping up, wondering why the network was down.” Sneakernet, obviously, was dead.</p>
<p class="para">同年还发生了两件重要的事情。3 月 31 日，梅特卡夫以自己的名义以及博格斯、萨克和兰普森的名义申请了以太网专利，这三人都为该技术做出了关键贡献。两年后，该专利被授予（并分配给了施乐）。</p><p class="para">Two more important events happened that same year. On March 31 Metcalfe filed for a patent on Ethernet in his own name and those of Boggs, Thacker, and Lampson, each of whom had contributed a critical element of the technology. It was awarded (and assigned to Xerox) two years later.</p>
<p class="para">第二，他辞职了。梅特卡夫在 PARC 工作了三年，这和他预期的差不多。行业猎头不断给他打电话。“我考虑过离开，也考虑过留下来，”他回忆道。在做出决定之前，他与顶头上司杰瑞·艾尔金德 (Jerry Elkind) 坐下来谈了谈。</p><p class="para">Second, he resigned. Metcalfe had worked at PARC for three years, about as long as he had expected to. Industry headhunters were calling. “I was contemplating moving on and I was also contemplating staying,” he recalled. Before deciding he sat down with his immediate boss, Jerry Elkind.</p>
<p class="para">“什么原因让你留下来？”艾尔金德问道。</p><p class="para">“What would make you stay?” Elkind asked.</p>
<p class="para">“我说，‘好吧，杰瑞，如果我留下来，我需要多长时间才能得到你的工作？’”梅特卡夫回忆道。“艾尔金德想了想。他说，‘好吧，你先是研究人员，然后你会成为研究人员的高级成员，然后你会成为研究人员的顾问成员’……基本上，比我大二十岁的杰瑞·艾尔金德说我需要大约二十年才能得到他的工作。我告诉他这不是我想要的。”</p><p class="para">“I said, ‘Well, Jerry, if I did stay, how long would it take me to get your job?’” Metcalfe recollected. “Elkind thought about it. He said, ‘Well, gee, you’re a member of the research staff, and then you’ll be a senior member of the research staff, and then you’ll become a consulting member of the research staff’…And basically Jerry Elkind, who was twenty years older than me, said it would take me about twenty years to get his job. I told him that wasn’t what I had in mind.”</p>
<p class="para">无论如何，这个决定已经强加在他身上。他结婚七年的妻子提出离婚。与此同时，花旗银行向他提供了一份在洛杉矶的工作，该银行正计划将其老化的电子资金转账系统重新部署到新电脑上。“所以在花旗银行有这份工作，我可以得到 30% 的加薪和一间可以看到风景的办公室<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch13.html.page193"></a>卡塔利娜岛和洛杉矶的生活机会，当时洛杉矶很有吸引力。所以我离开了。”</p><p class="para">Anyway, the decision had already been forced upon him. His wife of seven years asked for a divorce. Simultaneously he was offered a job in Los Angeles by Citibank, which was planning to redeploy its aging electronic fund transfer system onto new computers. “So here’s this job at Citibank where I’m to get a thirty percent raise and an office with a view <a></a>of Catalina Island and a chance to live in L.A., which was appealing at the time. So I bolted.”</p>
<p class="para">梅特卡夫的离职让 PARC 员工们大为震惊，犹如圣安德烈亚斯断层上的一次地震。这不仅是因为他是 PARC 成立五年来第一位离开的顶尖计算机科学家。更重要的是，他的辞职首次暗示，虽然他们埋头于卡米洛特的研究，但外面已经出现了一个全新的世界——它将欢迎他们和他们的知识。</p><p class="para">Metcalfe’s departure rattled the PARC staff like a tremor on the San Andreas fault. This was not only because he was the first top computer scientist to quit PARC since its founding five years earlier. More important, his resignation provided the first hint that while they had buried themselves in their research Camelot, a whole new world had sprung up outside—and that it would welcome them and their knowledge.</p>
<p class="para">他们不知道的是，很快梅特卡夫就会回来。</p><p class="para">What they could not know was that in a very short time Metcalfe would be back.</p>

<p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">这</span></span>是一个关于三张黄纸和三个不合群的人如何催生一个产业的故事。</p><p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">T</span></span>his is the story of how three sheets of lined yellow paper and three misfits spawned an industry.</p>
<p class="para">这个行业就是桌面出版，它使今天数百万普通人能够像专业人士一样出版通讯、杂志和书籍；并使数百万专业人士——作家、编辑和出版商——能够更快、更轻松地完成更为复杂的工作。</p><p class="para">The industry is desktop publishing, which today allows millions of ordinary persons to turn out newsletters, magazines, and books as though they were professionals; and allows millions of professionals—writers, editors, and publishers—to do their even more sophisticated work faster and easier.</p>
<p class="para">这三张黄纸属于巴特勒·兰普森。上面写满了他用工整、棱角分明的笔迹写下的函数和算法，这是他为 Alto 设计文本编辑器（也可以称之为文字处理程序）的初衷，当时 Alto 还没有这样的程序。</p><p class="para">The three sheets of yellow paper belonged to Butler Lampson. Covered with functions and algorithms written in his neat, angular hand, they represented his first pass at designing a text editor—a word processing program, if you will—for the Alto, which at that point did not have one.</p>
<p class="para">这三个格格不入的人分别是查尔斯·西蒙尼（Charles Simonyi），他有一天偶然看到了兰普森的涂鸦，并询问了它们的含义；还有拉里·特斯勒（Larry Tesler）和蒂姆·莫特（Tim Mott），他们被指派帮助施乐公司的教科书子公司找到一种方法，使编辑和重写手稿比砌砖更不乏味、更省时。</p><p class="para">The three misfits were Charles Simonyi, who one day happened upon Lampson’s scribbles and asked what they meant; and Larry Tesler and Tim Mott, who had been assigned to help Xerox’s textbook subsidiary find a way to make the editing and rewriting of manuscripts somewhat less tedious and time-consuming than the laying of bricks.</p>
<p class="para">他们共同实现了兰普森后来所说的“PARC 历史上最成功的合作之一”（PARC 历史上充满了令人惊叹的合作）。这三人为 Alto 带来了“杀手锏”<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch14.html.page195"></a>这个程序将其独特的优点深深地刻在了人们的脑海中，同时也首次向 PARC 以外的专业人士展示了个人电脑如何改善他们的生活。</p><p class="para">Together they achieved what Lampson later termed “one of the most successful collaborations in the history of PARC” (and that is a history rife with spectacular partnerships). The trio gave the Alto its “killer <a></a>app”—the application that burned its unique virtues indelibly into people’s minds—as well as the program that first showed professionals outside PARC how the personal computer might improve their lives.</p>
<p class="para">这些程序被称为 Bravo 和 Gypsy。它们的开发耗时三年多，从西蒙尼伸手去拿兰普森的三本黄页说“我能看看吗？”开始。</p><p class="para">These programs were called Bravo and Gypsy. Their development consumed more than three years, starting with the moment when Simonyi reached out his hand for Lampson’s three yellow pages and said, “Can I take a look?”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">西蒙尼有着一头棕色的直发和深邃的蓝眼睛，仿佛直接从雅克·路易·大卫的拿破仑青年肖像中走出来。两人的相似之处还不止于此。和拿破仑一样，西蒙尼年轻时也很少缺乏自信，他会告诉长辈们他们哪里错了，而自己哪里是对的。他们也都是以局外人的身份出名的：拿破仑从崎岖的地中海科西嘉岛来到法国革命军，而西蒙尼则从 20 世纪 60 年代的社会主义地狱匈牙利来到美国。</p><p class="para">With his mop of straight brown hair and his deep-set blue eyes, Simonyi might have stepped directly out of a Jacques-Louis David portrait of the young Napoleon. The similarity did not end there. Like Napoleon, Simonyi was a young man who rarely lacked the self-assurance to tell his elders where they were wrong and he was right. They also both came to prominence as outsiders: As Napoleon had come to the French revolutionary army from the rugged Mediterranean island of Corsica, Simonyi had crossed to the United States from the socialist hell of 1960s Hungary.</p>
<p class="para">西蒙尼是布达佩斯一位电气工程教授的长子，他第一次接触计算机是在 15 岁的时候。这是一台苏联制造的机器，名叫乌拉尔二号。乌拉尔是全国五台计算机之一，也是一台独一无二的时光机。“这台计算机上的所有操作都是通过控制台控制的——这真的是一种亲自动手的一对一体验，”西蒙尼回忆道。“它就像 15 年后的个人电脑一样，因为只有你和这台机器，没有其他人。”</p><p class="para">The elder son of a Budapest professor of electrical engineering, Simonyi had first encountered a computer at the age of fifteen. This was a Soviet-made contraption called the Ural II. The Ural was one of five computers in the whole country and a time machine of a unique variety. “All the action on this computer was directed through the console—it was truly a hands-on, one-on-one experience,” Simonyi recalled. “It was exactly like the personal computer of fifteen years later, because it was just you and the machine and no one else.”</p>
<p class="para">乌拉尔计算机可能是 20 世纪 50 年代和 60 年代每部科幻电影中计算机的原型。它有一间大房间那么大，由数千个发出诡异橙色光芒的真空管驱动。操作员的控制台就像老式收银机的键盘——六列编号开关和右侧的<span class="smallCaps">ENTER</span>键，全部由一个带有大量苏联元素的机制操作。“这一切都非常令人兴奋，因为它伴随着很多噪音，”西蒙尼回忆道。“每次我按下开关，它都会发出非常有力的咔嗒声。每当我清除它时，所有的键都会同时释放，发出巨大的‘<span class="italic">砰！</span> ’”</p><p class="para">The Ural could have been the model for the computer in every science fiction film of the 1950s and 1960s. The size of a large room, it was driven by thousands of vacuum tubes glowing with an eerie orange light. The operator’s console was like the keyboard of an old-fashioned cash register—six columns of numbered switches and an <span class="smallCaps">ENTER</span> key on the right, all operated by a mechanism with substantial Soviet heft. “All this was very exhilarating because there was a lot of noise associated with it,” Simonyi recalled. “Every time I hit the switch it clicked very firmly. Whenever I cleared it, all the keys released at once with a great ‘<span class="italic">Thunk!</span>’”</p>
<p class="para">乌拉尔位于布达佩斯的一所工程学院，它<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch14.html.page196"></a>每次打开它时，他都会吹灭至少一个管子，这会让操作员非常头疼。唯一的补救办法就是永远不要关掉它，这意味着在每个人都回家后，要雇一个人整晚照看这个庞然大物。通过父亲，西蒙尼为自己谋得了这份工作。在大学教员导师的帮助下，以及无数个可以全职进行实验的空闲夜晚，他很快自学了八进制编程的所有知识，乌拉尔就是基于​​八进制编程的。他的第一个程序是设计来填充“魔方”，即所有列和行加起来等于相同数字的巨大数字网格。多年后，他仍然记得自己会花几个小时按下机器上的按钮来创建八十个单元格宽、八十个单元格深的魔方，然后第二天早上回到家时“头痛欲裂，手里拿着一大卷纸打印出来。”</p><p class="para">Housed at a Budapest engineering institute, the Ural bedeviled its <a></a>operators by blowing out at least one tube every time it was switched on. The only remedy was never to turn it off, which meant hiring someone to babysit the behemoth all night after everyone went home. Through his father, Simonyi wangled the job for himself. With the help of a mentor on the university faculty and the endless, empty nights available for full-time experimentation, he soon taught himself all there was to know about programming in Octal, the base-8 system on which the Ural was programmed. His first programs were designed to fill in “magic squares,” giant grids of numbers in which all the columns and rows add up to the same sum. Years later he could still remember how he would spend hours punching buttons on the machine to create magic squares eighty cells wide by eighty cells deep, then arrive home in the morning “with an incredible headache and giant rolls of paper printouts.”</p>
<p class="para">大约一年后，他在布达佩斯贸易博览会上遇到的一位丹麦计算机技术员给他提供了一份工作。西蒙尼当时十六岁。他之所以无法获得临时通行证离开匈牙利，是因为匈牙利军方急需征兵。“我和他们说，我未成年，所以他们不能征召我，如果你在上大学，你可以延期服役。所以我考上了大学，并告诉他们，如果你们不让我去丹麦，我就去上大学，你们不会收留我。如果你们让我走，我一年后回来，然后<span class="italic">你们</span>就会收留我。”</p><p class="para">After about a year a Danish computer technician he met at a Budapest trade fair offered him a job. Simonyi was sixteen. All that prevented him from leaving the country on a temporary pass was the Hungarian military’s craving for draftees. “The way I went around them was that I was underage, so they couldn’t draft me, and if you were in college you got a deferment. So I got myself admitted to the university and told them if you don’t let me go to Denmark I’ll go to university and you won’t get me. If you let me go, I’m coming back in one year, and <span class="italic">then</span> you’ll have me.”</p>
<p class="para">当然，他绝对不会回去。那是 1966 年。匈牙利各地对 1956 年失败革命的记忆仍然历历在目。“我到丹麦时，有一件事让我震惊，”他回忆道，“那就是房子上没有弹孔。”回到家后，他的父亲因儿子叛逃而失去了工作。“但他本来就有很多政治问题，所以这件事只是雪上加霜。此外，这也是经过深思熟虑的——要么我的生活不幸福，要么他又会遇到一个政治问题。我的父母同意了。我爸爸实际上是在逼我去的。”</p><p class="para">Of course there was no question of his going back. This was 1966. Everywhere in Hungary memories of the aborted revolution of 1956 were still painfully fresh. “One thing that shocked me when I got to Denmark,” he recollected, “was that the houses didn’t have bullet holes in them.” Back home his father lost his job in retaliation for his son’s defection. “But he had a lot of political problems anyway, so this was just on top of it. Plus it was calculated in—either that I would have an unhappy life or he would have one more political problem. My parents agreed. My dad was practically pushing me to go.”</p>
<p class="para">大约一年半后，西蒙尼离开丹麦前往美国。由于他国内的情况被认为还不足以获得政治地位，他持学生签证抵达美国，但这种签证不允许他就业。“所以我告诉当局，由于特殊情况，我必须工作。特殊情况<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch14.html.page197"></a>“当时的情况是我快没钱了。”他在伯克利计算机公司找到了一份工作，在那里他遇到了萨克、兰普森和泰勒三驾马车，并度过了一生中唯一的一次公司破产。</p><p class="para">About a year and a half later Simonyi left Denmark for the United States. Because his situation at home was deemed not to have been perilous enough to warrant political status, he arrived on a student visa, which prohibited employment. “So I told the authorities that due to extraordinary circumstances I had to take up work. The extraordinary <a></a>circumstances were that I was running out of money.” The job he found was at Berkeley Computer, where he encountered the troika of Thacker, Lampson, and Taylor and survived the one and only corporate bankruptcy of his life.</p>
<p class="para">BCC 倒闭后，西蒙尼跟随梅尔·皮尔特尔开始了下一份工作，即监督艾姆斯研究中心（位于帕洛阿尔托南部的 NASA 设施）根据 ARPA 合同建造 Illiac IV。Illiac 是一个庞大的、设计过度的大型系统，有人称其为第一台超级计算机，另一些人称其为计算机的越南。（尽管花费了数百万美元，但它从未完全投入使用。）西蒙尼倾向于后一种观点，这并不是说他认为这个程序完全没有价值。除了它教会他关于计算机架构的知识外，作为一个政府项目，Illiac 曾一度使他免于被永久驱逐出美国。这件事发生在 1 月，当时他离开美国几天，前往西德——这是他七八年来第一次有机会见到正在汉堡做演讲的父亲。兴奋之余，他不仅忘记了外套，还忘记了学生签证持有人一旦离开美国，就必须重新申请回国许可的规定。</p><p class="para">Following BCC’s collapse, Simonyi had tagged along with Mel Pirtle to his next job, which was to supervise the building of the Illiac IV on an ARPA contract at Ames Research Center, a NASA facility just south of Palo Alto. Illiac was a vast, overdesigned attempt at a large-scale system that some called the first supercomputer and others called computing’s Vietnam. (It never became fully functional, despite the expenditure of millions of dollars.) Simonyi tended toward the latter view, which is not to say he found the program entirely worthless. Aside from what it taught him about computer architecture, as a government program Illiac at one point saved him from being permanently evicted from the United States. This occurred when he left the country for a couple of days one January to visit West Germany—his first chance in seven or eight years to see his father, who was giving a lecture in Hamburg. In his excitement he overlooked not only his overcoat but the rule that once the holder of a student visa leaves the country he must reapply for permission to come back.</p>
<p class="para">“所以周五晚上四点我去了大使馆，说：‘嘿，我的飞机一小时后起飞，你能给我签证吗？’他们看了我一眼就说不行。我马上打电话给皮尔特尔，事情就开始有了进展。他们周六开门办事，就是为了给我签证。”</p><p class="para">“So Friday evening at four o’clock I went to the embassy to say, ‘Hey, my plane’s leaving in one hour, would you please give me a visa.’ They took one look at me and said no. I called Pirtle right away and the wheels started to turn. They opened the embassy on Saturday, just to give me the visa stamp.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">自从第一次体验到 Ural 的劳动密集型工作后，西蒙尼就对编程艺术着迷了。到 1972 年，当他重新加入 PARC 的 BCC 同事时，他想出了一种不那么费力的方法，他称之为“元编程”，并以此作为斯坦福博士论文的主题。元编程涉及团队领导使用高度抽象的语言为程序起草详细蓝图，并将其交给助手进行软件的实际编码。正如西蒙尼以其特有的直率所描述的那样，这个想法是通过给予每个人更多时间，从而提高每个人的生产力。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch14.html.page198"></a>最聪明的程序员可以自由地进行粗略思考，而几个超负荷工作的助手则将他的想法简化为机器可以理解的代码。本质上，西蒙尼是在对程序员进行编程。</p><p class="para">Ever since his first labor-intensive experience with the Ural, Simonyi had been fascinated by the art of programming. By 1972, when he rejoined his BCC mates at PARC, he had come up with a less trying methodology, which he labeled “meta-programming” and made the topic of his Stanford doctoral thesis. Meta-programming involved a team leader’s drafting a detailed blueprint for a program using a highly abstract language, and handing this over to assistants for the actual coding of the software. The idea, as Simonyi described it with his characteristic bluntness, was to improve everybody’s productivity by giving <a></a>the smartest programmer the freedom to think in broad strokes while a couple of overworked assistants reduced his ideas to code that the machine could understand. In essence, Simonyi was programming the programmers.</p>
<p class="para">他的第一个实验是聘请两名斯坦福大学本科生担任这些智力奴仆，他称其为阿尔法。就在他准备进行第二个实验的时候，他发现自己在兰普森的办公室里，研究着那三页淡黄色的纸张。</p><p class="para">His first experiment in the process, which involved hiring two undergraduates from Stanford as these intellectual menials, he called Alpha. Around the time he was ready to conduct a second experiment, he found himself in Lampson’s office, studying the three canary-colored pages.</p>
<p class="para">“这是什么？”他问。</p><p class="para">“What is this?” he asked.</p>
<p class="para">“我们需要一个适用于 Alto 的文本编辑器，”兰普森回答道。“没人在做这个，所以我想先做。”</p><p class="para">“We need a text editor for the Alto,” Lampson replied. “Nobody’s working on it, so I thought I’d start.”</p>
<p class="para">兰普森的话有点不诚实。Alto 不只是需要一个文本编辑器——它需要<span class="italic">一切</span>。这台机器问世已有近一年，很明显，Cookie Monster 的新鲜感已经开始消退。“有些人并没有真正看到 Alto 的潜力，”兰普森后来回忆道。“我们试图吸引更多人使用它，因为显然没有软件，这个东西就毫无用处。在它问世后的头一年左右，它并不十分有趣，因为它没有非常有趣的软件。”黄页是兰普森启动这一进程的方式。</p><p class="para">Lampson was being slightly disingenuous. The Alto did not just need a text editor—it needed <span class="italic">everything</span>. The machine had been around for nearly a year and, quite clearly, the novelty of Cookie Monster had begun to wear off. “Some people didn’t really see the potential of Alto,” Lampson recalled later. “We were trying to draw more people into it, because obviously the thing is useless without software. For the first year or so after it existed it wasn’t very interesting because it didn’t have very interesting software.” The yellow sheets were Lampson’s way of jump-starting the process.</p>
<p class="para">西蒙尼非常好奇，他仔细研究了兰普森的公式。他自认为是一名伟大的程序员，他确实是，因为他在有史以来最顽固的计算机上学会了这门艺术。但他也意识到，正如他后来所说，“成为一名伟大的程序员是不够的；你必须找到一个伟大的问题。”</p><p class="para">Highly intrigued, Simonyi ran his eyes over Lampson’s formulas. He fancied himself a great programmer, which he was, having learned the art on one of the most recalcitrant computers ever built. But he was also aware, as he said later, that “it’s not enough to be a great programmer; you have to find a great problem.”</p>
<p class="para">这看上去是个难题。在图形屏幕上编辑文本乍一看似乎很容易，但其实隐藏着许多困难和未开发的潜力。</p><p class="para">This looked like such a problem. Editing text on a graphical screen seemed easy at first glance, but it was rife with hidden difficulties and unexplored potential.</p>
<p class="para">“我以为我们正处于范式转变的边缘，”他后来说。“我可以看到整本书在你面前流动，虚拟书籍和一切。回想起来，这似乎很明显。嗯，对任何人来说都不是显而易见的。这些东西在当时是未来的。但我突然意识到，随着施乐和这台机器的结合，文字处理将成为一个关键的应用。我接受了它并决定实现它，因为它看起来很棒。”因为这将是第二次实验<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch14.html.page199"></a>西蒙尼为其博士学位所进行的博士研究在字母表中向下移动了一位，并将其命名为 Bravo。</p><p class="para">“I thought we were on the cusp of a paradigm shift,” he said later. “I could see books in their entirety flowing in front of you, virtual books and everything. In retrospect it seems so obvious. Uh-uh, it wasn’t obvious to anyone. This stuff was in the future then. But it was suddenly clear to me that with the combination of Xerox and this machine, word processing was going to be a key application. I took it and decided to make it happen, because it looked very sweet.” Since it would be the second experiment <a></a>undertaken for his doctorate Simonyi moved one step down in the alphabet, and called it Bravo.</p>
<p class="para">除了提供三张黄页外，兰普森对 Bravo 制作的贡献还体现了他同时在数十个 PARC 项目中撒网的影响力。他为志同道合的合作者概述了该计划的基本构建模块，然后让西蒙尼完成大部分繁重的工作，但他留下来做他的向导、导师和倾听者——仿佛在实施他自己更高级的元编程形式。</p><p class="para">Beyond supplying his three yellow sheets, Lampson’s contribution to the making of Bravo exemplified his way of casting his influential net over dozens of PARC projects simultaneously. Having outlined the program’s basic building blocks for a like-minded collaborator, he let Simonyi do most of the heavy work, but stuck around to be his guide, mentor, and sounding board—as though implementing his own even more elevated form of meta-programming.</p>
<p class="para">“巴特勒的贡献在于意志，”西蒙尼后来说，“而我的贡献在于我同意他的观点。我当然会和他讨论所有事情。我是推动这件事的积极分子，我通过向他提问来推动这件事。”</p><p class="para">“What Butler contributed was the will,” Simonyi said later, “and what I contributed was that I agreed with him. I certainly discussed everything with him. I was the active person driving it and I drove it by asking him questions.”</p>
<p class="para">兰普森的基本思想之一是利用“片段表”将整篇文档高效地保存在内存中的关键算法。这些算法最初是由一位名叫杰伊·摩尔的程序员开发的。片段表算法不是将文本中的每个字母或字符视为内存中的单独位，而是将文档视为文本块（或“片段”）的排列。在文档中间插入一个句子会将文件从一个片段转换为三个片段，分别称为 A、B 和 C，分别对应于插入的片段以及其前后的块。这些片段不必在内存中连续，因为它们在屏幕上是连续的；计算机只需记住一张地图（片段表），这样它就可以在数据存储中找到所有片段，并按照正确的顺序将它们组合起来以供显示或打印。</p><p class="para">Among Lampson’s fundamental ideas was a critical algorithm for holding an entire document efficiently in memory through the use of “piece tables.” These had been first developed by a programmer named Jay Moore. Instead of treating each letter or character in a text as an individual bit in memory, the piece table algorithm viewed a document as an arrangement of text blocks (or “pieces”). Inserting a sentence in the middle of a document converted the file from one piece to three—call them A, B, and C, corresponding to the insert and the blocks preceding and following it. These did not have to be contiguous in memory, as they were on the screen; it was only necessary for the computer to memorize a map—the piece table—that would allow it to find all the pieces in data storage and assemble them in the proper order for display or printing.</p>
<p class="para">显然，将文档文件分成几个大块比处理每个字符都必须单独操作的文档文件要容易得多，就像将一打鸡蛋放在一个盒子里带回家比将它们一个个抱在怀里要容易得多一样。结果就是大大节省了计算资源。即使作者想做一些激进的事情，比如调换文档的开头和结尾，这些部分也会保持原样。只有部分表发生了变化，因此系统会知道从今以后这些部分不能读作 ABC，而是读作 CBA。</p><p class="para">It is self-evidently easier to handle a document file divided into a few large pieces than one in which every character has to be manipulated individually, just as it is easier to carry a dozen eggs home in one box than to cradle them individually in one’s arms. The result was a tremendous savings in computing resources. Even if the writer wanted to do something drastic like transpose the end and beginning of the document, the pieces stayed where they were. Only the piece table changed, so the system would know that the pieces henceforth had to be read not as A-B-C, but as C-B-A.</p>
<p class="para">最小化内存中的比特移动允许用户<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch14.html.page200"></a>创建更复杂的文档 — 只要是固定的，为什么不让它更重一点呢？在改进和增强 Bravo 的过程中，西蒙尼想出了如何对花哨的字体、奇数页边距和页码等特征进行编码。最终，他对 Bravo 进行了改进，使其能够在 Alto 的位图屏幕上几乎与打印出来的文档完全一样地再现文档。用户可以看到显示的下划线、粗体、斜体和各种样式和大小的字体 — 这一功能因喜剧演员 Flip Wilson 饰演的俏皮角色 Geraldine 的标志性短语而广为人知：“所见即所得”，或 WYSIWYG，发音为“wizzy-wig”。</p><p class="para">Minimizing the movement of bits within memory allowed users to <a></a>create more complex documents—as long as a piece would be stationary, why not make it heavier, so to speak? As he refined and enhanced Bravo, Simonyi figured out how to encode such characteristics as fancy typefaces, odd margins, and page numbers. Eventually he had Bravo polished to the point that it could reproduce a document on the Alto’s bitmapped screen almost exactly as it would appear printed out. The user could see displayed underlining, boldface, italics, and fonts of various styles and sizes—a capability that became known by the signature phrase of the comedian Flip Wilson’s sassy character Geraldine: “What You See Is What You Get,” or WYSIWYG, pronounced “wizzy-wig.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">Simonyi 的预测是正确的，没有什么比强大而灵活的文字处理程序更能凸显 Alto 的独特优势。Bravo 是个人电脑的万能答案：它放大了每个用户的生产力和创造力。</p><p class="para">Simonyi was right in predicting that nothing would underscore the Alto’s unique virtues like a powerful and flexible word processing program. Bravo was the all-purpose answer to the question of what a personal computer did: It magnified the productivity and creativity of every user.</p>
<p class="para">“毫无疑问，这是杀手级应用，”西蒙尼回忆道。“人们会在晚上来到 PARC 写各种东西，寄信、处理所有私人信件、家长会报告、愚蠢的小通讯，什么都做。如果你四处看看 Altos 在做什么，你会发现它们都在 Bravo。”能够使用 Altos 的 PARC 人员发现它们在外面的人气飙升。正在写博士论文的朋友会请求允许进来将他们的工作输入系统。然后他们会按下按钮，从激光机上获得精美的打印副本。</p><p class="para">“It was the killer app, no question,” Simonyi recalled. “People would come into PARC at night to write all kinds of stuff, sending letters, doing all personal correspondence, PTA reports, silly little newsletters, anything. If you went around and looked at what the Altos were doing, they were all in Bravo.” PARC personnel with access to the Altos found their popularity soaring on the outside. Friends writing Ph.D. theses would beg for permission to come in and type their work into the system. Then they would hit a button and get a gorgeously printed copy from the lasers.</p>
<p class="para">但 Bravo 仍存在严重缺陷。它看上去完全像是工程师为工程师编写的程序：命令复杂、难学，而且容易误用。尽管“所见即所得”的神奇之处，但屏幕图像却显得平淡无奇，对普通用户来说毫无吸引力。批评者嘲笑该显示器不过是一台“玻璃电传打字机”，未能充分利用 Alto 出色的图形功能。如果 Bravo 真的要受到 PARC 和研究科学家团体以外的用户的欢迎，它需要一个更具创意和可访问性的用户界面，一种屏幕格式，使程序及其令人生畏的命令和功能菜单对普通人来说易于理解。</p><p class="para">But Bravo still had serious shortcomings. It looked every inch like a program written by engineers for engineers: The commands were complicated, difficult to learn, and prone to being misapplied. The marvels of WYSIWYG notwithstanding, the screen image appeared flat and uninviting to the ordinary user. Critics derided the display as little more than a “glass teletype” that failed to take advantage of the Alto’s brilliant graphical capabilities. If Bravo were truly to be embraced by users outside PARC and the confraternity of research scientists, it would need a more creative and accessible user interface, a screen format that would render the program and its daunting menu of commands and capabilities intelligible to the average person.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch14.html.page201"></a>
<p class="para">兰普森和西蒙尼对界面的忽视并非偶然。他们认为，让程序运行起来会很麻烦，更不用说让它看起来漂亮了。“当我们建造 Bravo 时，”兰普森回忆道，“我们明确决定不做用户界面。我们说，那太难了，我们没有资源。”</p><p class="para">It was not by accident that Lampson and Simonyi had given the interface short shrift. They figured they would have their hands full getting the program to work, much less making it look pretty. “When we built Bravo,” Lampson recalled, “we made an explicit decision that we would not work on the user interface. We said, that’s going to be too hard and we don’t have the resources.”</p>
<p class="para">幸运的是，在系统科学实验室的走廊尽头，这个故事中的另外两个格格不入的人从相反的方向着手处理文本编辑问题。拉里·特斯勒和蒂姆·莫特深度参与了这样一个用户界面的设计。他们没有一个像样的文字处理程序来支撑它，而 CSL 现在有。</p><p class="para">Fortunately, down the hall in the Systems Science Lab the two other misfits of this story had been approaching the issue of text editing from the opposite direction. Larry Tesler and Tim Mott were deeply involved in the design of just such a user interface. What they did not have, but CSL now did, was a decent word processing program to hang it on.</p>

<p class="para">几乎从拉里·特斯勒从斯坦福人工智能实验室加入 PARC 的那一刻起，他就感到格格不入。他的主要工作是为 POLOS（“PARC 在线办公系统”）编写软件，这是比尔·英格利什 (Bill English) 的计划，旨在利用施乐能买到的优质资源重新设计道格·恩格尔巴特 (Doug Engelbart) 的交互式多媒体系统。这项工作由英格利什从恩格尔巴特挖来的一群工程师负责，他们怀着曾经为这位伟人工作时那种近乎宗教般的热情投入其中。</p><p class="para">Almost from the moment Larry Tesler joined PARC as a recruit from the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab, he felt out of place. His main job was to write software for POLOS, the “PARC On-Line Office System,” which was Bill English’s scheme to reengineer Doug Engelbart’s interactive multimedia system using the superior resources that Xerox money could buy. The work was being handled by a group of engineers English had raided from Engelbart, and they went at it with all the quasi-religious enthusiasm they had once felt working for the great man himself.</p>
<p class="para">让特斯勒感到自己像个陌生人的，是他与同事之间的一个相当根本的分歧：他认为 POLOS 很荒谬。</p><p class="para">What made Tesler feel like a stranger was a rather fundamental disagreement he had with his colleagues: He thought POLOS was ridiculous.</p>
<p class="para">拉里·特斯勒从未为道格·恩格尔巴特工作过。由于没有喝过大师的醉酒，他被 POLOS 的复杂性所困扰。从恩格尔巴特的实验室导入后，该系统要求用户学习一系列令人眼花缭乱的命令和按键序列，包括鼠标、键盘，以及——尤其令人沮丧的——一种被称为“键盘”的奇怪设备。这是一个带有五个未标记杠杆的垫子，类似于法庭上看到的速记机。按下各种组合键可以得到任何字母和各种专门的命令——作为一项工程成就，这已经足够令人印象深刻了。但特斯勒无法想象为什么有人会想使用这样一个深奥的小玩意。</p><p class="para">Larry Tesler had never worked for Doug Engelbart. Not having partaken of the master’s heady wine, he was troubled by POLOS’s complexity. As imported from Engelbart’s lab, the system required users to learn a dizzying array of commands and key sequences involving the mouse, keyboard, and—especially frustrating—a bizarre device known as the “keyset.” This was a pad with five unlabeled levers, resembling the steno machines one saw in courtrooms. Pressing the keys in various combinations could give you any letter of the alphabet and a wide range of specialized commands—impressive enough as an engineering achievement. But Tesler could not imagine why anyone would want to use such an esoteric gadget.</p>
<p class="para">POLOS 的另外两个特点也让他很反感。第一个特点是它的时间——<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch14.html.page202"></a>共享遗产。POLOS 基于一个古老的原则，即计算机非常昂贵，因此必须共享。该系统本质上是一组 Nova 微型计算机，通过电缆连接到每个办公室的视频终端。在任何屏幕上登录的用户都会自动从池中分配一台空闲的 Nova，该 Nova 将作为他或她的“个人”计算机，直到完成所需的任务（键入字母、解析数据库中的字段或执行工程研究）。但没有人会“拥有”一台个人机器，也不能保证在需求旺盛的时期人们不必等待 Nova 空闲。</p><p class="para">Two other features of POLOS also offended him. The first was its time-<a></a>sharing heritage. POLOS was based on the ancient principle that computers were so expensive they had to be shared. The system was designed as essentially a pool of Nova minicomputers linked by cable to video terminals in every office. A user logging in at any screen would automatically be assigned an idle Nova out of the pool, which would serve as his or her “personal” computer until the required task—typing a letter, parsing fields in a database, or performing an engineering study—was done. But no one would “own” an individual machine, nor would there be any guarantee that in periods of high demand one would not have to wait for a Nova to get free.</p>
<p class="para">特斯勒讨厌共享计算周期的想法，这种情绪可以追溯到他 15 岁时就读于纽约市精英布朗克斯科学高中的一次事件。简而言之，他因按错开关而被大学计算机中心开除。</p><p class="para">Tesler hated the very idea of sharing computing cycles, an emotion that dated from an incident that happened when he was a fifteen-year-old senior at New York City’s elite Bronx High School of Science. In short, he had gotten banished from a university computer center for throwing the wrong switch.</p>
<p class="para">那是 1960 年。特斯勒获得了许可，可以在周末空闲时间在哥伦比亚大学使用 IBM 650，这有点违法。650 大约有三个背靠背的高大衣柜那么大。它最奇特的功能之一是它的存储装置，一个由无尽旋转的皮带驱动的磁鼓，就像汽车的风扇皮带一样。计算机操作员必须遵守严格的规定，即如果系统断电，他们必须等待至少十五分钟才能重新打开系统，以确保磁鼓能够完全停止。</p><p class="para">The year was 1960. Tesler had acquired permission, somewhat illicitly, to use an IBM 650 at Columbia University during unbooked slots on weekends. The 650 was about the size of three tall armoires standing back to back. Among its more curious features was its memory apparatus, a magnetic drum driven by an endless rotating belt like the fan belt of a car. The computer’s operators were indoctrinated with the stringent rule that if power to the system ever failed they were to wait a minimum of fifteen minutes before turning it back on, to make sure the drum could first come to a complete stop.</p>
<p class="para">有一天，特斯勒独自留在中心，按错了开关，无意中关掉了机器。“我本能地把它重新打开了——但我一打开，就惊呼，‘哦，该死！’”</p><p class="para">Left alone in the center one day, Tesler hit the wrong switch and inadvertently turned off the machine. “Instinctively I flipped it back on again—and the moment I did I went, ‘Oh, shit!’”</p>
<p class="para">皮带瞬间断裂，发出一声枪响。IBM 收到维修电话，计算机中心因此损失惨重，而 Tesler 则被传唤到主任办公室。</p><p class="para">The belt instantly snapped with a report like a pistol shot. The harvest was a maintenance call to IBM, considerable expense to the computer center, and for Tesler a summons to the director’s office.</p>
<p class="para">“他告诉我，我再也不能用他们的电脑了，”特斯勒回忆道。“那天我下定决心，总有一天我要拥有自己的电脑，因为我不想再让任何人对我这样做。从那时起，我生活中的许多决定都要考虑这个问题：‘这能帮助我拥有自己的电脑吗？’”</p><p class="para">“He told me I could never use their computer again,” Tesler recalled. “That day I resolved that someday I was going to have my own computer, because I didn’t want anybody to ever do that to me again. And from then on many of my decisions about my life were weighed against the question: ‘Does this help me get my own computer?’”</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch14.html.page203"></a>
<p class="para">特斯勒对 POLOS 的第二个反对意见是其用户界面令人难以捉摸。这违反了另一个个人信条，即程序员的主要职责是让外行人能够理解计算机。到他到达 PARC 时，他已经编写了几个旨在将计算机变成普通用户方便使用的工具的程序，其中包括一个用于打印和格式化简单文档的程序，他称之为“Pub”，并通过邮购进行商业销售。</p><p class="para">Tesler’s second objection to POLOS was the hopeless inscrutability of its user interface. This violated another personal credo, that the programmer’s primary duty was to render the computer intelligible to the layman. By the time he reached PARC he had already written several programs aimed at turning computers into handy tools for average users, including one to print and format simple documents which he called “Pub” and sold commercially by mail-order.</p>
<p class="para">特斯勒曾以为，在 PARC，这个互动想象力的世界之都，每个人都在朝着同一个目标努力。然而，他却被扔进了 POLOS 团队，这个团队似乎一心想让用户的事情变得更加困难。他忍不住嘲笑这个系统和它愚蠢的神学。他一有机会，就试图向他着迷的同事们展示，恩格尔巴特令人眼花缭乱的系统是如此复​​杂，以至于给用户带来了更多的工作，而不是更少的工作，就像从错误的一端观看望远镜一样。</p><p class="para">Tesler had assumed that at PARC, the world capital of the interactive imagination, he would find everyone working toward this same goal. Instead he had been thrown among the POLOS team, which seemed bent on making things even harder for the user. He could not resist mocking the system and its silly theology. Every chance he could, he tried to show his smitten colleagues that Engelbart’s dazzling system was so complicated that it created more work for the user rather than less, like a telescope viewed through the wrong end.</p>
<p class="para">“他们必须证明，人们需要数周时间才能记住键盘，而要熟练使用则需要数月时间，”他回忆道。“因此，他们想出了‘增强智力’的整个奥秘，以及人们需要六个月的培训才能熟练使用计算机。基本上，我证明了，如果使用正确的系统，这些需要六个月才能完成的事情实际上只需要一周时间。”</p><p class="para">“They had to justify the fact that it took people weeks to memorize the keyset and months to become proficient,” he recalled. “So they came up with this whole mystique about ‘augmenting intellect’ and how in order to become literate with a computer people would need six months of training. Basically, I showed that this stuff that took six months really only had to take a week, with the right system.”</p>
<p class="para">他们不听他的话，反而像躲避牧师一样躲避狂欢。“他们受够了我，觉得我比其他任何人都更让人头疼，”特斯勒回忆道。“我是个反对者。我打击了士气。”</p><p class="para">Rather than heed his words, they shunned him like a parson at the orgy. “They were fed up with me and decided I was more of a pain than anything else,” Tesler recalled. “I was the naysayer. I was bringing down the morale.”</p>
<p class="para">最后，比尔·英格利什把他叫到办公室。“拉里，”他说，“我们给你安排了新任务。”</p><p class="para">Finally Bill English summoned him to his office. “Larry,” he said, “we’ve found you a new assignment.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">当特斯勒在内部对 POLOS 大发牢骚时，系统也得到了外部一位敏锐访客的审视。Timothy Mott 被 Ginn &amp; Co. 的负责人派往 PARC 担任特使，Ginn &amp; Co. 是施乐的一家子公司，在波士顿的办公室出版教科书。</p><p class="para">While Tesler had been crabbing about POLOS from the inside, the system had been getting the once-over from a perceptive visitor from the outside. Timothy Mott had been dispatched to PARC as an emissary by the head of Ginn &amp; Co., a Xerox subsidiary that published textbooks out of an office in Boston.</p>
<p class="para">对于一位 60 岁的出版商来说，这个名字颇具挑衅意味的男人，达尔文·M·牛顿，是一个不同寻常的有进取心的人。有时<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch14.html.page204"></a>此前，他发现施乐公司每年向吉恩收取一部分收入，用于支付“公司研究”费用。据他所知，这笔税款从未为吉恩购买过一分钱的知识或技术，他决心纠正这一缺陷。他的调查使他来到了 PARC，在那里他收到了办公系统最新成果的简短演示——即 POLOS。牛顿回到家，想着像 POLOS 这样的东西可能会帮助减轻编辑手稿和排版的乏味，并在此过程中帮助吉恩写出更好的书。</p><p class="para">For a sixty-year-old publisher, this man, the provocatively named Darwin M. Newton, was an uncommonly enterprising individual. Sometime <a></a>earlier he had discovered that Xerox was charging Ginn a portion of its annual revenues to cover “corporate research.” As far as he could tell, this tax had never purchased Ginn a dime’s worth of knowledge or technology, a deficit he resolved to correct. His inquiries led him to PARC, where he had received a short demo of the latest work on office systems—that is, POLOS. Newton returned home thinking that something like POLOS might help relieve the tedium of editing manuscripts and laying out pages, and in the process help Ginn turn out better books.</p>
<p class="para">但如何确定自己的怀疑是否正确，这个问题让他很为难。他对编辑了如指掌，但对电脑却一无所知。后来有一天，蒂姆·莫特 (Tim Mott) 来参加面试。</p><p class="para">But the question of how to actually determine if his suspicions were right had him stymied. He knew everything about editing but nothing about computers. Then one day Tim Mott showed up for a job interview.</p>
<p class="para">莫特是一位流离失所的英国人，拥有曼彻斯特大学的计算机科学学位。曼彻斯特大学在计算机领域的成就比帕洛阿尔托大学要悠久得多，因为世界上第一台基于阿兰·图灵概念的电子存储程序计算机就是在曼彻斯特于 1948 年制造出来的。完成学业后，莫特从曼彻斯特搬到了俄亥俄州的欧柏林学院，在那里他教了几年数学，并帮助学校建立了计算机系。然后他搬到了波士顿，就读商学院。他之所以来到牛顿的办公室，是因为有人告诉他，吉恩有一份兼职工作，可以帮他撑到新学年开始。</p><p class="para">Mott was a displaced Briton with a computer science degree from Manchester University. This was a place with a much older claim to computing distinction than Palo Alto’s, for it was at Manchester that the world’s first electronic stored-program computer, based on the concepts of Alan Turing, had been built in 1948. After completing his studies Mott had relocated from Manchester to Oberlin College in Ohio, where he had spent a couple of years teaching math and helping the school set up its computer department. He then moved to Boston to enroll in business school. What brought him to Newton’s office was a tip that Ginn had a part-time opening that might tide him over until the school year started.</p>
<p class="para">当牛顿得知坐在他面前的这个人是一名经过认证的计算机科学家时，他抓住机会探索如何在现实世界的生产线上应用他所见过的有趣系统。这份兼职工作突然消失了。相反，莫特发现自己被派往帕洛阿尔托，并被指示将 POLOS 作为编辑系统带回来。</p><p class="para">Once Newton learned that the man seated before him was a certified computer scientist, he jumped at the chance to explore how to apply the intriguing system he had seen in a real world production line. The part-time job suddenly disappeared. Instead, Mott found himself shipped out to Palo Alto with instructions to bring back POLOS as an editing system.</p>
<p class="para">作为一名英国人、一个陌生人、一个来自遥远的施乐之地的大使，莫特在西海岸的最初几天里一直感到头晕目眩。</p><p class="para">As a Briton, a stranger, and an ambassador from the far reaches of Xerox land, Mott spent his first few days on the West Coast with his head spinning.</p>
<p class="para">“我听说过 PARC，但可能只是通过 Stewart Brand 写的东西。我不认为自己属于计算机科学研究的主流，”他回忆道。他在 PARC 发现“从个人计算的角度来看，而不是从批处理的角度来看，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch14.html.page205"></a>或分时确实很吸引人。我听到了关于这项技术的价格和发展方向的笑话，以及在那里进行的研究最终将真正实现商业可行性的事实。”</p><p class="para">“I had heard of PARC, though probably only through the stuff Stewart Brand had written. I didn’t think of myself as being in the mainstream of computer science research,” he recalled. What he found at PARC “from the standpoint of personal computing as opposed to either batch process<a></a>ing or time-sharing was really fascinating. And I got the joke about the price of the technology and where it was going and the fact that what was being worked on there was really going to be commercially viable, in time.”</p>
<p class="para">但他也看到了研究列车偏离轨道的地方。他发现，在 POLOS 团队中，“没有花太多时间研究普通人能用这个系统做什么。”相反，他们开发了一个令人困惑的技术性和违反直觉的系统。英格利希和他的软件主管比尔·杜瓦尔忠实地复制了恩格尔巴特的“结构化文本”系统，其中文件的每一行和每一段落都包含指向其他相关文本的参考指针，允许用户在文档中遵循一种地下智力路径。莫特认为这是一个分析计算机程序或浏览信息空间的迷人模型。“但它并不是一个特别好的编辑手稿的模型，更不用说对文本和图形进行页面布局了。”和特斯勒一样，他一想到要训练一个典型的 Ginn 编辑或秘书，或任何普通用户使用 POLOS 的繁琐程序就不寒而栗。</p><p class="para">But he also saw where the research train was going off the rails. On the POLOS team, he found, “there wasn’t a lot of time spent looking at what mere mortals would be able to do with the system.” Instead they had produced a system bewilderingly technical and counterintuitive. English and his software chief, Bill Duvall, had faithfully reproduced Engelbart’s system of “structured text” in which every line and paragraph of a file incorporated reference pointers to other pertinent text, allowing users to follow a sort of subterranean intellectual path through a document. Mott regarded it as a fascinating model for analyzing computer programs or navigating through information space. “But it wasn’t a particularly good model for editing manuscripts, let alone doing page layout of text and graphics.” Like Tesler, he shuddered at the thought of training a typical Ginn editor or secretary, or any ordinary user, to utilize POLOS’s baroque routines.</p>
<p class="para">POLOS 在现实世界中的不足给 Mott 带来了真正的困境。由于他的职责是研究和调整 POLOS 以适应 Ginn，在帕洛阿尔托待了六周后，他基本上已经失去了工作。“我给 Ginn 的报告基本上是一封辞职信，说这不是你可以使用的技术，”他回忆道。</p><p class="para">POLOS’s inadequacies in the real world posed a real dilemma for Mott. Since his charge was to study and adapt POLOS for Ginn, after six weeks in Palo Alto he had essentially studied himself out of a job. “My report back to Ginn was basically a letter of resignation, saying this isn’t technology you can use,” he recalled.</p>
<p class="para">幸运的是，在发送之前，他恰好在鲍勃·泰勒的办公室里待了几分钟，概述了他的疑虑。</p><p class="para">Fortunately, before sending it he happened to spend a few moments in Bob Taylor’s office, outlining his misgivings.</p>
<p class="para">泰勒抽着烟斗。“你不会就这么走了吧？”他问道。</p><p class="para">Taylor puffed at his pipe. “You’re not going to just go away, are you?” he asked.</p>
<p class="para">“我还有什么选择？这个系统不适合出版应用。”</p><p class="para">“What choice do I have? This isn’t a system suitable for a publishing application.”</p>
<p class="para">“所以请留下来帮我们想<span class="italic">办法</span>帮助 Ginn。这就是我们来这里的原因。”</p><p class="para">“So stick around and help us figure out what <span class="italic">will</span> work for Ginn. That’s why we’re here.”</p>
<p class="para">泰勒向莫特提出的建议并非完全无私。当时，POLOS 和 Alto 正沿着平行的道路朝着同一个目标前进——以交互方式向用户提供计算周期。泰勒认为，这两个项目几乎肯定会在零和游戏中争夺资金和员工。他并不孤单：即使是没有多少利益的观察家<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch14.html.page206"></a>两种系统的成功都让市场意识到，当硝烟散去后，只有一种系统能够存活下来。泰勒会尽一切努力确保 Alto 能够胜出，这一点并不令人意外。</p><p class="para">Taylor’s proposal to Mott was not an entirely disinterested one. At that moment POLOS and the Alto were moving along parallel paths toward the same goal—delivering computing cycles interactively to users. Taylor figured the two programs were almost certain to end up vying for money and staff in a zero-sum game. He was not alone: Even observers with little stake <a></a>in the success of either system realized that when the smoke cleared only one would be left standing. No one could be surprised that Taylor would do anything to ensure the Alto was the one that would prevail.</p>
<p class="para">到 1974 年，当他与 Mott 进行对话时，这种竞争已经在计算机科学和系统科学实验室之间造成了紧张关系。Lampson 和他的同事们确信 POLOS 架构已经过时了。确实，放弃传统的重型大型机而采用 Nova 池可以减轻系统的内存管理和作业调度负担，而正是这些使得分时变得如此繁重和复杂。但由于必须保留一两台 Nova 来执行专门的任务（例如调度打印作业）并与池中机器的用户进行协调，因此复杂性又增加了。</p><p class="para">By 1974, when his conversation with Mott took place, this rivalry was already creating tension between the Computer Science and Systems Science labs. Lampson and his colleagues were convinced the POLOS architecture was obsolete. It was true that scrapping the traditional heavy-duty mainframe in favor of the Nova pool relieved the system of the memory management and job scheduling that made time-sharing so burdensome and complex. But since one or two Novas had to be reserved for specialized tasks such as scheduling print jobs and coordinated with the users of the pooled machines, the complexity got added right back in.</p>
<p class="para">“这实际上比尝试在传统的分时系统上实现更糟糕，”兰普森后来解释道。“你必须把所有这些球都放在空中才能让一切正常运转，而我们今天并不擅长这一点。我们当时肯定也不擅长。”</p><p class="para">“It was actually worse than trying to do it on a classical time-sharing system,” Lampson explained later. “You had to keep all these balls in the air to keep everything working, which we’re not that good at today. And we certainly weren’t very good at it then.”</p>
<p class="para">CSL 的工作人员发起了一场运动来破坏 POLOS。如果泰勒从伯克利计算机公司招募的人员对破坏他从恩格尔巴特实验室招募的优秀项目感到羞愧，他们并没有表现出来；这是一个工程问题，个人感情不是其中的因素。无论如何，英格利士和他的人现在属于另一个实验室。在员工会议和走廊闲聊中，计算机科学实验室从不放过任何表达其观点的机会，仿佛遵循鲍勃·泰勒早年在德克萨斯州乡村尘土飞扬的小镇中流浪时养成的习惯。他们确保 Alto 在等级制度中的优越地位得以确立并变得无懈可击。</p><p class="para">The CSL staff campaigned to undermine POLOS. If Taylor’s recruits from Berkeley Computer felt at all abashed about torpedoing the prize project of his recruits from Engelbart’s lab, they did not show it; this was a question of engineering, in which personal feelings were not a factor. In any case, English and his people now belonged to a different lab. In staff meetings and hallway bull sessions the Computer Science Lab never let slip a chance to make its views known, as though following the habit Bob Taylor had learned in his early itinerant years among the dusty little towns of rural Texas. They were making sure the Alto’s superior position in the hierarchy was established and rendered unassailable.</p>
<p class="para">“我们说我们的方式是正确的，”兰普森回忆道。“我们公开表达了我们的感受。我们真的认为他们做的是错的，投入的任何资源都将被浪费，事实也确实如此。”</p><p class="para">“We were saying our way is the right way,” Lampson recalled. “We openly articulated our feelings. We really thought they were doing the wrong thing and any resources poured into it were going to be wasted, as indeed they were.”</p>
<p class="para">POLOS 的辩护者也同样热情高涨，他们认为 CSL 计划向大楼里的每个人分发价值 20,000 美元的机器，这是对资源的荒谬浪费，就像给每个秘书配备一台打印机，而她所需要的只是一台打字机。更不用说<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch14.html.page207"></a>这样的系统会带来巨大的维护难题，特别是与将最复杂的机器方便地放在一个地方并且唯一分散的元素基本上是廉价、低维护的电视机相比。</p><p class="para">The POLOS defenders were equally spirited, arguing that CSL’s plan to distribute $20,000 machines to everyone in the building would be a ludicrous waste of resources, like giving every secretary her own printing press when all she needed was a typewriter. Not to mention <a></a>that such a system would present a massive maintenance headache, especially compared to one where the most complicated machines were kept conveniently in one spot and the only distributed elements were essentially cheap, low-maintenance TV sets.</p>
<p class="para">目前可能还不清楚的是，POLOS 已经陷入困境——原因正如 Lampson 所说。该系统过于复杂，本质上效率低下，无法生存。POLOS 团队无法让这个复杂的网络持续运行，这一点最终变得太明显了，即使是最坚定的支持者也无法忽视。</p><p class="para">What may not have been clear at the moment was that POLOS was already in trouble—and for exactly the reasons Lampson cited. The system was too complicated and inherently inefficient to survive. The POLOS team’s inability to get the elaborate network operating consistently eventually became too obvious for even its staunchest advocates to ignore.</p>
<p class="para">“我们不知道如何处理如此复杂的系统，”另一位参与该项目的前恩格尔巴特工程师 Smokey Wallace 承认。与 Alto-Ethernet 这样的模块化系统相比，POLOS 是如此有机地集成，以至于任何一个部件的崩溃都会导致整个系统无法运行，有时甚至无法解释。“它会连续运行三个月，然后半天就崩溃了，”Wallace 回忆道，“而我们不知道为什么。”</p><p class="para">“We didn’t know how to deal with a system so complicated,” acknowledged Smokey Wallace, another ex-Engelbart engineer working on the project. In contrast to a modular system like Alto-Ethernet, where the whole system would keep functioning regardless of any one component’s failure, POLOS was so organically integrated that the crash of any one part would knock the entire assemblage out of commission, sometimes inexplicably. “It would run for three months straight and then fall apart for half a day,” Wallace recalled, “and we wouldn’t know why.”</p>
<p class="para">尽管如此，在 Cookie Monster 首次出现在 Chuck Thacker 的显示屏上一年多之后，很难说哪个系统最终会胜出。POLOS 仍然有很多优点，包括 Doug Engelbart 的 NLS 的出色多媒体功能，这些功能经过重新实现并在许多方面得到改进。与此同时，Alto 仍在寻找理由。</p><p class="para">Still, for more than a year after the Cookie Monster first munched its way across Chuck Thacker’s display screen, it was impossible to say which system would eventually prevail. POLOS still had a lot to offer, including the spectacular multimedia capabilities of Doug Engelbart’s NLS, reimplemented and in many respects improved upon. Meanwhile, the Alto was still looking for a rationale.</p>
<p class="para">泰勒抓住机会让蒂姆·莫特工作。他知道莫特需要 POLOS 的替代品。显然，答案必须是 Alto。当他在系统科学实验室询问是否有出版系统方面的专家可以与莫特合作时，比尔·英格利什突然想起拉里·特斯勒做过“出版”这件事。他毫不犹豫地把特斯勒叫来，告诉他新工作的情况。</p><p class="para">Taylor jumped at the chance to put Tim Mott to work. He knew Mott needed an alternative to POLOS. Clearly the answer would have to be the Alto. When he asked over at the Systems Science Lab if they had anyone with expertise in publication systems to work with Mott, Bill English suddenly recalled that Larry Tesler had done that “Pub” thing. Without hesitating, he called Tesler in to tell him about his new job.</p>
<p class="para">“这是什么？”特斯勒问道。</p><p class="para">“What is it?” Tesler asked.</p>
<p class="para">“你要为 Ginn 做一个出版系统，”英格利什说。</p><p class="para">“You’re going to do a publication system for Ginn,” English said.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">当莫特和特斯勒开始合作时，PARC 已经编写了几个原型文字处理程序。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch14.html.page208"></a>然而，这些软件几乎都没有在 Alto 上发挥出很好的作用——要么太慢，要么太初级，要么太复杂。Bravo 是个例外，它运行速度快，功能丰富，并且与 Alto 的性能完美匹配。</p><p class="para">By the time Mott and Tesler started working together, several prototype word processing programs had already been written at PARC. <a></a>Almost none of them functioned very well on the Alto, however—they were too slow, or too elementary, or too complicated. The exception was Bravo, which was fast, rich in features, and well-tuned to the Alto’s capabilities.</p>
<p class="para">然而，莫特和特斯勒等人认为，尽管 Bravo 拥有许多了不起的天赋，但也存在一些重大缺陷。与 POLOS 一样，这些缺陷大多与用户界面有关——用户和程序之间通过按键、命令和视觉提示进行通信。</p><p class="para">Mott and Tesler, however, were among those who believed that Bravo, for all its marvelous endowments, harbored some major flaws. As with POLOS, most of these had to do with the user interface—the keystrokes, commands, and visual cues through which user and program communicated with each other.</p>
<p class="para">首先，Bravo 的界面经过了高度的模式化，这意味着键入某个键的结果会根据程序处于“命令”模式还是“文本”模式而有所不同。操作员必须始终记住系统处于哪种状态，以免发生灾难。例如，在“文本”模式下，系统的功能类似于打字机：按下“D”键会得到字母<span class="italic">D</span>。然而，在“命令”模式下，按键产生的不是文本字符而是命令 - 例如，按下 D 会指示程序删除<span class="italic">选定</span>的文本块。</p><p class="para">For one thing, Bravo’s interface was heavily moded, meaning that the result of typing a key would differ depending on whether the program was in “command” or “text” mode. The operator always had to keep in mind which of these states the system was in, lest disaster ensue. In “text” mode, for instance, the system functioned like a typewriter: Pressing the “D” key gave you the letter <span class="italic">D</span>. In “command” mode, however, the keys produced not text characters but commands—pressing a D, for example, instructed the program to <span class="italic">delete</span> a selected block of text.</p>
<p class="para">模式是界面设计中臭名昭著的陷阱，甚至催生出一个标准的警世笑话。这涉及到一个用户在命令模式而非文本模式下不经意地输入了单词“edit”：输入“e”会选中整个文档，“d”会删除所选内容，“i”会指示机器插入下一个要输入的字符……此时，用户发现他的整个文档已被字母“t”不可改变地替换。</p><p class="para">Modes were such notorious pitfalls in interface design that they had spawned a standard cautionary joke. This involved a user who inattentively typed the word “edit” while in command rather than text mode: Typing “e” selected the entire document, “d” deleted the selection, and “i” instructed the machine to insert in its stead the next character to be typed…at which point the user discovered that his entire document had been inalterably replaced by the letter “t.”</p>
<p class="para">特斯勒和莫特认为，为了方便外行，必须消除模式。他们认为 Bravo 的界面比 POLOS 的大量反常和违反直觉的命令有了很大的改进，但还远远不够。它的模式被简化了，但它们仍然是模式，正如特斯勒回忆的那样，这使得它“仍然是一个非常危险的编辑器”。</p><p class="para">For the sake of the layman, Tesler and Mott believed, modes had to be exterminated. They thought Bravo’s interface represented a vast improvement over POLOS’s thicket of perverse and counterintuitive commands, but that it had not gone far enough. Its modes were simplified, but they were still modes, making it “still a very dangerous editor to use,” as Tesler recalled.</p>
<p class="para">此外，与所有 CSL 程序一样，Bravo 的外观也非常丑陋。尽管 CSL 对其所见即所得功能感到满意，但该程序很少利用位图屏幕的图形功能。即使是可变字体仍然在空白屏幕上显示为裸文本。这反映了 CSL 设计师的深思熟虑，他们避免了繁琐<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch14.html.page209"></a>图形速度慢，因此他们不推荐使用高速图形，因为它们会降低系统速度。但是，由于系统科学实验室的工程师们最感兴趣的是让普通用户也能理解计算机，因此他们在程序中加载了各种图形，认为在一两代之内，计算机的速度最终会赶上来。</p><p class="para">Moreover, like all CSL programs, Bravo was exceedingly ugly in appearance. For all CSL’s delight at its WYSIWYG capabilities, the program made scant use of the bitmapped screen’s graphical power. Even the variable fonts were still displayed as bare text on a blank screen. This reflected a deliberate choice by the CSL designers, who avoided elabo<a></a>rate graphics because they slowed down the system. But because the Systems Science Lab engineers were mostly interested in making the computer intelligible to the average user, they loaded up their programs with graphical gewgaws of all kinds, figuring that within a generation or two the machine’s speed would eventually catch up.</p>
<p class="para">因此，特斯勒和莫特着手创建非模式图形界面，让 Bravo 易于使用。受到莫特继女在 1974 年万圣节穿的服装的启发，他们将新程序命名为“吉普赛”。</p><p class="para">Tesler and Mott therefore set out to create a modeless graphical interface to make Bravo simple to use. Inspired by the costume Mott’s stepdaughter was wearing for Halloween that year, 1974, they called their new program “Gypsy.”</p>
<p class="para">他们的第一步是做 PARC 从未尝试过的事情：他们分析非工程师实际上是如何使用计算机的。</p><p class="para">Their first step was to do something PARC had never tried before: They analyzed how non-engineers would actually use a computer.</p>
<p class="para">这项调查是在 Ginn 进行的，Mott 带回了一台 Alto 显示器、键盘和鼠标。他将它们安装成一种虚拟设置（机器无法使用），并邀请编辑坐在设备前，想象他们正在在线编辑，并描述他们期望它做什么。</p><p class="para">This survey was conducted back at Ginn, to which Mott returned with an Alto display, keyboard, and mouse. He installed them as a sort of dummy setup (the machine was nonfunctional) and invited editors to seat themselves in front of the equipment, imagine they were editing on-line, and describe what they expected it to do.</p>
<p class="para">“他们有点怀疑，”他回忆道。“但令人惊讶的是，他们希望机器模仿他们在纸上所做的工作。”他们甚至用他们一直使用的工具来描述这些过程。这就是为什么直到今天，每个传统文字处理器删除一段文本并将其放在文件其他位置的命令都被称为“剪切”和“粘贴”——因为 Ginn 的编辑是第一批使用这种系统的非工程师，他们想到了他们用来在纸上重新排列手稿的剪刀和粘贴罐。</p><p class="para">“They were a little skeptical,” he recalled. “But—surprise, surprise—what you got was them wanting the machine to mimic what they would do on paper.” They even described the processes in terms of the tools they had always used. That is why to this day every conventional word processor’s commands for deleting a block of text and placing it elsewhere in a file are called “cut” and “paste”—because Ginn’s editors, the first non-engineers ever to use such a system, were thinking about the scissors and paste pots they used to rearrange manuscripts on paper.</p>
<p class="para">当莫特回到波士顿研究人为因素时，特斯勒致力于界面的视觉表现。他的目标是围绕图标和菜单构建界面——缩略图大小的插图，当用鼠标单击时，它们会执行离散功能，以及可以随时执行的命令列表。有一段时间，他几乎开始同情 CSL 的观点，即繁重的图形如何给功能不足的 Altos 带来负担：他的第一个图形界面运行速度非常慢，为了演示他的方案，他不得不以正常速度的九分之一录制在录像带上，这样在实时播放时才会显得自然。</p><p class="para">While Mott was back in Boston studying the human factors, Tesler worked on the visual representation of the interface. His ambition was to build it around icons and menus—thumbnail-sized illustrations that would perform discrete functions when clicked with the mouse, and lists of commands that could be executed at any given time. For a while he almost started sympathizing with CSL’s view of how heavy graphics burdened the underpowered Altos: His first graphical interfaces worked so slowly that to demonstrate his scheme he had to record it on videotape at one-ninth normal speed so it would appear natural when played back in real time.</p>
<p class="para">1975 年，经过一年的努力，Gypsy 终于可以投入使用了。Mott 带来了<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch14.html.page210"></a>几台 Altos 和一台高速 Dover 激光打印机送回 Ginn，并将它们连接到一台可以输出照相排版文本的照相排字机上。这是专业编辑首次在如此大规模上在屏幕上处理文本并将其存储在磁盘上，而不是剪切、粘贴和标记打字稿，因为这些稿件的更改越来越难以辨认。</p><p class="para">In 1975, after a year of work, Gypsy was ready for launch. Mott brought <a></a>a couple of Altos and a high-speed Dover laser printer back to Ginn and wired them to a phototypesetter that would output camera-ready text. For the first time on such a large scale, professional editors manipulated text on a screen and stored it on magnetic disks rather than cutting, pasting, and marking a typed manuscript with progressively illegible changes.</p>
<p class="para">“最初人们对这个概念的反应是‘你必须把我拖着又踢又叫’，”莫特回忆道。“但每个坐在这个系统前使用过它的人，在一小时内就变成了这个系统的追随者。”</p><p class="para">“Initially the reaction to the concept was, ‘You’re going to have to drag me kicking and screaming,’” Mott recalled. “But everyone who sat in front of that system and used it, to a person, was a convert within an hour.”</p>
<p class="para">吉普赛尽一切可能模仿吉恩的日常工作。系统保留每个文件的多个版本和草稿，并将它们显示为列表。编辑可以使用鼠标向下滚动列表，然后单击所需的版本以打开它。（这是鼠标第一次像今天这样用于执行点击操作；恩格尔巴特的系统和 Bravo 都只是用它来将光标定位在文本块内。）</p><p class="para">In every way possible, Gypsy mimicked Ginn’s customary routines. The system retained multiple versions and drafts of every file and displayed them as a list. An editor could use the mouse to scroll down the list and click on the desired version to open it. (This was the first time the mouse was used as it is today, to execute point-and-click operations; Engelbart’s system and Bravo both used it simply to position the cursor within a block of text.)</p>
<p class="para">莫特努力让 Ginn 编辑参与设计阶段，这一努力最终获得了回报。他回忆说，编辑过程“非常繁琐，有时甚至会让人举手说‘我再也不想做了’”，而 Ginn 员工“发现，能够在屏幕上编辑并始终拥有干净的副本，提高了编辑本身的质量。他们可以做更多，而不会感到沮丧。”</p><p class="para">Mott’s diligence in drawing the Ginn editors into the design phase paid off. Instead of an editing process “so laborious that there was a point at which you threw up your hands and said, ‘I just don’t want to do this anymore,’” he recalled, the Ginn staff “found the ability to edit on the screen and always have a clean copy improved the quality of the editing itself. They could do a lot more of it before it became frustrating.”</p>
<p class="para">在 PARC 内部，Bravo 和 Gypsy 果断地让 Alto 胜过 POLOS。Simonyi、Tesler 和 Mott 已经证明，Alto 可以支持一个交互式办公系统，该系统运行速度足够快，可以增强（称之为“增强”）专业办公人员的智力。由于 POLOS 的进度落后得更远，Ginn 实验的成功注定了它的失败。“唯一真正的问题是，”Kay 的工程师之一 Ted Kaehler 说道，“POLOS 是否会在投入使用之前就过时了。”最终，它确实过时了。</p><p class="para">Within PARC, Bravo and Gypsy decisively tipped the balance in favor of the Alto over POLOS. Simonyi, Tesler, and Mott had shown that the Alto could support an interactive office system that worked fast enough to enhance—call it “augment”—the professional office worker’s intelligence. Since POLOS was slipping even further behind schedule, the success of the Ginn experiment sealed its doom. “The only real question,” remarked Ted Kaehler, one of Kay’s engineers, “was whether POLOS would be obsolete before it was even operational.” In the end, it was.</p>

<div class="chapterBody">
<p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">尽管</span></span>Bravo 和 Gypsy 都是杀手级应用，但它们只是触及了 Alto 强大功能的表面。虽然它不是第一台小到可以供个人使用的机器（LINC 之前就已存在），但 Alto 是第一台专门设计为通用“个人”设备的机器：个性化且可无限定制。计算机不再是一台需要人类适应的机器，而是一台可以无限适应每个用户需求的机器。</p><p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">F</span></span>or all their coolness as killer apps, Bravo and Gypsy only scratched the surface of the Alto’s vast capabilities. Although it was not the first machine small enough to be used by an individual—the LINC had been there before—the Alto was the first one deliberately designed as a general-purpose “personal” appliance: individualistic and infinitely customizable. The computer was no longer a machine to which man had to adapt, but one endlessly adaptable to every user’s needs.</p>
<p class="para">Alto 的神秘感深深地吸引了它的新主人，他们把自己的机器拟人化，就像大众甲壳虫的司机一样，把它们漆成鲜艳的颜色，并举行隆重的仪式为它们命名。凯伊将他的第一台所谓的临时 Dynabook 命名为“Bilbo”，以纪念 JRR 托尔金的英雄霍比特人。负责为 Alto 大规模生产做准备的英国人约翰·埃伦比将他的电脑称为“Gzunda”（“因为它是桌子的‘gzunda’”）。图形研究员迪克·舒普将他的电脑连接到彩色视频终端，创造了第一台彩色电脑显示器，泰勒则安装了一台电脑，只要他收到电子邮件，就会发出“德克萨斯之眼”的开头音。</p><p class="para">The Alto’s mystique worked potently on its new owners, who anthropomorphized their machines like drivers of Volkswagen Beetles, painting them in bright colors and christening them with considerable ceremony. Kay named his first so-called interim Dynabook “Bilbo,” after J. R. R. Tolkien’s heroic Hobbit. John Ellenby, a Briton who was placed in charge of readying the Alto design for large-scale production, called his the “Gzunda” (“because it ‘gzunda’ the desk”). The graphics researcher Dick Shoup connected his to a color video terminal, creating the first color computer monitor, and Taylor got his rigged to beep out the opening bars of “The Eyes of Texas Are Upon You” whenever he received an e-mail message.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch15.html.page212"></a>
<p class="para">Altos 通过以太网相互连接，并与打印机以及视频显示器和风琴键盘等许多其他设备相连，点燃了 PARC 的创意导火索。Thacker 设计了第一个自定义应用程序，一个名为“SIL”（代表“Simple Illustrator”）的程序，它可以自动完成计算机电路布局，并允许将原理图直接转换为印刷电路板。但随后又出现了更多这样的程序。</p><p class="para">Linked by Ethernet to each other, to printers, and to a host of other devices such as video displays and organ keyboards, the Altos lit PARC’s creative fuse. Thacker had designed the first custom application, a program called “SIL” (for “Simple Illustrator”) that automated the process of laying out computer circuits and allowed schematics to be translated directly into printed boards. But scores more were right behind.</p>
<p class="para">有 Patrick Beaudelaire 的“Draw”和 William Newman 的“Markup”，后者继承了 Ivan Sutherland 的“Sketchpad”的精髓，让用户能够将手绘直接放在位图屏幕上。（当然，Sutherland 的程序只能在麻省理工学院的一台 TX-2 上运行，而这些程序可以在任何 Alto 上运行。）有创作音乐和动画的程序、格式化文本文档的程序、帮助编写更多程序的程序，以及数十个 Smalltalk 程序。</p><p class="para">There were “Draw” by Patrick Beaudelaire and “Markup” by William Newman, which picked up where Ivan Sutherland’s “Sketchpad” left off by giving users the power to place freehand drawings directly onto the bitmapped screen. (Of course, where Sutherland’s program worked only on the lone TX—2 at MIT, these would run on any Alto.) There were programs to compose music and animation, to format text documents, and to assist the writing of more programs, and dozens of programs in Smalltalk.</p>
<p class="para">与此同时，无处不在的以太网促进了电子邮件的传播，并因此推动了“Laurel”的开发，这是一个简化撰写、阅读和归档电子邮件的程序。（后来的版本被称为“Hardy”。）这是泰勒将计算机作为通信设备的目标迈出的一大步。“当时计算机之间无法通信，”萨克回忆道。“除了在 PARC。”</p><p class="para">Meanwhile the all-pervading Ethernet encouraged the spread of e-mail and consequently the development of “Laurel,” a program to simplify composing, reading, and filing e-mail messages. (A later version was dubbed “Hardy.”) This was a huge leap toward Taylor’s grail of the computer as communications device. “Computers didn’t communicate with each other then,” Thacker recalled. “Except at PARC.”</p>
<p class="para">在那里，他们几乎不间断地交流，这种数字聊天方式让今天的互联网迷们羡慕不已。在 Alto 网络上，施乐员工创办了第一个在线俱乐部，玩了第一个联网电脑游戏，甚至完成了第一个联合研究项目，而他们从未与合作伙伴见过面。“在 PARC，我收到了第一封电子垃圾邮件、第一份电子工作录取通知书和第一份电子讣告，”一位实验室主管回忆道。沃伦·泰特尔曼 (Warren Teitelman) 有一次出差一周回来后发现他的电子邮箱里塞满了 600 条信息。</p><p class="para">And there they communicated almost nonstop, a digital chatter that would be the envy of today’s Internet junkies. On the Alto network Xerox employees started the first on-line clubs, played the first networked computer games, even completed the first joint research projects without ever meeting their partners face to face. “At PARC I received my first electronic junk mail, my first electronic job acceptance, and first electronic obituary,” recalled one lab supervisor. Warren Teitelman once returned from a week out of town to find his electronic mailbox crammed with 600 messages.</p>
<p class="para">所有这些活动都明确地指向了这样一个未来：计算机的功能将不再由硬件决定，而是由软件决定：标准化、商业化、无限适应性。巴特勒·兰普森是最早预见到这种可能性的人之一。1972 年，甚至在 Alto 成型之前，在 IBM 个人电脑和软件和硬件行业出现十多年之前，它就<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch15.html.page213"></a>他在一份专业出版物中阐述了他对计算机增强的乌托邦命运的“颇为虚幻的”愿景：</p><p class="para">All this activity plainly pointed to a future in which the computer’s functions would no longer be dictated by hardware, but software: standardized, commercialized, and boundlessly adaptable. Butler Lampson was one of the first to divine the possibilities. In 1972, even before the Alto took form and more than ten years before the advent of the IBM Personal Computer and the software and hardware industries it <a></a>spawned, he set forth in a professional publication his “rather phantasmagoric” vision of a Utopian computer-enhanced destiny:</p>
<div class="extract">
<p class="extractText">数以百万计的人将编写非平凡的程序，数十万人将试图出售这些程序。当然，市场将比现在大得多，也更加多样化，就像纸张比加法机更普及，用途也更多一样。几乎每个使用铅笔的人都会使用电脑，虽然大多数人不会进行任何严肃的编程，但几乎每个人都是某种严肃程序的潜在客户……这样的大众市场需要大规模分销。类似于书店、报摊和杂志订阅的模式似乎是可行的，以及我们现在拥有的那种邮购和家居装修营销模式。</p><p class="extractText">Millions of people will write non-trivial programs, and hundreds of thousands will try to sell them. Of course, the market will be much larger and very much more diverse than it is now, just as paper is more widespread and is used in many more ways than are adding machines. Almost everyone who uses a pencil will use a computer, and although most people will not do any serious programming, almost everyone will be a potential customer for serious programs of some kind…. Such a mass market will require mass distribution. Analogues of bookstores, newsstands and magazine subscriptions seem plausible, as well as the kind of mail-order and home improvement marketing patterns we have now.</p>
</div>
<p class="para">在分时系统的影响下，PARC 的大多数计算机科学家都难以适应将计算机周期随意分配给个人使用。一些人甚至在第一次拒绝使用闲置的 Alto 时感到一丝愧疚，就好像他们把食物留在桌子上，而其他人却在挨饿。但在计算机历史上，这是第一次，资源如此丰富，以至于可以随意浪费。</p><p class="para">Raised on time-sharing, most of PARC’s computer scientists had trouble getting acclimated to the experience of having computer cycles at their personal disposal. A few even felt a twinge of guilt the first time they turned their backs on an idle Alto, as though they were leaving food on the table while others starved. But for the first time in the history of computing, resources were abundant enough to waste.</p>
<p class="para">在 PARC，很少有人像艾伦·凯一样对这台机器如此痴迷。这台机器仿佛就是他一生都在等待的东西——事实上，这台机器几乎是按照他的个人要求打造的。当它出现时，他已经做好了充分的准备来利用它。</p><p class="para">Few people at PARC were as devoted to the machine as Alan Kay. It was as though this was what he had been waiting for all his life—indeed, it had virtually been built to his personal specifications. And when it appeared, he was fully prepared to take advantage of it.</p>
<p class="para">在汤姆索亚历险记中，凯以挥舞着大楼里最迷人的画笔而闻名。没有人比他更能令人信服地宣传他认为有吸引力的想法，无论是他自己的还是别人的。凯是出于需要而宣传。从研究生院毕业时，他写了一篇长达四百页的论文，描述了一种无法物理实现的机器，这种经历让他陷入了心理困境。由于无法执行，他以前的抑郁倾向又复发了。</p><p class="para">Among the Tom Sawyers Kay was known for wielding the most beguiling paintbrush in the building. No one evangelized more convincingly on behalf of ideas he found compelling, whether they were his own or belonged to others. Kay proselytized out of necessity. The experience of emerging from grad school with a four-hundred-page thesis describing a machine that could not be physically realized had sent him into a psychological tailspin. An old tendency toward depression, spurred by his inability to execute, reasserted itself.</p>
<p class="para">“在 PARC 的第一年，在心理治疗中，我发现<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch15.html.page214"></a>“我以前总是混淆自己的才能和性格，”他说，“我没有程序员的性格。我意识到我需要一个团队。”</p><p class="para">“Right about that first year at PARC, under psychotherapy, I discov<a></a>ered I was confusing my talent with my temperament,” he said. “I didn’t have the temperament of a programmer. I realized I needed a group.”</p>
<p class="para">这种顿悟就像一位诗人突然找到了自己的声音。像所有自学成才的人一样，一旦掌握了一个想法，凯就会迫不及待地去研究下一个想法。他是一个性格分裂的人，既是无与伦比的理论制定者，又是注意力不集中的本能工匠。凯在几十年的时间里一直是知识分子中的孤狼，他将自己传达热情的天赋转向吸引追随者的目标，通常是在大学讲座上，他很受欢迎。这有助于他能在一瞬间判断出一个潜在的门徒，而且技术能力并不是先决条件。</p><p class="para">This epiphany resembled that of a poet suddenly finding his voice. Like all the self-educated, having once grasped an idea Kay was impatient to move onto the next. He was a man of bifurcated nature, simultaneously a peerless formulator of theory and an instinctive craftsman with a short attention span. Having spent decades as an intellectual lone wolf, Kay redirected his gift for communicating enthusiasm toward the goal of attracting followers, often at the university lectures for which he was much in demand. It helped that he could size up a potential disciple in a split second, and that technical aptitude was not a prerequisite.</p>
<p class="para">“在我演讲结束后，总会有相当多的人在演讲结束时眼中闪烁着星星。在那个阶段，没有人真正知道如何做这些事情，所以我倾向于雇佣那些能够接受整个事情的浪漫的人，因为你可以在浪漫方面走得很远。”</p><p class="para">“After I would give a talk there would always be a fair number of people who would come up at the end with special stars in their eyes. At that stage nobody really knew how to do this stuff anyway, so I tended to hire people who could buy into the romance of the whole thing, because you could go a really good distance on romance.”</p>
<p class="para">在大楼内，只要离凯的门几码远，就不可能不感觉到引力。也许他最重要的新兵就这样被卷入了他的轨道，再也没有离开过。丹·英格尔斯以临时合同的形式来到 PARC，帮助乔治·怀特安装他为语音识别工作购买的 SDS Sigma 3。</p><p class="para">Inside the building it was impossible to pass within a few yards of Kay’s door without sensing a gravitational tug. Perhaps his most important recruit was swept into his orbit that way, never to leave. Dan Ingalls had come to PARC on a temporary contract to help George White set up the SDS Sigma 3 he had acquired for his work in speech recognition.</p>
<p class="para">“我的办公室最终位于艾伦办公室的对面，”英格尔斯说。“我不断注意到，我对大厅对面听到的内容比对我受雇从事的演讲工作更感兴趣。我偷听的这些对话都是关于开放式计算机科学的东西，我对此很感兴趣。有一天，我走过去说，‘嘿，你在做什么？’这导致他谈论了他对个人计算的整体看法，以及如何通过某种新语言简单地完成许多重要的事情。”</p><p class="para">“My office ended up across the hall from Alan’s,” Ingalls said. “I kept noticing that I was more interested in what I was hearing across the hall than in the speech work I was hired to do. These conversations I was eavesdropping on were all about open-ended computer science stuff, which I was interested in. One day I walked over and said, ‘Hey, what are you up to?’ And that led to his talking about his whole picture of personal computing and how one might make a simple job of a lot of the important things through some new language.”</p>
<p class="para">Alan Kay 在 Ideaspace 上大展身手，是一股非常强大的力量。Ingalls 急于完成 White 的工作，然后在走廊对面为自己争取到了一份全职工作。Kay 告诉 Ingalls 他的新型计算机语言计划时，并没有做白日梦。他所设想的可能将成为他一生中看到的第一个项目<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch15.html.page215"></a>直到实现。事实证明，丹·英格尔斯 (Dan Ingalls) 正是他所需要的人选。</p><p class="para">Alan Kay on a tear through Ideaspace was a very formidable force. Ingalls hastened to finish his job for White, then cadged himself a full-time appointment across the hall. Kay had not been daydreaming when he told Ingalls about his plans for a new computer language. What he had in mind would become perhaps the first project in his life he would see <a></a>through to fruition. Dan Ingalls, it turned out, was the person he needed to make it happen.</p>
<p class="para">到 1973 年中期，凯所谓的“学习研究小组”成员已达 8 人。他们的技能和资历非常杂乱，以至于鲍勃·泰勒开始称他们为“极端分子”，这并非完全是开玩笑。</p><p class="para">By mid—1973 Kay’s so-called “Learning Research Group” numbered eight. They were so miscellaneous in their skills and credentials that Bob Taylor took to calling them, not entirely facetiously, “the lunatic fringe.”</p>
<p class="para">英格尔斯带上了他的朋友泰德·凯勒，后者也来帮乔治·怀特完成语音识别项目，但觉得 Ideaspace 更有趣。黛安娜·梅里的路线更加随机。她是一名移居爱荷华州的人，几乎没有接受过编程培训，她得到了一份工作，担任综合科学实验室经理杰拉尔德·卢科夫斯基和约翰·乌尔巴赫的秘书。</p><p class="para">Ingalls brought along his friend Ted Kaehler, who had also come to help George White with his speech recognition project but found Ideaspace more interesting. Diana Merry’s route was even more random. A transplanted Iowan with little programming training, she got a job as secretary to Gerald Lucovsky and John Urbach, managers in the General Sciences Lab.</p>
<p class="para">然而，从一开始，梅里就被泰勒的工作和“走廊尽头电脑人员之间”的其他神秘活动所吸引，她大部分的空闲时间都花在了那里，她后来回忆道。最终，泰勒设法让她调任杰里·艾尔金德的助理。</p><p class="para">From the first, however, Merry was entranced by Taylor’s work and the other mysterious goings-on “down the hall among the computer folks” where she spent most of her free hours, as she recalled later. Eventually Taylor managed to get her transferred to a job as Jerry Elkind’s assistant.</p>
<p class="para">办公室里的一台机器是一台精密的电动打字机，它可以通过应用复杂的按键序列进行最低限度的文本格式化。除了梅里，没有人利用过这台笨重设备的功能，有一天，他被艾伦·凯发现在打字。</p><p class="para">One of the office machines there was an elaborate electric typewriter that could do minimal text formatting through the application of a complicated sequence of keystrokes. No one ever utilized the beastly device’s capability except Merry, who was caught at it one day by Alan Kay.</p>
<p class="para">“你是一名程序员！”他惊呼道。</p><p class="para">“You’re a programmer!” he exclaimed.</p>
<p class="para">“没开玩笑，”她说。</p><p class="para">“No kidding,” she said.</p>
<p class="para">凯对这个从物理实验室偷偷溜过来的秘书的天赋印象深刻，于是对她进行了几个小时的基本培训。之后，把她分配到自己的小组就成了一件相对简单的事情。</p><p class="para">Impressed by the natural skills of this secretary smuggled over from the physics lab, Kay gave her a few hours of rudimentary training. After that it was a relatively simple matter to get her assigned to his group.</p>
<p class="para">然后是阿黛尔·戈德堡，一位来自密歇根大学和芝加哥大学的教育技术专家，有着一头火红的头发和敏捷的思维过程（“我们形容阿黛尔的说话能力只有兰普森的十分之一”，梅里回忆道）。凯让团队更加充实，其中包括特斯勒，他和比尔·英格利什大致各占一半，直到吉普赛完成后，他才全职加入 LRG；克里斯·杰弗斯，凯的儿时好友和“参谋长”；还有实习生和暑期学生，他们的眼睛里闪烁着那种明显的光芒，误入他的圈子。</p><p class="para">Then there was Adele Goldberg, an educational technology specialist from the universities of Michigan and Chicago with fiery red hair and a turbocharged thought process (“Adele we described as speaking at ninetenths of a Lampson,” Merry recalled). Kay filled out the team with, among others, people like Tesler, whom he shared on a roughly fifty-fifty basis with Bill English until after Gypsy was finished, when he joined LRG full-time; Chris Jeffers, the childhood friend and “chief of staff”; and interns and summer students who strayed into his orbit with that telltale shimmer in their eyes.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch15.html.page216"></a>
<p class="para">凯喜欢他的员工背景各异，但并不总是包括攻读博士学位。“只要能让三位教员签名，就可以成为博士论文，”他会在他们辩护时这样说（引用曾为他签名的伊万·萨瑟兰的话）。或者：“观点价值 80 点智商。”他不在乎他的员工是否拥有博士学位——尽管他确实雇佣了很大比例的学术天才科学家和工程师——但他会一丝不苟地监控他们的观点。</p><p class="para">Kay reveled in his people’s eclectic backgrounds, which did not always include work toward a doctorate. “A doctoral thesis is anything you can get three faculty members to sign,” he would say in their defense (quoting Ivan Sutherland, who had been a signer of his). Or: “Point of view is worth eighty IQ points.” He did not care if his recruits had doctorates—although he certainly employed a high percentage of academically gifted scientists and engineers—but he monitored their points of view meticulously.</p>
<p class="para">和泰勒一样，他坚信实验室的成功取决于共同的愿景。但他决心避免泰勒的军事化纪律倾向。学习研究小组的教条源自艾伦·凯的思想，就像 CSL 的教条源自泰勒或兰普森的思想一样，但实验室的氛围不像军营，而更像是波西米亚风格的派对，客人们碰巧都同意主人选择的葡萄酒。</p><p class="para">Like Taylor, he believed strongly that a lab’s success depended on a shared vision. But he was determined to avoid Taylor’s tendency toward militaristic discipline. The Learning Research Group’s dogma sprung from Alan Kay’s mind as surely as CSL’s did from Taylor’s or Lampson’s, but the lab’s ambiance was less like an Army barracks than a bohemian party where the guests all happened to concur in their host’s choice of wine.</p>
<p class="para">PARC 的任何一个角落都没有像 Kay 团队那样产生过如此自由的狂热。“那是一个令人惊奇的诱人环境，”梅里回忆道。“我经常在那里待到深夜。人们充满了想法和兴奋，当然每个人都比其他人更了解世界应该是什么样子。”</p><p class="para">No corner of PARC generated anything like the Kay group’s free-wheeling mania. “It was an amazingly seductive environment,” recalled Merry. “I was there late at night all the time. People were so full of ideas and excitement, and of course everybody knew more than anybody else about how the world was supposed to be.”</p>
<p class="para">从社交角度来看，学习研究小组也是 PARC 最具凝聚力的单位。“小组成员之间有一种非常美妙、亲切的感觉，真正体现了彼此关心和相互支持，”梅里说。凯努力通过赞助团队一年一度的“外出”活动来建立同事关系，这些活动在他们最喜欢的度假胜地举行，即位于圣克鲁斯南部的海滨度假胜地帕哈罗沙丘，距离帕洛阿尔托只有几个小时的车程。在这里，他们可以一起花三四天时间自由参观 Ideaspace，工作压力被小心地放在了次要位置。后来，在凯和杰弗斯的启发下，更有音乐天赋的小组成员开始参加午餐时间的即兴演奏会（“我们演奏得不好，但很有热情”，驻场单簧管演奏家戈德堡回忆道）——包括吹长笛的英格尔斯和努力跟上自高中以来很少碰过的小号的梅里。 “曾经有句老笑话说，我们真的不在乎新员工是否会做计算机科学，我们真正需要的是一把低音提琴，”她说。</p><p class="para">Socially the Learning Research Group was also PARC’s most cohesive unit. “There was just a wonderful, personal feel to the group that spoke really of caring about one another and supporting one another,” Merry said. Kay strived to build collegiality by sponsoring annual team “offsites” at a favorite retreat, the seaside resort of Pajaro Dunes located south of Santa Cruz, a couple of hours by car from Palo Alto. Here they could spend three or four days together on unstructured tours of Ideaspace, the pressures of work carefully relegated to the background. Later in time and inspired by Kay and Jeffers, the more musically inclined group members took to engaging in ragged lunchtime jam sessions (“We played poorly but with great zest,” recalled Goldberg, the house clarinetist)—including Ingalls on flute and Merry trying to keep up on a trumpet she had rarely touched since high school. “There used to be an old joke that we really didn’t care whether a new recruit could do any computer science, what we really needed was a bass fiddle,” she said.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch15.html.page217"></a>
<p class="para">凯回忆说，即使回到家，这个团队也会把白天的大部分时间“花在 PARC 之外，打网球、骑自行车、喝啤酒、吃中国菜，并不断谈论 Dynabook 及其扩大人类影响力的潜力，以及为迫切需要它的摇摇欲坠的文明带来新的思维方式（这种目标在 20 世纪 60 年代后在加州很常见）。”</p><p class="para">Even back home, Kay recalled, the group spent much of the daytime “outside of PARC, playing tennis, bike-riding, drinking beer, eating Chinese food, and constantly talking about the Dynabook and its potential to amplify human reach and bring new ways of thinking to a faltering civilization that desperately needed it (that kind of goal was common in California in the aftermath of the Sixties).”</p>
<p class="para">尽管这个团队的结构很松散，但每个人都知道智力力量在哪里。那就是艾伦·凯和丹·英格尔斯的组合。他们是 PARC 的又一个合作伙伴，就像梅特卡夫/博格斯和兰普森/德意志一样，不太可能、难以置信，但力量强大得惊人。英格尔斯在凯的职业生涯中扮演了一个似乎没有人愿意或能够承担的角色。他是艾伦的现实过滤器。众所周知，凯的想法往往包含大约 200% 的技术实用性。但很少有人愿意仔细研究整个沙箱以找出实用的部分。正如兰普森回忆的那样，“艾伦会过来，说，我想做<span class="italic">x</span>和<span class="italic">y</span>。你会问他四个问题，关于这实际上将如何运作，你会发现它实际上行不通。所以在 CSL，我们会说，‘不，我们不想做那个。’”</p><p class="para">Loose as the group’s structure was, everyone understood where the intellectual power lay. It was in the combination of Alan Kay and Dan Ingalls. They were yet another PARC partnership, like Metcalfe/Boggs and Lampson/Deutsch, that was unlikely, implausible, and uncannily powerful. Ingalls filled a role in Kay’s professional life no one else had seemed willing or able to undertake. He was Alan’s reality filter. It was no secret that Kay’s ideas tended to embrace about 200 percent of what was technically practical. But there were few people around willing to sift through the whole sandbox to identify the pragmatic parts. As Lampson recalled, “Alan would come around and say, I want to do <span class="italic">x</span> and <span class="italic">y</span>. You would ask him four questions about how this is actually going to work and you’d discover that it isn’t actually going to work. So at CSL we’d say, ‘No, we don’t want to build that.’”</p>
<p class="para">但英格尔斯天生擅长挑选 Ideaspace 中切实可行的子集，并付诸实践。甚至在第一台 Altos 设计和制造出来之前，英格尔斯就已经开始研究这样一个子集。当机器完成时，他的努力已经产生了计算机科学的杰作 Smalltalk。</p><p class="para">But Ingalls was an instinctive master at picking out the subset of Ideaspace that was actually doable, and doing it. Even before the first Altos were designed and built, Ingalls had started working on one such subset. By the time the machines were finished, his efforts had yielded the masterpiece of computer science called Smalltalk.</p>
<p class="para">Smalltalk 让凯伊的名声比英格尔斯更大，但凯伊永远不会忘记是谁将它从想法变成了现实。</p><p class="para">Smalltalk would make Kay’s reputation more than Ingalls’s, but Kay never forgot who transformed it from idea to reality.</p>
<p class="para">他后来说，“如果没有丹·英格尔斯，根本就没人会知道我。”</p><p class="para">“Nobody would ever have heard of me,” he said later, “if it wasn’t for Dan Ingalls.”</p>

<p class="para">Kay 总是声称自己最好的想法都是在淋浴时产生的。34 号楼地下室有一个淋浴间，非常方便。更方便的是，他一天中效率最高的时段从来不用淋浴间——从早上四点（他通常上班的时间）到八点左右（团队其他成员开始入睡的时间）。</p><p class="para">Kay always claimed to get his best ideas in the shower. Conveniently, Building 34 had a shower in the basement. More expediently, it was never in use during his most productive time of the day—from four in the morning, when he typically came to work, until about eight, when the rest of his team would start drifting in.</p>
<p class="para">一天早上，他从地下室出来，遇到了凯勒<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch15.html.page218"></a>和 Ingalls 在走廊上闲聊时谈到“编程语言要有多大才能拥有如此强大的功能”，他回忆道。 Kay 瞬间提出了一个挑战，几乎和 Thacker 接受 Bill Vitek 的挑战一样大胆。</p><p class="para">Emerging from the basement one morning, he came upon Kaehler <a></a>and Ingalls in a hallway bull session about “how large a programming language would have to be to have great power,” as he recalled the scene. In a flash Kay posed a dare almost as audacious as the one Thacker had accepted from Bill Vitek.</p>
<p class="para">“我竭尽全力，声称你可以在一页代码中定义世界上最强大的语言。他们说，‘要么接受，要么闭嘴。’”</p><p class="para">“With as much panache as I could muster, I asserted that you could define the most powerful language in the world in a page of code. They said, ‘Put up or shut up.’”</p>
<p class="para">Kay 的挑战源自他对编程语言应实现什么的信念。语言不仅仅是程序：它们是思维过程本身的蓝图，是计算机<span class="italic">及其</span>程序员的软件。几乎从他接触第一台计算机的那一刻起，Kay 就明白，一个伟大系统的标志必须是它的简单性。只有这样，人们才能确定它已经完全提炼出其本质。</p><p class="para">Kay’s challenge was grounded in his convictions about what a programming language should accomplish. Languages are much more than mere programs: They are blueprints for the thought process itself, software for the computer <span class="italic">and</span> its programmer. Almost from the moment he had encountered his first computer, Kay understood that the hallmark of a great system must be its simplicity. Only then can one be certain it has been fully distilled down to its essentials.</p>
<p class="para">对他来说，编写一个紧凑到可以放在一页纸上的程序有两个主要优点。它迫使他将其精简到最精简，并且符合他的思维地理感。通过让语言的结构被一眼看透，他可以展示其所有单个组件是如何成为整体的相互关联的部分。</p><p class="para">For him, writing a program tight enough to fit on a page had two chief virtues. It forced him to pare it to the bone, and it suited his sense of mental geography. By allowing the structure of the language to be absorbed in a single eyeful, he could show how all its individual components were interrelated pieces of the whole.</p>
<p class="para">过去几年，这种对简单性的追求使他重新审视了他在空军和犹他州的<span class="italic">临时</span>学习期间吸收的所有有关编程和计算机架构的想法。凯勒和英格尔斯的挑战促使他坐下来，把自己的想法写在纸上。</p><p class="para">Over the previous few years this striving for simplicity had led him to reexamine all the ideas about programming and computer architectures he had absorbed during his <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> studies in the Air Force and at Utah. The challenge from Kaehler and Ingalls provoked him to sit down and arrange his thoughts on paper.</p>
<p class="para">传统的编程语言区分数据和作用于数据的过程：程序员定义一组数据变量，例如整数 3 和 4，然后使用过程“+”对它们进行运算以产生结果“7”。</p><p class="para">Traditional programming languages make a distinction between data and the procedures acting on them: The programmer defines a set of data variables as, say, the integers 3 and 4, then operates on them with the procedure “+” to produce the result “7.”</p>
<p class="para">表面上看，这很简单。但 Kay 对这种结构不满意的地方在于，随着数据越来越复杂，运算越来越多，程序的复杂性很快就变得无法控制 — — 即使所需的答案仍然是单个整数 7。</p><p class="para">Simple enough on its face. What dissatisfied Kay about this sort of structure was that as the data got more complex and the operations proliferated, the program’s complexity quickly got out of hand—even if the desired answer was still the single integer 7.</p>
<p class="para">使用传统语言来让 Seymour Papert 的显示龟沿着随机路径移动，需要程序员调动他或她对数据流动的复杂路径的所有知识<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch15.html.page219"></a>通过计算机，进行处理、翻译和重新排列，然后将其呈现在纸上——只是为了在屏幕上得到一张简单的图片！</p><p class="para">Using a traditional language to send Seymour Papert’s display turtle along a random path would require a programmer to summon all his or her knowledge of the convoluted routes by which data wend their way <a></a>through the computer, get crunched, translated, and rearranged, and lay them out on paper—just to get a simple picture on a screen!</p>
<p class="para">当变量定义数字以外的内容时，这些系统也会遇到麻烦，例如名字“John”和“Mary”。如果发送“+”来对<span class="italic">它们</span>进行操作，计算机几乎肯定会因为混乱而崩溃。（如何“添加”单词？）您实际上需要将 John 和 Mary 定义为某种数字形式，告诉系统如何将一个“+”到另一个，这样才能得到所需的答案——也许是“John, Mary”。</p><p class="para">These systems also ran into trouble when the variables defined something other than numbers—the names “John” and “Mary,” say. If one sent “+” to operate on <span class="italic">them</span>, the computer would almost certainly crash out of pure confusion. (How does one “add” words?) You would actually need to define John and Mary as some form of number that told the system how to “+” one to the other so the desired answer would result—“John, Mary,” perhaps.</p>
<p class="para">Kay 的目标是创建一种语言，让程序员能够通过简单的路径获得简单的结果，而无需考虑底层的复杂操作。他称之为“隐藏细节”。毕竟，人们不需要知道电视机的工作原理就能打开电视机并找到自己喜欢的节目——为什么需要知道所有数据和程序的细节才能将简单的图像映射到计算机屏幕上？</p><p class="para">Kay’s goal was to create a language that enabled the programmer to arrive at a simple result by a simple path, regardless of the complex operations taking place beneath the surface. He called this “hiding the details.” After all, one does not need to know how a television works to be able to switch it on and find one’s favorite show—why should it be necessary to know all the details of data and procedure to map a simple image to a computer screen?</p>
<p class="para">他的解决方案是发明一种全新的计算机编程语法，这种语法不是基于数据和程序，而是基于称为“对象”的离散编程代码模块。对象可以被认为是黑匣子，就像电视机一样。它们结合了数据<span class="italic">和</span>将在其上运行的程序，并通过向其发送“消息”进行操作。就像点击遥控器上的“开”按钮会向电视发送一条“消息”以打开它一样，在 Kay 的系统中，人们向对象“3”发送消息“+ 4”。对象知道将其解释为简单的加法，并返回 7。</p><p class="para">His solution was to invent an entirely new syntax of computer programming based not on data and procedures, but discrete modules of programming code called “objects.” Objects can be thought of as black boxes, like the television set. They combine data <span class="italic">and</span> the procedures that will work on them, and are manipulated by sending them “messages.” Just as clicking the “on” button of a remote control sends the TV a “message” to turn itself on, in Kay’s system one sends the object “3” the message “+ 4.” The object knows to interpret that as a simple addition, and returns 7.</p>
<p class="para">乍一看，这可能很复杂。但与传统语言相比，面向对象编程随着数据和操作的复杂化而变得相对简单。原因是底层计算始终隐藏在对象中，无需程序员显式调用。例如，只需向对象“John”发送消息“+ Mary”，即可知道“+”在此上下文中只能表示一件事：在逗号后将“Mary”附加到自身。</p><p class="para">This may seem complex at first. But in contrast to traditional languages, object-oriented programming becomes relatively simpler as the data and operations become more complex. The reason is that the underlying calculations always remain hidden within the object, never needing to be explicitly invoked by the programmer. The object “John,” for example, needs only to be sent the message “+ Mary” to know that “+” in this context can mean only one thing: to append “Mary” to itself after a comma.</p>
<p class="para">尽管 Kay 从几种著名的语言和计算机系统中汲取了“面向对象编程”的原理，但他的体系让许多受过传统训练的程序员<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch15.html.page220"></a>从一开始就令人困惑。这就像一个人试图用传统的英语单词发明一种新的文学语言，但却设计出全新的意义规则。单词看起来很熟悉，但它们在句子中相互关联的方式似乎令人费解——直到读者破译了新规则。</p><p class="para">Although Kay drew the principles of what became known as “object-oriented programming” from several well-known languages and computer systems, his system left many traditionally trained programmers <a></a>befuddled from the start. It was as if one tried to invent a new literary language using conventional English words but devising radically new rules of meaning. The individual words would look familiar, but the way in which they related to each other in a sentence would seem impenetrable—until the reader decoded the new rules, that is.</p>
<p class="para">CSL 程序员 Warren Teitelman 是 Lisp 语言的世界大师，也是 Kay 思想的主要来源，他一开始就觉得 Smalltalk 令人困惑。“人们习惯于从指令和命令的角度来思考程序。如果你用这些术语来思考，那么 Smalltalk 会给你带来很多困难。当你看到它时，你的第一反应是，好吧，我有点理解了，但是工作在哪里完成的呢？”</p><p class="para">The CSL programmer Warren Teitelman, a world master of the language Lisp—a key source of Kay’s ideas—was one who found Smalltalk perplexing at first. “People were used to thinking about programs in terms of instructions and imperatives. If you thought in those terms you had a lot of difficulty with Smalltalk. When you looked at it, your first reaction was, OK, I sort of understand it, but where does the work get done?”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">Kay 的队友要求他在一页纸上定义一种语言，经过八天从<span class="smallCaps">凌晨</span>4 点到<span class="smallCaps">早上</span>8 点的奋斗，Kay 终于手握这门新语言的蓝图，名字并不起眼。Smalltalk 非常紧凑，可以在一页代码中定义自己（尽管随着它变得越来越全面，页面变得越来越大，Kay 的笔迹也越来越细）。它很慢，因为它给计算机带来了不同寻常的负担。但它的灵活性令人惊讶。</p><p class="para">Having been challenged by his teammates to define a language on a page, Kay emerged after eight days of 4 <span class="smallCaps">A.M.</span> to 8 <span class="smallCaps">A.M.</span> struggle with a blueprint in hand for this new language with an unassuming name. Smalltalk was compact enough to define itself in a page of code (although as it grew more comprehensive, the pages got bigger and Kay’s handwriting more minute). It was slow, because it placed an unusual workload on the computer. But it was astonishingly flexible.</p>
<p class="para">因为任何东西都可以是“对象”，无论是数字、单词、列表还是图片，Smalltalk 特别适合在计算机显示器上表示图形图像。这一点在 Alto 准备就绪之前就已经很明显了。学习研究小组在配备笨重字符生成器的 Novas 上测试了他们的胚胎系统，并按分数生成了新字体和半色调位图。Alto 出现后，这个过程加快了速度，因为 Kay 的团队增强了 Smalltalk 的图形功能，超过了 PARC 开发的任何其他功能。</p><p class="para">Because anything could be an “object,” whether numeral, word, list, or picture, Smalltalk lent itself especially well to representing graphic images on a computer display. That became evident even in the days before the Alto was ready. The Learning Research Group tested their embryonic system on Novas equipped with their big, lumbering character generators and turned out new typefaces and half-tone bitmaps by the score. Once the Alto came along, this process picked up speed as Kay’s group enhanced Smalltalk with graphical capabilities that exceeded anything else being developed at PARC.</p>
<p class="para">事实上，Kay 迫不及待地想要得到 Alto，他甚至没有等到第一批完全设计好的带有印刷电路板的模型像其他实验室一样从埃尔塞贡多的生产线上下来。相反，他征用了六台机器，用最初两台原型机上使用的笨重且不可靠的绕线电路制造，然后将其安装在 34 号楼的地下室。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch15.html.page221"></a>他的想法是，即使这些计算机运行不稳定且难以维护，他也能以更低的价格和更快的速度获得它们。他还订购了第一批 Altos，其低端选项只有 96,000 字节内存，而不是最高 128,000 字节。第一批机器还配备了 250 万字节或 2.5 兆字节的存储磁盘。（相比之下，当今的家用和办公 PC 通常配备至少 3200 万或 6400 万<span class="italic">字节</span>内存和 40 到 80<span class="italic">亿</span>字节的存储磁盘。）</p><p class="para">In fact, Kay was so impatient to get his hands on the Alto that he did not even wait for the first fully engineered models with printed circuit boards to come off the production line set up in El Segundo, like the rest of the labs. Instead he requisitioned six machines to be built with the same clumsy and unreliable wire-wrapped circuitry used in the original two prototypes, which he proceeded to install in the basement of Building 34. <a></a>The idea was that he could get them cheaper and faster, even if they turned out to be flaky in operation and hard to maintain. He also ordered these first Altos with the low-end option of only 96,000 bytes of memory, rather than the maximum 128,000 bytes. The first machines also came with a 2.5-million byte, or 2.5-megabyte, storage disk. (By comparison, today’s household and office PCs often come with at least 32 or 64 <span class="italic">million</span> bytes of memory and four to eight <span class="italic">billion</span> byte storage disks.)</p>
<p class="para">在这种吝啬的配置下，Smalltalk 运行速度非常慢，部分原因是全屏显示就消耗了 64,000 字节，几乎没有留给程序内核。当 Kay 意识到自己是在虚度光阴，并试图偷偷摸摸地购买几台高性能机型时，这些机器已经非常抢手，以至于没有人愿意让他插手。“算了吧，艾伦，”被逗乐的 Ed McCreight 告诫道。“你才是搞砸的人。”</p><p class="para">Under this miserly configuration Smalltalk ran painfully slowly, in part because the full-screen display alone consumed 64,000 bytes, leaving almost nothing for the program kernel. By the time Kay recognized that he had engaged in a false economy and tried to scrounge a few high-performance models out of turn, the machines were such a sought-after sensation that no one would let him cut in. “Forget it, Alan,” admonished an amused Ed McCreight. “You’re the one who screwed up.”</p>
<p class="para">但是，当 Kay 终于为他的所有机器配备了足够的内存后，Smalltalk 满足了所有开发人员的期望。当 CSL 工程师忙于编写程序以尽可能快地让 Altos 运行，格式化同样枯燥乏味的文本文档时，那些疯狂的人却将机器的图形功能发挥到了极致。典型的学习研究小组程序不是黑白文本的集合，而是图画、半色调照片甚至动画图片的盛宴。“对象意味着多媒体文档，”Kay 会说。“你几乎免费获得它们。”</p><p class="para">But once Kay finally got all his machines retrofitted with adequate memory, Smalltalk fulfilled all its developers’ expectations. While the CSL engineers busied themselves with programs to format the same dull text-heavy documents as fast as they could make the Altos run, the lunatic fringe worked the machines’ graphical capabilities to the bone. A typical Learning Research Group program was no blob of black-on-white text but a carnival of drawings, half-tone photographs, even animated pictures. “Objects mean multimedia documents,” Kay would say. “You almost get them for free.”</p>
<p class="para">因此，该小组的程序倾向于艺术家而非科学家。在 Thacker 的帮助下，LRG 工程师 Bob Shur 为 Alto 编写了音乐合成器功能，使机器能够同时输出 12 个实时声音，对于 Alto 这样的规模的机器来说，这是一项惊人的功能。</p><p class="para">As a result, the group’s programs tended to favor the artist over the scientist. An LRG engineer named Bob Shur had programmed, with Thacker’s help, a musical synthesizer capability into the Alto that allowed the machine to output twelve real-time voices at once, an astonishing capability for a machine of the Alto’s scale.</p>
<p class="para">随后，在 1975 年秋天，Ted Kaehler（虽然他自己并不是音乐家）开发了一个名为“Twang”的程序。这是一个可视化界面，可以访问许多音乐合成器程序，这些程序可以在 Alto 上捕捉、创作、编辑和重放音乐。Twang 使用了一种非传统的符号，即不同长度和位置的黑条来表示不同的音调和节奏值，刻意模仿自动钢琴卷上的穿孔。Twang 的不同寻常之处在于它几乎可以在真实世界中工作<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch15.html.page222"></a>时间。所有以前的计算机音乐程序，包括由斯坦福大学的 John Chowning 开发的开创性的“FM”，都必须进行编译，这意味着需要几个小时的编程和调试才能制作出五分钟的即兴重复乐段。而有了 Twang，就不需要这样做了，因为人们可以用 Twang 创作和编程多达八个声部的复音乐段，速度几乎与敲击连接的钢琴键盘一样快。</p><p class="para">Then, in the fall of 1975, Ted Kaehler, although no musician himself, developed a program called “Twang.” This was a visual interface to a number of music synthesizer programs that could capture, compose, edit, and replay music on the Alto. Twang used a nontraditional notation, black bars of differing lengths and locations to indicate differing tonic and rhythmic values, that deliberately resembled the perforations on a player piano roll. Twang was unusual in that it worked virtually in real <a></a>time. All previous computer music programs, including the pioneering “FM” developed by John Chowning at Stanford, had to be compiled, meaning that several hours of programming and debugging were necessary to produce a five-minute riff. That was unnecessary with Twang, with which one could compose and program a polyphonic passage with as many as eight voices almost as fast as one could hit the keys on an attached piano keyboard.</p>

<p class="para">当 Merry、Ingalls、Kaehler、Tesler 和其他人忙于在 Alto 上实现严肃的 Smalltalk 工具时，Kay 决定兑现他最初的主张，即 Smalltalk 将是一种简单到儿童都可以使用的语言。1973 年夏天，他和 Adele Goldberg 召集了一群热切的青少年，开始教他们如何编程。这一努力很快导致 Kay 与 PARC 管理层再次发生痛苦的冲突。</p><p class="para">While Merry, Ingalls, Kaehler, Tesler, and others engaged in the grown-up activity of implementing serious Smalltalk tools on the Alto, Kay decided to make good on his original claim that Smalltalk would be a language simple enough for children to use. In the summer of 1973 he and Adele Goldberg assembled a group of eager preadolescents and started teaching them how to program. The effort would shortly lead to another of Kay’s painful run-ins with PARC management.</p>
<p class="para">这些孩子都不是普通的孩子。戈德堡从帕洛阿尔托乔丹路中学七年级的高级班开始教起，这所中学服务于距离斯坦福校园一英里左右的一个上层中产阶级社区。每周一到两次，孩子们会乘坐公共汽车或骑自行车上山来到 34 号楼，然后被护送到地下室，那里摆满了凯的原装电线缠绕的 Altos。</p><p class="para">These were not average youngsters. Goldberg started with an advanced class of seventh-graders at Palo Alto’s Jordan Road Middle School, which served an upper-middle-class neighborhood a mile or so from the Stanford campus. Once or twice a week the kids came up the hill by bus or bicycle to Building 34, to be escorted to a roomful of Kay’s original wire-wrapped Altos down in the basement.</p>
<p class="para">戈德堡用她灵感迸发的 Smalltalk 程序加载了这些程序，她称之为“一个名叫乔的盒子”。乔是一个有轮廓的正方形，是西摩·帕普特的 LOGO 海龟的直系后代。七年级学生用一系列一行命令就可以让它出现在屏幕上、侧身转动、变大或变小，或者消失。通过按顺序排列命令，他们实现了基本的动画。</p><p class="para">Goldberg loaded these with an inspired Smalltalk program she called “A Box Named Joe.” Joe, an outlined square, was a direct descendant of Seymour Papert’s LOGO turtle. With a series of one-line commands the seventh-graders could make it appear on the screen, turn on its side, grow larger or smaller, or disappear. By arraying the commands in a sequence, they achieved rudimentary animation.</p>
<p class="para">这次邂逅让彼此都受益匪浅。尽管这些年轻人大多生长在富裕且聪明的家庭，但他们还是惊讶地发现成年人如此天真地对他们正在萌芽的智力感兴趣。</p><p class="para">The encounter was mutually enlightening. Although these youngsters had for the most part grown up in privileged and brainy homes, they were surprised to come across grownups so guilelessly interested in their burgeoning intellects.</p>
<p class="para">“当你还是个孩子的时候，大人要么不想让你在身边，要么当你问问题时他们会教训你，”当时十二岁的玛丽安·戈尔丁 (Marian Goldeen) 回忆道，她是帕洛阿尔托一位钢琴老师和一位商人的女儿。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch15.html.page223"></a>“但她们不是那样的。阿黛尔怀孕了，但她看起来比我想象中的从事电脑工作的人年轻得多。”</p><p class="para">“When you’re a kid, adults either don’t want you around, or when you ask a question they give you a lecture,” recalled Marian Goldeen, then twelve, the daughter of a Palo Alto piano teacher and a businessman. <a></a>“But they weren’t like that. Adele was pregnant, but she looked a lot younger than someone I thought would be working with computers.”</p>
<p class="para">这些科学家中，有些已经成年，但很少有人家中有青少年，他们发现与十二三岁的孩子打交道是一件令人大开眼界的事情，这些孩子本能地掌握了编程的基本知识。一个周末，戈尔丁是数学专业的优等生，但从未编写过计算机程序，他带着戈德堡的几条建议回家，冷静地带着一个功能齐全的绘画程序回来了，这个程序有一个各种形状的菜单，用户可以从中选择自定义“画笔”。两个年纪较大的学生设计了写出乐谱或绘制电路图的程序，这是 Twang 和 SIL 的初级版本。</p><p class="para">The scientists, some with young families of their own but few with teenagers around the house, found it eye-opening to deal with twelve-and thirteen-year-olds who grasped the basics of programming instinctively. One weekend Goldeen, who was an honor student in mathematics but had never programmed a computer, went home armed with a few pointers from Goldberg and coolly returned with a full-blown paint program, complete with a menu of varied shapes from which the user could select a custom “brush.” Two older students contrived programs that wrote out musical scores or drew circuit diagrams, junior versions of Twang and SIL.</p>
<p class="para">几个学期后，凯以他特有的大胆尝试扩大他的实验。乔丹路中学的项目协调员安排为 PARC 的研究人员腾出一间房间，凯决定用一台能用的奥托来装饰房间。不幸的是，偷偷把奥托带出 PARC 场地是对施乐规则的严重违反。凯用一种简单的策略来处理这种影响，即不让管理层知道。一天深夜，他和阿黛尔·戈德堡开着她的旅行车来到 34 号楼的装卸码头，这是唯一一辆足够大到可以装运货物的车。</p><p class="para">A few semesters later Kay attempted with characteristic audacity to broaden his experiment. The program coordinator at Jordan Road Middle School had arranged to make a room available to the PARC researchers, and Kay decided to furnish it with a working Alto. Unhappily, spiriting an Alto off the PARC premises was an outrageous violation of Xerox rules. Kay dealt with the implications by the simple stratagem of keeping management uninformed. Late one night he and Adele Goldberg drove up to the loading dock of Building 34 in her station wagon, the only vehicle anyone owned large enough to carry the cargo.</p>
<p class="para">“这不是违法的吗？”她紧张地问道。凯回答说，别担心。他会承受压力的。</p><p class="para">“Isn’t this illegal?” she asked nervously. Stop worrying, Kay replied. He would take the heat.</p>

<p class="para">帕克深知凯对研究中心的重要性，因此一直对他宽容有加，尽管有些居高临下。“艾伦总是无法抑制，”他说，“你无法控制他。”即使施乐公司在“太空大战”后对未经授权的新闻声明进行了严厉批评，也没有阻止凯同意进行一系列非法示威和厚颜无耻的采访，其中一些采访在斯坦福引起了公愤。加州杂志<span class="italic">《新西部》</span>曾引用他的话说，施乐公司“不懂”计算机，其高管“真的不懂”<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch15.html.page224"></a>不知道我在这里做什么”，杰克·戈德曼不得不以书面形式向施乐公司的高管同事们保证，“艾伦·凯博士是该领域公认的杰出科学家，尽管他在与媒体打交道时有些土里土气，有些不合常规。”（“这篇文章是一篇平淡无奇的新闻报道，作者显然喜欢讽刺大机构，”他补充道。）凯抱怨说他的引言是捏造的。</p><p class="para">Painfully aware of Kay’s value to the research center, Pake had always treated him tolerantly, if condescendingly. “Alan’s irrepressible,” he would say. “You can’t keep him under control.” Even Xerox’s post-“Spacewar” strictures on unauthorized press statements had not stopped Kay from granting a steady stream of illicit demonstrations and brazen interviews, of which some of the latter provoked outrage back in Stamford. The California magazine <span class="italic">New West</span> once quoted him as saying that Xerox “doesn’t understand” computers and its executives “really don’t <a></a>have any idea what I’m doing here,” forcing Jack Goldman to reassure his fellow Xerox executives in writing that “Dr. Alan Kay is a recognized outstanding scientist in his field, albeit somewhat native and unorthodox in his dealings with the press.” (“The article is a piece of undistinguished journalism and the author apparently enjoys sniping at large establishments,” he added.) Kay complained his quotes were fabricated.</p>
<p class="para">帕克曾希望任命哈罗德·霍尔为 SSL 主管，这样或许有助于管束凯伊；毕竟，霍尔养育了五个孩子，其中四个是男孩。“我认为，他就像父亲一样，可以帮助抚养艾伦，”帕克后来说。但霍尔的管教没有奏效。1975 年，更为随和的伯特·萨瑟兰接替霍尔担任 SSL 主管后不久，乔丹丑闻爆发，凯伊再次卷入了头等大事。</p><p class="para">Pake had once hoped that appointing Harold Hall as SSL chief might help rein in Kay; after all, Hall had raised five kids, four of them boys. “I thought, he’s a father figure and he can help to bring Alan up,” Pake said later. But Hall’s discipline did not take. It was shortly after he was succeeded as SSL director in 1975 by the somewhat more accommodating Bert Sutherland that the Jordan scandal erupted, with Kay once again involved in a first-class transgression.</p>
<p class="para">高德曼恰好在场，对他进行了例行的斥责。在帕克的注视下，他严厉斥责凯和杰弗斯违反了施乐公司的保密规定，将专有程序暴露给了世人。</p><p class="para">Goldman happened to be on the scene to deliver the obligatory dressing-down. As Pake looked on, he berated Kay and Jeffers for violating Xerox security and exposing a proprietary program to the world.</p>
<p class="para">“事情真的变得一团糟，”凯回忆道。“戈德曼狠狠地批评了我和克里斯。”但一旦戈德曼满足于扮演坏警察的角色，他就让实验继续下去。凯后来回忆说，他转向帕克，简短地命令道：“让他们做吧！” <span class="sup">*</span></p><p class="para">“The shit really hit the fan,” Kay remembered. “Goldman tore a strip off me and Chris.” But once Goldman had contented himself with playing the bad cop, he let the experiment go on. As Kay recalled later, he turned to Pake and curtly commanded, “Let them do it!”<span class="sup">*</span></p>

<p class="para">1973 年和 1974 年，Alto 的强大功能和潜力让 LRG 的创意环境“成为计算机黑客的梦想”，Ingalls 回忆道。“我们会出去吃午饭、喝啤酒，然后说，‘如果你能做这个或那个，那不是很棒吗？’然后我们会回到 PARC，在一两个小时内做我们说过会很棒的事情。然后我们会进行演示并向 CSL 的同伴们展示它。”</p><p class="para">Through 1973 and 1974 the Alto’s remarkable power and potential made LRG’s creative environment “a computer hacker’s dream come true,” as Ingalls recalled. “We’d go out for lunch and beer and say, ‘Wouldn’t it be great if you could do this or that?’ Then we’d come back to PARC and in an hour or two do the thing we’d said would be so neat. And then we’d give a demo and show it off to our compadres in the CSL.”</p>
<p class="para">这次合作是互补的，主要是因为 Kay 的狂热分子总是以与计算机科学实验室完全不同的方式看待 Alto 的功能。对于 CSL 来说，问题是<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch15.html.page225"></a>他们能够以多快的速度在机器中传输数据，无论是 Bravo 文本还是 Thacker 的设计图。对于 LRG 来说，关键是如何以最令人惊叹、最动态的方式显示相同的数据。</p><p class="para">The partnership was a complementary one, largely because Kay’s lunatic fringe always approached the Alto’s capabilities along completely different lines from the Computer Science Lab. For CSL the issue was <a></a>how rapidly they could move data through the machine, whether it was Bravo text or Thacker’s design schematics. For LRG it was how to display the same data in the most mind-blowing, dynamic way.</p>
<p class="para">“我们的使命是让这款硬件真正发挥其应有的作用，”凯勒回忆道。“让它适合孩子，外观炫酷，反应灵敏。而 CSL 更关心硬核计算机科学问题。他们最终没有在界面上做出太多创新。我们知道我们无法像他们那样设计硬件，但我们可以让界面更具互动性。”</p><p class="para">“Our mission was to really make this hardware do what it was supposed to do,” recalled Kaehler. “Make it suitable for kids, flashy and wonderful, really responsive. And CSL was more concerned with hard-core computer science issues. They wound up not making that many innovations in the interface. We knew we couldn’t design hardware like them, but we could make the interface much more interactive.”</p>
<p class="para">他们就像管弦乐队的成员，同时在作曲和排练交响乐。一天的工作一开始，凯可能会突然闯入梅里和凯勒身边，打断他们辛苦编写某个代码模块的工作。他会在实验室随处可见的白板上潦草地写下一些新想法，直到白板上布满方框，这些方框里又填满了其他方框，箭头指向更多的方框，箭头指向新的方框等等。凯决心要从 Alto 位图中榨干每一点功能。他宣称，显示屏只是在物理尺寸方面很小。就其图形灵活性而言，它是巨大的。从这个角度来看，为什么要阻止用户使用鼠标和绘图程序在屏幕上绘制图片，同时起草描述该过程的备忘录呢？</p><p class="para">They worked like orchestra members composing and rehearsing a symphony at the same time. The day might start with Kay bursting in on Merry and Kaehler, interrupting their hard work on some module of code. He would scrawl some new idea across the lab’s ubiquitous whiteboards until they were covered with boxes filled with other boxes and arrows pointing to yet more boxes with pointers across to new boxes and so on. Kay was determined above all to squeeze every ounce of functionality out of the Alto bitmap. The display screen, he proclaimed, was small only in terms of its physical dimension. In terms of its graphic flexibility, it was colossal. From that standpoint, why should the user be prevented from, say, drawing a picture on the screen using a mouse and a paint program while simultaneously drafting a memo describing the procedure?</p>
<p class="para">不幸的是，答案是 Alto 的 8.5 x 11 英寸屏幕占用的物理空间有限——只有一张书写纸的空间。事实上，这一限制直接导致了他们对计算机屏幕外观最重要的贡献之一——重叠窗口的概念。</p><p class="para">The answer, unfortunately, was that the Alto’s 8½-by-11-inch screen encompassed just so much physical real estate—the space of a single sheet of writing paper. That limitation, as it happened, led directly to one of their most important contributions to the look of the computer screen—the concept of overlapping windows.</p>
<p class="para">这个想法始于将屏幕视为物理桌面。凯认为，办公室里的人们通过将纸张堆叠在一起来解决纸张太多而空间不够的问题。类似的过程是将小图像堆叠在屏幕上——也许以某种方式允许用户跟踪一次打开了多少张纸、多少个项目或多少个窗口，并立即将最重要的一个调到最上面。</p><p class="para">The idea began by thinking of the screen in terms of a physical desktop. People in offices got around the same problem of too much paper and not enough room, Kay reasoned, by piling pages on top of one another. The analogous procedure would be to pile up small images on the screen—perhaps in some way that allowed the user to keep track of how many sheets, or projects, or windows, were open at once and to summon the most important one instantly to the top of the pile.</p>
<p class="para">和往常一样，Kay 在 Ideaspace 中构思一个概念，并询问他的<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch15.html.page226"></a>团队无法将其付诸实践。尽管他们知道如何用多个框（甚至是重叠的框）平铺屏幕，但移动这些框或将其中一个框移到顶部对处理器的要求很高。Alto 以它唯一知道的方式抱怨，以缓慢的速度执行该过程。</p><p class="para">As usual, Kay was formulating a concept in Ideaspace and asking his <a></a>team to implement it in reality. Although they knew how to tile the screen with multiple boxes, even overlapping ones, moving these boxes around or shifting one or another to the top placed enormous demand on the processor. The Alto complained in the only way it knew how, by performing the procedure at a glacial crawl.</p>
<p class="para">几个星期以来，凯勒主要致力于解决重叠窗口难题。团队有一个系统，用于显示其中一人在编码问题上遇到困难并需要交出它。这就是“烫手山芋”：其中一人会小心翼翼地用双手捧着象征性的物体走进另一个人的办公室，然后把它扔到下一个人的腿上。1974 年秋天的一天，凯勒在重叠窗口问题上遇到困难，于是把这个烫手山芋扔到了英格尔斯的腿上，而他解决了这个问题。</p><p class="para">For several weeks Kaehler worked principally on the overlapping-windows puzzle. The team had a system for showing when one of them had hit the wall on a coding problem and needed to hand it off. This was the “hot potato”: One of them would walk into another’s office with the figurative object held gingerly in cupped hands, then drop it into the next one’s lap. Kaehler, having hit the wall on overlapping windows, dropped the hot potato into Ingalls’s lap one day in the fall of 1974, and he solved it.</p>
<p class="para">解决方案来自英格尔斯的一项出色编码，称为“BitBlt”，这是术语“位边界块传输”的缩写，发音为“bitblit”。BitBlt 是一种通过一次操作将位图的整个矩形或块从一个位置移动到另一个位置的方法。它使系统能够绕过深入内存、定位矩形图像的所有组件并逐一更改它们的繁琐工作；从而省去了导致全位图程序如此缓慢的大部分计算。突然间，显示屏上的图形变化更快、更直接，而且从计算角度来看成本大大降低。</p><p class="para">The solution came in the form of a brilliant feat of coding Ingalls called “BitBlt,” an abbreviation of the term “bit boundary block transfer” that was pronounced “bitblit.” BitBlt was a way to shift whole rectangles, or blocks, of the bitmap from one location to another in a single operation. It enabled the system to bypass the tedium of delving into memory, locating all the components of the rectangular image, and changing them one by one; and thus cut out most of the computation that had made full-bitmap procedures so slow. Suddenly graphical changes on the display were faster, more direct, and in computing terms vastly cheaper.</p>
<p class="para">就像车轮或哥特式拱门一样，BitBlt 是那些事前不直观、事后显而易见、最终可适应无限用途的发现之一。文本首次可以以闪电般的速度上下滚动（或横跨屏幕）。您可以绘制一个正方形，并用千鸟格图案填充，然后将其推过屏幕，直到它从侧面消失。或者复制屏幕的某个部分，保存它，并在其位置显示新图像。这是重叠窗口的关键，因为暂时隐藏的屏幕部分（例如，一个窗口在另一个窗口下方）现在可以快速调回视图，就像将隐藏在一叠纸中间的一页纸拉出并转移到顶部一样。“现在，您有一种屏幕显示单独层的错觉，这是以前人们没有做过的，”Ingalls 说。</p><p class="para">Like the wheel or the gothic arch, BitBlt was one of those discoveries that was nonintuitive in advance, obvious in retrospect, and ultimately adaptable to an infinity of uses. For the first time text could scroll up or down—or across the screen—at lightning-fast speed. You could draw a square and fill it with a hound’s-tooth pattern, then push it across the screen until it disappeared off the side. Or make a copy of some part of the screen, save it, and display a new image in its place. This was the key to overlapping windows, for a part of the screen that was temporarily hidden (one window beneath another, for example) could now be called swiftly back into view, as though a page hidden halfway down a stack of papers was pulled out and transferred to the top. “You now had the illusion of a separate layer of screen display, which people weren’t doing before,” Ingalls said.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch15.html.page227"></a>
<p class="para">Kay 的团队努力让这项引人注目的新功能不仅仅是一个有趣的奇特功能。他们将 BitBlt 操作融入到他们开发的用户界面中，直到创建和操作多个窗口（每个窗口运行不同的程序）的操作看起来就像在桌子上翻动文件一样轻松。然后，在 1975 年 2 月，他们让 CSL 知道他们想向他们展示一些东西。</p><p class="para">Kay’s group labored to make this striking new capability more than merely an intriguing oddity. They worked BitBlt operations into their developing user interface until the actions of creating and manipulating multiple windows, each one running a different program, seemed exactly as effortless as shuffling papers on a desk. Then, in February 1975, they let CSL know there were a few things they wanted to show them.</p>
<p class="para">团队为演示做准备就像演员在百老汇试镜一样。泰勒的工程师可能是一个苛刻的观众，他们鄙视那些将浮华置于速度和效率之上的程序。这就是为什么 CSL 的理想仍然是 Bravo，它可以即时响应命令，看起来就像电话簿上的一页一样令人兴奋。</p><p class="para">The team prepared for the demo like actors auditioning for a shot at Broadway. Taylor’s engineers could be a harsh audience, scornful of programs that placed glitz above speed and efficiency. That was why CSL’s ideal was still Bravo, which responded to commands instantaneously and was as exciting to look at as a page from the phone book.</p>
<p class="para">时机一到，英格尔斯就坐在了豆袋室的一台 Alto 电脑上。兰普森、萨克、德意志和 CSL 的大部分员工都在场，还有其他实验室的几名工程师。英格尔斯首先创建了几个窗口，并在其中加载了各种程序：一个窗口显示一幅图画，另一个窗口显示一段 Smalltalk 代码，第三个窗口显示一段很长的文本。他的光标在隐喻性的桌面上流畅地移动着，停下来在这里画一条线，在那里添加一个单词或短语。当观众全神贯注地看着这台像活生生的生物一样灵活的显示器时，英格尔斯几乎忘记了自己。“我们只是随波逐流，做演示，没有想到我们正在做一件以前从未有人见过的事情。”当他正沉浸在例行的剪切粘贴编辑任务中时，他听到一个声音喊道：“嘿！”</p><p class="para">When the moment arrived Ingalls seated himself at an Alto in the beanbag room. Lampson, Thacker, Deutsch, and most of the rest of CSL were there, along with a few engineers from the other labs. Ingalls started by creating a few windows and loading them with various programs: One held a drawing, another a block of Smalltalk code, the third a lengthy block of text. His cursor wandered over the metaphorical desktop with fluid ease, pausing to draw a line here, add a word or phrase there. As his audience watched in rapt fascination at a display that had become as supple as a living creature, Ingalls almost forgot himself. “We were just going along, giving our demo, not thinking about the fact that we were doing something nobody had ever seen before.” He was deep into a routine cut-and-paste editing task when he heard a voice shout, “Hey!”</p>
<p class="para">英格尔斯停顿了一下。彼得·多伊奇站了起来，指着屏幕。“你刚才做的是不是和我想的一样？”他说。</p><p class="para">Ingalls paused. Peter Deutsch was on his feet, pointing at the screen. “Did you just do what I thought you did?” he said.</p>
<p class="para">这时，英格尔斯才意识到发生了什么。在编辑过程中，他本能地按下了鼠标中键。屏幕上突然出现了一个小矩形，列出了几个命令。英格尔斯选择了“剪切”并松开了鼠标中键，小矩形随即消失（连同要删除的选定文本）。这就是他们所说的“弹出菜单”，这是如今几乎每个 Windows 或 Macintosh 程序中都常见的设备的前身。“它闪了一下就消失了，”他回忆道。“那真是一个美妙的时刻，一切都在半秒钟内完成。”</p><p class="para">Only then did Ingalls realize what had happened. In the midst of the edit he had instinctively pressed the middle button of his mouse. As if from nowhere, a small rectangle had appeared on the screen listing several commands. Ingalls had selected “cut” and released the button, whereupon the tiny rectangle instantly disappeared (along with the selected text to be deleted). It was something they called the “pop-up menu,” the forerunner of a device common to almost every Windows or Macintosh program today. “It flashed and disappeared,” he recalled. “That was really a wonderful moment, and it was all done in a half a second.”</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch15.html.page228"></a>
<p class="para">在菜单弹出并再次消失的瞬间，全体观众不仅领悟了 BitBlt 的强大功能，还领悟了它在普通用户世界中的实际应用。“房间里的每个人都目瞪口呆地走出去，”斯莫基·华莱士回忆道，他受雇于恩格尔巴特实验室，帮助使用 PARC 技术设计一款商业办公系统。他立即意识到，他刚刚看到的东西将成为他可以投放市场的任何产品的不可或缺的元素。第二天，他出现在了英格尔斯的办公室。“告诉我关于 BitBlt 的一切，”他说。</p><p class="para">In the instant it took for the menu to pop onto the screen and off again, the entire audience comprehended not only the power of BitBlt but its practical application in a world of average users. “Everyone in that room walked out in a daze,” recalled Smokey Wallace, who had been hired from Englebart’s lab to help design a commercial office system using PARC technology. He recognized immediately that what he had just seen would be an indispensable element of anything he could put on the market. The very next day he showed up in Ingalls’s office. “Tell me all about BitBlt,” he said.</p>
<p class="para">PARC 用户界面，包括重叠窗口、鼠标点击和弹出菜单，已进入计算机历史。二十五年多来，经过许多代工程师的努力，它仍然是桌面隐喻的无可争议的鼻祖，指导着数百万家庭和办公室计算机的用户。“从那一刻起，”华莱士说，“没有人回头了。”</p><p class="para">The PARC user interface, with its overlapping windows, mouse clicks, and pop-up menus, had entered computing history. More than twenty-five years and many engineering generations later, it remains the indisputable parent of the desktop metaphor guiding the users of millions of home and office computers. “From that moment on,” Wallace said, “nobody ever looked back.”</p>

Finally he would roll to a stop next to the graphics lab.</p>

<p class="para">过度的野心会让一位才华横溢的发明家在 CSL 成为弃儿，这种想法听起来很荒谬——更像是加里·斯塔克韦瑟在韦伯斯特这样的地方会发生的事情，这与 PARC 应该发生的事情完全相反。然而，每个人类组织最终都会珍视自己的正统观念，PARC 也不例外。当一个团体以积极的态度追求目标时，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch16.html.page230"></a>在鲍勃·泰勒 (Bob Taylor) 的领导下，计算机科学实验室表现出一心一意的毅力，但出现不宽容的可能性却更大。</p><p class="para">The notion that an excess of ambition could make a talented inventor into a pariah at CSL sounds preposterous on its face—more like something that would happen to a Gary Starkweather in a place like Webster, and the very antithesis of what should have happened at PARC. Yet every organization of human beings eventually comes to cherish its own orthodoxies, and PARC was no different. When a group pursues a goal with <a></a>the single-minded tenacity the Computer Science Lab possessed under Bob Taylor, the potential for intolerance is even greater.</p>

<p class="para"><span class="italic">他一开始并不是一个局外人。恰恰相反。很难想象有比迪克·舒普更隐晦的计算机科学背景：卡内基梅隆大学博士学位，毕业后就职于伯克利计算机公司，随后被鲍勃·泰勒选为 BCC 倒闭后加入 PARC 的六名精英之一。在计算机科学实验室这个小圈子里，这是最接近五月花号</span>的经历。</p><p class="para">He had not started as an outsider.

<p class="para">您必须非常了解舒普，才能看清这位异端者在这些杰出学术血统背后的灵魂。一个线索是，他对一些事情的兴趣甚至让 PARC 的一些自由思想家都觉得有些<span class="italic">离奇</span>，比如他的超验冥想小组，该小组每天早上聚集在 PARC 的公共休息室，听着邮购磁带上玛赫西·马赫什·约吉的声音。</p><p class="para">You would have to know Shoup very well before discerning the heretic’s soul underlying those sterling academic bloodlines. One clue was his interest in things that struck even some of PARC’s free thinkers as a little <span class="italic">outré</span>, like his Transcendental Meditation group, which gathered every morning in a PARC commons room to do its thing to the voice of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi on mail order tapes.</p>
<p class="para">“迪克和其他人有点不同，”他的朋友艾尔维·雷·史密斯说。“他有点脾气暴躁，不关心政治，而且非常固执，我认为这就是他如此优秀的原因。”</p><p class="para">“Dick was a little different from everybody else,” related his friend Alvy Ray Smith. “He’s sort of a crusty guy, and he’s not political, and he’s very stubborn, and I think this is why he’s as good as he is.”</p>
<p class="para">如果鲍勃·泰勒知道迪克·舒普<span class="italic">如此</span>固执，他可能不会在 PARC 职业生涯的一开始就对他如此放任。舒普来到 CSL 后不久，泰勒就欢迎他到办公室讨论他想做什么。舒普不像他的同事兰普森、德意志和萨克那样有清晰的信念。相反，他看到面前有太多迷人的道路，以至于他被只能选择一条而困扰。最后泰勒慢吞吞地说：“你为什么不花一年时间想清楚你想做什么呢？”</p><p class="para">Had he known <span class="italic">how</span> stubborn, Bob Taylor might not have given Dick Shoup such a long leash at the very outset of his PARC career. Shortly after Shoup got to CSL Taylor welcomed him into his office to discuss what he wanted to do. Shoup did not have the clear-eyed convictions of his colleagues Lampson, Deutsch, and Thacker. Instead he saw so many fascinating paths laid out before him that he was stymied by the need to pick only one. Finally Taylor drawled: “Why don’t you take a year to figure out what you want to do?”</p>
<p class="para">对于泰勒来说，这个提议并不像乍一看那么开放。他认为，伟大的计算机科学家只要靠自己的能力（并受到经理的巧妙指导）就一定能找到通往交互式分布式计算的圣杯。但舒普相信了他的新老板的话。在一个月或一个月内<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch16.html.page231"></a>所以他决定从事视频计算机图形学的研究课程。</p><p class="para">With Taylor this offer was never as open-ended as it might seem at first glance. He figured that great computer scientists left to their own devices (and subtly guided by the Impresario’s hand) would invariably find their way to the grail of interactive distributed computing. But Shoup took his new boss at his word. Within a month or <a></a>so he had decided to pursue a course of research in video computer graphics.</p>
<p class="para">从表面上看，他的选择完全符合泰勒的主流观点。毕竟，泰勒通过 ARPA 资助了犹他州第一个计算机图形“卓越中心”，并聘请了两名毕业生 Bob Flegal 和 Jim Curry 作为 CSL 的首批新员工。舒普的这一决定也并非完全偶然。他对视频的兴趣可以追溯到他在宾夕法尼亚州西部读高中的时候，当时他周末会为小镇的邻居修理电视机。</p><p class="para">On the surface his choice sat squarely within the mainstream of Taylor’s vision. After all, Taylor had underwritten through ARPA the first computer graphics “center of excellence” at Utah and hired two of its graduates, Bob Flegal and Jim Curry, as his very first recruits to CSL. Nor was it entirely random on Shoup’s part. His interest in video went all the way back to his high school days in western Pennsylvania, when he spent weekends repairing TV sets for his small-town neighbors.</p>
<p class="para">他知道，将视频光栅显示器应用于交互式计算机会引发一系列有趣的技术问题，需要进一步研究，尤其是当人们想对图像进行一些有趣的处理时。例如，人们需要一种方法来一次性将一整帧的数字数据存储在内存中。实现这一目的的技术被称为帧缓冲区。Shoup 提出的正是人们所见过的最大、最灵活的帧缓冲区。</p><p class="para">Adapting video raster displays to interactive computers, he knew, raised a host of intriguing technical issues crying out for further study, especially if one desired to do interesting things with the image. One would need a way to store a whole frame’s worth of digital data in memory at a time, for example. The technology to do so was known as the frame buffer. What Shoup proposed was nothing less than the biggest and most flexible frame buffer anyone had ever seen.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">简单来说，帧缓冲区是一个装有海量内存的盒子。更准确地说，它是一个网格，其中的内存排列与视频帧相对应，因此一个或多个内存位对应显示屏上的每个“像素”或“图像元素”。以任何给定模式激活帧缓冲区的位，屏幕上就会出现完全相同的模式。将缓冲区连接到计算机，您可以根据您能设计的任何算法重新排列这些相同的位（以及相应的图像），就像您在分区的盒子中重新排列彩色弹珠一样。</p><p class="para">Simply defined, a frame buffer is a box holding a hell of a lot of memory. More precisely, it is a grid in which the memory is arrayed to correspond with a video frame, so that one or more bits of memory account for every “pixel,” or “picture element,” on the display. Activate the bits of a frame buffer in any given pattern and the exact same pattern should appear on the screen. Connect the buffer to a computer and you can rearrange those same bits—and the corresponding image—according to any algorithm you can devise, the way you might rearrange colored marbles in a partitioned box.</p>
<p class="para">在弗莱加尔、库里和法国图形专家帕特里克·博德莱尔的帮助下，舒普花了一年多时间设计和组装这台巨型内存。Superpaint 的第一个原型于 1973 年 4 月 10 日在 34 号楼投入使用，就在 Alto 投入使用几天后，Alto 正在他位于一楼的视频实验室正下方的地下室中建造。</p><p class="para">With the assistance of Flegal, Curry, and a French graphics expert named Patrick Beaudelaire, Shoup spent more than a year devising and assembling his memory giant. The first prototype of Superpaint went operational in Building 34 on April 10, 1973, just a few days after the Alto, which was being built in a basement room directly under his ground-floor video lab.</p>
<p class="para">当 Cookie Monster 穿过 Alto 屏幕，引来 PARC 忠实粉丝和访客的欢呼时，Dick Shoup 独自坐在一台黑白摄像机前，手里拿着一份索引<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch16.html.page232"></a>他在卡片上潦草地写到：“它能用，差不多。”系统将他的脸部图像和卡片精确地记录在缓冲存储器中——除了他下垂的胡子和长及衣领的头发呈鲜橙色——并将其以比特模式存储在传统的计算机磁盘上。（“它一直存留到今天，”他在 1998 年说道。）</p><p class="para">While Cookie Monster was marching across the Alto screen to the delighted gasps of the PARC faithful and their visitors, Dick Shoup was seated alone before a black-and-white video camera, holding up an index <a></a>card on which he had scrawled, “It works, sort of.” The system recorded the image of his face and the card in buffer memory in accurate detail—save for the bright red-orange of his droopy mustache and collar-length hair—and stored it on a conventional computer disk as a pattern of bits. (“It survives to this day,” he said in 1998.)</p>
<p class="para">几个月内，他添加了千变万化的视频输入，包括直播电视、录像带和视频光盘，以及允许他修改从屏幕上抓取的图像的硬件和软件。最终产品是有史以来第一个完全兼容视频的帧缓冲器。它也是一个载体，与同事在地下室组装的计算机不同。Alto 可以放在桌子下面，而 Superpaint 则占据了两个柜子，每个柜子高 5 英尺，装有 33 张存储卡。它有近 250 万个存储位（半导体芯片价值约 10 万美元），这意味着分辨率为 486 x 640 像素的视频帧中的每个像素都可以用 8 位寻址。该系统需要两个独立的显示器，一个用于显示要处理的图像，另一个用于显示电子“画笔”菜单，可以用它来改变颜色或图案。“毫无疑问，这是一大块硬件，”Shoup 深情地回忆道。</p><p class="para">Within a few months he had added a kaleidoscopic variety of video inputs, including live television, videotape, and videodisc, as well as hardware and software to allow him to alter the images he grabbed from the screen. The finished product was the first fully video-compatible frame buffer ever built. It was also a vector apart from the computer his colleagues had assembled in the basement. Where the Alto fit under a desk, Superpaint occupied two cabinets, each standing five feet tall and holding thirty-three memory cards. Its nearly two and a half million memory bits (in semiconductor chips worth about $100,000) meant that each pixel in a video frame with a resolution of 486 by 640 pixels could be addressed by eight bits. The system required two separate display monitors, one to show the image to be manipulated and the second a menu of electronic “paintbrushes” with which it could be altered in color or pattern. “No question about it, this was a big chunk of hardware,” Shoup recalled fondly.</p>
<p class="para">Superpaint 是一款独特、灵活且适应性强的图形工具。用户可以从录像带、光盘或电视屏幕上“抓取”一帧，然后对其进行处理，改变其颜色、翻转或反转图像、将其散布到整个屏幕上，甚至为其添加动画效果。关键是每像素 8 位的比率，这允许用户将每个点调整为 256 种颜色值中的任意一种。您可以冻结《<span class="italic">星际迷航》</span>等录像剧集中的随机帧，将其叠加在缓冲区上，就像在空白画布上描线一样，然后通过为相应的像素分配新值将 Spock 的头发重新染成绿色。</p><p class="para">Superpaint was a uniquely agile and adaptable graphical tool. One could “grab” a frame from a videotape, disc, or directly off a television screen and manhandle it by changing its colors, flipping or reversing the image, bleeding it across the screen, even animating it. The key was the ratio of eight bits per pixel, which allowed the user to tune every dot to any one of 256 color values. You could freeze a random frame from a taped episode of, say, <span class="italic">Star Trek</span>, overlay it on the buffer as if you were tracing a line drawing on a blank canvas, and recolor Spock’s hair green by assigning new values to the appropriate pixels.</p>
<p class="para">然而，舒普对色彩和视频的痴迷使他远离了泰勒认为的计算机科学实验室的主要任务。舒普像 CSL 团队中任何一位顺从的成员一样参与了 MAXC 项目；但当实验室的其他成员将注意力转移到 Alto 时，他已经退出了个人世界。泰勒对事情的发展方向感到非常不满。</p><p class="para">Yet Shoup’s fascination with color and video drew him away from what Taylor viewed as the Computer Science Lab’s principal mandate. Shoup had participated in the MAXC project like any obedient member of the CSL team; but by the time the rest of the lab shifted its attention to the Alto he had withdrawn into his personal world. Taylor was distinctly displeased at the course things were taking.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch16.html.page233"></a>
<p class="para">“鲍勃认为整个实验室都需要朝着一个方向努力，”舒普回忆道。这不仅仅是因为他在独自工作；更重要的是，人们认为 Superpaint 的基本前提永远与 CSL 打造“未来办公室”的目标不符。研究如何操纵数字比特来创建图像是一回事——这是 CSL 自将 Cookie Monster 的脸映射到 Alto 屏幕上以来一直采取的方向。对于他的同事来说，舒普的工作方式是倒着进行的，从视频图像开始，然后将其简化为数字组件：办公系统能用它做什么<span class="italic">？</span></p><p class="para">“Bob felt the whole lab needed to be working in one direction,” Shoup recalled. It was not simply that he was working on his own; more critically, it was felt that the basic premise of Superpaint would never fit in with CSL’s goal to build the “office of the future.” It was one thing to study how digital bits could be manipulated to create an image—the direction CSL had taken since the day they mapped Cookie Monster’s face to the Alto screen. To his colleagues Shoup was working backwards, starting with video images and reducing them to their digital components: What could an office system ever do with <span class="italic">that?</span></p>
<p class="para">“房子那边的每个人都对文件感兴趣，”舒普回忆道。“文件基本上就是白纸上的黑色标记。彩色意味着电视，那是另一个世界。”</p><p class="para">“Everyone on that side of the house was interested in documents,” Shoup recalled. “Documents are pretty much black marks on white paper. Color meant TV, and that was some other world.”</p>
<p class="para">1974 年底到 1974 年初，Shoup 与实验室其他成员之间的紧张关系愈演愈烈，因为 CSL 的科学家们面临着越来越大的压力，他们必须将精力几乎全部集中在与 Alto 相关的项目上。似乎唯一能让这场酝酿已久的分歧不至于演变成全面决裂的因素就是缺乏催化剂。然后，仿佛按计划，一名男子来到了 PARC，他似乎真的来自另一个世界。</p><p class="para">The tension between Shoup and the rest of the lab intensified through the end of the year and into early 1974, as pressure mounted on CSL scientists to focus their efforts almost entirely on Alto-related projects. It seemed that the only thing keeping the simmering disagreement from turning into a full-scale break was the absence of a catalyst. Then, as if on schedule, a man arrived at PARC who really did seem to come from some other world.</p>
<p class="para">艾维·雷·史密斯是 20 世纪 70 年代典型的辍学者。他出生于新墨西哥州，曾是纽约大学的计算机教授，后来放弃了前途光明的学术生涯，开着一辆白色福特都灵越野车，追寻抽象艺术的灵感。他和舒普第一次见面是在几年前，当时史密斯是大型并行计算机神秘数学方面的专家，正在组织一个关于模块化计算机的会议小组，有人建议他联系舒普，舒普在卡内基梅隆大学的论文涉及了同样的领域。</p><p class="para">Alvy Ray Smith was the quintessential 1970s dropout. A native of New Mexico, he had been a New York University computer professor until abandoning his promising academic career to drive a white Ford Torino cross-country in pursuit of the muse of abstract art. He and Shoup had first encountered each other several years earlier when Smith, an expert in the arcane mathematics of massively parallel computers, was putting together a conference panel on modular computers and someone recommended he contact Shoup, whose dissertation at CMU had covered the same territory.</p>
<p class="para">他们开始了终生的友谊，部分原因是他们对非传统事物的共同迷恋。“迪克总是愿意谈论科学以外的各种事情，”史密斯回忆道。“音乐、艺术、超心理学、前沿的东西。”1974 年，史密斯突然辞去教授职务，前往加利福尼亚画画，他出现在老朋友迪克的家中，寻找过夜的地方，这似乎是理所当然的事。</p><p class="para">They embarked on a lifelong friendship, based in part on their shared fascination with the unconventional. “Dick was always willing to talk about all kinds of other things than science,” Smith recalled. “Music, art, parapsychology, out-on-the-edge stuff.” When Smith abruptly quit his professorship in 1974 and headed for California to paint, it seemed only natural that he would surface at the home of his old friend Dick, looking for a place to spend the night.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch16.html.page234"></a>
<p class="para">当时，PARC 正处于创意发酵的高峰期。每天都会出现一些新的工程壮举，几乎要求向任何有空闲时间的人展示。而 Alvy Ray Smith 则像猫一样好奇，有空余时间四处游荡。第二天早上，Shoup 开车前往研究中心时，心中充满了期待。坐在他旁边的是他认识的唯一一个有“得到”超级油漆的气质的人。果然，这台机器像一道闪电击中了 Smith 的双眼。</p><p class="para">PARC then was at a peak of creative ferment. Every day some new feat of engineering appeared, virtually demanding to be shown off to anyone with a free moment. And here was Alvy Ray Smith, curious as a cat, at large with time to spare. Shoup fairly tingled with anticipation as he drove to the research center the next morning. Seated next to him was the one man he knew possessed the temperament to “get” Superpaint. Sure enough, the machine hit Smith like a lightning bolt between the eyes.</p>
<p class="para">“他一进门就完全入迷了，”舒普回忆道。“他完全沉迷其中。”在接下来的几天几夜里，这位被迷住的艺术家几乎每次都呆在实验室里一两个小时。“我意识到这就是我来加州的目的，”史密斯回忆道。“你可以看出这就是未来。”</p><p class="para">“He came in the door and got completely entranced,” Shoup remembered. “He just deep-ended right into it.” For the next several days and nights the bewitched artist scarcely left the lab for more than an hour or two at a time. “I realized this was what I had come to California for,” Smith recalled. “You could just see it was the future.”</p>
<p class="para">在画布上涂抹颜料这一历史悠久的技术突然显得过时了。史密斯的新爱好是得到舒普的机器，永不放手。舒普赞成这个想法，认为他需要像史密斯这样的人来弥补自己艺术技能的不足（“我是一个视觉思考者，但从来都不是一个视觉艺术家，”他说）。舒普试图让史密斯成为 PARC 的永久员工，他认为史密斯的艺术天赋和扎实的科学资历使他有资格帮助开发 Superpaint 的全部潜力，就像试飞员将一架新型战斗机推到极限一样。</p><p class="para">The time-honored technique of daubing paint on canvas suddenly seemed hopelessly antiquated. Smith’s new obsession was to get his hands on Shoup’s machine and never let go. Shoup favored the idea, figuring he needed someone like Smith on the premises to make up for his own lack of artistic skill (“I was a visual thinker, but never much of a visual artist,” he said). Attempting to secure Smith a place on PARC’s permanent staff, Shoup argued that Smith’s artistic talent and solid scientific credentials uniquely qualified him to help develop Superpaint’s full potential, like a test pilot pushing a new fighter plane to the edge of the envelope.</p>
<p class="para">在掌握预算的高层看来，这是一笔不小的买卖。没有人想过在 PARC 的人数中安排一名驻地艺术家，更不用说像 Alvy Ray Smith 这样无根的嬉皮士了。不过，你可以说 PARC 的一点是，它的普通员工在寻找突破规则的方法方面非常机智。在人事办公室拒绝雇用 Smith 作为临时工或承包商后，Alan Kay 想出了一个主意，让他作为一件家具进入大楼——以几千美元的价格执行他的服务采购订单。“我不在乎他们怎么做，”Smith 说。“我不想要头衔或薪水或任何东西。我只想使用设备。”</p><p class="para">Among the higher-ups with their hands on the budget, this was a no sale. No one had thought to provide in PARC’s head count for an artist in residence, much less a rootless hippie like Alvy Ray Smith. Still, one thing you could say about PARC was that its rank and file was infinitely resourceful at finding ways to stretch the rules. After the personnel office refused to hire Smith as a temp or a contractor, Alan Kay came up with the idea of getting him into the building virtually as a piece of furniture—executing a purchase order for his services for a couple of thousand dollars. “I didn’t care how they did it,” Smith said. “I didn’t want a title or salary or anything. I just wanted access to the equipment.”</p>
<p class="para">很快他就成了 34 号楼的固定成员。如果说 Dick Shoup 是个特立独行、与外界融为一体的人，那么 Alvy Ray Smith 就是一个很难被<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch16.html.page235"></a>小姐。他身材魁梧，肩宽体阔，喜欢穿花哨的衬衫，留着一头乌黑浓密的头发和一脸嬉皮士风格的胡须，他用洪亮的声音向所有愿意倾听的人和许多不愿意倾听的人宣扬 Superpaint 的天才之处。</p><p class="para">In no time he became a fixture in Building 34. If Dick Shoup was a maverick who blended in, Alvy Ray Smith was one who was hard to <a></a>miss. Big and broad-shouldered, given to loud shirts, with a luxuriant mane of jet-black hair and a flowing hippie beard, he proclaimed the genius of Superpaint in a booming voice to anyone who was willing to listen and many who were not.</p>
<p class="para">泰勒从一开始就对他持怀疑态度，这很不祥。也许是因为他自称远见卓识，泰勒认为这是对他个人的侮辱。又或许是因为史密斯似乎有一种独特的才能，能够激怒别人，就像他在 PARC 的第一天就展示的那样。</p><p class="para">Taylor, ominously, viewed him skeptically from the start. Perhaps it was his claim to superior farsightedness, which Taylor took as a personal affront. Or perhaps the reason was that Smith seemed to have a singular talent for pressing his buttons, as he demonstrated on his very first day at PARC.</p>
<p class="para">史密斯正在视频实验室里摆弄 Superpaint，这时泰勒走到他身后，显然是想让这位新来者明白这台机器已经不属于主流。他默默地看着史密斯费力地调整颜色设置，然后问道：“你不觉得这台机器太难用了吗？”</p><p class="para">Smith was in the video lab, tinkering with Superpaint, when Taylor came up behind him, evidently intent on making sure the newcomer understood that this machine was considered to be out of the mainstream. He watched silently as Smith laboriously tuned the color settings, then asked, “Don’t you find this too hard to use?”</p>
<p class="para">史密斯转过身来，对这个想法感到震惊。这就像问画家是否觉得挥动画笔太难一样。“不，我觉得不太难，”他不耐烦地回答道。“你不明白吗？这台机器是革命性的！”</p><p class="para">Smith wheeled on him, shocked at the very idea. One might just as well ask a painter if he found it too hard to wield his brush. “No, I don’t find it too hard,” was his impatient rejoinder. “Don’t you get it? This machine is revolutionary!”</p>
<p class="para">泰勒哼了一声，走开了，他很不高兴在自己的实验室里被人训斥什么是革命，什么不是革命。他以前从来没有被人指责为反动分子，这让他很难受。</p><p class="para">Taylor walked off with a grunt, unhappy at being lectured in his own lab about what was and was not revolutionary. He had never before been reproached as a reactionary, and it stuck in his craw.</p>
<p class="para">史密斯也意​​识到了这次交流的意义。“从那天起，”他说，“我意识到我的朋友迪克处在一个不友好的环境中。”</p><p class="para">Nor was the significance of the exchange lost on Smith. “From that day on,” he said, “I realized my friend Dick was in an unfriendly environment.”</p>
<p class="para">当然，泰勒和史密斯的言论是互相矛盾的。计算机科学实验室的工程师们无情地权衡着一切，而问题在于：这将如何让我们更接近目标？他们致力于开发施乐未来的办公室，任何分散他们注意力或服务于其他目标的东西都必须被丢弃或消灭。对他们来说，创造性艺术家如此珍视的侥幸和运气的赞美似乎是无法容忍的浪费时间和精力。甚至艾伦·凯也以他随意浏览 Ideaspace 的倾向考验着他们的耐心；但与艾尔维·雷·史密斯相比，艾伦·凯就像长老会长老一样清醒。</p><p class="para">Taylor and Smith, of course, had been speaking at cross-purposes. The Computer Science Lab was a collection of engineers who weighed everything pitilessly against the question: How will this get us closer to our goal? They had committed themselves to developing Xerox’s office of the future, and anything that diverted their attention or served an alternative goal had to be discarded or obliterated. To them the glorification of fluke and luck so cherished by the creative artist seemed intolerably wasteful of time and effort. Even Alan Kay tested their patience with his penchant for drifting haphazardly through Ideaspace; but compared to Alvy Ray Smith, Alan Kay was as sober as a Presbyterian elder.</p>
<p class="para">史密斯很快就认可了舒普的信念，认为有人扎根于这两种艺术<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch16.html.page236"></a>和科学将为 Superpaint 的进化做出巨大贡献。他最重要的改进与用户调整屏幕上颜色的方式有关。作为一名工程师，Shoup 构建了一个只有其他工程师才会喜欢的元素系统：控件是一组“滑动杆”，只能调整图像的红色、绿色和蓝色值。这个过程缺乏某种必要的精细度，几乎就像强迫作曲家不使用升号或降号一样。</p><p class="para">Smith soon rewarded Shoup’s faith that someone rooted in both art <a></a>and science would make a powerful contribution to Superpaint’s evolution. His most important refinement had to do with the way users adjusted colors on the screen. As an engineer, Shoup had built a system with elements only another engineer could love: The controls were a set of “sliding levers” that could adjust only an image’s red, green, and blue values. The process lacked a certain necessary delicacy, almost like forcing composers to do without sharps or flats.</p>
<p class="para">“艺术家不会这么想，”史密斯告诉他。</p><p class="para">“Artists don’t think that way,” Smith informed him.</p>
<p class="para">正如他后来解释的那样，“迪克可以得到他想要的任何颜色，但他必须考虑如何从红色、绿色和蓝色中得到粉红色。”（任何尝试过仅使用三原色拨盘调整旧彩色电视机上的肤色的人都可以想象这有多么棘手。）史密斯认识到，要让该系统直观地供艺术家使用，需要一组额外的控件。“如果我给你色调、亮度和暗度的控件，你就会知道你可以把红色变得更浅：那就是粉红色。”他把新的类别称为“色调、饱和度和明度”，并将该系统称为“HSV 变换”。（史密斯的附加类别或类似类别至今仍存在于大多数视频动画系统中。）</p><p class="para">As he explained later, “Dick could get any color he wanted, but he had to think in terms of how you might get pink out of red, green, and blue.” (How tricky this is can be imagined by anyone who has tried to adjust the flesh tones on an old color TV using only the three primary color dials.) Making the system intuitively useful for artists, Smith recognized, required an additional set of controls. “If I gave you controls for hue, lightness, and darkness, you would know you could take red and make it lighter: That’s pink.” He called the new categories “hue, saturation, and value” and labeled the system the “HSV transform.” (Smith’s additional categories, or similar ones, survive in most video animation systems to this day.)</p>
<p class="para">但史密斯对 Superpaint 的热爱加速了舒普与 CSL 同志们的疏远，因为他的机器看起来只不过是长发玩具。史密斯一连几个小时独占这台设备，将视频图像扭曲成复杂的抽象形式。他会拿一个颜色测试图案，按照 256 种颜色值的编程序列对其进行操作，使其看起来像是放置在万花筒背景下的变色龙的皮肤，或者将图案以迷幻的方式洒满屏幕。“我拿了一个女朋友的脸，对它做了一些小技巧，把它从中间切成两半，然后反射它，再把它切成两半，这样它就是一张四向反射的脸，几乎无法辨认了，但仍然有一些有机的东西。”</p><p class="para">But Smith’s devotion to Superpaint hastened Shoup’s estrangement from his CSL comrades by making his machine seem little more than a toy for longhairs. Smith monopolized the device for hours at a stretch, twisting video images into intricate abstract forms. He would take a color test pattern and step it through a programmed sequence of the 256 color values so it resembled the skin of a chameleon placed against a kaleidoscopic background, or bleed the pattern across the screen in a psychedelic wash. “I took a girlfriend’s face and did some tricks with it, halved it down the middle and reflected it and halved that again so it was a four-way reflected face that’s hardly recognizable anymore, but still has something organic about it.”</p>
<p class="para">如今，这种操作已司空见惯，甚至到了陈词滥调的地步，就像电视特效中的东西。但在 1974 年，没有人见过这样的事情。很快，史密斯就邀请旧金山创意圈的朋友来参加演示，这些演示变成了通宵的 Superpaint“即兴演奏会”。一位名叫弗里茨·费舍尔 (Fritz Fisher) 的爱荷华州平面艺术家曾<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch16.html.page237"></a>舒普和史密斯邀请他到 PARC 介绍他的工作。他看了一眼 Superpaint，然后回家收拾行李。回到帕洛阿尔托后，他进入斯坦福大学学习，并在 CSL 找到了一份守夜人的工作。在接下来的几年里，他白天上课，晚上看守实验室。“我们第二天早上来的时候，机器上就有这些精美的设计，”舒普说，“我们知道弗里茨已经完成了。”</p><p class="para">Today such manipulation is commonplace to the point of triteness, the stuff of TV special effects. But in 1974 no one had ever seen anything like it. Soon Smith was inviting friends from San Francisco’s creative demimonde down for demos that turned into all-night Superpaint “jam sessions.” One graphics artist, an Iowan named Fritz Fisher, had been <a></a>invited out to PARC by Shoup and Smith to give a talk about his work. He took one look at Superpaint and returned home only long enough to pack his bags. Back in Palo Alto he enrolled at Stanford and got a job as night watchman at CSL. For the next few years he would attend class in the daytime and tend the lab all night. “We’d come in the next morning and there’d be these elaborate designs on the machine,” Shoup said, “and we’d know Fritz had been at it.”</p>
<p class="para">然而，PARC 的科学家们对此的反应却不那么热烈，只有少数富有同情心的工作人员在凌晨加入 Smith 的行列，其中一些人表现出了偷偷吸食实验性毒品的迹象。（“这是分界线之一，”Smith 后来开玩笑地说：“你只要看一眼人们就知道他们是不是吸毒者。如果他们整晚工作并且玩得很开心，那么他们很可能在吸毒。”）Smith 从彩色图形实验室的有利位置仔细记录了每个人对 Superpaint 的反应，该实验室占据了一个狭长的房间，位于 34 号楼交通流的枢纽位置，因为里面有七扇门，所以人员通行很少停止。</p><p class="para">Among PARC scientists, however, the reaction was much less fervent, except among a handful of empathetic staff members who joined Smith in the wee hours, some displaying the furtive signs of experimental drug use. (“That was one of the dividing lines,” Smith later remarked jocularly: “You’d just look at people and know if they were dopers or not. If they worked all night and had a lot of fun, they were probably doing dope.”) Smith kept careful note of everyone’s reaction to Superpaint from his vantage point in the color graphics lab, which occupied a long narrow room strategically situated at the nexus of Building 34’s traffic flow—since seven doors opened into it, the passage of personnel rarely ceased.</p>
<p class="para">“屏幕上显示的是我们的作品，令人震撼，”他回忆道。“大多数人都会停下来看看。但也有一些人会径直走过，根本不看。我总是在想，这些人是怎么回事？”</p><p class="para">“Here’s our stuff on the screen, mind-blowing stuff,” he remembered. “Most people would stop and look. Then there were other people who would walk right by and never look. And I’d always wonder, what’s with those guys?”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">在 CSL 内部，对 Superpaint 漠不关心的标杆人物是巴特勒·兰普森，这并不令人意外。兰普森的远见卓识根植于独特的实用主义。他决心通过一系列小步、有节制的步伐，而不是盲目地跳跃，因为盲目跳跃会带来不可接受的风险，会将人带入死胡同。大步前进需要信念，而有节制的步伐只需要科学和尺子。</p><p class="para">Inside CSL, the person who set the standard of indifference to Superpaint was, unsurprisingly, Butler Lampson. Lampson’s visionary temperament was grounded in a unique pragmatism. He was determined to reach the unseen horizon not by great blind leaps—they posed the unacceptable risk of leading one into a dead end—but by a series of small, measured steps. Big leaps required faith; measured steps required only science and a ruler.</p>
<p class="para">“我记得有一次和巴特勒就我对人工智能的梦想进行了一次非常有启发性的讨论，”丹·鲍勃罗说，他是计算机语言方面的杰出专家，被杰里·艾尔金德带到了 CSL。“他说，‘丹尼，你怎么能从事一个目标远在两年之后的项目呢？’巴特勒对如何选择项目的愿景是，选择那些两年后就​​能告诉你结果的项目。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch16.html.page238"></a>你成功了还是失败了。他总是选择循序渐进​​。我不记得他有过我认为的长远眼光。但凭借他的聪明才智和良好的品味，他能够在计算领域迈出重要的下一步并捍卫它们。”</p><p class="para">“I remember once having a very illuminating discussion with Butler about my dreams for artificial intelligence,” said Dan Bobrow, the brilliant specialist in computer languages who had been brought to CSL by Jerry Elkind. “He said, ‘Danny, how can you work on something where there’s a goal farther out than two years away?’ Butler’s vision of how you choose projects was to choose those that would tell you in two years if <a></a>you’d succeeded or failed. He always chose incremental things. I can’t recall him ever having what I think of as a long-term vision. But with his smarts and his good taste he was able to do important next steps in computing and defend them.”</p>
<p class="para">兰普森反对彩色图形的理由之一是，根据任何人的定义，它都不是渐进式的东西。“当时我们买不起彩色，因为我们买不起驱动彩色帧缓冲器的内存，”多年后他仍然坚持这一点。“我觉得你不应该尝试它，除非它变得相当简单，否则它会造成巨大的干扰。” <span class="sup">*</span></p><p class="para">Among Lampson’s objections to color graphics was that it was not by anyone’s definition an incremental thing. “We couldn’t afford color at the time because we couldn’t afford the memory to drive a color frame buffer,” he was still insisting many years later. “I felt you shouldn’t go for it until it’s quite easy, because otherwise it’s going to be a huge distraction.”<span class="sup">*</span></p>
<p class="para">当然，舒普承认，现在彩色很贵，但五年或十年后就会变得便宜，就像内存一样。为什么不把它看作是时间机器的另一个功能呢？</p><p class="para">Sure, Shoup acknowledged, color was expensive now, but it would be cheap in five or ten years, just like memory. Why not think of it as just another feature of the Time Machine?</p>
<p class="para">兰普森对超级油漆的另一个重要反对意见就此展开：他天生无法想象颜色除了装饰门面之外还能为未来的办公室做出什么贡献。他认为，如此微不足道的事情最好被忽视，直到它不仅便宜，而且免费。</p><p class="para">Here entered Lampson’s other important objection to Superpaint: He was constitutionally unable to imagine color contributing anything other than window-dressing to the office of the future. Something so trivial, he argued, might just as well be ignored until it was not merely cheap, but free.</p>
<p class="para">舒普的反驳是，Superpaint 的作用远不止增强未来的办公室。“我当时看的是更大的图景：基于像素的成像，”他后来回忆道。关键的斗争是让 CSL 的其他成员认识到视频、色彩和动画不仅仅是周六早间卡通片和迪士尼电影背后的技术，而且是新型计算机图形的基础。</p><p class="para">Shoup’s rejoinder was that Superpaint would do much more than enhance the office of the future. “I was looking at a bigger picture: pixel-based imaging in general,” he recalled later. The essential struggle was to get the rest of CSL to see video, color, and animation as not just the technologies behind Saturday morning cartoons and Disney films, but as the foundations of a new type of computer graphics.</p>
<p class="para">鉴于兰普森对泰勒和计算机科学实验室其他成员的影响力，这注定是徒劳无功的任务。然而，舒普越是感觉到自己被边缘化，就越是坚持走自己的路。“我们试图让迪克进入主流，但迪克知道他想做什么，而不是那样，”兰普森回忆道。至于泰勒，他已经认为舒普是一个不可接受的孤僻成员，而他组建这个实验室是为了实现一个共同的愿景。舒普没有加入 Alto 项目，而是背弃了他。虽然他自己的实验室同事发现很难与他共事，但泰勒<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch16.html.page239"></a>抱怨的是，他经常向局外人展示 Superpaint 的演示——而且还是“非技术”局外人，比如史密斯的艺术家和嬉皮士圈子。</p><p class="para">Given Lampson’s influence over Taylor and the rest of the Computer Science Lab, this was destined to be a futile mission. Yet the more Shoup sensed himself becoming marginalized, the more he insisted on going his own way. “We attempted to bring Dick into the mainstream, but Dick knew what he wanted to do, and it wasn’t that,” Lampson recalled. As for Taylor, he already considered Shoup an unacceptably reclusive member of a lab he had assembled to serve a shared vision. Instead of joining in the Alto project, Shoup had turned his back. While his own lab colleagues found it hard to work with him, Taylor <a></a>complained, he constantly gave demos of Superpaint to outsiders—and “non-technical” outsiders to boot, like Smith’s circle of artists and hippies.</p>
<p class="para">正如舒普所理解的，一旦失去鲍勃·泰勒的青睐，就再也回不来了。泰勒的黑名单是一个冷酷而令人生畏的地方。他曾几次半心半意地试图重建他被烧毁的桥梁。在 Alto 启动并运行后，他为其中一台安装了彩色显示屏。但这是 PARC 见过的唯一一台彩色 Alto，并且永远是 CSL 大多数工程师漠不关心的对象。（凯的学习研究小组一直更关注内容而不是图形显示的过程，最终很好地利用了它。）随着时间的流逝，舒普的绩效评估听起来更加险恶。“迪克，”有人读到，“必须找个新家了。”</p><p class="para">As Shoup understood, once you fell out of favor with Bob Taylor there was no coming back. Taylor’s shit list was a cold, forbidding place. He made a few half-hearted attempts rebuild his burned bridges. After the Alto was up and running, he rigged one with a color display. But it was the only color Alto ever seen at PARC and remained forever an object of indifference to most of the engineers in CSL. (Kay’s Learning Research Group, always more highly attuned to the content rather than the process of graphical displays, eventually made excellent use of it.) With every year that passed, Shoup’s performance appraisals sounded more sinister. “Dick,” one read, “is going to have to find a new home.”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="smallCaps">一天，</span>泰勒走进视频实验室，发现舒普的设备上贴满了手写的警告标志：“未经我<span class="smallCaps">允许，不得</span><span class="smallCaps">触碰</span>。<span class="smallCaps">”</span>对于<span class="smallCaps">一位</span>深信自己的员工都<span class="smallCaps">在</span>为一个共同的系统构建组件的经理来说，这简直是天方夜谭。他决心要让迪克·舒普知道谁才是他珍贵设备的真正主人。1974 年末的一天，舒普出城时，他开了第一枪。<span class="smallCaps"></span><span class="smallCaps"></span><span class="smallCaps"></span><span class="smallCaps"></span></p><p class="para">One day Taylor walked into the video lab to find Shoup’s equipment festooned with handwritten signs warning: “D<span class="smallCaps">O</span> N<span class="smallCaps">OT</span> T<span class="smallCaps">OUCH</span> W<span class="smallCaps">ITHOUT</span> M<span class="smallCaps">Y</span> P<span class="smallCaps">ERMISSION</span>.” To a manager whose most profound conviction was that his people were all building components of a single common system, this was anathema. He became determined to show Dick Shoup who really owned his precious equipment. One day in late 1974, while Shoup was out of town, he fired the first shot.</p>
<p class="para">这次活动是为了播出一档关于艺术先锋派的电视节目，名为<span class="italic">《Supervisions》</span>，由洛杉矶公共电视台 KCET 制作。史密斯和舒普在《Superpaint》上的工作开始在 PARC 之外赢得广泛关注，部分原因是史密斯将他最好的作品剪辑编辑成一盘名为“Vidbits”的磁带，在加州各地的艺术家聚会上播放。在一次这样的放映后，KCET 委托他们两人为<span class="italic">《Supervisions》</span>提供一些简短的色彩循环效果。他们严格坚持制片人给予施乐屏幕信用，假设母公司会感激这一荣誉。</p><p class="para">The occasion was the broadcast of a television program about the artistic avant-garde entitled <span class="italic">Supervisions</span>, which was produced by the Los Angeles public television station KCET. Smith’s and Shoup’s work on Superpaint had started to win wide notice outside PARC, thanks in part to a tape called “Vidbits” which Smith had compiled from clips of his best work for playing to artists’ gatherings all around California. After one such showing, KCET commissioned the two of them to supply some brief color-cycling effects for <span class="italic">Supervisions</span>. They had scrupulously insisted that the producers give Xerox screen credit, assuming that the parent company would appreciate the honor.</p>
<p class="para">相反，在节目播出一两天后，泰勒走进视频实验室，拉住史密斯。“施乐公司希望他们的标志从每一盘磁带上消失，”他说。“现在就去掉。”</p><p class="para">Instead, Taylor marched into the video lab a day or two after the broadcast and buttonholed Smith. “Xerox wants their logo off every piece of tape,” he said. “Right now.”</p>
<p class="para">他命令史密斯为他检查实验室里的每一段录像带——长达数英里。泰勒坐在他旁边一下午，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch16.html.page240"></a>史密斯费力地检查了每一卷胶片，包括他自己的“Vidbits”的每一份拷贝，按下“<span class="smallCaps">删除”</span>按钮删除任何带有施乐名称或商标的画面。当舒普回到家时，他和史密斯因为这件事的荒谬性而紧张地笑了笑。但他们心里知道，这预示着更糟糕的麻烦即将来临。</p><p class="para">He ordered Smith to screen for him every snippet of videotape in the lab—miles of tape. While Taylor sat next to him for an entire afternoon, <a></a>Smith laboriously ran every reel, including every copy of his own “Vidbits,” punching the <span class="smallCaps">ERASE</span> button to excise any frame bearing Xerox’s name or trademark. When Shoup returned home he and Smith managed a nervous chuckle over the sheer absurdity of the incident. But in their hearts they knew it presaged worse trouble to come.</p>
<p class="para">果然，几周后，史密斯被解雇了——或者更确切地说，他的采购订单被取消了。这个消息来自杰瑞·艾尔金德，他名义上是史密斯的老板，但之前从未和他说过话。“我们决定用黑白两色，”他说。“这个项目结束了。”</p><p class="para">Sure enough, a few weeks later, Smith was dismissed—or more precisely, his purchase order was canceled. The word came from Jerry Elkind, who was nominally Smith’s boss but had never even spoken to him before. “We’ve decided to go with black and white,” he said. “This project is over.”</p>
<p class="para">史密斯惊呆了。“你疯了！”他脱口而出。“从现在开始，这里全是彩色的，你们可以拥有一切！我不敢相信你们要关闭它。”</p><p class="para">Smith was stunned. “You’re crazy!” he blurted. “It’s going to be all color from here on out, and you guys can own it all! I can’t believe you’re shutting it down.”</p>
<p class="para">“嗯，”艾尔金德平静地回答，“这是公司的决定。”</p><p class="para">“Well,” Elkind replied evenly, “it’s a corporate decision.”</p>
<p class="para">史密斯别无选择，只能离开。他和另一位艺术家、Superpaint 狂热爱好者大卫·迪弗朗西斯科一起开车前往犹他州，寻求许可继续在那里的大学安装帧缓冲器。他没有得到许可，但却收到了在私立纽约理工学院开设视频课程的邀请。该部门后来<span class="italic">全部</span>转移到乔治·卢卡斯的卢卡斯影业，后来又被剥离出来，成立了皮克斯工作室，该工作室制作了热门的电脑生成电影《<span class="italic">玩具总动员》</span>和<span class="italic">《虫虫危机》</span>。</p><p class="para">Smith had no choice but to leave. With a fellow artist and Superpaint fanatic, David DiFrancesco, he drove off toward Utah in quest of permission to continue his work on a frame buffer installed at the university there. He failed to get it, but instead received an invitation to set up a video program at the private New York Institute of Technology. The department later transferred <span class="italic">en masse</span> to George Lucas’s Lucasfilm and even later was spun off as Pixar, the studio that produced the hit computer-generated movies <span class="italic">Toy Story</span> and <span class="italic">A Bug’s Life</span>.</p>
<p class="para">与此同时，舒普在 PARC 成为了一个孤独的弃儿。一天早上，当他走进实验室时，一位富有同情心的同事拦住了他，告诉他：“你知道，有人在为你开会。”</p><p class="para">Meanwhile, at PARC Shoup now stood as a solitary pariah. One morning on his way into the lab he was stopped by a sympathetic colleague, who told him: “You know, there’s a meeting going on about you.”</p>
<p class="para">舒普冲进泰勒的办公室，打断了关于拆除视频设备并将其重新分配给其他项目的讨论。大家尴尬地沉默了一会儿，然后“我回到实验室等待”，他回忆道，显然不受欢迎。不久之后，判决结果出来了：他的实验室空间将被占用。他必须收拾好他的录音设备，并将其交给 PARC 视听团队，他们将用它汇编一份行政会议录音档案。</p><p class="para">Shoup burst into Taylor’s office, interrupting a discussion about dismantling and redistributing his video equipment to other projects. The group fell sheepishly silent until, clearly unwelcome, “I went down to my lab and waited,” he recalled. A short while later the verdict arrived: His lab space was to be taken away. He was to pack up his taping and recording equipment and turn it over to the PARC audiovisual crew, which would use it to compile a taped archive of administrative meetings.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">舒普被 CSL 驱逐后，系统科学实验室展开了救援行动，将他转移到凯的团队，并获准重新组装他的大部分设备。</p><p class="para">Shoup’s eviction from CSL was answered by a rescue effort by the System’s Science Lab, which secured him a transfer into Kay’s group and permission to reassemble most of his equipment.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch16.html.page241"></a>
<p class="para">但 PARC 的计算机部门从未真正将色彩作为其使命不可分割的一部分。几年后，当施乐公司明确表示不会支持舒普开发下一代视频图形时，舒普离开了 PARC。他成立了自己的公司 Aurora Systems，开发了一套商业系统，制作了第一批动画电视天气图和视频徽标。</p><p class="para">But the computer side of PARC never really embraced color as an integral part of its mission. Within a couple of years, when it became clear that Xerox would not support his work on another generation of video graphics, Shoup left PARC. Forming his own company, Aurora Systems, he developed a commercial system that produced the first animated TV weather maps and video logos.</p>
<p class="para">最后的讽刺发生在 1983 年，当时美国国家电视艺术与科学学院联合颁发了一项技术艾美奖给迪克·舒普和施乐公司，以表彰 Superpaint 作为视频动画技术的先驱所发挥的作用。舒普参加了在纽约举行的颁奖典礼，他与受邀嘉宾艾维·雷·史密斯以及总部派来代表公司领奖的一位不知名的官员一起坐在获奖者的桌子旁。电视学院有先见之明，准备了两座艾美奖小金人。舒普将其中一座带回了家。在与舒普度过了一个愉快的夜晚后，这位工作人员将另一座带回了斯坦福，从此消失在公司档案中。“我一直不知道他们怎么处理它，”舒普说。</p><p class="para">The final irony came in 1983, when the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences awarded a technical Emmy jointly to Dick Shoup and Xerox Corporation in recognition of Superpaint’s role as a pioneering technology of video animation. Shoup went to the ceremony in New York, where he sat at the honorees’ table with his invited guest Alvy Ray Smith and a nameless functionary dispatched by headquarters to accept the award on the company’s behalf. The television academy had the foresight to prepare two Emmy statuettes. Shoup took his home. After spending a cordial evening with Shoup, the staff man took the other with him back to Stamford, where it vanished into the corporate archives. “I never did find out what they did with it,” Shoup said.</p>

<p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">“</span></span>我学到的一件事就是，你永远不要独自面对这种全新的情况，”1975 年初的一天，哈罗德·霍尔告诉大卫·利德尔。“我需要有人照顾我。所以你为什么不跟我一起去呢？”</p><p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">T</span></span>he one thing I’ve learned is you don’t ever go into a completely new situation like this one alone,” Harold Hall told David Liddle one day early in 1975. “I need someone to watch my back. So why don’t you come with me?”</p>
<p class="para">尽管霍尔的挑衅很夸张，但大卫·利德尔并不需要别人再三要求，尤其是当他要加入一个新成立的部门，将 PARC 技术转化为施乐的实际产品时。当然，他知道被任命为该部门负责人的霍尔的谨慎是正确的。几乎没有证据表明总部了解它要求这个新部门承担的任务的规模，而且没有人保证它永远不会了解。谁知道树林里会潜伏着什么敌人？</p><p class="para">Despite Hall’s melodramatic come-on, David Liddle did not need to be asked twice, not when the pitch was to join a newly created division to turn PARC technology into actual Xerox products. Of course he knew that Hall, who had been appointed its boss, was right to be wary. There was precious little evidence that headquarters understood the scale of the undertaking it had asked this new division to assume, and no guarantee it ever would. Who knew what enemies might lurk in the woods?</p>
<p class="para">但有利因素打破了平衡。利德尔和霍尔保持着密切且相互尊重的工作关系。而且这是一个绝佳的机会。霍尔不仅需要他帮助推销 PARC 的技术，还需要他将其分散的部分组装成一个连贯的整体——从一片混乱中创造出一条全新的产品线。</p><p class="para">But the pluses tipped the balance. Liddle and Hall enjoyed a close and mutually respectful working relationship. And the opportunity was spectacular. Hall needed him not merely to help merchandise PARC’s technology, but to assemble its disparate pieces into a coherent whole—to create an entirely new product line out of a magnificent jumble.</p>
<p class="para">“就是这样，”利德尔回忆道。“我看着这些很酷的东西被做出来，但我不知道它们会如何进入市场。那里堆满了这么多优秀的原材料。我的想法是坐下来，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch17.html.page243"></a>仔细考虑架构——因为当然这些事情都是在 PARC 独立和临时完成的，就像你总是想在研究环境中做的那样。另外，我坦率地觉得，如果我不去做，他们可能会指派一些不合适的人，这些人不会真正<span class="italic">了解</span>PARC 和我们正在尝试做的事情。”</p><p class="para">“That was it,” Liddle recalled. “I looked at all this cool stuff getting done and I did not see how it was going to get to market. There was so much great raw material just piled up there. My idea was to sit down and <a></a>think through an architecture—because of course these things were all done somewhat independently and ad hoc at PARC, as you always want to do in a research setting. Also, I frankly felt that if I didn’t go and do it they’d probably assign some inappropriate person who wouldn’t really <span class="italic">get</span> PARC and what we were trying to do.”</p>
<p class="para">这个刚刚起步的部门花了五年多的时间才将其第一款主要产品推向市场。正如霍尔所担心的那样，他未能挺过第一次清洗。但利德尔做到了。当系统开发部门完成其艰巨的工作并向世界推出传奇的施乐之星时，利德尔将成为负责人。</p><p class="para">More than five years would pass before this fledgling division would bring its first major product to market. As Hall had feared, he did not survive the first purge. But Liddle did. When the Systems Development Division completed its arduous work and introduced the legendary Xerox Star to the world, Liddle would be the man in charge.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">系统开发部门的诞生源于施乐公司试图将其品牌从复印机扩展到新型办公设备。这个市场就像大型计算机市场一样，由 IBM 主导，尽管并非那么稳固。施乐公司实际上已经开始凭借一系列带有其备受推崇的品牌的文字处理器、传真机和电子打印机产品线，在与蓝色巨人的竞争中取得重大进展。但这些设备充其量只是最先进的，而不是领先于最先进的。</p><p class="para">The Systems Development Division had its genesis in Xerox’s drive to expand its brand name beyond copiers and into new kinds of office equipment. This market, like the one for mainframe computers, was dominated by IBM, if not quite as unassailably. Xerox actually was beginning to make serious headway against Big Blue with a product line of word processors, fax machines, and electronic printers bearing its well-respected nameplate. But these devices were at best state-of-the-art, not ahead of the art.</p>
<p class="para">1974 年，总部的一个工作组得出结论，制造更先进的办公“系统”并销售给业务范围广泛、分布广泛的大型企业客户，可能还有更多机会。委员会建议成立一个新部门来服务这个市场。乔治·帕克和杰克·戈德曼明白，这是将 PARC 技术推向商业市场的最佳机会，于是决定让熟悉该领域的人员来管理这个部门。</p><p class="para">In 1974 a headquarters task force concluded there might be more opportunities yet in manufacturing more advanced office “systems” for sale to large corporate customers with extensive and far-flung operations. The committee recommended the formation of a new division to serve this market. George Pake and Jack Goldman, understanding that this was their best chance to get PARC’s technology into the commercial marketplace, maneuvered to place the unit under someone with a working knowledge of the territory.</p>
<p class="para">在这方面他们取得了一定程度的成功。新的系统开发部门（SDD）不向高盛汇报，而是向另一位从福特调来的财务人员唐纳德·伦诺克斯汇报，后者在韦伯斯特的办公室负责监督施乐的产品开发。但在 1975 年 1 月 1 日，哈罗德·霍尔被任命负责该部门，而他的整个施乐职业生涯都在 PARC 度过。</p><p class="para">In this they succeeded, up to a point. The new Systems Development Division, or SDD, was to report not to Goldman but to another transplanted Ford finance man, Donald Lennox, who supervised Xerox product development out of an office in Webster. But on January 1, 1975, Harold Hall, whose entire Xerox career had been spent at PARC, was named to run it.</p>
<p class="para">霍尔在战前接受过核物理学家的培训，但他已经从事这一行业几十年了。相反，他设计了一个<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch17.html.page244"></a>他有着长期的专业研究经理生涯，曾在利弗莫尔武器实验室（爱德华·泰勒领导下）、高级研究计划局、福特的航空电子分部和辛格公司的高科技分部工作过，最后于 1972 年加入 PARC。正如他后来以特有的谦逊口吻所说，在与才华横溢的科学家们共事多年后，“我已经培养并磨练出了一种技能，可以让我自己对那些智力天赋远超我的人有所帮助。”</p><p class="para">Hall had trained before the war as a nuclear physicist, but it had been many decades since he had plied that trade. Instead he had fashioned a <a></a>long career as a professional research manager, touching down at places like the Livermore Weapons Laboratory (under Edward Teller), ARPA, the Aeronutronics division of Ford, and a high-tech division of Singer before landing at PARC in 1972. As he put it later with characteristic self-effacement, after so many years working among exceptionally brilliant scientists “I had developed and honed the skill of making myself useful to people whose intellectual gifts dwarfed my own.”</p>
<p class="para">他是土生土长的南达科他州人，在大萧条时期从农场的赤贫生活成长为一名模范企业官僚，性格迷人，在战争期间和战后核武器计划工作中有着大量引人入胜的故事。1971 年，他因他人的权力游戏而被赶下辛格副总裁一职，于是他向福特公司的老同事杰克·戈德曼寻求工作机会。戈德曼将他派到 PARC，因为他认为他是乔治·帕克的完美搭档，在接下来的十年里，他几乎一直担任乔治·帕克的忠实副手。</p><p class="para">A native South Dakotan, he had emerged from grinding poverty on a Depression-era farm to become an exemplary corporate bureaucrat with a charming personality and a store of fascinating yarns about his work on the nuclear weapons program during and after the war. When in 1971 he got nudged out of his Singer vice presidency by someone else’s power play, he had called upon his old Ford colleague Jack Goldman for a job. Goldman sent him to PARC because he considered him the perfect foil for George Pake, who he would serve almost continuously as a loyal lieutenant for the next decade.</p>
<p class="para">帕克最初指派霍尔接替比尔·冈宁 (Bill Gunning) 接管系统科学实验室，后者渴望重新开始动手研究。霍尔忠于自己的直觉，作为 SSL 负责人，霍尔对实验室的工作非常熟悉，因此艾伦·凯 (Alan Kay) 和阿黛尔·戈德堡 (Adele Goldberg) 对他非常友好。“我知道不能假装自己缺乏知识，否则肯定会被 PARC 拒绝，”他说，并开玩笑说这份工作似乎主要是在艾伦·凯 (Alan Kay) 的费用报告上签字。</p><p class="para">Pake initially assigned Hall to take over the Systems Science Lab from Bill Gunning, who yearned to get back to hands-on research. True to his instincts, as SSL chief Hall familiarized himself with the work being done in his lab just enough to be genially manipulated by Alan Kay and Adele Goldberg. “I knew better than to pretend knowledge I lacked, the surest way to be rejected by PARC,” he said, joking that the job seemed to consist chiefly of affixing his signature to Alan Kay’s expense reports.</p>
<p class="para">霍尔体魄强健、满头银发、思想自由，在帕洛阿尔托充满智力刺激的环境中养育着五个才华横溢的孩子，过着心满意足的生活。他的野心非常克制，几乎无法对施乐组织结构中比他高的人构成威胁。他觉得新职位最令人满意的是，他获得了副总裁的职位——这是他自从失去辛格的最后一个职位以来一直渴望获得的唯一公司头衔。</p><p class="para">Athletic, silver-haired, and free-thinking, Hall led a contented life raising his five accomplished children in the intellectually stimulating atmosphere of Palo Alto, displaying such neatly constrained ambitions that he could hardly pose a threat to anyone above him in the Xerox organizational chart. What he found particularly gratifying about his new assignment was that it came with a vice presidency—the one corporate title he had aspired to since the day he lost his last one at Singer.</p>
<p class="para">然而，霍尔发现，他和他的新老板对 SDD 的使命的看法完全不同。唐·伦诺克斯是麦克纳马拉的另一位神童——他是帮助罗伯特·麦克纳马拉重塑福特管理的一群年轻而聪明的技术官僚之一（他后来在五角大楼也尝试了同样的方法，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch17.html.page245"></a>霍尔和伦诺克斯的合作并不那么顺利（他们的老板成为了肯尼迪的国防部长）。伦诺克斯是一位“友好、直率、善意”的金融专家，但对先进产品开发的复杂性一无所知。霍尔预计 SDD 将设计和销售全新一代办公信息系统，而伦诺克斯似乎认为这项任务只不过是混合和搭配一些现成的组件。在霍尔向韦伯斯特汇报与伦诺克斯第一次会面的那天，他们之间的愿景差异就变得清晰起来。霍尔原本以为自己会得到 100 人或更多的员工，但他却发现，自己被分配了一个由 6 名前 SDS 工程师组成的残余小队在埃尔塞贡多，还有 4 个空缺职位等他随意填补。</p><p class="para">Hall found, however, that he and his new boss were on entirely different wavelengths in terms of how they viewed SDD’s mission. Don Lennox was another ex-McNamara whiz kid—one of the troupe of young and brilliant technocrats who had helped Robert McNamara remake Ford management (and would attempt the same at the Pentagon, with <a></a>less distinguished results, when their boss became J.F.K.’s Defense Secretary). He was a “friendly, direct, and well-meaning” financial expert, but profoundly at sea with the complexities of advanced product development. Where Hall anticipated that SDD would design and market an entirely new generation of office information systems, Lennox appeared to think the task involved nothing more than mixing and matching a few off-the-shelf components. The disparity between their visions became clear the day Hall reported to Webster for his first meeting with Lennox. Fully expecting to be granted a staff of 100 persons or more, he learned instead that he had been assigned a rump platoon of six ex-SDS engineers in El Segundo, along with four open positions to fill as he pleased.</p>
<p class="para">他掩饰了自己的沮丧，回到帕洛阿尔托，尽最大努力工作。他首先打电话给戴夫·利德尔。“跟我来，”他说，“你可以把你们在 PARC 所做的所有出色工作整合成一个架构。”</p><p class="para">Hiding his dismay, he returned to Palo Alto to get on as best he could. His first call was to Dave Liddle. “Come with me,” he said, “and you can pull together an architecture out of all the good work you guys have done at PARC.”</p>
<p class="para">对于利德尔来说，霍尔的邀请是一种解脱。施乐公司最近邀请他领导韦伯斯特的一个显示设备研究项目。尽管这是一次晋升，但他觉得这份工作毫无吸引力。首先，他讨厌搬回东部的想法。此外，他认为自己是一名计算机科学家，而韦伯斯特的人根本不是。最后，他对显示技术感到厌倦，这是他在密歇根大学学习期间一直研究的领域。</p><p class="para">For Liddle, Hall’s invitation was an act of deliverance. Xerox had recently asked him to head up a research project on display devices in Webster. Even though this would be a promotion, he found the offer unenchanting. For one thing, he hated the thought of moving back East. Plus he thought of himself as a computer scientist, and the people at Webster were anything but. Finally, he was bored with display technology, which had been his field of study since his days at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p class="para">SDD 的工作解决了所有这些问题。因此，当 Hall 招募 Ron Rider、Charles Simonyi 和 Chuck Thacker 填补最后三个空缺职位以填补其稀缺的名册时，Liddle 则全身心投入起草技术路线图以指导新部门的工作。</p><p class="para">The SDD job answered all those concerns. So while Hall filled out his meager roster by recruiting Ron Rider, Charles Simonyi, and Chuck Thacker to his last three open slots, Liddle dove into the task of drafting a technical road map to guide the new division.</p>
<p class="para">“哈罗德是个聪明人，所以他知道哪些技术最适合使用，”利德尔回忆道。“但评估这些技术实际上取决于我。我听取了很多意见，与 PARC 的很多人交谈，并让不同的人审查。”</p><p class="para">“Harold was a smart guy, so he had some sense of which technologies were most appropriate to use,” Liddle recalled. “But it was really up to me to assess them. And I got lots of opinions, talked to lots of people at PARC, and had different folks look it over.”</p>
<p class="para">这份文件被他称为“办公信息系统架构”，正式确定了他和 PARC 同事们设想的综合办公信息系统的所有要素。每个人都有自己的工作站（前面是高质量的<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch17.html.page246"></a>PARC 的计算机系统包括：计算机（例如，位图显示屏）以及用于打印和文件存储的公用机器或服务器。所有计算机系统都通过以太网连接，其容量为每秒 10 兆比特（是 PARC 以太网的三倍多），并由 PARC 最先进的操作系统和应用软件的工业级版本提供支持。这是 PARC 辉煌的头五年的成果，最终转化为商业产品。简而言之，正如利德尔所说，“它是阿尔托之子。”</p><p class="para">The “Office Information Systems Architecture” as he called the document, formally set down all the elements of an integrated office information system as he and his PARC colleagues envisioned them. There would be personal workstations for every individual (fronted by high-quality <a></a>bitmapped display screens) as well as communal machines, or servers, for printing and file storage. All were to be linked to each other by Ethernet with a capacity of ten megabits per second—more than three times the power of PARC’s Ethernet—and powered by industrial-strength versions of PARC’s most advanced operating systems and application software. It was the work of PARC’s magnificent first five years transformed into a commercial product. In short, as Liddle said, “It was son of Alto.”</p>
<p class="para">从那一刻起，直到 1981 年 4 月公开推出施乐 8010 办公系统“Star”，这一基本轮廓从未改变。Star 将成为一项卓越的工程壮举，也许是有史以来最完美的集成办公计算机系统。Liddle 计划开发阶段需要五年时间，但他也预计该系统的架构将为行业树立至少十年的标准。</p><p class="para">From that moment through to the public introduction in April 1981 of the Xerox 8010 office system, the “Star,” this basic outline would never change. The Star would emerge as a superb feat of engineering and perhaps the most perfectly integrated office computer system of all time. Liddle planned on the development phase taking five years, but he also anticipated that the system’s architecture would set a standard in the industry for at least another ten.</p>
<p class="para">然而，激励《星报》设计师的愿景是 SDD 为数不多的在随后几年中保持稳定的东西之一。SDD 成立五个月后，唐·伦诺克斯被调任。他的继任者是鲍勃·斯帕拉西诺，一位拥有施乐从通用汽车引进的扎实工程经验的高管。斯帕拉西诺立刻不喜欢霍尔，一个月后，霍尔被解雇，因为他的偏执竟然如此迅速地应验了，这让他大吃一惊。（他回到了帕克的团队。）在接下来的三年半里，SDD 换了三任负责人，但没有一个能坚持几个月，直到 1978 年，最高职位最终移交给了利德尔，他不知何故在所有的动荡中都保持了低调。正如梅特卡夫后来开玩笑说的那样：“有一段时间，在施乐，最危险的工作就是做大卫·利德尔的老板。” <span class="sup">*</span></p><p class="para">The vision animating the Star’s designers, however, was one of the few things about SDD that would remain stable through the coming years. Five months after launching SDD, Don Lennox was reassigned. His replacement was Bob Sparacino, an executive with solid engineering credentials Xerox had imported from General Motors. Sparacino took an instant dislike to Hall and a month later Hall, astonished at how swiftly his paranoia had been fulfilled, was dumped. (He returned to Pake’s staff.) Over the next three and one-half years SDD had three chiefs, none of them lasting more than a matter of months, until finally, in 1978, the top job devolved to Liddle, who somehow had managed to keep his head down amid all the turmoil. As Metcalfe later joked: “For a while the most dangerous job to have at Xerox was to be David Liddle’s boss.”<span class="sup">*</span></p>
<p class="para">与此同时，SDD 很快就突破了伦诺克斯对其规模的限制。1981 年，该组织向世界推出了《星报》，并且<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch17.html.page247"></a>该部门为施乐的多种产品开发了基础系统技术——它并不是一个只有十个人的小店，而是一个在帕洛阿尔托雇用了 180 名工程师、在埃尔塞贡多雇用了 100 名工程师的庞然大物。作为 PARC 技术的指定商业渠道，该部门还获得了作为施乐旗手的崇高地位。这在一定程度上解释了 Star 刻意设计得庄严的原因。它的目标用户不是秘书和职员，而是他们的老板，即高管和专业人士——这一雄心壮志引发了当时营销专家的怀疑，但却准确地预示了个人电脑后来作为办公设备的发展。（这一雄心壮志还促使 Star 的架构师尽可能地将用户界面设计为鼠标导向。1981 年，施乐的宣传手册称 Star 是“专为打字技能很少或没有打字技能的专业商务人士设计的”。）</p><p class="para">SDD, meanwhile, soon burst the restraints Lennox had placed on its size. The organization that presented the Star to the world in 1981—and <a></a>developed a basic system technology for a wide range of Xerox products—was no ten-person shop but a colossus employing 180 engineers in Palo Alto and another 100 in El Segundo. As the designated commercial outlet for PARC technology, the division also acquired an exalted sense of its stature as a flag-bearer for Xerox. This partially accounted for the Star’s deliberately stately design. Its target users were not secretaries and clerks but their bosses, who were executives and professionals—an ambition that inspired skepticism among marketing experts of the time but accurately foretold the later evolution of the personal computer as an office device. (This ambition also drove the Star’s architects to make the user interface as mouse-oriented as possible. A Xerox promotional brochure would state in 1981 that the Star was “designed specifically for professional business people with little or no typing skills.”)</p>
<p class="para">SDD 的主管们正确地理解了施乐总部希望产品开发项目具有一定的最低限度的重要性。一位技术经理观察到：“施乐很难理解任何不是 1 亿美元业务的东西。”然而，其他人担心，在等待该部门推出其功能齐全的产品时，施乐可能会无意中错过无数规模较小但仍有希望的机会。</p><p class="para">SDD’s chiefs correctly understood that Xerox headquarters expected a product development program to possess a certain minimum heft. “Xerox had a hard time understanding anything that wouldn’t be a $100-million business,” observed one technology manager. Others feared, however, that in waiting for the division to unveil its fully featured product, Xerox might inadvertently miss out on myriad smaller, but still promising, opportunities.</p>
<p class="para">因此，SDD 管理层尽管不经常，但还是认真地努力让总部对开展不那么雄心勃勃的市场探索感兴趣。例如，1976 年，作为该部门的负责人，前 SDS 高管罗伯特·斯宾拉德 (Robert Spinrad) 试图说服技术主管吉姆·奥尼尔 (Jim O'Neill) 为办公室文职市场推出一款缩小版的低成本 Alto。</p><p class="para">SDD management accordingly made earnest, if infrequent, efforts to interest headquarters in staging less ambitious market probes. As head of the division in 1976, for instance, the former SDS executive Robert Spinrad attempted to persuade Jim O’Neill, the head of technology, to introduce a downscaled low-cost Alto for the office clerical market.</p>
<p class="para">奥尼尔回应说，施乐公司对占领他眼中偏远的滩头阵地不感兴趣。他认为，让其他人在技术先锋中占据一席之地会更安全。施乐公司会等待时机，然后通过大规模、集中的攻击击败他们。“如果我们现在就把它消灭，我们就会暴露自己的弱点，”他告诉斯宾拉德。“虽然我们会取得早期的成功，但其他人会看着我们，并拿出一款在现场维护得更好的精心设计的产品。我们只会输掉这场大战。”</p><p class="para">O’Neill responded that Xerox was uninterested in taking what he saw as a remote beachhead. It would be safer, he argued, to let others establish positions in the technical vanguard. Xerox would bide its time and overrun them later with a massive, concentrated attack. “If we put it out right now we’ll tip our hand,” he told Spinrad. “While we’ll have an early success, others will look at us and come in with a well-engineered product that can be maintained better in the field. We’ll just lose the big battle.”</p>
<p class="para">“我的想法是，”斯宾拉德回忆道，“我们可以从小处着手，然后逐渐发展壮大。但我在每一次战斗中都失败了。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch17.html.page248"></a>那个时代的施乐公司什么都做，就是不进行全面的产品开发。”</p><p class="para">“My notion,” Spinrad recalled, “was that we could build small and develop up. But I lost every one of those fights. There was no way the <a></a>Xerox Corporation of that era was going to do anything but full-scale product development.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">SDD 成立大约一年半后，戴夫·利德尔 (Dave Liddle) 劝说鲍勃·梅特卡夫 (Bob Metcalfe) 回到帕洛阿尔托。他发现这并非难事，因为梅特卡夫已经对他的新雇主——花旗银行的子公司——感到不满，该子公司通过洛杉矶的计算机中心处理花旗银行的电子资金转账。</p><p class="para">About a year and a half after SDD’s founding, Dave Liddle tempted Bob Metcalfe back to Palo Alto. He did not find it a difficult sale, for Metcalfe had grown disaffected with his new employer, a subsidiary of Citibank that handled the giant bank’s electronic fund transfers out of a computer center in Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="para">七个月后，他成功地让公司摆脱了老旧的定制读卡器，转而使用运行交互式软件的数字 PDP-11。不幸的是，他发现他的人类同事不如机器那么听话。“有人向我保证，六个月后我会成为副总裁，”他回忆道。但当他要求公司兑现承诺时，他的老板却以他还不到三十岁为由反悔了。“他说，‘我不能这么做，你太年轻了。这真的会打乱计划。没什么大不了的。’我说，‘这对我来说是一件大事。’”</p><p class="para">After seven months he had succeeded in weaning the operation from its aging custom-built card readers and onto Digital PDP-11s running interactive software. Unfortunately, he found his human colleagues less tractable than the machines. “I’d been promised that I would be made a vice president after six months,” he recalled. But when he demanded that the company make good on its offer, his boss reneged on the grounds that he was not yet thirty. “He said, ‘I can’t do that, you’re just too young. It would really upset the applecart. It’s no big deal.’ I said, ‘It’s a big deal to me.”</p>
<p class="para">利德尔和梅特卡夫之间的友谊建立在众多共同点之上。他们都是身材高大、体格健壮、自命不凡、不惧炫耀权力的人。作为前大学运动员，他们在球场上发泄挫折，通常是在对方身上。梅特卡夫经常在网球比赛中击败利德尔，而利德尔曾在 20 世纪 60 年代中期短暂地在密歇根大学打过校队篮球，因此在篮板球方面可以果断击败他。</p><p class="para">The friendship between Liddle and Metcalfe was anchored by a multitude of common traits. They were both tall, solid men with built-in swaggers, unashamed to throw their weight around. As ex-college jocks they worked out their frustrations on the field of play, often on each other. Metcalfe could regularly beat Liddle at tennis, his game; but Liddle, who had briefly played varsity basketball at the University of Michigan in the mid—1960s, could whom him decisively under the boards.</p>
<p class="para">有一次，利德尔凭借大学队的背景击败了梅特卡夫，取得了决定性的胜利。梅特卡夫是洛杉矶一位刚刚离婚的单身汉，生活富足，他订了两张洛杉矶湖人队比赛的场馆座位，距离比赛场地很近，他的鞋尖可以碰到边线。他邀请了利德尔，后者一直吹嘘自己曾在密歇根大学与湖人队后卫卡齐·拉塞尔一起打球。</p><p class="para">One time his varsity background enabled Liddle to score a decisive victory off Metcalfe. The latter, living high off the hog as a newly divorced bachelor in Los Angeles, had secured a pair of floor seats to the L.A. Lakers games, close enough to the action for the toes of his shoes to nuzzle the side line. He invited Liddle, who had long bragged of having played ball at Michigan with Lakers guard Cazzie Russell.</p>
<p class="para">“我们都会说，是的，是的，你当时在密歇根大学，卡齐·拉塞尔也在那里，是的，当然，”梅特卡夫回忆道。这次，他和利德尔在洛杉矶论坛的地板上坐下，正好赶上湖人队开始热身。当梅特卡夫惊讶得哑口无言地看着时，卡齐·拉塞尔径直走向戴夫·利德尔。“他走过来说道<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch17.html.page249"></a>大意是这样的，‘你好吗，利德尔，我的朋友，好久不见了’，然后他又带了另一个名人，比如卡里姆·阿布杜勒-贾巴尔，然后说，‘见见我的朋友大卫，我一直跟你提起…’好吧，从此我相信戴夫·利德尔永远不会撒谎，因为他显然没有夸大他和卡齐·拉塞尔的关系。”</p><p class="para">“We’d all say, yeah, yeah, you were at Michigan and Cazzie Russell was there too, yeah, sure,” Metcalfe recalled. On this occasion, he and Liddle took their seats on the floor of the Los Angeles Forum just as the Lakers came out for their warmup. As Metcalfe watched in mute astonishment, Cazzie Russell made a beeline for Dave Liddle. “He came over and said <a></a>something to the effect of, ‘How you doin’, Liddle, my man, it’s been a long time,’ then he brought over another famous guy like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and it’s, ‘Meet my friend David I’ve been telling you about…’ Well, thereinafter I believed Dave Liddle could never lie, because he had obviously not been exaggerating in the slightest about his relationship with Cazzie Russell.”</p>
<p class="para">当梅特卡夫因失去副总裁职位而愤然离开花旗集团时，利德尔准备趁机抓住他。梅特卡夫曾是 PARC 第一位离开的知名研究人员，令其赞叹不已，现在他又成为第一位回归的研究人员（虽然严格来说，他是回到了 SDD，而不是 PARC）。他在 PARC 的最后薪水与 37,000 美元的新工资之间的差额相当于大楼里任何人获得的最大涨幅。通过在其他地方工作一段时间来获得施乐加薪的策略后来被称为“梅特卡夫晋升”，这个术语进一步让获奖者感到高兴。</p><p class="para">When Metcalfe quit Citicorp in a huff over his withheld vice presidency, Liddle was ready to grab him on the rebound. Metcalfe, who had inspired awe at PARC by becoming the first well-known researcher to leave, now became the first to return (although technically he was returning to SDD, rather than PARC). The difference between his final PARC salary and his new wage of $37,000 amounted to the biggest raise anyone in the building had ever received. The strategy of extracting a raise from Xerox by working somewhere else for a spell was known ever after as the “Metcalfe promotion,” a term that further gratified its honoree.</p>
<p class="para">“我从花旗银行拿到了 20% 到 30% 的利息，然后利德尔又给了我 10% 到 15% 的额外利息，让我赚回了钱，”他说，“但问题是我认识一些人，他们赚的钱比我多得多，而我认为他们并不比我聪明多少。”</p><p class="para">“I got twenty to thirty percent from Citibank, then Liddle gave me another ten to fifteen percent premium to get me back,” he said. “But the problem was I knew people who were making much more, and they were people I didn’t think were that much smarter than me.”</p>
<p class="para">梅特卡夫的新工作主要是将以太网的容量从每秒 3 兆位升级到 10 兆位，以满足 SDD 庞大的产品计划的需求。但他也需要以合同管理员的身份监督 Star 任务关键型中央处理器设计师查克·萨克。</p><p class="para">Metcalfe’s new job was primarily to upgrade Ethernet’s capacity from three to ten megabits per second to meet the demands of SDD’s formidable product plan. But he was also expected to ride herd, as a sort of contract administrator, on the designer of the Star’s mission-critical central processor, Chuck Thacker.</p>
<p class="para">仿佛他与 Thacker 之间那段充满历史的紧张关系还不够，1976 年 6 月，在 Metcalfe 接任新职务后，他发现整个项目都偏离了轨道。从结构上讲，SDD 一团糟。该部门有两个总部，一个在帕洛阿尔托，另一个在埃尔塞贡多，它接管了 SDS 腾出的一大片制造设施。这种安排让 Liddle 和他的直属上司们背负着两个相距五百英里、相互怨恨的半组织——北方分队充斥着 PARC 校友，南方分队则由重新分配的 SDS 员工组成，他们对帕洛阿尔托那些花哨的博士怀有旧怨。没有大量的电子邮件或网络<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch17.html.page250"></a>文件共享无法缓解重新燃起的紧张局势，只有乘飞机无休止地往返的 SDD 经理进行个人调解。</p><p class="para">As if his historically charged relationship with Thacker were not problem enough, on assuming his new duties in June 1976 Metcalfe discovered that the entire project was careening off the tracks. Structurally speaking, SDD was a mess. The division had two headquarters, one in Palo Alto and the other in El Segundo, where it had taken over a block of manufacturing facilities vacated by SDS. This arrangement burdened Liddle and his cavalcade of immediate superiors with two mutually resentful semi-organizations located five hundred miles apart—the northern contingent thickly seeded with PARC alumni and the southern branch staffed with reassigned SDS employees nursing old grievances against the fancy Ph.D.s in Palo Alto. No volume of e-mail or networked <a></a>file sharing could quench the rekindled tensions, only the personal intercession of SDD managers shuttling endlessly back and forth by air.</p>
<p class="para">地理上的差距只是众多麻烦中的一个。该项目的进度几乎从第一天开始就被推迟了。建造这颗雄心勃勃的 Star“花费的时间比所有人想象的要长，难度也比所有人想象的要大”，前恩格尔巴特工程师、曾帮助梅特卡夫监督 Thacker 工作的 Bob Belleville 回忆道。而主要的困境就在这里。Thacker 的处理器设计被称为“Dolphin”，它让所有人都不满意。它几乎在每一个方面都超出了规格——太大、太慢、太热、太贵——就好像 Thacker 这个极简主义的典范莫名其妙地屈服于令人震惊的“大而无当”的攻击。</p><p class="para">The geographical rift was only one of numerous headaches. The project’s schedule had slipped almost from Day One. Building the ambitious Star “was taking, longer than everyone thought and it was harder than everyone thought,” recalled Bob Belleville, a former Engelbart engineer who helped Metcalfe supervise Thacker’s work. And there lay the main predicament. Thacker’s processor design, which was dubbed “Dolphin,” satisfied no one. It busted its specifications in almost every measure—too big, too slow, too hot, too expensive—as if Thacker, the minimalist paragon, had unaccountably succumbed to an alarming attack of biggerism.</p>
<p class="para">然而，大部分责任都归咎于规格本身。SDD 的目标是将两项独立的技术捆绑在一起：办公自动化，包括可编程文字处理和网络；以及使用高速激光的高质量数字复印和打印。设计一个处理器来处理这两项任务可能很容易，但将它们组合在一起就像化圆为方——表面上简单，实际上不可能。</p><p class="para">Most of the blame, however, belonged to the specs themselves. SDD’s ambition was to bundle together two separate technologies: office automation, including programmable word processing and networking; and high-quality digital copying and printing with high-speed lasers. Designing a processor to handle either task might have been manageable, but putting them together was like squaring the circle—simple on its face and impossible in practice.</p>
<p class="para">“查克最终设计出了一台在两个方面都不太出色的机器，”他的朋友巴特勒·兰普森 (Butler Lampson) 说道。“在很早的时候，他们就应该说，‘这是不可能的，我们无法同时满足这两个要求。’但他却坚持设计了这台机器，它对于办公自动化应用来说有点大而笨重，而且没有成像应用所需的功能。它失败了。”</p><p class="para">“Chuck ended up designing a machine that wasn’t very good for either purpose,” remarked his friend Butler Lampson. “At a very early stage they should have said, ‘This is impossible, we can’t meet both of these requirements.’ But instead he soldiered on and designed this thing which was kind of big and clunky for the office automation application and didn’t have the power that was needed for the imaging application. It was a bust.”</p>
<p class="para">此外，萨克使用的是上一次战争的武器。由于新系统的组件比 Alto 大得多，速度也快得多（以太网速度提高了三倍，这只能说明问题的严重性），因此他的设计计划是采用原来的 Alto 处理器，然后简单地将其扩大。事实上，需要的是一个全新的架构。</p><p class="para">Moreover, Thacker was fighting his battle using the weapons of the last war. Because the new system’s components were exponentially bigger and faster than the Alto’s—that the Ethernet had tripled in speed only hinted at the size of the problem—his design plan was to take the original Alto processor and simply scale it up. In fact, what was needed was an entirely new architecture.</p>
<p class="para">“Alto 是一款完美融合了各种技术的机器，”Belleville 说道。“它诞生的时机恰到好处。它吸收了各种想法，并将它们打造成当时非常强大且价格低廉的机器。但现在，显示器更大、速度更快，以太网<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch17.html.page251"></a>计算机越来越大，越来越快，磁盘也越来越大，越来越快。复杂性迅速上升，Thacker 陷入了困境。”</p><p class="para">“The Alto was a machine that was a happy confluence of technologies,” Belleville observed. “It was built at the right time. It took a mess of ideas and made them into a machine that was for the time extraordinarily powerful and cheap. But now the display was bigger and faster, and Ethernet <a></a>was bigger and faster, and the disks were bigger and faster. The complexity rose very quickly and Thacker ran into a brick wall.”</p>
<p class="para">中央处理器无法跟上其超强外围设备的速度，这给系统的其他部分带来了更大的压力。人们永远无法确定处理器是否能及时完成一项任务，以便处理下一项任务——例如，数据位可能从磁盘流入得如此之快，以至于处理器可能来不及接收它们，就像网球运动员试图回击一台增强型发球机的截击球一样。在这种情况下，系统就会崩溃。</p><p class="para">The central processor’s inability to keep up with its supercharged peripherals increased pressure on the rest of the system. One could never be sure the processor would be finished with one task in time to handle the next—data bits might stream in so fast from the disk, for example, that the processor, like a tennis player trying to return the volleys of a souped-up ball machine, might not be in position to receive them. In that event, the system would crash.</p>
<p class="para">Thacker 感到陷入了僵局。“你可以用各种方式来权衡成本、性能和上市时间，”他解释道。“但如果你试图将这三者结合起来，你可能会陷入设计空间中不可行的部分。这就是 Dolphin 的情况。为了降低成本，我们大幅降低了性能——但仍然无法达到成本目标。它仍然比 Alto 快，而且它有一些 Alto 没有的东西，比如虚拟内存和缓存，但它太贵了。”</p><p class="para">Thacker felt deadlocked. “You can trade off cost and performance and time to market in various ways,” he explained. “But if you try to bind all three of them you may wind up in an infeasible part of the design space. That’s what happened with the Dolphin. In order to cut the costs we cut the performance down quite a bit—and still couldn’t meet the cost goals. It was still faster than the Alto and it had some things the Alto didn’t have, like virtual memory and caches, but it was just too expensive.”</p>
<p class="para">梅特卡夫对他提出了尖刻的要求，要求他进步，而他则努力保持紧张的日程安排。这种压力让他几乎精疲力竭。“我的小组大约有 15 个人，一半在帕洛阿尔托，一半在埃尔塞贡多，”萨克回忆道。“而我每周要花两天时间往返于埃尔塞贡多。这让我崩溃了。”</p><p class="para">Metcalfe pelted him with acerbic demands for progress while he tried to maintain a grueling schedule. The pressure brought him to the edge of burnout. “My group had about fifteen people in it and half were in Palo Alto and half in El Segundo,” Thacker recalled. “And I would commute two days a week to El Segundo. That just broke me.”</p>
<p class="para">在很大程度上，梅特卡夫只是在传递他从上级那里得到的那种压力。“施乐公司让一些员工从康涅狄格州过来检查我们的工作情况，”他回忆道。“我的工作就是站在这些混蛋面前，给他们做报告。我的工作很<span class="italic">有趣</span>。我会说，‘还记得我上次告诉你事情进展得有多顺利吗？但事情并没有那么顺利。这是意料之外的问题……’这种情况一直持续下去。”</p><p class="para">To a great extent, Metcalfe was only passing on the same tension he received from above. “Xerox had these staff guys who would come in from Connecticut to check up on what we were doing,” he recalled. “It was my job to stand up in front of these bastards and give them these presentations. I had the <span class="italic">fun</span> job. I’d say, ‘Remember last time I told you how well it was going? Well, it hasn’t worked out that way. Here’s the unforeseen problem…’ And this went on forever.”</p>
<p class="para">SDD 别无选择。如果 Thacker 无法完成工作，整个项目都会陷入危险，因为他是顶尖处理器设计师，知识来源直接来自 PARC。但他们只能逼迫他到这个地步，因为严格来说他不是 SDD 的员工，只是正式借调的承包商。</p><p class="para">SDD had few options. If Thacker could not get the job done, the entire project was in jeopardy, for he was the ace processor designer and the font of knowledge piped direct from PARC. Yet there was only so far they could push him, for he was not technically an employee of SDD—just a contractor, formally on loan.</p>
<p class="para">“戴夫不能简单地敲着查克的办公桌说，‘该死，我要解雇你！’”贝尔维尔回忆道。在一次郁闷的员工会议上，“他们都<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch17.html.page252"></a>担心查克会被卡车撞到，因为他是 SDD 硬件的开发人员。就在那时，梅特卡夫开玩笑说，“你们不知道的是，我正在一条小巷里等着，<span class="italic">开着</span>卡车。”</p><p class="para">“Dave could not simply bang on Chuck’s desk and say, ‘Dammit, I’ll fire you!’” Belleville recalled. During one morose staff meeting, “They were all <a></a>worrying about whether Chuck would be hit by a truck, because he was the one developing the hardware for SDD. Right then Metcalfe joked, ‘What you guys don’t realize is that I’m waiting in an alley, <span class="italic">driving</span> the truck.’”</p>
<p class="para">尽管困难重重，萨克的团队最终还是制造出了海豚。正如大家所担心的那样，它的问题很多，因为基本问题尚未解决。所有设计上的妥协都使它变得太大、太慢、太昂贵。疲惫不堪、士气低落的萨克回到了 CSL，在这里他可以再次不受商业截止日期的无情压力地工作。作为交换，CSL 为利德尔的部门提供了另一个帮助。这就是巴特勒·兰普森的代祷，就像希腊悲剧中的<span class="italic">天降神兵</span>。</p><p class="para">Against these great odds, Thacker’s team finally produced the Dolphin. It was as problematic as everyone feared, for the fundamental issues had not been solved. All the design compromises made had still left it too big, too slow, too expensive. Weary and demoralized, Thacker returned to CSL, where he could work once again sheltered from the merciless pressure of commercial deadlines. As though in exchange, CSL provided one more favor for Liddle’s division. This was the intercession, like the <span class="italic">deus ex machina</span> in a Greek tragedy, of Butler Lampson.</p>
<p class="para">当 Thacker 还在为 Dolphin 设计而苦苦挣扎时，Lampson 就意识到 SDD 的硬件努力正在遭遇挫折。Thacker、Metcalfe 和 Liddle 是他的朋友，他几乎能嗅到他们的恐慌。“我和他们聊了很多，我注意到 Dolphin 不会令人满意。但他们拒绝接受。我决定自己回到 Alto 的根源，再试一次。”这是典型的 PARC（也是典型的 Lampson）——对一个没有提出的问题不请自来的回答，随意地从气窗上掉下来。</p><p class="para">Lampson had become aware while Thacker was still struggling with the Dolphin design that SDD’s hardware effort was hitting the wall. Thacker, Metcalfe, and Liddle were his friends and he could almost smell their panic. “I kibitzed with them quite a bit and I noticed at some point that the Dolphin wasn’t going to be satisfactory. But they were in denial. I decided myself to go back to the roots of the Alto and give it another spin.” This was classic PARC (and classic Lampson)—an unsolicited answer to an unasked question dropped casually over the transom.</p>
<p class="para">对他来说，设计替代处理器就像爵士乐手在手边吹奏萨克斯。原材料是他重新审视问题的能力，以及美国国家半导体公司宣布推出的新型集成电路。由于该芯片实际上尚未投入生产，因此他的工作完全基于其书面规格。但当他意识到 Dolphin 处理器（与 Alto 一样）无法与其内部时钟同步时，他灵光一闪，克服了阻碍 Thacker 的障碍。</p><p class="para">For him the task of designing a substitute processor resembled a jazzman’s noodling on a handy sax. The raw materials were his ability to take a fresh look at the problem, and the appearance of a new integrated circuit that had been announced by National Semiconductor Corporation. Because the chip was actually not yet in production, he based his work entirely on its written specifications. But the flash of insight that enabled him to overcome the obstacles that had stymied Thacker came when he realized that the Dolphin processor—like the Alto’s—did not keep time with its own internal clock.</p>
<p class="para">这种所谓的“异步”架构以前从未出现过问题，因此 Thacker 为新机器重新实现了它。简而言之，Dolphin 和 Alto 根据它们正在执行的程序改变它们每个时钟周期执行的指令数量。更复杂的程序比简单的程序需要更多的指令（​​和更多的时间）。因此，系统只能猜测处理器何时可以提供服务<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch17.html.page253"></a>下一个需要的外围设备，无论是以太网收发器还是磁盘控制器。由于 Alto 的处理器速度足以同时处理所有这些功能，因此从未出现任何问题。然而，考虑到 Dolphin 机器的不断增长的需求，这种非正式的安排并不可行。</p><p class="para">This so-called “asynchronous” architecture had never before been a problem, which is why Thacker had reimplemented it for the new machine. In simple terms, the Dolphin and Alto varied the number of instructions they performed each clock cycle according to the procedure they were executing. More complicated procedures required more instructions (and more time) than easy ones. Therefore the system could only guess when the processor would be available to service <a></a>the next needy peripheral, whether that was the Ethernet transceiver or the disk controller. Since the processor speed of the Alto was more than fast enough to handle all these functions together, nothing ever went awry. Given the stepped-up demands of the Dolphin machine, however, such an informal arrangement would not do.</p>
<p class="para">兰普森的“同步”设计与众不同，它在每个时钟周期内向处理器和内存提供固定数量的指令，这使他能够将所有外围设备与处理器同步，并消除了对何时可以处理传入位的猜测。由于一切都按照相同的时钟运行，因此必须保存在缓冲区中的数据量要小得多——这减轻了 Dolphin 硬件臃肿的设计。</p><p class="para">Lampson’s “synchronous” design differed by feeding a fixed number of instructions through the processor and memory per clock cycle, which enabled him to synchronize all the peripheral devices to the processor and eliminate the guesswork about when an incoming bit could be processed. With everything ticking along according to the same clock, a much smaller volume of data had to be held in buffers—which relieved the design of the Dolphin’s hardware bloat.</p>
<p class="para">贝尔维尔和其他人立刻意识到，兰普森在七张黄纸上勾勒出的设计比海豚运行速度更快、效率更高、温度更低。经过一些小改动后，他们将其重新命名为“蒲公英”（施乐公司帕洛阿尔托工程师在此期间生产的大部分机器都以“D”（代表“数字”）开头，并被统称为“D 机器”），并将其安装在海豚的位置，成为星形机器的心脏。一个主要障碍终于被扫清了。</p><p class="para">Belleville and the others saw instantly that the design Lampson had sketched out on seven sheets of lined yellow paper would run faster, more efficiently, and cooler than the Dolphin. After making a few minor changes, they renamed it “Dandelion” (most of the machines being turned out by Xerox’s Palo Alto engineers in this period got names starting with “D” for “Digital” and became known collectively as the “D machines”) and installed it in the Dolphin’s place as the heart of the Star. A major hurdle had finally been cleared.</p>
<p class="para">但距离 Star 的发布还有两年多的时间——而这将决定它的未来。虽然 Star 的设计初衷是成为办公人士的个人天堂，它采用金钱可以买到的最先进的技术部件精心组装而成，但它注定会在市场上被一种新型机器所打倒，这种机器显然不够天堂，用最便宜的部件快速而粗糙地组装而成，而且技术含量如此之低，以至于它与 Star 的关系几乎就像溜冰鞋与梅赛德斯奔驰的关系一样。</p><p class="para">But the Star was still more than two years from its launch—and that would make all the difference in its future. For while the Star was designed to be the office professional’s personal nirvana, meticulously assembled from the finest technological components money could buy, it was destined to get blindsided in the marketplace by a new species of machine that was quite explicitly less than nirvana, assembled quick and dirty from the cheapest components available, and so low-tech it bore almost the same relationship to the Star that a roller-skate does to a Mercedes-Benz.</p>
<p class="para">Star 是当时的一个传奇，在推出近二十年后，其性能仍然无与伦比，最终成为有史以来最华丽的过时机器之一。</p><p class="para">A legend in its own time, boasting capabilities still unmatched nearly twenty years after its launch, the Star would end up as one of the most resplendently obsolescent machines ever sold.</p>

<p class="para">到 1975 年，即 PARC 成立的第五年，乔治·帕克的预测变成了现实：该中心的发展已经超出了其原来的办公场所，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch17.html.page254"></a>还有一些。有 200 名员工分布在三个地点，从 Porter Drive 到 Hillview，现在租用了两栋建筑。3 月，随着 PARC 位于 3333 Coyote Hill Road 的永久办公楼投入使用，价值一千万美元，位于 34 号楼对面，这一最初的设想得以实现。</p><p class="para">By 1975, the fifth year of PARC’s existence, George Pake’s prediction had come true: The center had outgrown its original quarters, and <a></a>then some. There were two hundred employees spread among three locations ranging from Porter Drive up to Hillview, where two buildings were now rented. In March Jack Goldman’s original vision of a free-standing shrine to basic research was realized with the opening of PARC’s ten-million-dollar permanent home at 3333 Coyote Hill Road, directly across the street from Building 34.</p>
<p class="para">这座新建筑的诞生可谓艰难。它的奠基仪式被推迟了两年多，直到 1973 年 8 月才举行（戈德曼和其他几位贵宾带回了镀银的铲子，以纪念这一仪式）。这是因为一场由当地一家环保组织发现该地块的所有者斯坦福大学非法分割土地而引发的土地使用争议。所谓的绿色山麓委员会提起诉讼，阻止了该地块上的所有开发，直到迫切希望启动建设项目的施乐公司促成了和解。</p><p class="para">The new building had a difficult birth. Its groundbreaking had been delayed for more than two years, until August 1973 (Goldman and several other dignitaries took home silver-plated shovels marking the occasion), by an old land-use controversy enflamed by a local conservation group’s discovery that Stanford University, the site’s owner, had illegally subdivided the land. The so-called Committee for Green Foothills sued, tying up all development on the site until Xerox, desperate to get its construction project under way, brokered a settlement.</p>
<p class="para">作为协议的一部分，施乐和斯坦福同意了严格的建筑限制。PARC 大楼的面积不得超过 20 万平方英尺（其第一期实际上只有 12 万平方英尺），并且位于大多数主要街道上经过的汽车驾驶员看不到的地方。斯坦福的忏悔是承诺将几英亩相邻的（可能利润丰厚的）土地永久保留。</p><p class="para">As part of the deal Xerox and Stanford agreed to stringent construction restrictions. The PARC building was to be no more than 200,000 square feet (its first phase actually came to only 120,000) and situated out of view of motorists passing on most of the major local thoroughfares. Stanford’s penance was a pledge to leave several neighboring (and potentially lucrative) acres permanently undeveloped.</p>
<p class="para">PARC 的设计者是 Gyo Obata，他是一位建筑师，因设计了华盛顿特区的国家航空航天博物馆而声名鹊起。PARC 是一座长长的直线型混凝土建筑，装饰着空中花园。建筑呈阶梯状，沿着山坡层叠而下，形状像一个倒置的蛋糕，游客可以从三楼进入，那里是管理人员的办公场所，然后下到二楼（计算机和系统科学实验室）和一楼（通用和光学科学实验室）。底层是员工入口，令人满意的是，这里配备了一个带顶棚的自行车架。为了响应 Rick Jones 从该建筑未来的住户那里收集的建议，Obata 慷慨地在 PARC 的北立面安装了水平玻璃带，让室内沐浴在充足的阳光中，并为其配备了多个露天中庭，非常适合静静地沉思自然、技术及其联系。</p><p class="para">Designed by Gyo Obata, an architect who had made a name for himself with the arresting design of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., PARC was a long rectilinear concrete building adorned with hanging gardens. The building cascaded down the hillside in steps, arranged like an upside-down cake so that visitors entered on the third floor, where the administrative staff was housed, and descended to the second (occupied by the computer and system science labs) and first (the general and optical science labs). There at the bottom was a staff entrance, gratifyingly outfitted with a sheltered bike rack. Responding to suggestions Rick Jones had dutifully collected from the building’s future occupants, Obata generously fronted PARC’s northern elevation with horizontal ribbons of glass to bathe its interior in ample sunlight, and furnished it with numerous open-air atriums ideal for the tranquil contemplation of nature, technology, and the nexus thereof.</p>
<p class="para">Coyote Hill 大楼的竣工代表了<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch17.html.page255"></a>PARC 的公开形象。当地报纸刊登了对 Pake 的详尽采访、未来办公室的概述（“帕洛阿尔托施乐研究中心的科学家甚至不用复印机……”），以及对新旧科学融合的乐观言论。</p><p class="para">The completion of the Coyote Hill building represented a milestone in <a></a>PARC’s public profile. The local newspapers featured fulsome interviews with Pake, glimpses of the office of the future (“scientists at the Xerox Research Center in Palo Alto aren’t even working with copiers…”), and optimistic talk about the blending of the new sciences with the old.</p>
<p class="para">这与几百英里以南正在上演的残酷故事形成了鲜明对比。这是 SDS 的死亡守望。</p><p class="para">The contrast could not be greater with the grim saga playing itself out a few hundred miles to the south. This was the death watch over SDS.</p>
<p class="para">“McColough's Folly” 几乎从 1969 年易手的那一刻起就一直处于无效状态。它定期会受到某个特别小组的密切关注（杰瑞·艾尔金德于 1972 年在其中一个小组任职），但没有人能找到办法阻止赤字的蔓延。相反，施乐管理层试图通过将公司重组为三个职能部门（销售和营销、工程和制造以及战略和规划）并将计算机业务的部分业务分配给它们，将损失隐藏在资产负债表中。作为该计划的一部分，施乐于 1972 年解散了 SDS，将其作为一个独立实体，并解雇了自出售以来一直管理该公司的前帕列夫斯基副手丹·麦古克。</p><p class="para">“McColough’s Folly” had been an invalid virtually since the moment it changed hands back in 1969. Periodically it would come under the microscope of one task force or another (Jerry Elkind served on one such group in 1972), but no one could ever find a way to stanch the flow of red ink. Instead, Xerox management tried to hide the losses deep within the balance sheet by reorganizing the company into three functional organizations—sales and marketing, engineering and manufacturing, and strategy and planning—and distributing pieces of the computer business among them. As part of this program, Xerox in 1972 dissolved SDS as a separate entity and fired Dan McGurk, the former Palevsky lieutenant who had been running it ever since the sale.</p>
<p class="para">但这种策略无法掩盖计算业务的损失，就像农民无法通过将粪便撒在更多土地上来消除粪便的恶臭一样。到 1975 年初，施乐公司糟糕的整体业绩摧毁了华尔街对其管理层的最后一丝信心。该公司股价在 1972 年创下每股 179 美元的历史新高，但随后跌至 50 美元。据公司传说，有一天，在斯坦福总部的洗手间，公司以财务为导向的总裁阿奇·麦卡德尔 (Archie McCardell) 告诉麦考洛，他认为是时候完全放弃计算机业务了。作为回应，麦考洛召集了他的最后一个计算机特别工作组。其目的是找到切断 SDS 残存部分的最佳方法，这也许就是它被赋予荷马式代号“奥德赛”的原因。</p><p class="para">But this tactic could not disguise the losses in computing, any more than a farmer can obliterate the stench of manure by spreading it over more acreage. By early 1975 Xerox’s poor overall performance had destroyed the last of Wall Street’s confidence in its management. The stock, which had hit an all-time high of $179 a share in 1972, dropped to $50. Corporate legend has it that one day in the men’s room at Stamford headquarters Archie McCardell, the company’s finance-oriented president, told McColough he thought it was time to give up on the computer business altogether. In response, McColough convened his final computer task force. Its purpose was to find the best way to cut adrift what was left of SDS, which may be why it was given the Homeric code name “Odyssey.”</p>
<p class="para">奥德赛的成员中就有里格登·柯里 (Rigdon Currie)，他试图通过后卫行动阻止其原有部门的消亡。“我提议将业务缩减到我们原来的科学和实时计算客户群，而不是与 IBM 在商业市场上竞争，”他回忆道。“但我被踩了。”</p><p class="para">Among Odyssey’s members was Rigdon Currie, who tried to fight a rearguard action against the extinction of his old division. “I put in a pitch to cut the operation back to our original customer base in scientific and real-time computing, instead of competing with IBM in the business market,” he recalled. “I got stepped on.”</p>
<p class="para">奥德赛的结论是，计算机业务可能<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch17.html.page256"></a>既没有挽救，也没有以任何价格出售。柯里被赋予了一项令人不快的任务，即与霍尼韦尔达成尽可能好的交易，以换取其剩余的零碎，霍尼韦尔习惯于从其他公司在计算领域失败的项目中寻找残骸。为了弥补退出该业务的费用，施乐公司进行了 8440 万美元的巨额注销。此举导致该公司自 15 年前推出 914 型复印机以来首次出现年度亏损。</p><p class="para">Odyssey’s conclusion, instead, was that the computer business could be <a></a>neither saved nor sold at any price. Currie was handed the disagreeable assignment of cutting the best possible deal for its remaining odds and ends with Honeywell, which had made a practice of scavenging the shards of other companies’ failed ventures in computing. To cover the expense of getting out of the business, Xerox took an enormous $84.4 million writeoff. The action produced the company’s first annual loss since the introduction of the Model 914 copier, fifteen years earlier.</p>
<p class="para">SDS 的长期失败已经不复存在，只剩下现在安置在帕洛阿尔托山坡上新宫殿里的研究人员队伍。如果施乐公司要被说服数字技术是其未来的关键，那么他们必须独自证明这一点。</p><p class="para">Nothing was left of the long misadventure of SDS other than the platoon of researchers now installed in their imposing new hillside palace in Palo Alto. If Xerox was to be persuaded that digital technologies were the key to its future, it would be up to them alone to make the case.</p>

<p class="para">前几年，施乐经历了一系列的失望和尴尬。1975 年，SDS 收购案失败，这被称为“麦考洛的愚蠢行为”，导致 8440 万美元的资产减记。外国入侵演变成全面溃败，施乐在市场上没有竞争产品的细分市场中售出了十万台廉价日本复印机。然后，IBM 和柯达直接瞄准施乐传统客户群的核心，推出了自己的快速新型复印机。反垄断诉讼和专利侵权之争接踵而至。最糟糕的是，美国经济状况糟糕，受到高通胀和严重衰退的双重挤压，这种前所未有的组合被称为“滞胀”。</p><p class="para">The previous few years had been a skein of disappointments and embarrassments for Xerox. In 1975 had come the unraveling of the SDS purchase—“McColough’s Folly”—and the resulting $84.4 million writeoff. The foreign invasion had turned into a full-scale rout, with a hundred thousand inexpensive Japanese copiers sold in a market segment for which Xerox had no competing product. Then IBM and Kodak took direct aim at the heart of Xerox’s traditional customer base by introducing fast new copiers of their own. There were antitrust lawsuits and patent infringement battles. To top it all off, the U.S. economy was in terrible shape, squeezed by the pincers of high inflation and savage recession—an unprecedented combination known as “stagflation.”</p>
<p class="para">施乐公司董事长知道必须采取措施阻止士气低落，否则公司最优秀的高管和销售人员就会离开。他的解决方案是举办一场盛大的、具有历史意义的聚会。</p><p class="para">The Xerox chairman knew something had to be done to stem the erosion of morale or his best executives and salespersons would flee. His solution was to throw one huge, historic party.</p>
<p class="para">麦科洛设想 1977 年 11 月举行的施乐世界大会是一次全公司的复兴，也是最后一次尝试恢复近 20 年前推动公司崛起的激情，当时乔·威尔逊<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch18.html.page260"></a>把全部家当押在未经测试的技术上，赢得了世界。来宾名单将包括这家全球组织的 250 名高管及其配偶。地点将是佛罗里达州精致的博卡拉顿乡村俱乐部，在那里，为期四天的庆祝、劝诫和重生期间的食物、住宿和娱乐将始终是一流的。在麦考洛的想象中，这次活动将唤起 1971 年举行的上一届世界大会的氛围，当时施乐的财富和傲慢正处于顶峰。</p><p class="para">McColough envisioned the Xerox World Conference of November 1977 as a sort of company-wide revival, a last attempt to restore the passion that had fueled its rise nearly twenty years earlier, when Joe Wilson <a></a>bet the farm on an untested technology and won the world. The guest list would comprise the top 250 executives of the worldwide organization and their spouses. The setting would be Florida’s exquisite Boca Raton Country Club, where the food, accommodations, and entertainment through four days of celebration, exhortation, and rebirth would be first-class all the way. In McColough’s imagination, the affair would evoke the atmosphere of the previous World Conference, held in 1971 when Xerox’s wealth and hubris were at their very peak.</p>
<p class="para">目前尚不清楚是谁首先提议让 PARC 在世界大会上发挥重要作用。无论如何，当麦考洛听到利用博卡拉顿向销售人员介绍 PARC 发明的技术的想法时，他全心全意地接受了它。PARC 不仅有机会炫耀；麦考洛下令在博卡拉顿的四天中，有一整天的时间将专门用于 PARC。</p><p class="para">It is not clear which individual first proposed that PARC play a major role at the World Conference. In any case, once McColough heard the idea of using Boca Raton to introduce the technologies PARC had invented to the sales force, he embraced it whole heartedly. PARC would not only get a chance to show off; McColough decreed that one entire day of the four in Boca Raton would be devoted to PARC alone.</p>
<p class="para">那年夏天的一个早晨，SSL 主任伯特·萨瑟兰邀请约翰·埃伦比到他的办公室。埃伦比在计算机科学实验室工作了三年，在此期间，他赢得了“干得漂亮”的美誉——实现了原理图，制作了原型，完成了项目——在 PARC 工程和设计领域，在自我意识的冲突和无休止的宗教战争中，这绝非易事。</p><p class="para">One morning that summer, the SSL’s director, Bert Sutherland invited John Ellenby into his office. Ellenby had worked in the Computer Science Lab for three years, during which time he had gained a well-deserved reputation as a man who Got Things Done—schematics realized, prototypes built, projects completed—not at all an easy proposition amid the clash of egos and the religious wars raging unceasingly over engineering and design at PARC.</p>
<p class="para">“约翰，如果你有自由，你会做些什么来展示我们的工作？”萨瑟兰开始说道。“你知道，即将举行一场面向全球经理人的大型会议，我们受到了邀请。”</p><p class="para">“If you had a free hand, John, what would you do to show off our work?” Sutherland began. “You see, there’s this big conference coming up for managers from all over the world, and we’ve been invited.”</p>
<p class="para">艾伦比想了想，然后问道：“你说的自由行动到底是什么意思？”</p><p class="para">Ellenby thought for a moment, then asked, “Just what do you mean by a free hand?”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">约翰·埃伦比是一位身材瘦削、面色苍白的英国人，一缕棕色的头发垂在高高的额头上。他的教育和工作经历异常丰富，包括在伦敦大学学习经济地理学，在伦敦经济学院任教，在 IBM 学习系统工程课程后，他被任命为爱丁堡大学计算机科学讲师和英国先驱计算机制造商 Ferranti 有限公司的计算机架构和图形顾问。他第一次接触 PARC 是在<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch18.html.page261"></a>这件事发生在 1971 年，当时丹·鲍勃罗 (Dan Bobrow) 正在爱丁堡参加奖学金项目。鲍勃罗向艾伦比介绍了 PARC，当他回到美国时，又向 PARC 介绍了艾伦比。不久之后，艾伦比恰好路过湾区；他被邀请去向一位经销商发表演讲，1974 年 9 月，杰瑞·埃尔金德 (Jerry Elkind) 聘用了他，毫无疑问，埃尔金德认为艾伦比能够如此轻松地在学术界和工业界之间穿梭，反映了他平衡科学和务实判断的能力。</p><p class="para">John Ellenby was a slender, pale Briton with a fringe of brown hair crowning his high forehead. His unusually varied education and work experience had included the study of economic geography at the University of London, a teaching post at the London School of Economics, and, following a course in systems engineering from IBM, a dual appointment as a lecturer in computer science at the University of Edinburgh and consultant in computer architecture and graphics to Ferranti Ltd., the pioneering British computer maker. His first encounter with PARC had <a></a>occurred back in 1971 thanks to Dan Bobrow, who was passing through Edinburgh on a fellowship. Bobrow described PARC to Ellenby and, when he returned stateside, described Ellenby to PARC. Not long after that Ellenby happened to be passing through the Bay Area; an invitation was issued for him to address a Dealer, and in September 1974 he was hired by Jerry Elkind, who no doubt saw in Ellenby’s ability to shuttle so easily between academia and industry a reflection of his own skill in balancing good science and solid pragmatic judgment.</p>
<p class="para">埃伦比的雇佣条件相当于减薪。由于他从两份全职工作中获得了丰厚的薪水，他和雕塑家妻子吉莉安以及两个年幼的儿子住在爱丁堡一栋古老的大石屋里，过着相对奢侈的生活。“但那并不重要，”他后来说。“我有机会在 PARC 工作，那里绝对是世界上一流的计算机科学实验室。所以我加入了，我们都搬了过来。”</p><p class="para">The terms of Ellenby’s employment amounted to a pay cut. Owing to the good salaries he pulled down from two full-time jobs, he lived in relative luxury in a large old stone house in Edinburgh with his sculptress wife, Gillian, and two young sons. “But that was immaterial,” he said later. “The chance was to work at PARC, which was absolutely the top-notch computer sciences lab in the world. So I joined, and we all moved.”</p>
<p class="para">他有足够的见识，一眼就能看出 PARC 的优点和缺点。前者包括开发 Alto 和以太网的工作，他觉得它们是优雅设计和精湛工程技术的奇迹。后者包括泰勒的教条主义，艾伦比认为这种教条主义阻碍了计算机科学实验室中深思熟虑的异议。他沮丧地发现，真正有远见的项目，如舒普的 Superpaint 和 Bobrow 在人工智能方面的工作，都对 CSL 的正统观念提出了挑战，并勉强维持着。</p><p class="para">He had worldliness enough to discern at a single glance the dividing line separating PARC’s virtues from its flaws. The former included the work that had produced the Alto and the Ethernet, which impressed him as marvels of elegant design and superb feats of engineering. The latter included Taylor’s dogmatism, which Ellenby believed discouraged thoughtful dissent in the Computer Science Lab. He was dismayed to find genuinely farsighted projects such as Shoup’s Superpaint and Bobrow’s work in artificial intelligence, both of which challenged CSL orthodoxy, hanging on by their fingernails.</p>
<p class="para">“当时，计算机架构是宗教战争的主要战场，”他回忆道，“而施乐公司则占据了主导地位。”他的第一项任务就是在两支敌对的军队之间进行调解。</p><p class="para">“Computer architecture in those days was a major battleground for religious wars,” he recalled, “and Xerox had them big-time.” His first assignment would have him interceding between two of its contending armies.</p>
<p class="para">任务是让 Alto 的制造过程尽快启动。机器已经设计完毕并制作了原型，但目前只有五台。制造计划似乎在帕洛阿尔托和埃尔塞贡多之间神秘地停滞了。</p><p class="para">The task was somehow to get the Alto manufacturing process jump-started. The machine had been designed and prototyped but as yet there were only five in existence. The construction program, it seemed, had mysteriously stalled somewhere between Palo Alto and El Segundo.</p>
<p class="para">事实上，埃伦比曾是一名英国工业顾问，他将功能失调的程序改造成可运行的程序。他用自己经验丰富的眼光审视 Alto，立刻意识到这些机器实际上是一场宗教战争的人质——这场战争发生在设计它们的计算机科学实验室和<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch18.html.page262"></a>SDS 的工厂员工工作条件艰苦，他们负责在五百英里外的埃尔塞贡多按照 PARC 的规格制造这些产品。</p><p class="para">As it happened, Ellenby had distinguished himself as an industrial consultant in Great Britain by transforming dysfunctional programs into operational ones. Turning his experienced eye to the Alto, he recognized instantly that the machines were indeed hostages of a religious war—this one between the Computer Science Lab, which designed them, and <a></a>SDS, whose downtrodden factory staff was tasked with building them to PARC specifications in El Segundo, five hundred miles away.</p>
<p class="para">“El Segundo 是一家非常自豪的产品组织，”Ellenby 回忆道。“他们制造了许多令人印象深刻的机器，当时有很多优秀的人。现在他们被一家复印机公司欺骗了，这家公司知道如何将煤粉放到鼓上，然后吹着口哨把它转移到纸上，但对电子产品一无所知。所以那里有一个宗教问题。然后，他们不得不在试图解决其他问题的同时与一群奇怪的北加州人打交道。与此同时，PARC 对 SDS 并不太尊重。而且 PARC 没有人真正被指派来实现这一切。Alto 就像一个在寻找母亲的婴儿。”</p><p class="para">“El Segundo was a product organization with a lot of pride,” Ellenby recalled. “It had a lot of good guys from the days when they had built a lot of quite impressive machines. And now they were getting fucked over by this copier company that knew how to put powdered coal onto drums that went whistling around and transferred it to paper but didn’t know shit about electronics. So there was a religious problem right there. Then there was this funny group of weird Northern Californians they had to deal with while they were trying to solve their other problems. Meanwhile there was not a lot of respect at PARC for SDS. And nobody was really assigned at PARC to make it all happen. The Alto was kind of a baby looking for its mother.”</p>
<p class="para">艾伦比介入，担任裁判。他的第一个成就是让埃尔塞贡多完成了 20 辆滞留在管道中的 Altos。然后他采取了激进的措施。他将一小批产品工程师组织成一个综合工程和制造部门，他称之为特别计划小组，安排将查克·萨克的时间机器重新设计成一个可以高效批量生产的物体。特别计划小组取代了所有萨克式的捷径，当目标是匆忙制造出一台带有备用零件的可维修机器时，这些捷径看起来是美德，但现在只是恼人故障的根源。</p><p class="para">Ellenby stepped in to referee. His first achievement was getting El Segundo to complete twenty Altos stuck in the pipeline. Then he took a radical step. Organizing a small cadre of product engineers into an integrated engineering and manufacturing unit he called the Special Programs Group, he arranged for Chuck Thacker’s time machine to be reengineered into an object that could be efficiently mass-produced. The Special Programs Group replaced all the Thackeresque shortcuts, which looked like virtues when the goal was hastily to turn out a serviceable machine with spare parts, but were now merely the sources of annoying glitches.</p>
<p class="para">“这不是查克的错，只是机器有点问题，”艾伦比说。“我的背景非常严格，因为我在 Ferranti 担任顾问设计师的机器 Argus 700 是为非常高可靠性的流程和通信控制而设计的。我认为不知何故，一台无缘无故停止运转的机器不是一台好机器。”</p><p class="para">“No fault of Chuck’s, but the machine was just flaky,” Ellenby said. “I had come from a pretty rigorous background because the machine for which I had been consulting designer at Ferranti, the Argus 700, was designed for very high-reliability process and communications control. I thought that somehow or other a machine that stops for no reason was not a good machine.”</p>
<p class="para">Ellenby 的团队增加了一个内存纠错系统，类似于 Thacker 为 MAXC 设计的系统（但 Alto 上没有）。这大大降低了机器的制造成本，因为 SPG 可以使用更容易出错但更便宜的内存芯片，而不会损害机器的可靠性。最初的 Alto 几乎无法维护（“为了得到一些东西，你必须去掉很多其他东西，”Ellenby 回忆道）；他下令重新设计内部结构，以便每个计算机<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch18.html.page263"></a>就像今天的台式电脑一样，只需打开盖子即可轻松访问组件。所谓的 Alto II 既耐用又易于在小型生产线上制造。“我们只是把它们拿出来，”艾伦比自豪地说。这台机器在整个 PARC 中广为流传，成为世界上一些最引人注目的技术创新的跳板。</p><p class="para">Ellenby’s group added a memory error-correction system similar to the one Thacker had designed for MAXC (but had left off the Alto). This substantially cut the manufacturing cost of the machine by allowing the SPG to use more error-prone, but cheaper, memory chips without compromising the machine’s reliability. The original Alto was almost unmaintainable (“In order to get to something you had to take a lot of other stuff out,” Ellenby recalled); he ordered the innards redesigned so every com<a></a>ponent would be easily accessible just by opening the cover, as in today’s desktop PCs. The so-called Alto II was both durable and easy to manufacture on a small production line. “We just popped ’em out,” Ellenby said proudly. This was the machine that proliferated throughout PARC as a springboard for some of the most striking technological innovations the world has ever seen.</p>
<p class="para">然而，1976 年初，新机器开始下线后不久，艾伦比就不得不面对施乐公司技术政治的现实。在 Alto II 大获成功的刺激下，艾伦比继续推进设计和生产 Alto III 的计划。这将是他的终极目标：一款可以大规模销售的可编程计算机，它将利用摩尔定律的滚雪球效应（例如更快更便宜的内存芯片），提供用户友好的文字处理、专业数据库程序等。目标是让特别程序组设计机器，由施乐公司的办公系统部门生产，该部门位于达拉斯，在前韦伯斯特实验室负责人罗伯特·波特的领导下生产电动打字机和其他非复印式办公机器。</p><p class="para">Soon after the new machines started rolling off the fabrication line in early 1976, however, Ellenby came face to face with the realities of technology politics at Xerox. Heady from the triumph of the Alto II, he forged ahead with a plan to design and manufacture an Alto III. This would be the Holy Grail: a mass-marketable, programmable computer that would exploit the snowballing manifestations of Moore’s Law (such as faster and cheaper memory chips) by offering user-friendly word processing, professional database programs, and more. The goal was for the Special Programs Group to design the machine for manufacture by Xerox’s Office Systems Division, a Dallas-based unit that turned out electric typewriters and other non-copier office machines under the leadership of a former Webster lab chief named Robert Potter.</p>
<p class="para">同年 7 月，施乐公司的显示文字处理任务组批准了该计划。在短短几周的辉煌时期，施乐公司的官方政策是利用 Alto III 来满足日益增长的电子文字处理市场的需求，这是一款可编程的个人计算机，它与竞争对手的打字机的关系就像哈雷摩托车与三轮车的关系一样。艾伦比的团队的目标是设计一款廉价的计算机兼文字处理器和打印系统，并在 1978 年中期交付给客户。如果施乐公司能做到这一点，那么它就能比 IBM PC 早三年上市，而且它拥有一台复杂得多的机器。</p><p class="para">That July, Xerox’s Display Word Processing Task Force endorsed the plan. For a few short, glorious weeks, official Xerox policy was to service the growing market for electronic word processing with the Alto III, a programmable personal computer that would bear the same relationship to the competition’s glorified typewriters as a Harley does to a tricycle. Ellenby’s group was on target to engineer an inexpensive computer-cum-word processor and printing system for shipment to customers by mid-1978. Had it done so, Xerox would have beaten the IBM PC to market by three years—with an infinitely more sophisticated machine.</p>
<p class="para">但那并没有发生。鲍勃·波特没有加入，也永远不会加入。波特在 1973 年访问过 PARC，当时他刚刚接管达拉斯分部。但他和 CSL 工程师的交流就像不同物种的生物一样。“我去了那里，坐在他们的豆袋椅上，但我就是无法从他们那里得到任何东西，”他后来抱怨道。“他们只对自己的事情感兴趣。他们认为自己比其他人高出四英尺。”</p><p class="para">But it was not to happen. Bob Potter was not on board and never would be. Potter had visited PARC in 1973, shortly after taking over the Dallas division. But he and the CSL engineers communicated like creatures of different species. “I went out there and I sat in their beanbags, but I just couldn’t get anything out of them,” he groused later. “They were only interested in their own thing. They thought they were four feet above everybody else.”</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch18.html.page264"></a>
<p class="para">PARC 的员工也对此表示了同样的不满，他们粗鲁地认为波特是一个无可救药的技术文盲，他之所以能获得如此高的地位，与其说是因为他具有管理才能，不如说是因为得到了施乐公司新任总裁阿奇·麦卡德尔 (Archie McCardell) 的青睐，而阿奇·麦卡德尔是一个几乎没有任何营销天赋的“会计师”。<span class="sup">*</span></p><p class="para">PARC’s people returned the sentiment, dismissing Potter rudely as a hopeless technical illiterate whose exalted position owed less to managerial aptitude than to having the ear of Archie McCardell, Xerox’s new president, a “bean-counter” with scarcely any instinct for marketing.<span class="sup">*</span></p>
<p class="para">1974 年，波特的团队推出了一款性能低下的文字处理器，在市场上遭遇惨败。但他没有接受办公室工作组的建议，即让施乐全力支持 Alto III，而是推出了自己的新机器，另一款不可编程的文字处理器，名为 Xerox 850——本质上是一台打字机，内存足以容纳几页商业信函，以供校对。</p><p class="para">Potter’s group had brought out a low-performance word processor in 1974 that failed in the marketplace. But instead of accepting the office task force’s recommendation that Xerox throw its weight behind the Alto III, he pushed his own new machine, another nonprogrammable word processor called the Xerox 850—essentially a typewriter with enough memory in it to hold a few pages of a business letter long enough to be proofread.</p>
<p class="para">在那个夏天的剩余时间里，波特和艾伦比的策划者们上演了一场数字之战，对 Alto 的制造成本做出了相互矛盾的分析来支持他们的论点——艾伦比试图证明 Alto 的量产成本可以低于 850 的 5,000 美元，而波特则认为它永远无法达到其声称的价格目标。</p><p class="para">For the rest of the summer Potter’s and Ellenby’s planners staged a battle of numbers, producing contradictory analyses of the Alto’s manufacturing costs to bolster their arguments—Ellenby trying to prove that the Alto could be mass-produced for less than the five-thousand-dollar manufacturing cost of the 850, and Potter that it could never meet its claimed price target.</p>
<p class="para">埃伦比甚至得到了施乐公司最受尊敬的制造工程师的支持，他们是罗切斯特产品成本估算部门的专家。“争论的焦点是螺丝和其他东西，都是些小问题，”他回忆道。“他们是这方面的专家。作为工程师，他们非常挑剔——从正确的角度来看。他们实际上仔细检查，问我螺丝的表面处理方式。我会使用铍板吗？然后他们会查一下，告诉我这要花多少钱。他们非常仔细地核实了我们的成本是否正确……但达拉斯仍然不相信。”</p><p class="para">Ellenby even enlisted the support of Xerox’s most respected manufacturing engineers, experts from the product cost estimation division in Rochester. “The dispute was over screws and things, all the minor stuff,” he recalled. “And they were the experts in that. As engineers they were most extraordinarily anal—in the right sense. They actually went through and asked me what would be the finish on the screws. Would I be using beryllium plate? Then they’d look it up and tell me how many cents that would cost. They did a very thorough job verifying that our costs were right…And Dallas still didn’t believe it.”</p>
<p class="para">但艾伦比逐渐意识到，这些数字只是这场政治斗争中的炮灰。导致双方分道扬镳的是施乐的组织结构，而不是成本估算或技术愿景。达拉斯团队知道，如果他们被迫<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch18.html.page265"></a>在其惯用的办公机器系列中增加一款全新的产品，那么实现今年短期销售和财务配额的任何希望都将破灭。</p><p class="para">But as Ellenby gradually realized, the numbers were merely cannon fodder in a battle that was political to the core. It was Xerox’s organizational structure, not cost estimates or technological visions, that was driving the two sides apart. The Dallas group knew that if they were forced <a></a>to add an entirely new product to their customary line of office machines, any hope of meeting their near-term sales and financial quotas for the year would be demolished.</p>
<p class="para">“他们不得不放弃 Alto III，因为这款产品无法达到预期，因此无法获得奖金，”艾伦比总结道。“事实上，成功制造打字机并推出世界上第一台个人电脑对他们来说绝对是一个无法承受的负担。他们不应该被要求这样做。因此，它就像大多数与数字有关的事情一样，基于谣言和错误数据而被否决。”</p><p class="para">“They had to sandbag the Alto III, because with it they wouldn’t make their numbers and therefore wouldn’t get their bonuses,” Ellenby concluded. “In fact, it would have been an absolutely impossible burden on them to be successful in making typewriters and also introduce the world’s first personal computer. And they should never have been asked to do it that way. So it was shot down like most things that have to do with numbers, based on rumor and wrong data.”</p>
<p class="para">凭借传统的力量，波特和他的政治盟友最终取得了胜利。8 月 18 日，文字处理工作组在麦卡德尔等人的压力下改变了主意，宣布 850 为施乐官方文字处理器。作为施乐产品，Alto III 已不复存在。</p><p class="para">With the power of tradition behind them, Potter and his political allies prevailed. On August 18 the word processing task force, reversing itself under pressure from McCardell and others, declared the 850 the official Xerox word processor. As a Xerox product, the Alto III was dead.</p>
<p class="para">这一消息在 PARC 引起了强烈反响。就连艾伦·凯也认为这一决定是“巨大的打击”，尽管他一直宣称 Alto 是一款“临时”机器（他曾建议帕克把它们想象成 Kleenex，使用时间短，一旦出现下一个大热门，就丢弃）。很明显，PARC 缺乏必要的能力来吸引和留住总部重要人物的注意力。研究人员们无助地看着鲍勃·波特和他在达拉斯的产品开发小组继续制造笨重而过时的机电打字机，就好像 PARC 从未存在过一样——并最终被市场击败。在运营的三年中，达拉斯分部从未有过一个盈利的季度。</p><p class="para">The news landed with a hard thud at PARC. Even Alan Kay, who had always proclaimed the Alto an “interim” machine (he once advised Pake to think of them like Kleenex, to be used briefly and discarded as soon as the next big thing came along), took the decision as a “huge blow.” It was clearer than ever that PARC lacked the necessary juice to seize and hold the attention of anyone who mattered at headquarters. The researchers watched helplessly as Bob Potter and his product development group in Dallas continued to manufacture clunky and obsolescent electromechanical typewriting machines as though PARC had never existed—and got thrashed by the market into the bargain. In its three years of operation, the Dallas division had never had a profitable quarter.</p>
<p class="para">接下来的一年，艾伦比埋头于另一个可行的项目，试图平息自己的失望情绪。这个项目涉及重新设计斯塔克韦瑟的打印机，使激光设备能够可靠地跟上施乐最快的复印机的速度，这个问题比任何人想象的都要难解决。多亏了一个名为 Orbit 的程序，艾伦比在 1977 年仲夏制造出了一台被称为“Dover”的机器。Orbit 是一个巧妙的捷径，由年轻的图形研究员 Bob Sproull 和熟练工程师 Severo Ornstein 共同开发，后者的杰出记录包括与 Wes Clark 合作开发 LINC，以及与 Jerry Elkind 合作开发 Bolt、Beranek &amp; Newman 最初的 ARPANET 提案。</p><p class="para">Ellenby spent the next year trying to quell his disappointment by burying himself in another can-do project. This involved reengineering Starkweather’s printer so the laser device could reliably keep pace with Xerox’s fastest copiers, a problem harder to solve than anyone had expected. Thanks to a program called Orbit, a cunning shortcut developed jointly by Bob Sproull, a young graphics researcher, and Severo Ornstein, a journeyman engineer whose distinguished record included working on the LINC with Wes Clark and on Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman’s original ARPANET proposal with Jerry Elkind, Ellenby produced a machine known as the “Dover” in mid-summer 1977.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch18.html.page266"></a>
<p class="para">几周后，当他还在等待下一个任务时，伯特·萨瑟兰 (Bert Sutherland) 把他拉进了办公室，告诉他在博卡拉顿计划举办一场前所未有的活动，该活动已被昵称为“未来日”。</p><p class="para">He was still waiting for his next assignment when, a few weeks later, Bert Sutherland dragged him into his office and told him about an unprecedented event scheduled for Boca Raton and already nicknamed “Futures Day.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">很快，人们就清楚，艾伦比在即将举行的施乐世界大会上将大展拳脚。未来日原定于 11 月 10 日星期四举行，也是世界大会的第四天，也是闭幕日，预计将成为 PARC 演示的压轴之作，届时将盛装出席，制作水平一流。正如艾伦比的一位同事回忆的那样，艾伦比对待这份工作的态度“就像是在入侵一个外国一样”。</p><p class="para">It soon became clear that Ellenby’s hand at the upcoming Xerox World Conference would be very free indeed. Futures Day, which was scheduled for the world conference’s fourth and closing day on Thursday, November 10, was expected to be the PARC demo to end all demos, in full dress and with top-level production values. As one of his colleagues recalled, Ellenby responded by approaching the job “as though he was invading a foreign country.”</p>
<p class="para">该项目的规模似乎只会激起他的野心。他聘请好莱坞制片人和编剧准备一场两小时的多媒体舞台秀，并征用了 PARC 一半的 Altos 飞机，以确保所有观众都能亲身体验；还租用了两架 DC-10 货机将所有设备运送到博卡拉顿。有一天，他向 CSL 研究员查克·格施克 (Chuck Geschke) 概述了该计划，查克·格施克是该公司的后勤官，签约时有些随意。格施克坐在会议上，有一种灾难即将来临的感觉。“我们基本上是要把 PARC 收拾好，装上飞机，飞越全国，”他回忆道。“我在想，‘哦，天哪，我们只剩两个月的时间了？’”格施克意识到，这个团队不仅要与日程表作斗争，还要与同事们不太一致的支持作斗争。他回忆道：“PARC 内部的意见范围很广，有的认为‘这是我们能做的最伟大的事情’，有的认为‘这简直是在浪费时间’，还有的认为‘你永远也做不成’。”</p><p class="para">The venture’s scale seemed only to stoke his ambitions. He hired Hollywood producers and scriptwriters to prepare a two-hour multimedia stage show, and commandeered half of PARC’s working Altos to ensure that the entire audience could have a hands-on experience; two DC-10 cargo planes were rented to transport all the equipment to Boca Raton. One day he outlined the program to Chuck Geschke, a CSL researcher who had signed on somewhat casually as logistics officer for the enterprise. Geschke sat through the meeting with a sense of impending catastrophe. “We were basically going to pick up PARC and put it all on an airplane and fly it across the country,” he recalled. “I was thinking, ‘Oh, my God, and we’ve got only two months left?’” Geschke was aware that the group would be fighting not only the calendar, but less than uniform support from their own colleagues. “The range of opinion at PARC,” he recalled, “went all the way from ‘This is the greatest thing we could possibly do,’ to ‘What an incredible waste of time’ and ‘You’ll never pull it off.’”</p>
<p class="para">幸运的是，格什克本人决定加入狂热者阵营。他认为，长期以来，PARC 的主流态度是，科学家或工程师留在研究领域比将想法付诸实践以交付产品更有意义。他得出结论，这种方式无法制造出人们愿意购买的东西。难道他们没有从鲍勃·波特 (Bob Potter) 等保守经理的蔑视中学到什么吗？</p><p class="para">Fortunately, Geschke himself decided to join the enthusiasts’ camp. For too long, he thought, the prevailing attitude at PARC had been that it was a higher calling for a scientist or engineer to stay in research rather than to follow an idea through to the delivery of product. He concluded that this was no way to build anything people would buy. Hadn’t they learned anything from the scorn of hidebound managers like Bob Potter?</p>
<p class="para">“有几次麦考洛来我们这里，感觉就像是国事访问一样，”他说，“你有十五分钟的时间来投球，但<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch18.html.page267"></a>“我们不会进行后续工作，也不会派代表去理解我们所说的话。我们只是没有沟通。”他想得越多，就越相信未来日将是 PARC 打破其发明与世界隔绝的墙壁的最好机会——或者说唯一的机会。</p><p class="para">“On the few occasions when we’d have McColough come by it was like getting a state visit,” he said. “You’d get your fifteen minutes to pitch but <a></a>there’d be no follow-through, no delegation to anyone who could actually understand what we were saying. We just weren’t communicating.” The more he thought about it, the more he was convinced that Futures Day would be PARC’s best chance—or only chance—to break down the walls hiding its inventions from the world.</p>
<p class="para">为了实现未来日，艾伦比挑选了 PARC 的顶尖工程师。除了聘请格什克担任后勤官外，他还聘请了蒂姆·莫特负责监督营销生产，聘请戴夫·博格斯负责监督设备安装，并派约翰·肖克前往斯坦福担任总部现场联络员。迪克·舒普和鲍勃·斯普劳尔以及来自埃尔塞贡多的产品和制造工程师组成了团队，埃尔塞贡多的足智多谋给艾伦比在 Alto II 和 Dover 项目期间留下了深刻印象。团队稳步发展，直到人数达到 65 人，所有人都在为迫在眉睫的最后期限而疯狂工作。</p><p class="para">To make Futures Day happen, Ellenby had his pick of PARC’s top engineers. In addition to Geschke as logistics officer, he recruited Tim Mott to supervise the marketing production and Dave Boggs to oversee the installation of equipment, and sent John Shoch to Stamford to work as on-site liaison with headquarters. Dick Shoup and Bob Sproull rounded out the platoon, along with product and manufacturing engineers from El Segundo whose resourceful scrounging had impressed Ellenby during the Alto II and Dover programs. The team grew steadily until it numbered sixty-five persons, all working frenetically against the looming deadline.</p>
<p class="para">到 10 月下旬，他们在好莱坞派拉蒙影业的摄影棚里完成了一场戏剧表演，并将其打磨得光鲜亮丽，甚至还配上了原创管弦乐，让人不禁想起了《<span class="italic">星球大战》</span>的配乐。莫特有时不得不努力让自由职业的舞台制作人熟悉未来，而未来不仅仅是门面和闪光灯，但这确实<span class="italic">奏效了</span>。“他们赖以生存的手段是为公司会议制作多媒体节目，诸如此类，”他回忆道。“对他们来说，不同寻常的是所涉及的技术水平以及要传达的愿景程度，对任何人来说都是如此。”</p><p class="para">By late October they had assembled a dramatic presentation on a Paramount Pictures sound stage in Hollywood and buffed it to a high gloss, right down to an original orchestral score shamelessly evoking the soundtrack of <span class="italic">Star Wars</span>. Mott occasionally had to struggle to familiarize his freelance stage producers with a future that was more than a facade and flashing lights, but that actually <span class="italic">worked</span>. “Their bread and butter had been multimedia shows for corporate meetings, things like that,” he remembered. “What was unusual for them, as it would have been for anyone, was the level of technology involved as well as the degree of vision that was to be communicated.”</p>
<p class="para">彼得·麦考洛将 PARC 视为自己的遗产，将世界大会视为自己的聚会，他对整个规划都抱有浓厚的个人兴趣。他坚持要求艾伦比定期提交进度报告，甚至在 10 月下旬参加了派拉蒙的彩排。从这些接触中，艾伦比给人留下了一位负担沉重的公司董事长的印象。麦考洛已经失去了七年前 PARC 落成典礼上那种自信明亮的眼神。取而代之的是，他表现出了船长在无情的风暴中驾驶一艘不稳定的船的深深疲惫。</p><p class="para">Peter McColough, who viewed PARC as his legacy and the World Conference as his party, took an intense personal interest in all the planning. He insisted that Ellenby deliver regular progress reports and in late October even attended a dress rehearsal at Paramount. From these encounters Ellenby took away an impression of a deeply burdened corporate chairman. McColough had lost the confident bright-eyed glow visible at the PARC dedication seven years earlier. In its stead he displayed the profound weariness of a captain steering a balky ship through a merciless storm.</p>
<p class="para">一天下午，我和主席在<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch18.html.page268"></a>在帕洛阿尔托斯坦福俱乐部，艾伦比借此机会向他讲述了 Alto III 产品化流产的整个过程。文字处理方面的争论在公司内部的特别工作组和中层管理层面上展开。董事长全神贯注地听着，显然是第一次听到这一切。然后，艾伦比开始热议他的话题，说得太过火了。他用一个有趣的轶事结束了这个故事——至少他<span class="italic">认为</span>这很有趣——说明了施乐公司自己的员工对公司昂贵而徒劳的产品规划的冷嘲热讽。</p><p class="para">One afternoon, treated to a private lunch with the chairman at the <a></a>Stanford Club in Palo Alto, Ellenby took the opportunity to regale him with the full story of the aborted productization of the Alto III. The war over word processing had been waged deep within the corporation at the level of task forces and middle management. The chairman listened raptly, evidently hearing it all for the first time. Then, warming to his subject, Ellenby went too far. He capped the story with an amusing anecdote—at least he <span class="italic">thought</span> it was amusing—illustrating the cynicism about Xerox’s costly and fruitless product planning that afflicted the company’s own staff.</p>
<p class="para">他说，在 Alto III 推广活动期间的一天，他与公司办公室的一位朋友进行了交谈。“约翰，”这位朋友说，“你真的认为你在那里有一个产品计划，不是吗？”</p><p class="para">One day during the Alto III campaign, he said, he had a conversation with a friend from the corporate office. “John,” the friend said, “you really think you’ve got a product program there, don’t you?”</p>
<p class="para">“好吧，”艾伦比说，“我认为确实如此。”</p><p class="para">“Well,” Ellenby said, “I think it certainly could be.”</p>
<p class="para">“你错了，”他反驳道，“等你知道施乐公司有产品计划时，我就会告诉你。你会开始看到有人出现在你的实验室外面，制造几个巨大的无底洞。然后卡车会日夜不停地开过来，装满百元大钞，把它们倒进那些坑里。约翰，你唯一的工作就是交通管制——<span class="italic">这就是</span>你知道施乐公司有产品计划的方式。”</p><p class="para">“You’re wrong,” came the rejoinder. “I’ll tell you when you’ll know you’ve got a product program at Xerox Corporation. You’ll start seeing people turn up and make a couple of big bottomless pits outside your lab. Then trucks will drive up night and day loaded with hundred-dollar bills, and just pour them into those pits. Your only job, John, will be traffic control—and <span class="italic">that’s</span> how you’ll know you’ve got a product program at Xerox.”</p>
<p class="para">麦考洛非但没有欣赏这个讽刺故事，反而突然显得很震惊。他转移话题，结束了这场会面，没有给艾伦比任何线索，让他知道出了什么问题。</p><p class="para">Instead of appreciating the wry yarn, McColough suddenly looked stricken. He changed the subject and brought the encounter to a close without giving Ellenby any clue to what had gone wrong.</p>
<p class="para">他很快就知道了。麦考洛最近一直在努力应对这一功能失调的流程所带来的可怕后果。在过去的五年里，1000 名施乐工程师和技术人员一直在致力于代号为“摩西”的项目，该项目旨在开发该公司的下一代大型复印机。摩西将成为施乐反击柯达和其他大型竞争对手的先锋。它速度快、创新性强，提供了许多开创性的功能，例如高速文档处理器，它可以通过在机器中循环复印多页纸张，这些纸张夹在两层透明塑料之间。</p><p class="para">He soon found out. McColough had recently been wrestling with the dire harvest of that same dysfunctional process. For the previous five years, 1,000 Xerox engineers and technicians had been working on a project code-named Moses, which aimed to develop the company’s next great copier. Moses would be the vanguard of the Xerox counterattack against Kodak and its other big rivals. Fast and innovative, it was to offer such pioneering features as a high-speed document handler that could copy multiple pages by cycling them through the machine, wedged between two layers of clear plastic.</p>
<p class="para">但到了 1977 年，在花费了 9000 万美元（比波音公司设计 747 所花的钱还多）之后，施乐公司仍未生产出能够在市场上具有竞争力的机器。更糟糕的是，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch18.html.page269"></a>柯达刚刚推出了一款优质产品，其文件处理速度非常快，以至于摩西版本还在设计阶段就已经过时了。在与艾伦比共进午餐几天后，也就是世界会议前夕，麦考洛做出了职业生涯中最痛苦的决定之一：他直接杀死了摩西。</p><p class="para">But by 1977, after the expenditure of $90 million—more than Boeing Corporation had spent in designing the 747—Xerox had not yet produced a machine that could credibly compete in the marketplace. Worse, <a></a>Kodak had just introduced a superior product, with a document handler so fast that the Moses version still on the drawing board was already obsolete. Only a few days after his lunch with Ellenby, on the very eve of the World Conference, McColough made one of the most painful decisions of his career: He killed Moses outright.</p>
<p class="para">这项命令给整个公司带来了巨大的冲击——不仅因为严重的财务损失，还因为这意味着施乐至少在未来两年内只能在市场上推出陈旧的衍生产品。“摩西本应带领我们进入应许之地，”一位高管说。“但红海却向我们袭来。”</p><p class="para">The edict sent a shock wave through the entire company—not only because of the horrific financial toll, but also because it meant Xerox would have nothing but aging, derivative products in the market for at least the next two years. “Moses was supposed to lead us into the promised land,” said one executive. “Instead the Red Sea came crashing down on us.”</p>
<p class="para">回到 PARC 后，艾伦比意识到麦考洛在讲这个不合时宜的笑话时，已经做好了做出摩西决定的准备。“他做出了一个非常艰难的决定，”他后来回忆道。“我真是太愚蠢了。”</p><p class="para">Back at PARC, Ellenby recognized that McColough had been girding himself to make the Moses decision at the very moment he was telling his tactless joke. “He made a very tough call,” he recalled later. “And that was bloody stupid of me.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">摩西事件的惨败仍让人心有余悸，施乐世界大会于 11 月 7 日在博卡拉顿乡村俱乐部召开。正如麦考洛所希望的那样，会议的欢乐气氛至少暂时驱散了人们的忧郁情绪。公司不惜重金招待 500 名来宾。会议期间，他们进行了深海捕鱼和丰盛大餐。在一次正式午餐会上，主讲嘉宾是亨利·基辛格，他最近才从国务卿职位上退休。俱乐部场地上搭起了一个马戏团大小的帐篷，用于举办赌场之夜，每个人都会收到一份代金券，赢家可以兑换摩托车和其他精美奖品。</p><p class="para">With the Moses debacle still painfully fresh, the Xerox World Conference convened on November 7 at the Boca Raton Country Club. As McColough hoped, the gaiety of the affair helped at least temporarily to dispel the gloom. The company spared no expense to keep its 500 guests entertained. There was deep-sea fishing and lavish dining. At one formal luncheon the keynote speaker was Henry Kissinger, only lately retired as secretary of state. A circus-sized tent was erected on the club grounds for a casino night at which everyone received an allotment of scrip, which winners could redeem for a motor scooter and other fancy prizes.</p>
<p class="para">与此同时，艾伦比的团队拼命为最后一天做准备，而 PARC 将独自面对最后一天。艾伦比不愿容忍施乐政策或人员的阻挠，他随身携带着一封麦考洛亲笔签名的信，信中要求该组织在被顽固的官僚阻挠时提供他所需的一切。他从未使用过这封信，但这并不意味着他没有偶尔冒着危险。</p><p class="para">Meanwhile, Ellenby’s team worked like fiends to prepare for the final day, which PARC would have all to itself. Willing to brook no hindrance from Xerox policy or personnel, Ellenby kept in his possession a signed letter from McColough ordering the organization to provide anything he required in the event he found himself thwarted by a recalcitrant bureaucrat. He never had to use it, which is not to say he did not on occasion sail rather close to the wind.</p>
<p class="para">“当我们需要完成工作时，我们会违反施乐的规定，”艾伦比回忆道。“有些东西被花掉了，而这些钱可能根本不应该花掉。”说实话，这不仅仅适用于传统业务。“有些<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch18.html.page270"></a>那些人决定让我在浴缸里养一只鳄鱼。于是他们乘坐其中一艘气垫船前往飞行员说要给他们看几只鳄鱼的地方。两名身材魁梧的工程师跳下气垫船，把这只鳄鱼拖进气垫船，不顾飞行员的反对把它绑起来，带回来，塞进我的浴缸里。我把水上飞机的费用算作他们的“特殊交通工具”之类的费用。”</p><p class="para">“We broke Xerox rules when we needed to get things done,” Ellenby recalled. “Certain things were expensed that probably never should have been.” And not, to be truthful, only for conventional business. “Some of <a></a>the guys decided I needed to have an alligator in my bathtub. So they went off in one of these airboats to where the pilot said he’d show them some alligators. Two very hefty engineers jumped in and wrestled this alligator into the boat, tied it up much against the protests of the pilot, brought it back, and stuck it in my bathtub. I expensed the floatplane for them, as ‘special transportation’ or some such thing.”</p>
<p class="para">会议的最后一晚，大家的兴致达到了顶峰，艾伦比在 Blue Bayou（一家略低于四星级的博卡餐厅）为整个未来日团队（从工程师到卡车司机）举办了一场派对。活动非常热闹，甚至吸引了几位来自几个街区外较为低调的官方晚宴的高管——其中一位选择驾驶租来的林肯大陆从餐厅走最短的路线返回乡村俱乐部，一路上都留下了轮胎痕迹。</p><p class="para">The group’s exuberance reached its climax on the conference’s final night, when Ellenby threw a party for the entire Futures Day team, from engineers to truck drivers, at the Blue Bayou, a somewhat less than four-star Boca restaurant. The event was so festive it even attracted a few senior executives from the more demure official dinner a few blocks away—one of whom chose to drive his rented Lincoln Continental from the restaurant back to the country club by the shortest possible route, leaving tire marks all the way across the golf course.</p>
<p class="para">尽管施乐的客人度过了欢乐的一周，但他们在 11 月 10 日到来时渴望听到好消息，这也是情有可原的。麦考洛周一上午的开幕致辞为公司业绩描绘了一幅黑暗的画面。“我们在市场、工程和策略方面都处于劣势，”他说道。“我们根本没有为此做好准备……我们现在面临着公司内部变革的迫切需要！”麦卡德尔和大卫·卡恩斯（David Kearns）——一位前 IBM 员工，即将接替麦卡德尔担任施乐总裁——在接下来的两天里，他们也发表了悲观的评估。</p><p class="para">Despite their week of conviviality, Xerox’s guests might have been forgiven if they greeted the dawn of November 10 thirsting for good news. McColough’s opening speech Monday morning had painted a dark picture of the company’s performance. “We are being out-marketed, out-engineered, outwitted in major segments of our market,” he lectured. “We simply have not been prepared for this…We are now faced with the urgent need for change within this company!” McCardell and David Kearns, an up-and-coming ex-IBMer who would shortly succeed McCardell as Xerox President, had followed over the next two days with downbeat assessments of their own.</p>
<p class="para">最后，在最后一天，彼得·麦考洛再次登上讲台，这一次他试图重拾他带领公司进入数字时代的乐观情绪。他所用的手段还是那句空洞的短语，从一开始就引起了很多混乱，但现在它变得更加紧迫。</p><p class="para">Finally, on the last day, Peter McColough again took to the podium, this time in an attempt to revive the optimism with which he had tried to lead his company into the digital age. His instrument was the same vacuous phrase which had caused so much confusion from the start, but now it carried much more urgency.</p>
<p class="para">他宣称：“‘信息架构’仍然是施乐的基本宗旨，只不过它不再仅仅是一个概念。”</p><p class="para">“‘The architecture of information,’” he proclaimed, “is still the basic purpose of Xerox, except that it’s no longer just a concept.”</p>
<p class="para">PARC 终于轮到我们了。</p><p class="para">PARC’s turn had finally come.</p>
<p class="para">当天上午的未来日演讲就像 Doug Engelbart 著名的旧金山演示一样，充满了兴奋的气氛。俱乐部宽敞的舞厅里响起不祥的音乐。“问题出在纸上，”一位<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch18.html.page271"></a>专业解说员，演员和 PARC 工程师则登上舞台，演示 Altos、以太网、甚至典型的彩色打印机，所有设备完美协作，确立了施乐在办公自动化领域的领先地位。</p><p class="para">The Futures Day presentation that morning was like Doug Engelbart’s famous San Francisco demo on steroids. The club’s vast ballroom boomed with portentous music. “The problem is paper,” intoned a <a></a>professional narrator, while actors and PARC engineers piled onstage to demonstrate Altos, the Ethernet, even a prototypical color printer, all working in perfect harmony to establish Xerox’s rightful place atop the world of office automation.</p>
<p class="para">观众们看到人们收发真实的电子邮件、合作开展联合项目、用日文写备忘录，并在 Alto 引人注目的黑白显示屏上绘制工程图 — — 全部都是现场直播。秘书们打出信件并通过网络发送到激光打印机，而工程师们则在视频屏幕上设计建筑物，软件开发人员则调试代码。如果有人怀疑 PARC 能否开发出一款有市场价值的产品，那么施乐 9700 的首次亮相打消了人们的疑虑 — — 这是一款基于斯塔克韦瑟机器的每秒两页的激光打印机，它将在未来几年成为该公司在发展中市场的利润丰厚的特许经营权的支柱。但即使是 9700 也被 Pimlico 所超越，这是斯普劳尔和罗恩·莱德为博卡演示而紧急制造的一款原型彩色激光打印机。</p><p class="para">The audience watched people send and receive real e-mail, collaborate on joint projects, write memos in Japanese characters, and conjure up engineering schematics on the Alto’s arresting black-on-white display—all live. Secretaries typed letters and shot them over the network to a laser printer, while engineers designed buildings on a video screen and software developers debugged code. If there had been any doubt that PARC could develop a marketable product, it was dispelled by the debut of the Xerox 9700—a two-page-per-second laser printer based on Starkweather’s machine that would anchor the company’s lucrative franchise in that developing market for years to come. But even the 9700 was trumped by the Pimlico, a prototype color laser printer built by Sproull and Ron Rider as a rush job for the Boca demo.</p>
<p class="para">更为刺激的是纯粹的惊喜元素。艾伦比决心不让 IBM（IBM 在博卡拉顿附近设有一个研究实验室）窥探此次演示，也不让施乐自己的高管发现，因此他采取了预防措施，雇佣了自己的安保人员（由戴德县警长女婿拥有的一家公司提供）。</p><p class="para">Adding to the thrill was the element of pure surprise. Determined to keep the demo shrouded not only from the prying eyes of IBM, which maintained a research lab nearby in Boca Raton, but from Xerox’s own executives, Ellenby had taken the precaution of hiring his own security force (provided by a company conveniently owned by the Dade County sheriff’s son-in-law).</p>
<p class="para">“因此，期货日的到来完全令人震惊，”艾伦比回忆道。“不仅产品的广度和全面性，而且它们都运行完美，这让高层管理人员感到非常惊讶。”</p><p class="para">“So Futures Day came as a complete shock,” Ellenby recalled. “Not only the breadth and comprehensiveness of the products but that they all worked flawlessly was quite astonishing to the senior management.”</p>
<p class="para">最后，惊叹不已的观众们成群结队地去吃外卖午餐，而一队叉车将设备从舞台上移到宽敞的演示室，在那里，他们将在当天的剩余时间里进行亲手演示。客人们不知道，演示的这一部分在开始之前就差点失败了，因为佛罗里达的湿度和俱乐部糟糕的空调使房间变得非常热，有烧坏计算机精密电路的危险。（Alto 在炎热的天气里总是表现不稳定，即使在帕洛阿尔托的家里也是如此。）艾伦比租用了东方航空公司用来保持飞机在地面凉爽的一辆冷藏车，从而避免了灾难<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch18.html.page272"></a>在迈阿密机场。由于该车未获准在公共道路上行驶，因此州警察护送该车到博卡拉顿，博格斯和斯普劳尔在那里设法将通风管穿过厨房，通入会议中心。</p><p class="para">Finally the wowed audience trooped off to a catered lunch while a platoon of forklift trucks moved the equipment off the stage and into a capacious demonstration room, where they would be accessible for hands-on demos for the rest of the day. Unbeknownst to the guests, this part of the demonstration almost failed before it started, for Florida’s humidity and the club’s meager air conditioning made the room so hot it threatened to blow the computers’ delicate circuits. (The Altos always behaved flakily in hot weather, even at home in Palo Alto.) Ellenby averted catastrophe by renting one of the refrigeration trucks Eastern Airlines employed to keep its planes cool on the ground <a></a>at the Miami airport. Since the vehicle was not licensed to drive on public thoroughfares, it was provided with a state police escort to Boca Raton, where Boggs and Sproull managed to run a ventilation pipe through the kitchen and into the meeting center.</p>
<p class="para">“所有电脑都运行正常，每个人都可以穿着西装四处走动——毕竟这是施乐公司，”艾伦比回忆道。（演出结束后，博格斯和斯普劳尔试图看看他们是否可以使用卡车在舞厅里造雪。他们把雪开到最大，直到其中一个压缩机爆裂，实验就此结束。“这是我们不得不通过系统支付的另一项费用，”艾伦比回忆道。“而且相当昂贵。”）</p><p class="para">“All the computers were happy and everyone could walk around in their suits—this was Xerox, after all,” Ellenby recalled. (After the show was over Boggs and Sproull tried to see if they could use the truck to produce snow in the ballroom. They turned it up until one of the compressors blew out, ending their experiment. “That was another expense we had to slide through the system as something else,” Ellenby recalled. “Fairly expensive, too.”)</p>
<p class="para">灾难避免了，高管和他们的妻子被鼓励花尽可能多的时间来熟悉 Altos。他们可以在位图屏幕上打字和绘图，使用一种名为“鼠标”的非凡指针设备，将他们的手稿发送到联网的打印机，并将其存储在被称为“文件服务器”的电子文件柜中。他们可以在计算机上准备文件，并通过传真将其发送到世界任何地方——无需生成一张打印纸。</p><p class="para">Disaster averted, the executives and their wives were encouraged to spend as much time as they wished familiarizing themselves with the Altos. They could type and draw on the bitmapped screens, meet a remarkable pointing device called a “mouse,” send their handiwork off to the networked printers, and store it in electronic file cabinets known as “file servers.” They could prepare documents on computer and send them by fax anywhere in the world—without generating a single sheet of printed paper.</p>
<p class="para">拥有 30 台 Altos 的演示室一直开放到深夜。“很多人都过来了，他们都说这台机器太棒了，”艾伦比回忆道。现场的大多数 PARC 科学家都抓住机会，第一次见证了非工程师对他们的神奇技术的反应。结果好坏参半。一方面，很明显他们“对这些东西的效果印象深刻，因为他们听说 PARC 是个有点不靠谱的地方，”艾伦比回忆道。“他们觉得 PARC 是一种奢侈品，所以看到一些真正的价值，甚至一些他们可能想要的东西，他们感到很欣慰。”但显然，他们也对这些神秘的过度教育的玩意儿可能对他们的职业生涯产生的影响感到困惑和不信任。</p><p class="para">The demo room with its thirty Altos stayed open until late in the evening. “Lots of people came by and they all said how fantastic it was,” Ellenby remembered. Most of the PARC scientists on the scene seized the opportunity to witness for the first time how nonengineers would react to their fabulous technology. The results were mixed. On the one hand, it was clear they were “very impressed that the stuff all worked, because they’d heard PARC was sort of a flaky place,” Ellenby recalled. “There was sort of a feeling around that PARC was a luxury, so it was a relief for them to see some real value and even some things they might want.” Yet clearly they were also perplexed and mistrustful about the effect these mysteriously overeducated contraptions might have on their careers.</p>
<p class="para">施乐公司的高管大多是复印机的销售人员。这些租赁的庞然大物的收入来源就像复印机计数机的“咔嗒”声一样有形，客户为此向施乐公司支付每页几美分（施乐公司从中向销售人员支付佣金）。艾伦比注意到他们眯起了眼睛，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch18.html.page273"></a>几乎可以听到他们在想：“如果没有纸质文件可以复印，那‘点击’又从何而来？”换句话说：“我如何获得报酬？”</p><p class="para">Xerox’s top executives were for the most part salesmen of copy machines. From these leased behemoths the revenue stream was as tangible as the “click” of the meters counting off copies, for which the customer paid Xerox so many cents per page (and from which Xerox paid its salespersons their commissions). Noticing their eyes narrow, Ellenby <a></a>could almost hear them thinking: “If there is no paper to be copied, where’s the ‘click’?” In other words: “How will I get paid?”</p>
<p class="para">对于 Geschke 来说，最令人不安的是高管和他们妻子的反应之间的巨大反差。“施乐高管的典型姿势和举止是这样的，他们都是男性”——双臂交叉在胸前，表情严肃。“但他们的妻子会立即走到机器前说，‘我能试试那个鼠标吗？’这是因为他们中的许多人都曾是秘书——使用过这种设备。这些人，也许他们一生中只按过一次复印机上的按钮，但他们让别人帮他们打字和归档。所以我们试图向那些对这种设备的实际工作一无所知的人推销。</p><p class="para">For Geschke, the most discomfiting revelation was the contrast between the executives’ reactions and those of their wives. “The typical posture and demeanor of the Xerox executives, and all of them were men, was this”—arms folded sternly across the chest. “But their wives would immediately walk up to the machines and say, ‘Could I try that mouse thing?’ That’s because many of them had been secretaries—users of the equipment. These guys, maybe they punched a button on a copier one time in their lives, but they had someone else do their typing and their filing. So we were trying to sell to people who really had no concept of the work this equipment was actually accomplishing.</p>
<p class="para">“当时我并没有意识到这一点，但那是一个极其响亮、极其清晰的信号，告诉我们，让施乐公司了解我们拥有的东西将是多么困难。”</p><p class="para">“It didn’t register in my mind at that event, but that was the loudest and clearest signal we ever got of how much of a problem we were going to have getting Xerox to understand what we had.”</p>
<p class="para">至少还有另一个预兆预示着即将到来的失望。当晚快结束时，麦科洛、卡恩斯和几名高管出现在演示室。他们的出现是事先安排好的。“他们来这里是为了有机会说，‘好吧，现在我们要做点什么了，伙计们，’”艾伦比回忆道。“但他们没有抓住这个机会。他们只是说，‘谢谢。’”</p><p class="para">There was at least one other harbinger of the coming letdown. Toward the end of the evening McColough, Kearns, and a few of the executive staff materialized in the demo room. Their appearance had been prearranged. “They were there to have an opportunity to say, ‘Well, now we’re going to do something, guys,’” Ellenby recalled. “But they didn’t take that opportunity. They just said, ‘Thank you.’</p>
<p class="para">“我原本期望会比这多一点，”他说。“我们建立了一种非常不寻常的情谊。我的手下感到振奋和兴奋，就像一支运动队。但我们得到的却是，‘谢谢，孩子们，战争结束了，你们可以把马带回来了。’”</p><p class="para">“I was expecting a bit more than that,” he said. “We’d developed a camaraderie that was quite unusual. My people felt pumped up and hyped, like a sporting team. Instead what we got was, ‘Thanks, boys, the war is over, and you can take your horses back.’”</p>
<p class="para">因此，在完美演示的兴奋感尚未消退之前，疑虑便浮现出来。尽管麦考洛再次大声支持“信息架构”，但他和卡恩斯含糊其辞的告别让艾伦比和他的团队意识到，他们认为施乐公司会很快利用这项技术是天真的。</p><p class="para">Thus did the doubts surface almost before the euphoria of a flawless demonstration had a chance to run its course. Despite McColough’s ringing re-endorsement of “the architecture of information,” his and Kearns’s equivocal farewell told Ellenby and his team that they were naïve to think Xerox would exploit this technology anytime soon.</p>
<p class="para">艾伦比知道，在这个陷入困境、心神不宁的公司，时间就是敌人。</p><p class="para">And in this beleaguered and distracted corporation, Ellenby knew, time was the enemy.</p>

<p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">期货日之后，PARC 从总部收到的信号并非</span></span>全都像最初那样令人沮丧。事实上，这次活动确实带来了两个令人鼓舞的衍生信号。</p><p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">N</span></span>ot all the signals PARC received from headquarters after Futures Day were as deflating as the initial one. In fact, the event did have two promising offshoots.</p>
<p class="para">第一次是次年 1 月，彼得·麦科洛和他的 9 名高级下属（包括阿奇·麦卡德尔、大卫·卡恩斯和杰克·戈德曼）对 Coyote Hill Road 进行了一次不同寻常的访问。他们的目的是参加为期两天的软件艺术和科学速成班——这是鲍勃·泰勒的创意，他设法将其卖给了高管们，而他们仍然对 PARC 在博卡拉顿的出色表现心存感激，尽管他们有些不情愿。</p><p class="para">The first was an unusual visit to Coyote Hill Road the following January by Peter McColough and his nine top subordinates, including Archie McCardell, David Kearns, and Jack Goldman. Their purpose was to attend a two-day crash course in the art and science of software—the brainchild of Bob Taylor, who managed to get it sold to the executives while they still felt some gratitude, however begrudging, for PARC’s bravura performance in Boca Raton.</p>
<p class="para">泰勒认为，914 复印机的独特成功让施乐管理层坚信，好东西只能来自硬件。他决心向他们表明，这种想法已经过时了。正如 PARC 设想的未来办公室，只需更改软件，一台设备就可以用于多种用途。只要高层认为这个想法是外来的——在 1977 年，它对大多数人来说都是革命性的——他们就会对可编程 Altos 优于狭隘的机电文字处理器（如 850）视而不见。</p><p class="para">Taylor believed that the unique success of the 914 copier had inculcated Xerox management with the doctrine that good things derived only from hardware. He was determined to show them that this idea was obsolete. As PARC envisioned the office of the future, a single piece of equipment could be made to serve multiple uses simply by changes in its software. As long as the brass found this idea an alien one—and it was revolutionary to most people in 1977—they would remain blind to the superiority of programmable Altos over narrow-minded electromechanical word processors like the 850.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch19.html.page275"></a>
<p class="para">泰勒请艾伦·凯帮他设计一个动手操作的软件演示，打破了计算机科学实验室工程师两天的嗡嗡声。“你可以每天给他们一个半小时，”他说。“看看你能做些什么。”</p><p class="para">Taylor asked Alan Kay to help him break up what might otherwise be two days of lectures in the nasal drone of Computer Science Lab engineers by designing a hands-on software demo for the visiting brass. “You can have them for one and a half hours each day,” he said. “See what you can do.”</p>
<p class="para">凯将这项任务委托给他的教育专家阿黛尔·戈德堡。截止日期与艾伦比在“未来日”面临的时间差不多，为九周。但挑战可能更加艰巨：让十位古板的男性高管面对陌生的计算机编程严谨性，并使其充满乐趣。这些男性的这种经历的陌生感不可低估。即使是杰克·戈德曼，这位不知疲倦地努力将 PARC 技术引入施乐产品线的<span class="italic">家长</span>，也将是他有生以来第一次在计算机上认真工作。</p><p class="para">Kay delegated the task in turn to his educational expert, Adele Goldberg. The deadline was about the same as Ellenby had faced for Futures Day, nine weeks. But the challenge was possibly even more daunting: Bring ten stuffy male executives face to face with the unfamiliar rigors of computer programming, and make it fun. The strangeness of the experience for these men could not be underestimated. Even Jack Goldman, the <span class="italic">paterfamilias</span> who battled so tirelessly to get PARC’s technology into the Xerox product stream, would be doing serious work on a computer for the first time in his life.</p>
<p class="para">戈德堡认为，公司高层管理人员在思考很多事情时，注意力的持续时间与教室里焦躁不安的青少年差不多。为了吸引他们的注意力，她开发了一个名为“SimKit”的演示程序，并在其中加载了大量动画和音乐（下课时会自动播放一段曲调）。但这些花哨的背后是一个复杂的系统，能够模拟高管们在现实世界中熟悉的情景。它的基本格式是一个由工人和客户组成的通用工作场所场景。这可以改变为大型办公室的复印中心、机械化生产线、工资部门——任何高管学生可能觉得舒适和熟悉的场景。</p><p class="para">Goldberg figured the attention span of top corporate officers with much on their minds would be about the same as that of a classroom of fidgety adolescents. To hold their attention, she developed a demonstration program called “SimKit” and loaded it with plenty of animation and music (one tune sounded automatically when class time was over). But underlying the bells and whistles would be a sophisticated system able to simulate situations the executives would recognize from the real world. Its basic format was a generic workplace scene populated by workers and customers. This could be altered to suggest the copy center of a large office, or a mechanized production line, a payroll department—whatever setting the executive-pupil might find comfortable and familiar.</p>
<p class="para">“我们确实在教他们，虽然程序中有独立的部分可以用来构建一些东西，但也存在着不同种类的对象相互作用的环境，”戈德堡回忆道。“他们会有工作站，里面有他们可以选择的工作人员，专门负责某项功能。动画可以让他们真正看到顾客进来排队并获得服务。我们让他们能够画出自己的工作人员，并说出他们的样子：这个在皱眉，那个在微笑。我们把一切都安排好了，这样他们就永远不会碰键盘。他们只需要用鼠标指向和点击，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch19.html.page276"></a>因为我们知道这些人不会打字。在那个年代，打字可不是男子气概的表现。”</p><p class="para">“We really were teaching them that while there are independent pieces in a program you can build something out of, there’s also a context in which different kinds of objects are interacting,” Goldberg recalled. “They’d have stations with workers they could select and specialize to do one function or another. The animation would let them actually see the customers come in and queue up and get service. We gave them the ability to draw in their own workers and say what they looked like: This one’s frowning, that one’s smiling. And we had it all structured so they would never touch the keyboard. It was all mouse-pointing and mouse-clicking, <a></a>because we knew these guys wouldn’t type. In those days, that wasn’t macho.”</p>
<p class="para">随着活动的临近，出现了一些小问题，其中有一个是年轻的 LRG 团队中没有人能预料到的。在与来自三楼行政办公室的十名中年秘书进行的一次排练中，他们发现没有一个人能读懂 Alto 字体。“我们三十多岁的人习惯的小字体对五十多岁的人不起作用，”凯回忆道。戈德堡因势利导，重写了课程，让每个学生的首要任务是选择一种自定义字体和字体大小，用于为期两天的课程。这种改进具有双重优点，既能让高管们立即适应鼠标，又能让他们（希望）对 Smalltalk 界面前所未有的灵活性印象深刻。</p><p class="para">As the event approached a few glitches cropped up, including one that no one on the youthful LRG team could have anticipated. During a dry run staged with ten middle-aged secretaries from the third-floor administration offices, it developed that none of their subjects could read the Alto typefaces. “The small fonts our thirtysomething eyes were used to didn’t work for those in their fifties,” Kay recalled. Goldberg made a virtue out of necessity by rewriting the curriculum so each student’s first task would be to select a custom typeface and font size to use for the two-day session. This enhancement had the dual merits of instantly acclimating the executives to the mouse and impressing them (it was hoped) with the unprecedented flexibility of the Smalltalk interface.</p>
<p class="para">诺曼底登陆前一周出现了更加可怕的危机。</p><p class="para">A more harrowing crisis arose the week before D-Day.</p>
<p class="para">这是 Smalltalk 复杂的内存管理系统“Ooze”中的一个小故障，该系统由 Ted Kaehler 设计。Ooze 的工作原理是在 Alto 稀少的主内存和宽敞的硬盘之间快速传送数据和对象，其算法使磁盘看起来只是内存的延伸。如今，这种欺骗计算机使其认为内存比实际内存更多的策略是台式计算机的标准功能，称为“虚拟内存”；1978 年，在如此小的计算机上实现该系统是一项伟大的编程壮举。然而，Ooze 有其局限性。Goldberg 向系统加载了如此多的新材料，以至于 Ooze 的容量已达到极限。在研讨会前仅剩五天的时候，Kaehler 带来了坏消息。</p><p class="para">This was a glitch in “Ooze,” Smalltalk’s intricate memory management system, which had been designed by Ted Kaehler. Ooze worked by rapidly shuttling data and objects between the Alto’s scanty main memory and its spacious hard disk, based on an algorithm that made the disk seem merely an extension of the memory. Nowadays this stratagem of fooling the computer into thinking it has more memory than really exists is a standard feature of desktop computers known as “virtual memory”; in 1978 implementing the system on such a small computer was a great programming feat. Ooze had its limits, however. Goldberg had loaded the system with so much new material that Ooze’s capacity was strained to the breaking point. With five short days left before the seminar, Kaehler delivered the bad news.</p>
<p class="para">“阿黛尔，软泥怪的设计是错误的，”他说。“我们没有为所有这些子类做计划。”</p><p class="para">“Adele, the Ooze design is wrong,” he said. “We didn’t plan for all these subclasses.”</p>
<p class="para">“是啊？”她警惕地回答。“那是什么意思？”</p><p class="para">“Yeah?” she replied warily. “What does that mean?”</p>
<p class="para">“目前还不清楚它能否在研讨会期间坚持下去。如果它崩溃了，我们就有麻烦了。”</p><p class="para">“It’s not clear it’ll hold up during the seminar. And if it crashes, we’re in trouble.”</p>
<p class="para">“那么，还有什么其他选择呢？我应该简化课程吗？”</p><p class="para">“Well, what’s the alternative? Should I simplify the curriculum?”</p>
<p class="para">凯勒的想法并不谦虚。“对我来说，很明显，”他后来说道，“我应该修复 Ooze 中的问题。”</p><p class="para">Kaehler had nothing so modest in mind. “It seemed obvious to me,” he said later, “that I should just fix the problem in Ooze.”</p>
<p class="para">戈德堡一想到这个就感到不安。这可不是什么普通的虫子，她<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch19.html.page277"></a>想了想，但设计上做了重大改变。“泰德，”她说，“我觉得这不是<span class="italic">一个</span>好主意。”</p><p class="para">Goldberg grew fidgety at the very notion. This was no mere bug, she <a></a>figured, but a major design change. “Ted,” she said, “something tells me this is <span class="italic">not</span> a good idea.”</p>
<p class="para">他挥了挥手。修复方法涉及重写程序中大约七处代码，使其容量翻倍。他后来回忆说，理论上这很容易——假设他能确定找到每个需要修复的地方。无论如何，他认为团队会有五天的时间进行测试。他对戈德伯格说：“别担心。”</p><p class="para">He waved his hand. The fix involved rewriting code in about seven places in the program to double its capacity. Easy enough in principle, he recalled later—assuming he could be sure of finding every place that needed fixing. In any event, he figured the team would have five days for testing. To Goldberg he said, “Don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p class="para">说起来容易做起来难。戈德伯格和其他团队成员对凯勒的调整感到紧张，因为他要在如此关键的试镜前对系统的一个重要组件进行调整。凯勒回忆道：“阿黛尔、艾伦、丹·英格尔斯和拉里·特斯勒分别和我坐下来，听我讨论解决办法，并向我强调这一定有效。这让人感到相当害怕。”戈德伯格告诉他，如果第一次就成功了，她就会使用它。否则，他们将恢复原始的 Ooze，而凯勒将缩减她的教学计划。</p><p class="para">Easier said than done. Nervous about his tinkering with such an important component of the system so close to its make-or-break audition, Goldberg and the other team members put Kaehler on a short leash. “Adele, Alan, Dan Ingalls, and Larry Tesler each sat down with me separately to hear what the fix was and impress on me that it had to work,” he recalled. “That was fairly intimidating.” Goldberg told him that if it worked the first time, she would use it. Otherwise; they would restore the original Ooze and she would pare down her lesson plan.</p>
<p class="para">凯勒在一个晚上就完成了改造，并向同事们演示了修复方法。令戈德堡感到欣慰和惊讶的是，修复工作完美无缺。“这就像你正在建造泰姬陵，”她后来说道，“就在你准备给它盖上最后一层盖子时，你发现地基砖不对，需要更换。只需将其全部顶起，更换，然后再放回去。这就是他所做的。非常了不起的事情，能做到这一点的人也非常了不起。”</p><p class="para">Kaehler finished his reworking in one evening and demonstrated the fix to his colleagues. To Goldberg’s relief and amazement, it worked perfectly. “It was like you’re building the Taj Mahal,” she said later, “and just as you’re about to put the final cap on it you decide that the foundation brick isn’t right and you need to replace it. Just jack it all up, replace it, and put it back down again. That’s what he did. Pretty remarkable stuff, and also a remarkable guy who could do that.”</p>
<p class="para">凯回忆说，高管亲自动手的训练“取得了巨大的成功”。为了确保成功，公司为每位高管都配备了一名 LRG 导师，在戈德堡的模拟练习中坐在他身边。十分之九的人在铃声响起之前就完成了他们的程序。其中一位负责施乐大型制造部门的人甚至通过将他脑海中的实际数字输入到他的计算机模型中，发现了自己实际生产线上的一个缺陷。</p><p class="para">The executive hands-on, as Kay recalled, proved “a howling success.” To ensure victory, each corporate officer was assigned an LRG tutor to sit by his side during Goldberg’s simulation exercise. Nine out of ten finished their programs before the bell rang. One, who was in charge of a large Xerox manufacturing arm, even uncovered a flaw in his own real-life production line by plugging actual figures he carried around in his head into his computerized model.</p>
<p class="para">但高管们是否从中获得了具有持久价值的印象则是另一个问题。担任导师的戴安娜·梅里怀疑他们是否很好地理解了他们所看到的东西——即 Alto 屏幕上播放的简单直观的动画背后隐藏着的非凡工程成就。</p><p class="para">But whether the executives took away impressions of lasting value is another question. Diana Merry, who served as a tutor, doubted they had a very good idea of what they were looking at—that is, the remarkable engineering achievement underlying the simple and intuitive animations playing over the Alto screen.</p>
<p class="para">有些人可能对 PARC 轻松随意的氛围印象更深刻。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch19.html.page278"></a>有一次，杰克·戈德曼闯进了一楼的一间办公室，差点被正在照看婴儿女儿的阿黛尔·戈德堡绊倒。1978 年，这种不拘礼节的行为在公司里是闻所未闻的，而且完全出乎意料。戈德曼尴尬地退开了，永远忘不了那一刻。戈德堡的反应更尖锐：“他罪有应得。门关着，他不应该不敲门就进来。”</p><p class="para">Some may have been struck more by PARC’s unstuffy ambiance. At <a></a>one point Jack Goldman barged into an office on the first floor and almost tripped over Adele Goldberg, nursing her infant daughter inside. In 1978 such informality was unheard-of in a corporate setting and entirely unexpected. Goldman backed away, embarrassed, never to forget the moment. Goldberg’s reaction was sharper: “It served him right. The door was closed and he shouldn’t have walked in without knocking.”</p>
<p class="para">至于施乐公司未来的董事长兼首席执行官戴维·卡恩斯 (David Kearns)，他最深刻的印象是 PARC 的凌乱和自我放纵的文化，这种文化在其与世隔绝、宁静的园区中根深蒂固。“这个地方，”他后来说道，“只是在按照自己的方式行事。”当危机需要卡恩斯的帮助和理解时，这种印象对 PARC 来说并不有利。</p><p class="para">As for David Kearns, Xerox’s future chairman and chief executive officer, his most vivid impression was of PARC’s unkempt and self-indulgent culture, perpetuated by its isolated and tranquil campus. “The place,” he said later, “just sort of drifted along on its own course.” This impression would not work to PARC’s advantage when Kearns’s help and understanding would be needed in a crisis.</p>

<p class="para">奇怪的是，期货日的第二个重要结果是创建了一项正式的 Alto 商业化计划。在杰里·艾尔金德 (Jerry Elkind) 的领导下，新合资公司被授权以严格的条款向精选客户提供 Altos，从而将 Altos 逐渐推向市场。</p><p class="para">The second important consequence of Futures Day was, oddly enough, the creation of a formal program to commercialize the Alto. Led by Jerry Elkind, who chose John Ellenby as one of his top lieutenants, the new venture was empowered to dribble Altos into the marketplace by offering them to select customers on stringent terms.</p>
<p class="para">杰克·戈德曼精心设计了先进系统部（ASD）的章程，与建造星舰的 SDD 部门的章程如出一辙。大卫·利德尔的团队正在组建一个火力最强的军火库，只有在一切准备就绪后才能在市场上部署——这与艾伦比向彼得·麦考洛描述过的无底洞非常相似——而 ASD 可以像鱼雷艇一样穿梭自如，使用任何方便的弹药来吸引一些关键买家。艾伦比喜欢将这种安排与诺曼底登陆进行比较，利德尔就像艾森豪威尔将军一样，容忍一两次试探性的海滩侦察行动。利德尔含蓄地承认了这个比喻：“我们非常谨慎地采取战略，”他说。“ASD 是战术性的。”</p><p class="para">As crafted by Jack Goldman, the charter of the Advanced Systems Division, or ASD, would be the mirror image of that of the SDD unit building the Star. Where David Liddle’s team was assembling an arsenal of maximum firepower to deploy in the market only after everything was in place—quite similar to the bottomless money pit Ellenby had so tactlessly described to Peter McColough—ASD could weave and dart like a PT boat, using whatever ammunition it found handy to keep a few key buyers intrigued. Ellenby liked to compare the arrangement to the Normandy invasion, with Liddle as a General Eisenhower tolerating an experimental foray or two to reconnoiter the beaches. Liddle implicitly acknowledged the metaphor: “We were very deliberately strategic,” he said. “ASD was tactical.”</p>
<p class="para">这个新部门解决了 PARC 最紧迫的两个问题。首先，它让 Futures Day 的老员工有机会证明 Alto 的商业可行性，这让他们很满意。也许更重要的是，它让 Jerry Elkind 有了发展的空间。</p><p class="para">The new division solved two of PARC’s most pressing problems. First, it indulged the veterans of Futures Day by giving them a chance to prove the Alto’s commercial viability. Perhaps more important, it gave Jerry Elkind a place to go.</p>
<p class="para">埃尔金德刚刚从临时任务岗位返回帕洛阿尔托研究中心<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch19.html.page279"></a>泰勒回到公司工程部门。这不是一次愉快的回家。他的离开不仅使他远离了计算机科学实验室的日常工作，也凸显了他与泰勒管理风格之间的差距。</p><p class="para">Elkind had only recently returned to PARC from a temporary assign<a></a>ment to the corporate engineering staff. It was not a joyful homecoming. His absence had not only distanced him further from the daily routine of the computer science lab, but also underscored the gulf between his management style and Taylor’s.</p>
<p class="para">长期以来，很明显他无法与泰勒争夺实验室大多数人员的喜爱。一个问题是，他表现得像他们在技术能力上一样，这是泰勒永远不会想到的，即使这是真的，也一定会惹恼那些自负的员工。此外，他不断提醒计算机科学实验室，尽管它独立而傲慢，但它属于一个更大的组织 PARC，而 PARC 又受制于一个更大的实体施乐。相比之下，泰勒表现得好像 CSL 是太阳，PARC、施乐，甚至所有已知的计算机科学都围绕着它旋转。</p><p class="para">For a long time it had been evident he could not hope to compete with Taylor for the affection of most of the lab personnel. One problem was that he comported himself as their equal in technical ability, something which Taylor would never presume and which was bound to annoy the egotistical staff even if it were true. Moreover, he continually reminded the Computer Science Lab that for all its independence and arrogance, it belonged to a larger organization, PARC, which was in turn beholden to yet a greater entity, Xerox. Taylor, by comparison, behaved as though CSL was the sun around which PARC, Xerox, and indeed all known computer science revolved.</p>
<p class="para">“在资源问题上，我采取的立场比鲍勃温和得多，我希望我的立场不会那么敌对，”艾尔金德后来表示。“在争夺资源的时候，我总是不得不向鲍勃证明，公平分配是存在的。<span class="italic">”</span></p><p class="para">“I took a much less aggressive stance with respect to the resource issues, and I would hope a less antagonizing stance, than Bob did,” Elkind said later. “In times when you’re competing for resources I always had to make the argument with Bob that there <span class="italic">was</span> such a thing as a fair share.”</p>
<p class="para">也许最大的摩擦点是艾尔金德经常直言不讳、居高临下的性格。有人可能会说，在这方面他与巴特勒·兰普森或泰勒本人几乎没有什么不同。但只要艾尔金德缺乏前者的智慧魅力和后者富有同情心的家长作风，PARC 的许多人就不会认为他有权威，只是爱管闲事。</p><p class="para">Perhaps the greatest friction point was Elkind’s frequently blunt and condescending temperament. One could argue that in this he scarcely differed from Butler Lampson or, indeed, Taylor himself. But as long as Elkind lacked the former’s intellectual charisma and the latter’s sympathetic paternalism, many at PARC would not consider him authoritative, just officious.</p>
<p class="para">“杰里的管理风格有些简略，我永远无法欣赏，”埃德·麦克雷特说，他和所有走过 CSL 走廊的人一样温和而温顺。“他会走进我的办公室，说‘我认为你没有做任何重要的事情。’这是他表达‘解释一下这件事如何符合宏伟计划’的方式，但这会让你对自己感到失望。”</p><p class="para">“Jerry had a shorthand in his management style I never could appreciate,” said Ed McCreight, as mild and complaisant a person as anyone who ever walked CSL’s hallways. “He’d come into my office and say, in effect, ‘I don’t think you’re doing anything important.’ It was his way of saying, ‘Explain how this fits into the grander scheme,’ but it made you get down on yourself.”</p>
<p class="para">麦克雷特的一些同事，比如吉姆·米切尔，并没有感到被贬低，只是感到愤怒。“杰里总是说，‘让我来扮演魔鬼代言人吧’，”他说。“但他他妈的就只会这么做！每次你去找他，他总是告诉你你的想法有什么问题，所以<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch19.html.page280"></a>我们大多数人都不再去找他了。我曾告诉他，‘杰瑞，当你只做这些事情时，你会感到沮丧。有时你也需要‘欢呼’，而不是只做魔鬼代言人。’他技术精湛，但不如我们任何人聪明，我们知道这一点。他也应该这样做。”</p><p class="para">Some of McCreight’s colleagues like Jim Mitchell did not feel demeaned, just infuriated. “Jerry would always say, ‘Let me play devil’s advocate,’” he said. “But that was all he goddam did! Every time you went to him he was always telling you what was wrong with your ideas, so <a></a>most of us stopped going to him. I told him once, ‘Jerry, when that’s all you do it’s kind of a downer. You need to be going “rah, rah” sometimes, too, not just being a devil’s advocate.’ He was technical but he wasn’t as smart as any of us, and we knew it. He should have, too.”</p>
<p class="para">如果艾尔金德没有他的粉丝，他的举止就不会让实验室产生如此大的两极分化。CSL 的几名工作人员对艾尔金德的风格相当满意。这群人包括丹·鲍勃罗和沃伦·泰特尔曼，他们都是艾尔金德老东家 Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman 招募来的，还有彼得·多伊奇和鲍勃·梅特卡夫，后者在麻省理工学院认识艾尔金德，认为他是“一个好人、一个绅士和一个知识分子”。</p><p class="para">Elkind’s manner would not have polarized the lab as much if he had not had his fans, too. Several CSL staff members were quite comfortable with Elkind’s style. This group included Dan Bobrow and Warren Teitelman, both recruits from Elkind’s old firm, Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman, as well as Peter Deutsch and Bob Metcalfe, the last of whom had known Elkind at MIT and considered him “a fine man, a gentleman, and an intellectual.”</p>
<p class="para">但他们只是少数。杰瑞·艾尔金德严格意义上只是实验室负责人，但他却越来越被孤立。1977 年，当他因公司工作小组的长期任务而离开时，有人认为实验室没有他也能正常运转。麦克雷特记得，在泰勒毫无阻碍地管理 CSL 几个月后的一天，鲍勃·斯普劳尔走进了他的办公室。</p><p class="para">But they were a minority. Considered strictly as the laboratory’s chief, Jerry Elkind was an increasingly isolated figure. While he was away for an extended assignment to a corporate task force in 1977, the notion arose that the lab might function just as well without him. One day after Taylor had been running CSL unhampered for several months, McCreight remembered, Bob Sproull walked into his office.</p>
<p class="para">“埃德，你最近有没有注意到气氛有什么不同？”他问道。</p><p class="para">“Ed, have you noticed anything different in the atmosphere recently?” he asked.</p>
<p class="para">“你知道，”麦克雷特回答道，“我很喜欢让鲍勃来管理这个地方。”</p><p class="para">“You know,” McCreight replied, “I sort of enjoy having Bob run the place.”</p>
<p class="para">“你不是唯一一个有这种感觉的人。”</p><p class="para">“You’re not the only one who feels that way.”</p>
<p class="para">米切尔回忆道：“我们每个人都注意到了实验室里的感觉差异。我们都感觉效率更高了，而且我们非常喜欢这里的氛围。”</p><p class="para">As Mitchell recalled, “Every one of us noticed the difference in feeling in the lab. We all felt more productive, and we sure as hell liked the atmosphere a lot better.”</p>
<p class="para">随着艾尔金德任期的结束，几名 CSL 工程师拜访了帕克，请他为艾尔金德寻找新家。泰勒明智地保持低调。但帕克确信他知道幕后操纵者是谁。“杰里离开后，泰勒确实安顿下来了，”他回忆道。“他确实巩固了自己的地位。”</p><p class="para">With the end of Elkind’s assignment nearing, several CSL engineers visited Pake to ask him to find Elkind a new home. Taylor, wisely, laid low. But Pake was convinced he knew who was behind the move. “While Jerry was gone, Taylor really did settle in,” he recalled. “And he did definitely consolidate his position.”</p>
<p class="para">这种情况让佩克面临一个不愉快的前景。他开始依赖艾尔金德作为泰勒和其他实验室负责人之间的缓冲。果然，在艾尔金德不在的时候，物理学家和计算机科学家之间的紧张关系加剧了，而泰勒的<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch19.html.page281"></a>人们经常认为，只有计算机实验室（尤其是 CSL）才能在 PARC 做值得资助的工作。小规模的对抗情绪的激增几乎摧毁了 Pake 在 Coyote Hill 建立多学科乌托邦的梦想。</p><p class="para">The situation confronted Pake with an unappetizing prospect. He had come to rely on Elkind as a buffer between Taylor and the other lab chiefs. Sure enough, during Elkind’s absence the tensions between the physicists and computer scientists had increased, aggravated by Taylor’s <a></a>oft-expressed view that only the computer labs (and specifically CSL) did any work worth financing at PARC. The surge of petty antagonism had all but destroyed Pake’s dream of a multidisciplinary utopia on Coyote Hill.</p>
<p class="para">（CSL 工程师 Jim Morris 回忆起一天晚上在城里的一个聚会上被一名 GSL 物理学家堵住的经历。这位物理学家嘲讽道：“为一个没有博士学位的老板工作感觉怎么样？”“当时我觉得那句话很蠢，”Morris 说，“但它确实反映了 PARC 正在进行的跨学科较量。”）</p><p class="para">(The CSL engineer Jim Morris recalled being cornered at a party in town one night by a GSL physicist. “How does it feel to be working for a boss who doesn’t have a Ph.D.?” the physicist gibed. “At the time I thought that was an asinine remark to make,” Morris said, “but it did reflect the interdisciplinary pissing match that was going on at PARC.”)</p>
<p class="para">帕克本人已经到了几乎无法忍受看到泰勒的地步，更不用说和他交谈了。他不喜欢泰勒的个人主义管理技巧，对迪勒的野蛮行为更是感到震惊。总的来说，他不相信“优秀的研究人员应该能够以他们提出批评的同样精神接受批评”这一论点。大楼底层穿着白色套装的物理学家和光学科学家——他的手下——在科学标准上与泰勒一样毫不妥协，但<span class="italic">他们</span>并不像 CSL 那样感到必须放弃所有的礼貌。</p><p class="para">Pake himself had reached the point where he could barely stand the sight of Taylor, much less engage him in conversation. He disliked Taylor’s individualistic management technique and was even more appalled by the feral dynamics of Dealer. On the whole, he was unpersuaded by the argument that good researchers should be able to take criticism in the same spirit in which they dished it out. The white-suited physicists and optical scientists on the ground floor of the building—his people—were every bit as uncompromising in their scientific standards as Taylor’s, but <span class="italic">they</span> did not feel constrained to abandon all civility as CSL did.</p>
<p class="para">想到要直接与实验室主任之一泰勒打交道，他脸色苍白。然而，让新人接替艾尔金德担任 CSL 主任可能会被泰勒的圈子视为无法容忍的侮辱。帕克选择通过维持现状来拖延时间，他告诉实验室，他已经答应让艾尔金德重返旧职，并有责任信守诺言。</p><p class="para">The thought of dealing directly with Taylor as one of his laboratory directors made him blanch. Yet inserting someone new as Elkind’s replacement as CSL chief might be taken as an intolerable insult by Taylor’s coterie. Pake chose to buy time by sticking to the status quo, informing the lab that he had promised Elkind his old job back and owed it to the man to be true to his word.</p>
<p class="para">与此同时，反对艾尔金德的言论让丹·博布罗等效忠派深感不安。博布罗深思熟虑，虽然有点天真，但他乐观地认为，通过真诚地把好心人聚集在一起，他可以找到一个让所有人都满意的中间立场，于是他安排了一群 CSL 工程师正式访问艾尔金德的特遣队驻地，该驻地距离 PARC 山不远。</p><p class="para">Meanwhile the anti-Elkind talk left loyalists like Dan Bobrow deeply perturbed. Thoughtful, a bit naïve, but optimistic that by bringing well-meaning people together in good faith he could find a middle ground satisfying everyone, Bobrow arranged for a group of CSL engineers to pay a formal visit to Elkind’s task force quarters a short distance down the hill from PARC.</p>
<p class="para">“我当时试图让事情顺利进行，”他回忆道。“在我看来，杰瑞是一位出色的经理，他总是会提出很好的尖锐问题，并且非常支持我。我不明白为什么他不能继续担任他的角色，鲍勃也不能继​​续担任他的角色。我没有意识到这场争斗背后有多么激烈的权力斗争<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch19.html.page282"></a>场面或分歧有多深，有些人认为鲍勃是一个倾听者和他们愿景的推动者，而杰瑞有他自己的看法。”</p><p class="para">“I was trying to smooth things out,” he recalled. “To me, Jerry was a superb manager who always asked good hard questions and was very supportive. I didn’t see why he couldn’t continue in his role, and Bob in his. I didn’t realize how much of a power struggle there was behind the <a></a>scenes or how deep the division was, in the sense that some people thought Bob was a listener and a pusher of their vision and that Jerry had his own views.”</p>
<p class="para">他很快就知道了。大多数与会者并不认为这次会议是和解的尝试，而是驱逐的手段。</p><p class="para">He was about to find out. Most of the other participants viewed the meeting not as an effort at reconciliation, but as the vehicle for an ouster.</p>
<p class="para">会议在紧张的气氛中开始。艾尔金德面对的是实验室里最有权势的成员，包括兰普森、萨克、米切尔、麦克雷特、查克·格什克和塞韦罗·奥恩斯坦。麦克雷特回忆说，他们说：“找点别的事做怎么样？”</p><p class="para">The meeting opened in a strained atmosphere. Elkind was facing the most powerful members of his laboratory, including Lampson, Thacker, Mitchell, McCreight, Chuck Geschke, and Severo Ornstein. Their message, as McCreight recalled, was: “How about finding something else to do?”</p>
<p class="para">“我很确定他已经被告知我们来见他的原因，”米切尔回忆道。“我不认为这完全是意料之外的。他尽力保持冷静。他没有生气，也没有对我们大发雷霆。他试图用一些友善的态度开始，试图说，‘天哪，我很高兴见到你’，诸如此类。但是，你可以看到他内心深处在发抖，因为他被拒绝了。这对他来说非常困难。”</p><p class="para">“I’m pretty sure he’d been warned about why we were there to see him,” Mitchell recalled. “I don’t think this was completely out of the blue. He tried his best to be very calm. He didn’t get mad and rail at us or anything. He tried to start it off with some bonhomie, trying to say, ‘Gee, I’m glad to see you,’ and everything. But man, you could see him shaking in his boots just under the surface, because he was being rejected. It was very hard for him.”</p>
<p class="para">艾尔金德听了，但没有屈服。会议结束时，他说：“乔治·帕克决定该怎么做，他邀请我回到 CSL。”</p><p class="para">Elkind listened, but did not capitulate. As the meeting broke up, he said: “It’s up to George Pake to decide what should be done, and he invited me to come back to CSL.”</p>
<p class="para">泰勒在这次挑战艾尔金德权威的行动中扮演了什么角色很难确定。他一直坚称自己与派遣代表团无关，而艾尔金德拒绝发表意见。“我不知道泰勒是否鼓励这些人来，”他说。另一方面，兰普森、萨克、麦克雷特、格什克和奥恩斯坦都是泰勒的“老干部”，他依靠这些人提供技术和行政建议。在担任副主任七年之后——尤其是在艾尔金德缺席一年之后——泰勒可能会认为他应该成为CSL<span class="italic">法定</span>的、而非<span class="italic">事实上的</span>主任，这并非难以置信。</p><p class="para">Taylor’s role in this challenge to Elkind’s authority is hard to establish. He has always contended he had nothing to do with dispatching the delegation, and Elkind declines to hazard an opinion. “I don’t have any idea whether Taylor encouraged those people to come,” he said. On the other hand, Lampson, Thacker, McCreight, Geschke, and Ornstein were all among Taylor’s “Greybeards,” a sort of kitchen cabinet he relied on for technical and administrative advice. And it is far from implausible that after seven years as associate director—especially following Elkind’s yearlong absence—Taylor might think he deserved to be <span class="italic">de jure</span>, not <span class="italic">de facto</span>, director of CSL.</p>
<p class="para">鲍勃罗推测泰勒终于意识到了作为幕后掌权者的局限性。“当杰瑞离开一年后，”他说，“鲍勃才真正体会到拥有王位意味着什么。”</p><p class="para">Bobrow speculates that Taylor had finally recognized the limitations of being the power behind the throne. “When Jerry went off for a year,” he said, “Bob got a sense of what it meant to actually have a throne.”</p>
<p class="para">无论如何，艾尔金德确实回到了 CSL 担任董事，但那段时间并不顺利。“很明显，鲍勃赢得了这场战斗，”鲍勃罗回忆道。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch19.html.page283"></a>剩下的就是为艾尔金德找一些能挽回面子的退路。最后，当杰克·戈德曼利用期货日的成功，将 Alto 部署为小型计算机商业可接受性的“市场试金石”时，道路就清晰了。杰瑞·艾尔金德被任命为新成立的高级系统部门负责人，该部门被授权将 Alto 推向世界。</p><p class="para">In any case, Elkind did return to CSL as its director for a brief, uneasy period. “It was apparent that Bob had won the battle,” Bobrow recalled. <a></a>All that remained was to find Elkind some face-saving retreat. Finally, when Jack Goldman parlayed the success of Futures Day into a chance to deploy the Alto as a “market probe” of the commercial acceptability of small computers, the path was clear. With Jerry Elkind appointed as its chief, the new Advanced Systems Division was authorized to put the Alto out into the world.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">艾尔金德从否决艾伦·凯小型计算机提案的怀疑论者，转变为 Alto 的首席推广人，这其实可以追溯到他第一次看到 Bravo 在 Alto 屏幕上运行时，这远早于 1978 年 1 月 ASD 成立之前。“我心想，看到这些机器运转，看到 Bravo 的东西，那真是太棒了。”</p><p class="para">Elkind’s transformation from the skeptic who vetoed Alan Kay’s proposal for a small computer into proselytizer-in-chief of the Alto actually dated back to the first time he had seen Bravo running on an Alto screen, long before ASD’s creation in January 1978. “I thought to myself, seeing the machines work and seeing the Bravo stuff, that it was just smashing.”</p>
<p class="para">尽管泰勒团队对他的管理风格感到厌恶，但他还是成为了这台机器最坚定的拥护者之一。现在，他的热情被这台计算机的商业潜力所激发。和艾伦比一样，埃尔金德也是 1976 年 Alto III 与达拉斯制造的 850 文字处理器之战中受过伤的老将。“我们很多人都感到非常沮丧，”他说。“和所有人一样，我非常渴望把这些东西拿出来。”</p><p class="para">The Taylor group’s distaste for his management style notwithstanding, he had turned into one of the machine’s hardiest champions. Now his enthusiasm was fired even more by the computer’s commercial potential. Like Ellenby, Elkind was a bruised veteran of the 1976 battle between the Alto III and the Dallas-built 850 word processor. “A lot of us were feeling very frustrated,” he said. “Like everyone, I was very anxious to get this stuff out.”</p>
<p class="para">他吸引到新公司的是一群才华横溢的不满人士。其中有埃伦比和蒂姆·莫特，他们在《未来之日》之后感受到了总部的冷漠，也尝到了以超过 100 万美元的巨额预算完成一场热门演出所带来的权力的滋味。另一个新成员是查尔斯·西蒙尼，他因公开贬低《星报》的“大而无当”而成为 SDD 的不受欢迎人物。在 ASD，他发现了一种完全不同的文化，并以新的活力工作，将吉普赛界面融入了专为商业 Altos 量身定制的重写 Bravo 中，称为 BravoX。</p><p class="para">The group he attracted to his new venture was a remarkable collection of talented malcontents. There were Ellenby and Tim Mott, who had felt the sting of headquarters indifference after Futures Day as well as the taste of power that comes from pulling off a hit performance on a lavish $1-million-plus budget. Another recruit was Charles Simonyi, who had made himself an undesirable at SDD by openly denigrating the biggerism of the Star. At ASD he found an entirely different culture and worked with renewed vigor, incorporating the Gypsy interface in a rewritten Bravo specifically tailored for the commercial Altos and known as BravoX.</p>
<p class="para">艾尔金德认真对待 ASD 的委托，即通过选择性销售和租赁“预产品”来开发外部市场。他接管了艾伦比位于埃尔塞贡多的特别项目组，并接管了他们已经开始的几个项目，其中包括为瑞典国有电话公司生产文字处理器。瑞典人得到的却是 Altos。</p><p class="para">Elkind took seriously ASD’s mandate to develop outside markets by selective sales and leases of “pre-products.” Taking over Ellenby’s El Segundo—based Special Programs Group, he commandeered several projects they had already started, including one to produce word processors for Sweden’s government-owned telephone company. The Swedes got Altos instead.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch19.html.page284"></a>
<p class="para">卡特政府也是如此，它授予 ASD 一份合同，为其信息办公室创建文档和文件系统。运行 BravoX 的 Altos 于 1978 年安装，使原本无能的卡特政府成为历史上第一个使用个人电脑进行文字处理的政府。参议院和众议院也纷纷效仿。“事实证明，如果白宫要这样做，那么众议院和参议院也必须这样做，”艾尔金德回忆道。“这就是政治：只要他们都这样做，他们就能获得资金。如果白宫试图在没有众议院和参议院的情况下这样做，那么他们就拿不到钱。”</p><p class="para">So, too, did the Carter White House, which awarded ASD a contract to create a document and file system for its information office. Altos running BravoX were installed in 1978, giving the otherwise ineffectual Carter Administration the distinction of being the first in history to use personal computers for word processing. The Senate and House of Representatives followed suit. “It turned out that if the White House was going to do it, then the House of Representatives and the Senate had to do it,” Elkind remembered. “That was politics: As long as they all did it, they could all get the funding. If the White House tried to do it without the House and Senate, then they wouldn’t get the money.”</p>
<p class="para">其他客户包括洛杉矶的 Atlantic Richfield 公司和波音公司的西雅图总部。更多的机器被送到了 PARC 以外的施乐分部，这些分部的需求非常旺盛，以至于艾尔金德、帕克和罗切斯特的一位研究主管组成了一个三人委员会，将稀缺的机器分配给他们自己公司的员工。</p><p class="para">Other customers included the Atlantic Richfield Company in Los Angeles and the Seattle headquarters of Boeing Corporation. More machines went to Xerox divisions outside PARC, where demand was so fierce that Elkind, Pake, and a research executive from Rochester sat as a committee of three to allocate the scarce machines to employees of their own corporation.</p>
<p class="para">有那么一小段时间，艾尔金德的员工们沉浸在将 PARC 技术真正推向市场的兴奋之中。“在我们卖出大约 20 台机器后，我们在帕洛阿尔托吃了一顿丰盛的晚餐，”西蒙尼回忆道。“我发表了一个精彩的演讲，说今天我们有 10 台机器，明年会是 100 台，然后是 1 万台。每个人都因为狂妄自大而大笑。”</p><p class="para">For a short time Elkind’s people reveled in the thrill of actually getting PARC technology out to the marketplace. “After we sold, like, twenty machines, we had this wonderful dinner in Palo Alto,” Simonyi recalled. “I made this wonderful speech about how today it’s ten machines, and next year it will be one hundred, and then ten thousand. Everybody was laughing from sheer hubris.”</p>
<p class="para">不可避免的坠机就在眼前。随着 ASD 向全世界推出更多 Altos，约翰·埃伦比 (John Ellenby) 开始意识到自己正在碰壁。施乐管理层似乎并没有吸取这些产品具有市场价值的教训，而是将 ASD 视为《星报》的掩护。</p><p class="para">The inevitable crash landing awaited just over the horizon. As ASD placed more Altos out in the world, John Ellenby was receiving the all-too-familiar impression that he was hitting a brick wall. Rather than absorb the lesson that these were marketable products, Xerox management seemed largely to view ASD as a sort of stalking horse for the Star.</p>
<p class="para">“这是一次牺牲，”艾伦比说。“我们想让一些客户知道我们来了——但我们没有坚持到底，这让客户很生气。”他越来越把自己比作艾森豪威尔的牺牲先锋，就像 1944 年在迪耶普惨败的加拿大人：“如果能得到后续行动，市场调查是好的。但你不能只是把军队送到滩头阵地，却没有办法深入内陆或撤出。”</p><p class="para">“It was a sacrificial thing,” Ellenby said. “It was, ‘Let’s show some customers we’re coming’—but it pissed off the customers that we didn’t follow through with it.” He compared himself more and more to a member of Eisenhower’s expendable vanguard, like the decimated Canadians at Dieppe in 1944: “Market probes were good if they got follow-up. But you don’t just go and land troops on a beachhead without a means of getting further inland or pulling them out.”</p>
<p class="para">让他更加沮丧的是，越来越多的迹象表明 SDD 正在<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch19.html.page285"></a>当时，Star 的发布日期已经推迟到下一个十年，而且当时也不确定。艾伦比看到了施乐公司的独特机会，即提供一款市场认可度高、可在几个月内准备就绪的计算机产品。“基本上，我说如果你真的想快速推出一些产品，那么我们可以做到。我们知道人们愿意为这些东西付钱，因为调查已经表明了这一点。我们确实需要进行工程设计，使其质量上乘，我们需要实施制造。但我们知道如何做到这一切。”</p><p class="para">Adding to his frustration were the mounting signs that SDD was fal<a></a>tering. The Star’s launch date was now off into the next decade, and not a sure thing even then. Ellenby saw a unique opportunity for Xerox to offer a computer product with proven market acceptance that could be ready in a matter of months. “Basically, I said if you really want to get some products out there quickly, then we can do it. We know people are willing to pay for these things because that has come out in the probes. We do need to perform the engineering that makes them high-quality, and we need to put in place the manufacturing. But we know how to do all that.”</p>
<p class="para">1978 年末，他拟定了一份计划，利用现成的电子元件制造升级版 Alto，并与 BravoX 和 SSL 开发的办公系统软件套件 OfficeTalk 以及黑白激光打印机 Penguin 捆绑销售。最终，这份厚达一英寸的文件名为“能力投资提案”，旨在强调施乐公司应小规模实施 Alto 计划，但要认真贯彻执行。</p><p class="para">In late 1978 he consigned to paper a plan to manufacture an updated Alto out of electronic components available off the shelf, to be bundled with BravoX and a suite of SSL-developed office systems software known as OfficeTalk, as well as a black-and-white laser printer called the Penguin. The result was an inch-thick document whose title, “Capability Investment Proposal,” aimed to stress the point that Xerox should implement the Alto program on a small scale, but with serious follow-through.</p>
<p class="para">然而，起草提案只是这场斗争的一部分，而且只是很小的一部分。艾伦比有理由怀疑他的报告需要多长时间才能传到施乐的指挥链上。结果，这个问题被一位名叫谢尔比·H·卡特的传奇企业人物从他手中夺走了。</p><p class="para">Drafting the proposal was only part of the battle, however, and a small part at that. Quite justifiably, Ellenby had doubts about how long it would take his report to wend its way up the Xerox chain of command. As it happened, the issue got taken out of his hands by a legendary corporate figure named Shelby H. Carter.</p>
<p class="para">当时，施乐公司的全国销售经理谢尔比·卡特 (Shelby Carter) 是那种对施乐公司迟钝的决策感到愤怒的人。卡特是德克萨斯州前海军陆战队战斗机飞行员，他以龙卷风般的无情力量追击他的猎物，并把自己打造成了有史以来最伟大的销售员之一（几乎没有客户敢于反对他），他让人想起了施乐公司不屈不挠的销售目标和满腔热血的奔波。他和鲍勃·泰勒一样，都是本能地鼓舞人心的人，但他更喜欢在更大的人群中施展他的魔力。</p><p class="para">Then Xerox’s national sales manager, Shelby Carter was the type of person who could not but bridle at Xerox’s torpid decision-making. A Texan ex-Marine fighter pilot who pursued his quarry with the implacable force of a tornado and fashioned himself one of the greatest salesmen of all time (few customers dared disagree), Carter was a throwback to the old Xerox of relentless sales targets and blood-in-the-shoes pounding of pavement. Every bit as instinctive an inspirer of men as Bob Taylor, he preferred to work his magic among bigger crowds.</p>
<p class="para">“他过去常常主持所谓的喷气式飞机小组会议，”大卫·卡恩斯回忆道。“卡特会跳上公司的喷气式飞机，每天飞往两三个城市，鼓动员工们。在纽约市，他们可能会聚集在谢亚体育场。卡特会站在投手丘上发表他的演讲，在场的销售人员会听得入迷。然后他们会出去推销复印机，几乎是<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch19.html.page286"></a>疯狂的热情。”对于符合他严格标准的销售代表，卡特会赠送镶嵌在牌匾上的珍贵博伊刀纪念品。对于他们中的许多人来说，这不仅仅是一笔现金奖励。</p><p class="para">“He used to conduct what were known as Jet Squad Meetings,” recalled David Kearns. “Carter would hop into the corporate jet and fly to two or three cities a day and stir up the troops. In New York City they might gather at Shea Stadium. Carter would stand on the pitcher’s mound and deliver his spiel, and the salesmen in attendance would be spellbound. Then they would go out and sell copiers with an almost <a></a>crazed intensity.” On sales reps who met his exacting standards Carter would bestow the treasured memento of a Bowie knife mounted on a plaque. For many of them it meant more than a cash bonus.</p>
<p class="para">然而，到了 20 世纪 70 年代末，卡特在公司内的影响力明显减弱。除了戴维·卡恩斯 (David Kearns) 可能例外，他再也无法在高管套房中号召全神贯注的听众。这个地方的基因密码已经改变。“在会议上，人们不再像以前那样听谢尔比·卡特 (Shelby Carters) 的胡言乱语了，”卡恩斯观察到。“卡特会说，‘我对此有预感’，每个人都会回答，‘不可能。我们不会凭直觉行事。’”</p><p class="para">By the late 1970s, however, Carter’s influence within the corporation was distinctly on the wane. With the possible exception of David Kearns, he could no longer command a rapt audience in the executive suite. The genetic code of the place had changed. “The hip-shooting Shelby Carters weren’t listened to as much at meetings anymore,” Kearns observed. “Carter would say, ‘I have a hunch about this,’ and everyone would respond, ‘No way. We don’t act on hunches.’”</p>
<p class="para">卡特的直觉之一与 Alto 有关。他坚信一支积极进取的销售队伍能够大卖这款机器，于是他派了一位值得信赖的副手弗兰克·索尔 (Frank Sauer) 进入 ASD，让他随时了解营销计划，并让施乐的圣克拉拉销售办事处参与规划。有一天，索尔偷偷递给他一份艾伦比的提案副本。卡特曾深度参与未来日的规划，因此很欣赏艾伦比的才能。“看完后，他非常兴奋，”艾伦比回忆道。“他非常相信事情要成真。所以有一天，他碰巧坐在大卫·卡恩斯 (David Kearns) 旁边观看纽约大都会队的比赛，他说，‘嘿，约翰的团队真的在做一些令人兴奋的事情。别忘了，这些人就是为你在博卡拉顿做事的人。’卡恩斯说，‘马上给我拿一份。’”</p><p class="para">One of Carter’s hunches concerned the Alto. Convinced that a properly motivated sales force could sell the machine, big-time, he had placed a trusted lieutenant named Frank Sauer inside ASD to keep him up to date on the marketing program and to involve Xerox’s Santa Clara sales office in the planning. One day Sauer slipped him a copy of Ellenby’s proposal. Carter, who had been deeply involved in the Futures Day planning and appreciated Ellenby’s talents as a result, “took a look and got pretty excited,” Ellenby recalled. “He was a great believer in making things happen. So one day he happened to be sitting next to David Kearns at a New York Mets game and said, ‘Hey, John’s team is really up to something exciting. Don’t forget these are the guys who did Boca Raton for you.’ And Kearns said, ‘Get me a copy right away.’”</p>
<p class="para">因此，该提案跳过了管理层，直接传达到了最高层。这是一个危险的举动。尽管高管们喜欢谈论打破官僚主义壁垒，让施乐公司重新运转起来，但他们对礼仪仍然非常挑剔。当有消息传出该提案不知怎么传到了卡恩斯的耳中时，人们认为艾伦比是故意泄露给首席执行官的——这可以理解，因为他在博卡拉顿的积极进取的作风为他赢得了“一个不顾组织其他人感受就能完成工作的能手”的声誉，这是他自己说的。艾伦比回忆说，埃尔金德“非常生气”，甚至威胁要解雇他。</p><p class="para">The proposal thus skipped over several levels of management on its way to the top. This was a dangerous move. As much as senior executives liked to talk about tearing down the bureaucratic walls to get Xerox moving again, they remained very fussy about protocol. When word filtered down that the proposal had somehow reached Kearns, Ellenby was assumed to have deliberately leaked it to the chief executive—understandably, since his can-do style at Boca Raton had earned him the reputation of “a hot shot who got the job done regardless of other people’s organizational feelings,” as he put it himself. An “extremely pissed off” Elkind even threatened to fire him, Ellenby recalled.</p>
<p class="para">埃伦比否认与将报告发送给上游有任何关系。但现在这件事已经完成了，他仍然没有悔改。他受够了施乐，认为这个提议是他最后一次机会<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch19.html.page287"></a>他在组织内实现了自己的目标。如果计划不成功，他就准备离开并创办自己的公司。他还认为，以其他方式，该提案永远不会被提交给高层管理人员。</p><p class="para">Ellenby denied having had anything to do with sending the report upstream. But now that it was done, he remained unrepentant. He was fed up with Xerox and considered the proposal his last crack at achiev<a></a>ing his goals within the organization. If it did not fly, he was ready to go off and start his own company. He also felt that the proposal would never have made it to top management any other way.</p>
<p class="para">“艾尔金德不会把文件传给他的老板，他的老板也不会把文件传给他的老板，”他说。“施乐公司不是这么做的。”</p><p class="para">“Elkind would not have passed it to his boss, who would not have passed it to his boss,” he said. “Xerox did not work that way.”</p>
<p class="para">他是对的。艾尔金德后来表示，他认为埃伦比的计划在施乐公司内部不可能成功，即使没有“在管理层上下级之间进行多次调动”——尤其是当《星报》仍是公司办公系统中指定的先锋时。卡特的无礼让阿尔托公司失去了朋友。正如艾尔金德所预料的那样，该提案在整个管理层中都遭到了抵制和敌意。</p><p class="para">He was right. Elkind said later he did not think Ellenby’s program could ever succeed within Xerox, even absent “the disruption of bouncing it several steps up the management chain”—especially with the Star still holding pride of place as the corporation’s designated spearhead in office systems. Carter’s impertinence had earned the Alto no friends. As Elkind predicted, the proposal met with nothing but resistance and hostility all the way along the management line.</p>
<p class="para">不过，如果卡恩斯真的能支持，这个计划或许会成功。但他并不愿意这么做。他伸手去拿这份提案，仿佛是为了证明自己也能像其他人一样具有创业精神和自发性，然后把提案交给了一名副手进行例行评估。</p><p class="para">Still, it might have succeeded had Kearns thrown some real weight behind it. This he was unwilling to do. Having reached down to grab the proposal as though to demonstrate he could be as entrepreneurial and spontaneous as the next man, he turned it over to a deputy for a routine appraisal.</p>
<p class="para">副手罗伯特·温里克 (Robert Wenrik) 将其与 SDD 和鲍勃·波特 (Bob Potter) 等常见嫌疑人的意见进行了对比。两人都发现了许多值得挑剔的地方，包括长期存在的成本问题。最后，温里克用一封官僚主义的空洞拒绝了艾伦比的工作。信中写道：“我们得出结论，施乐公司不会采纳您开出的方案；但是，我们感谢您对方案中涉及的许多问题的思考……”</p><p class="para">The deputy, Robert Wenrik, tested it against the judgments of the usual suspects, including SDD and Bob Potter. Both found plenty to carp at, including the perennial issue of cost. In the end Wenrik shot down Ellenby’s work with a bureaucratically vacuous rejection letter. “We have concluded that Xerox will not adopt the proposal you have prescribed,” it read; “however, we appreciate the thought you have given to the many issues covered in your proposal…”</p>
<p class="para">“我保留了一份副本，”多年后的一天，艾伦比从他的档案中取出了这份副本。“他在这里说的话很有意思，比如‘<span class="italic">你明确指出的一些挑战正在通过正常的管理渠道进行处理，应该会在未来几周内得到解决……</span> ’但事实并非如此，因为它们从来没有得到解决。还有‘<span class="italic">你的提议帮助我们比通常更快地处理了这个问题……</span> ’我不认为这是真的，我认为这个提议实际上拖延了事情，就像是给工作添了麻烦。</p><p class="para">“I kept a copy,” Ellenby said one day many years later, withdrawing it from his files. “It’s pretty interesting what he did say here, like ‘<span class="italic">Some of the challenges which you clearly identified are being pursued through the normal management channels, and should be resolved over the next few weeks…</span>’ Which was not the case, because they never were. And ‘<span class="italic">Your proposal assisted us in dealing with the problem more expeditiously than we normally might have…</span>’ I don’t think that’s true, I think actually the proposal delayed things, it was like throwing a wrench into the works.</p>
<p class="para">“然后他继续说，‘<span class="italic">我相信你会继续支持我们在杰里·埃尔金德的调查活动中面临的挑战......</span> ’他很清楚杰里想解雇我。”</p><p class="para">“Then he goes on to say, ‘<span class="italic">I’m confident that you will continue your support to the challenges we face in Jerry Elkind’s probe activity…</span>’ Knowing full well that Jerry wanted to fire me.”</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch19.html.page288"></a>
<p class="para">1980 年 1 月，在收到温里克的信大约一年后，艾伦比从施乐公司辞职。他用多留一年的公司利润分享计划中赚到的部分钱，创办了一家名为 Grid Systems 的公司，生产了世界上第一台笔记本电脑。该产品线并非源自他在施乐公司所做的任何工作（施乐律师曾严厉警告他不要招募任何团队成员加入他的新公司），而是源自他从费兰蒂那里学到的平板显示器和微处理器技术。将 PARC 技术转移到外部的梦想必须等待。艾伦比和其他许多人一样，发现作为一家将他积极倡导的品牌纯粹视为威胁的公司的员工，他不可能实现这一目标。</p><p class="para">In January 1980, about one year after receiving Wenrik’s letter, Ellenby quit Xerox. Partially with the money he had earned in his corporate profit-sharing plan by staying the extra year, he founded a company called Grid Systems, which manufactured the world’s first laptop computers. The product line derived not from any work he had done at Xerox, whose lawyers had cautioned him sternly against recruiting any of his team members to his new company, but from flat-panel display and microprocessor technology he had learned from Ferranti. The dream of transferring PARC’s technology to the outside would have to wait. Ellenby, like so many others, had found it impossible to accomplish this as an employee of a company that treated his brand of aggressive advocacy purely as a threat.</p>
<p class="para">“戴夫·卡恩斯在看到我的能力提案后，主动来到 PARC，花了一些时间讨论它，”艾伦比回忆道。“他说，‘如果我决定不做这件事，你会怎么做？’</p><p class="para">“Dave Kearns took it upon himself to come out to PARC and spend a bit of time discussing my capability proposal after he saw it,” Ellenby recalled. “He said, ‘What will you do if I decide not to do this?’</p>
<p class="para">“我说，‘我会确保我的员工在公司里安居乐业，因为他们喜欢这个公司。但我必须离开，大卫，因为我已经毁掉了太多的桥梁。’”</p><p class="para">“I said, ‘I’ll make sure my folks are well set and happy within their corporation because they like this corporation. But I’m going to have to leave, David, because I’ve burned too many bridges.’”</p>

<p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">1978 年的一个</span></span>早晨，数十名 PARC 科学家上班时发现他们的 Altos 计算机死机了。起初，这并没有引起任何警觉。Alto 计算机死机是一种很常见的现象，而且很容易解决：只需伸手按下 Thacker 贴心提供的控制台上的重置开关即可。然后，计算机会从存储有操作系统副本的备用磁盘重新启动，如果没有备用磁盘，则通过以太网远程重新启动。</p><p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">O</span></span>ne morning in 1978 dozens of PARC scientists arrived at work to discover their Altos were dead. At first this did not raise any alarm. The crash of an Alto was a common enough phenomenon and easily remedied: One simply reached over and pressed a reset switch Thacker had obligingly provided on the console. The machine then rebooted from a spare disk coded with a copy of the operating system or, if one was not available, remotely by Ethernet.</p>
<p class="para">在第一个小时左右，甚至没有人怀疑这些崩溃可能是更普遍的危机的一部分。但很快就发现，Altos 被一种全新的怪癖感染了。它们启动正常，但只要离开机器几分钟——它就会再次崩溃。再次重启，一切正常。让它闲置……然后死亡。很快，3333 Coyote Hill Road 的一楼和二楼就回荡着担忧和抗议的声音。</p><p class="para">For the first hour or so no one even suspected that the crashes might be part of a more general crisis. But it soon became obvious that the Altos had been infected by an entirely new quirk. They booted up fine, but step away from your machine for even a few minutes—and it crashed again. Reboot again, fine. Leave it idle…and death. Soon the first and second floors of 3333 Coyote Hill Road were fairly echoing with voices raised in apprehension and protest.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">嘿，我的 Alto 怎么了？……你的也出问题了？我进来的时候我的就死机了！……我的也是！……还有我的！……怎么回事？今天早上我们进来的时候肯定有上百台机器崩溃了！</span></p><p class="para"><span class="italic">Hey, what’s the matter with my Alto?…Something go wrong with yours, too?

<p class="para">到 20 世纪 70 年代末，PARC 的两个计算实验室的大部分工作都涉及对其辉煌的最初几年中产生的发明进行深入研究。发明 Alto 和以太网就像播种田地。现在是时候收割庄稼了 — 换句话说，更仔细地研究这些系统在现实世界中如何协同工作。</p><p class="para">By the late 1970s much of the work in PARC’s two computing labs entailed elaborating on the inventions produced during its first few glorious years. Inventing the Alto and Ethernet was like seeding a field. Now it was time to harvest the crops—in other words, to look more closely into how these systems worked in the real world and in concert.</p>
<p class="para">John Shoch 决定在他的斯坦福博士论文中引用其中一条线索。他的计划是研究网络在不同消息负载和流量模式下的行为。但仅仅观察它在正常条件下的运行是不够的。真正有趣的事情是看看如果你真的猛击系统，将其加载到绝对极限，看看它是否会爆炸，会发生什么。</p><p class="para">John Shoch decided to tug on one of these threads for his Stanford doctoral thesis. His plan was to study how a network behaved under various message loads and traffic patterns. But it would not be enough to watch it operate under normal conditions. The really interesting thing would be to see what happened if you really pounded on the system, loading it to the absolute limit to see if it blew a gasket.</p>
<p class="para">他知道自己比其他学习网络理论的学生有很大优势。他每天都可以访问以太网，这是当时世界上最大、最繁忙的计算机网络。唯一的问题是施乐公司是否会让他发表自己学到的东西。</p><p class="para">He knew he had a major advantage over other students of network theory. He had daily access to the Ethernet, then the world’s largest and busiest computer network. The only question was whether Xerox would let him publish what he learned.</p>
<p class="para">这并不是无谓的考虑。施乐公司敏锐地意识到，其财富来自秘密和产权。在其复印机市场主导地位（虽然正在衰落，但仍然强大）的背后，是一些受到强烈捍卫的专利，以及其他至关重要的发明，它们从未通过专利申请向公众公开。相反，它们被锁在与保护可口可乐配方一样安全的保险库中。到 1973 年，该公司已指派了一家公司<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch20.html.page291"></a>担任 PARC 的全职专利律师，并规定即使是技术论文也必须经过律师审查，并清除任何无意的专有信息泄露，然后才能提交给专业期刊。</p><p class="para">This was not an idle consideration. Xerox was acutely aware that its wealth flowed from secrets and property rights. Behind its domination of the copier market—which was waning but still strong—were a handful of ferociously defended patents, as well as other inventions so critical they had never been exposed to the public scrutiny of a patent application. Instead they were locked in a vault as secure as the one that safeguarded the recipe for Coca-Cola. By 1973 the company had assigned a corporate <a></a>patent lawyer to PARC full-time and decreed that even technical papers were to be vetted by counsel and cleansed of any inadvertent proprietary disclosures before they could be submitted to professional journals.</p>
<p class="para">PARC 偶尔会自己发布技术论文。这些论文因封面上的横条纹颜色而被称为“蓝皮书”。但大多数情况下，法律部门都以铁腕手段控制研究成果的发表。如此多的创意人才涌入这座位于 Coyote Hill Road 的大楼，而流出的信息却如此之少，以至于一位前经理回忆说，PARC 有时被称为“计算机科学的黑洞”。</p><p class="para">On rare occasions PARC issued technical papers on its own. These were known as “blue books” from the color of the horizontal stripes across the covers. But for the most part the legal department controlled the publication of research with an iron hand. So much creative talent went into the building on Coyote Hill Road and so little information came out that PARC, recalled one former manager, was sometimes called “the black hole of computer science.”</p>
<p class="para">参加会议和其他公共活动的 PARC 研究人员必须严格遵守公司的严格规定。他们并不总是能避免尴尬。其中一个比较棘手的情况涉及 Shoch、Bob Metcalfe 和其他几位工程师组成的以太网团队。作为 ARPANET 主机所在地，PARC 有义务帮助解决在全国系统建设过程中出现的任何技术问题。不幸的是，施乐公司的律师已严格命令以太网工程师保密他们所知道的一切。</p><p class="para">PARC researchers participating in conferences and other public events had to carefully comply with the company’s paranoid rules. They did not always avoid embarrassment. One of the more delicate situations involved the Ethernet team of Shoch, Bob Metcalfe, and several other engineers. As an ARPANET host location PARC was honor-bound to help address any technical problems cropping up during construction of the nationwide system. Unfortunately, Xerox’s lawyers had given the Ethernet engineers strict orders to keep to themselves everything they knew.</p>
<p class="para">这一困境首次浮现是在 1973 年，当时梅特卡夫参加了斯坦福大学举办的 ARPANET 会议。当时讨论的一个问题源于独立“局域网”或 LAN 的激增，类似于 PARC 的以太网。这些网络的技术标准或协议通常彼此不兼容，并且与 ARPANET 本身也不兼容。问题是如何协调它们，以便数据能够通过 ARPANET 主干顺利地从一个网络传输到另一个网络——这是实现 ARPA 目标的关键一步，即将其网络扩展为一个更大、更全面的系统，连接世界各地的计算机——换句话说，将其转变为一个“互联网”。</p><p class="para">This quandary first surfaced in 1973, when Metcalfe attended an ARPANET conference at Stanford. One issue under discussion arose from the proliferation of independent “local area networks,” or LANs, similar to the Ethernet at PARC. These networks’ technical standards, or protocols, were often incompatible with each other and with the ARPANET itself. The question was how to coordinate them so data could smoothly pass from one to another via the ARPANET backbone—a critical step toward ARPA’s goal of expanding its network into a larger and more comprehensive system linking computers everywhere—transforming it, in other words, into an “internet.”</p>
<p class="para">对于 ARPANET 的技术负责人来说，这个问题仍然很大程度上只是假设。到目前为止，只有少数几个运行的 LAN 足够先进，可以接入主网络。然而，对于 PARC 来说，这已经是一个紧迫的问题。在斯坦福，梅特卡夫没有多说什么，但他回到办公室时确信自己不能等 ARPA 解决这个问题。施乐公司已经计划使用以太网将公司本地网络连接到<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch20.html.page292"></a>数据在全国各地——实际上是全球——传输。数据包在从一个本地施乐环路传输到另一个本地环路时必须穿越外部系统，就像卡车在州际公路上从加州工厂开往纽约零售店一样。</p><p class="para">For the ARPANET’s technical honchos this question was still largely hypothetical. So far there were only a few operating LANs sophisticated enough to tap into the main network. For PARC, however, it was already a pressing issue. At Stanford Metcalfe held his tongue, but he returned to his office convinced he could not wait for ARPA to solve the problem. Xerox was already planning to use the Ethernet to link corporate loca<a></a>tions all over the country—indeed, the globe. Data packets would have to traverse outside systems on their way from one local Xerox loop to another, like trucks hopping on the interstate en route from California factories to New York retail shops.</p>
<p class="para">“我们面临的问题比他们更紧迫，”梅特卡夫向肖克透露，“因为我们的网络比他们多。我们必须自己构建一个互联网协议。”</p><p class="para">“We have a more immediate problem than they do,” Metcalfe confided to Shoch, “because we have more networks than they do. We’re going to have to build an internet protocol ourselves.”</p>
<p class="para">在博格斯和哈佛大学数学家埃德·塔夫特的合作下，梅特卡夫和肖克想出了一个解决方案，他们称之为 PARC 通用数据包，简称“Pup”。基本思路是将数据包封装在一种符合传输网络协议的电子信封中，就像孩子的生日礼物一样，用联邦快递的空运单包裹并贴上标签，以便通过飞机和卡车运输。当数据包从一个网络移动到另一个网络时，它可以进一步被封装在任意数量的网络专用胶囊中。当它到达目的地时，各种信封都会被剥去，只剩下原始信息可供阅读。</p><p class="para">Working with Boggs and Ed Taft, a mathematician from Harvard, Metcalfe and Shoch came up with a solution they called the PARC Universal Packet, or “Pup.” The basic idea was to enclose a data packet in a sort of electronic envelope consistent with the protocol of the transporting network—rather like a child’s birthday present wrapped and tagged with a Federal Express airbill for transport by its planes and trucks. As the packet moved from network to network, it could be further wrapped in any number of network-specific capsules. By the time it reached its destination the various envelopes would have been stripped away, leaving the original message to be read.</p>
<p class="para">在开发和测试 Pup 的一年中，PARC 工程师在数十个不同网络上取得了技术上的领先，远远超过了 ARPANET 团队。这并不令人意外。他们的沙箱由分布在全国各地的近 500 台主机组成，已经比 ARPANET 大得多，也繁忙得多。<span class="sup">*</span>此外，PARC 不受 ARPANET 笨拙的官僚机构的影响。</p><p class="para">In the year they spent developing and testing Pup over dozens of variant networks, the PARC engineers moved well ahead of the ARPANET team in their technical expertise. This was unsurprising. Their sandbox, comprising nearly 500 host computers scattered around the country, was already much bigger and busier than the ARPANET.<span class="sup">*</span> Moreover, PARC was immune to the ARPANET’s lumbering bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="para">“我们的优势在于，我们全职从事这项工作，并因此获得报酬，”Shoch 回忆道。“ARPANET 的工作人员在政府资助和大学合同下工作。他们有合同管理员和学生为他们工作，并且要应对所有缓慢、令人沮丧的行为。我们拥有大量资源和大量机器，没有太多其他事情要做。我们正在向前发展。”</p><p class="para">“We had the great advantage of getting paid to do this full-time for a living,” Shoch recalled. “The ARPANET guys were working under government funding and university contracts. They had contract administrators and students working for them and all that slow, lugubrious behavior to contend with. We had a lot of resources and a lot of machines and we didn’t have much else going on. We were evolving ahead.”</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch20.html.page293"></a>
<p class="para">但当 ARPA 邀请他们参加技术会议，解决他们已经解决的相同问题时，他们却面临一个痛苦的困境。施乐的律师仍在考虑是申请以太网专利还是将其作为专有产品进行营销，因此对 PARC 团队施加了严格的限制。“我们被要求参加会议，”Shoch 说。“但我们被命令<span class="italic">不要</span>描述我们正在做的事情。”</p><p class="para">But when ARPA invited them to a technical meeting to work out the very same issues they had already solved, they faced a painful dilemma. Xerox’s lawyers, still deliberating whether to patent Ethernet or market it as a proprietary product, placed the PARC team on a short leash. “We were told to participate in the meetings,” Shoch said. “But we were ordered <span class="italic">not</span> to describe what we were doing.”</p>
<p class="para">尽管如此，他们还是强烈地渴望将自己的智慧传授给 ARPA 的朋友们。由于法律专家的严厉批评，他们只能通过一种奇怪的手势来表达自己的观点，即提出一些难以捉摸但又狡猾尖锐的问题。“有人会谈论某个元素的设计，我们会给出所有这些暗示，”Shoch 回忆道。“我们会说，‘你知道，这很有趣，但如果这个错误消息再次出现，会发生什么？如果随后出现了延迟的重复消息，当流量控制不接受它时，远程网关的响应速度会减慢，但它还是回来了，迟到了，会发生什么？那时你会怎么做？’他们会停顿一下，然后说，‘你已经<span class="italic">试过了</span>！’我们会回答，‘嘿，我们从没这么说过！’”</p><p class="para">Nevertheless, they felt a powerful urge to impart their wisdom to their friends at ARPA. Thanks to the legal beagles’ strictures, they were reduced to getting their points across by a weird pantomime of asking inscrutable but cunningly pointed questions. “Somebody would be talking about the design for some element and we’d drop all these hints,” Shoch recalled. “We’d say, ‘You know, that’s interesting, but what happens if this error message comes back, and what happens if that’s followed by a delayed duplicate that was slowed down in its response from a distant gateway when the flow control wouldn’t take it but it worked its way back and got here late? What do you do then?’ There would be this pause and they’d say, ‘You’ve <span class="italic">tried</span> this!’ And we’d reply, ‘Hey, we never said that!’”</p>
<p class="para">最终，他们成功地沟通了 Pup 架构的大部分内容，使其成为 ARPANET 标准 TCP/IP 的重要组成部分。TCP/IP 至今仍是数据包在全球数据网络（即大写的“互联网”）中顺利传输的关键。PARC 的贡献大多默默无闻；互联网最近的一段历史只承认 PUP“启发”了 TCP/IP。Metcalfe、Shoch 和其他人已经习惯了他们的贡献被不公平地低估。Shoch 说：“TCP/IP 团队永远不会告诉你他们这样做是因为施乐，因为他们不记得这件事。但我们会坐在那里解释问题，并试图指导他们。我们让所有这些东西都运转起来，但我们无法告诉他们。”</p><p class="para">Eventually they managed to communicate enough of Pup’s architecture for it to become a crucial part of the ARPANET standard known as TCP/IP, which to this date is what enables data packets to pass gracefully across the global data network known as the Internet—with a capital “I.” PARC’s contribution is mostly unsung; one recent history of the Internet acknowledges only that PUP “inspired” TCP/IP. Metcalfe, Shoch, and the others have gotten used to their contribution being minimized unfairly. “The TCP/IP guys will never tell you they did this because of Xerox, because they don’t remember it that way,” Shoch said. “But we would sit there explaining the problems and trying to coach them along. We had all this shit up and running, and we couldn’t tell them.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">尽管律师们对与 ARPA 和其他外部机构的合作提出了严厉的批评，但 Shoch 认为应该允许他自己在自己的沙盒中玩耍。如果你连一个微不足道的博士学位都无法完成，那么访问以太网有什么意义呢？他仔细地收集了一堆临时许可和批准，并确保<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch20.html.page294"></a>施乐公司的官僚机构知道，对他来说，这不仅仅是一篇在科学杂志上发表的十页论文。最后，他确信自己能够发表自己学到的东西，于是开始像孩子敲鼓一样敲打以太网。</p><p class="para">Despite the lawyers’ strictures on cooperating with ARPA and others on the outside, Shoch figured he should be allowed to play in his own sandbox. What was the point of having access to the Ethernet if you could not even use it to finish a paltry doctorate? He carefully assembled a stack of provisional clearances and approvals and made sure the <a></a>Xerox bureaucracy knew that more was at stake for him than a ten-page paper in a scientific journal. Finally, confident that he would be able to publish what he learned, he set out to pound on the Ethernet like a kid beating a drum.</p>
<p class="para">首先，他编写了一个程序，从午夜开始，连续 10 分钟不间断地向以太网发送消息位。天黑后，实验室其他人都回家了，他和同事 Jon Hupp 花了几个小时辛苦地将软件加载到 100 台闲置的 Altos 中。然后他们等到<span class="smallCaps">凌晨</span>12:10 ，重复了这一过程，这次收集了每台机器的数据，了解有多少数据包到达了目的地，有多少数据包因系统堵塞而被困住。在这场考验结束之前，Shoch 意识到他和朋友已经投入了人类已知的最枯燥、最愚蠢的练习。</p><p class="para">To begin with, he wrote a program that would spew message bits onto the Ethernet for a ten-minute period without interruption, starting at the stroke of midnight. He and a colleague named Jon Hupp spent hours laboriously loading the software into 100 idle Altos after dark, when the rest of the lab had gone home. Then they waited for 12:10 <span class="smallCaps">A.M.</span> and repeated the circuit, this time collecting each machine’s data on how many of its packets got through to their destination, compared to how many got tied up in the system by gridlock. Before this ordeal had run its course, Shoch realized he had committed himself and his friend to the dreariest and stupidest exercise known to man.</p>
<p class="para">不管有没有博士学位，他都不想再经历那样的痛苦。他必须想办法让机器做这些枯燥乏味的工作。他认为这应该不是一项难以完成的任务——只需让机器告诉他它们处于空闲状态，然后通过以太网分发他在第一天晚上带到一百个办公室的同一个程序。原则上，这与启动或通过网络发送文件没有太大区别，而这些事情在 PARC 每天都会发生几十次。</p><p class="para">Doctorate or not, he was damned if he was going to go through that again. Somehow he had to figure out how to make the machines do the bleak scutwork. It should not be an insurmountable task, he figured—just a simple matter of getting the machines to tell him they were idle, then distributing by Ethernet the very same program that he had hauled around to a hundred offices on that first night. In principle this was not much different from booting up or sending files over the net, something that happened at PARC dozens of times a day.</p>
<p class="para">几天之内，Shoch 就编写了一个新程序，可以指示一台 Alto 询问其他机器是否有空。唯一的麻烦是，PARC 中空置的 Altos 永远不会完全闲置。主人离开后，它们仍保持开机状态，整晚运行诊断程序，不断测试内存芯片（那些老旧的、有缺陷的 Intel 1103）是否有早期故障。只要机器处于非活动状态的时间达到一定时间，测试程序就会自动启动（就像今天的自动屏幕保护程序一样），阻止 Altos 对他的询问做出肯定的回应。</p><p class="para">Within a few days Shoch had written a new program that would instruct one Alto to ask the others if they were free. The only complication was that unoccupied Altos at PARC were never entirely idle. After their owners departed they remained on, spending the night running a diagnostic program that continually tested the memory chips—those old buggy Intel 1103s—for incipient failures. The test program, which kicked in automatically whenever the machine remained inactive for a certain number of minutes (just like today’s automatic screen savers), would prevent the Altos from responding affirmatively to his query.</p>
<p class="para">肖克沿着走廊走到编写诊断程序的戴维·博格斯身边。“你能把这个东西加到程序里吗，这样机器就能回答我的问题，告诉我他有空？”他问道。</p><p class="para">Shoch strolled down the hall to David Boggs, who had written the diagnostic. “Could you just add this thing to the program so the machine will answer mine and tell me he’s free?” he asked.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch20.html.page295"></a>
<p class="para">博格斯耸耸肩。在 PARC，像这样帮助同事是理所当然的事。“没问题，”他说。“我能做到。”</p><p class="para">Boggs shrugged. Helping a colleague like this was coin of the realm at PARC. “No problem,” he said. “I can do that.”</p>
<p class="para">“另外，你能确保如果我向他发送这种数据包，他能使用我的软件重新启动吗？”</p><p class="para">“And while you’re at it, can you make sure that if I send him this kind of packet he’ll reboot with my software?”</p>
<p class="para">“我可以做到。”</p><p class="para">“I can do that.”</p>
<p class="para">“所以突然之间，”Shoch 后来回忆道，“你可以向任何一台自由机器发送‘你好’，并说‘我要通过网络将这个程序加载到你身上，当我说‘<span class="italic">开始</span>’时，你开始在网络上生成比特。然后我将逐一远程轮询你，取回所有数据并打印出来。然后我将制作这张图表并获得我的博士学位。’”</p><p class="para">“So all of a sudden,” Shoch recalled later, “you could send out a ‘Hello’ to any free machine and say, ‘I’m going to load this program on you through the net, and when I say “<span class="italic">Go</span>” you’re to start generating bits, onto the network. Then I’m going to poll you all remotely one by one and take back all the data and make a printout. And then I’m going to produce this chart and get my Ph.D.’”</p>
<p class="para">只需按下按钮，就能让五十或一百名 Altos 响应召唤，这让他有一种令人眼花缭乱的权力感。“这就像坐在星际飞船企业号的掌舵人手中<span class="italic">，</span> ”他说，“掌控一切。”</p><p class="para">Inducing fifty or a hundred Altos to answer a summons dispatched by the press of a button gave him a giddy feeling of power. “It was like sitting at the helm of the Starship <span class="italic">Enterprise</span>,” he said, “in control.”</p>
<p class="para">也许这就是为什么他的想法很快就从直接与每台机器通信转变为指导它们相互交谈。如果他不从一个中心点将相同的程序加载到五十台机器上，而是让每台机器都能寻找其他机器，那会怎样？</p><p class="para">Perhaps that was why his thoughts soon turned from communicating directly with each machine to instructing them to talk to each other. What if, rather than loading the same program onto fifty machines from one central point, he gave each one the ability to seek out the others?</p>
<p class="para">“我可能不必找到 50 台机器，只需找到两台，然后告诉每台机器再找到 50 台。然后每台<span class="italic">机器</span>又被告知再找到 25 台。”如此反复——可能性无穷无尽。“这是那种你深夜才会思考的事情，”他笑着说——但这并不是人类大脑第一次出现这种想法。有一天，当他向一群同事解释这个概念时，斯坦福实习生史蒂夫·韦尔打断了他。</p><p class="para">“Instead of my having to find fifty machines, maybe I just find two, and tell each of them to find fifty more. Then each of <span class="italic">those</span> machines is told to find twenty-five more.” And on and on—the possibilities were infinite. “It’s the kind of thing you think about late at night,” he laughed—but it was not the first time something of the sort had occurred to the human mind. As he explained the concept one day to a group of colleagues, he was interrupted by a Stanford intern named Steve Weyer.</p>
<p class="para">“那是绦虫！”韦耶说。</p><p class="para">“That’s the tapeworm!” Weyer said.</p>
<p class="para">“什么？”</p><p class="para">“The what?”</p>
<p class="para">“绦虫，出自<span class="italic">《冲击波骑士》</span>。我给你一本。”</p><p class="para">“The tapeworm, from <span class="italic">The Shockwave Rider</span>. I’ll give you a copy.”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">《冲击波骑士》</span>是英国科幻小说作家约翰·布伦纳最近的一部小说。在故事中，主人公释放了一种无懈可击的自我延续病毒——也许是第一个真实或虚构的计算机病毒——来摧毁一个邪恶的全球网络。（“<span class="italic">它无法被杀死。至少可以摧毁整个网络！</span> ”）翻阅韦耶的这本书，肖克认为他的装置和布伦纳的装置之间的相似之处<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch20.html.page296"></a>大部分都是比喻性的。“虽然它确实唤起了正确的形象，但它并不完全是我们当时所做的，”他回忆道。无论如何，他还是借用了这个名字，略微缩短了一点，从那一刻起，Shoch 的以太网轮询程序在大楼里被称为“蠕虫”。</p><p class="para"><span class="italic">The Shockwave Rider</span> was a recent novel by the British science fiction writer John Brunner. In the course of the story its hero unleashes an invulnerable self-perpetuating virus—perhaps the first computer virus of fact or fiction—to destroy a sinister global network. (“<span class="italic">It can’t be killed. Not short of demolishing the net!</span>”) Paging through Weyer’s copy of the book, Shoch thought the similarities between his device and Brunner’s <a></a>were mostly metaphorical. “It wasn’t quite what we were doing, although it did evoke the right images,” he recalled. He appropriated the name anyway, slightly truncated, and from that moment on Shoch’s Ethernet-polling program was known around the building as “the worm.”</p>
<p class="para">Shoch 并没有像 Brunner 笔下的英雄那样摧毁网络，而是希望通过允许 PARC 的分布式计算机协同执行计算来增强网络。从理论上讲，蠕虫可以编程为从一台计算机开始，随着计算需求的增加而扩展到其他计算机。“在半夜，这样的程序可以调动一栋建筑中的数百台计算机，”他后来写道。在第二天早上之前，当用户来取回他们的计算机时，蠕虫就会撤退。在白天在一台或两台计算机中冬眠后，它会在第二天晚上再次出现——这一形象让 Shoch 的一位同事将它比作吸血鬼，而不是蠕虫。</p><p class="para">Rather than destroy the network like Brunner’s hero, Shoch aimed to enhance it by allowing PARC’s distributed machines to perform computations in concert. Theoretically, the worm could be programmed to start out in one machine and reach out to others as its computing needs expanded. “In the middle of the night, such a program could mobilize hundreds of machines in one building,” he wrote later. Before morning, as users arrived to reclaim their machines, the worm would retreat. After hibernating in a machine or two during daylight, it would reemerge the next evening—an image that led one of Shoch’s colleagues to liken it less to a worm than to a vampire.</p>
<p class="para">目标是将 200 台 Altos（每台都具有单处理器的功能）转换成一台具有 200 倍幂的分布式互连机器！Shoch 的奇思妙想暗示了一种复合处理器能力的方法，这种方法有朝一日将在超级计算机领域得到广泛应用。（IBM 机器“深蓝”采用了一种远亲架构，它在 1997 年瞬间完成了数十亿次计算，击败了国际象棋大师加里·卡斯帕罗夫。）</p><p class="para">The point was to convert 200 Altos, each with the power of a single processor, into one distributed, interlinked machine with the exponential power of 200! Shoch’s brainstorm hinted at a method of compounding processor power that would one day find wide application in the field of supercomputers. (The IBM machine “Deep Blue” employed a distantly related architecture when it instantaneously mustered billions of calculations to defeat chess grandmaster Gary Kasparov in 1997.)</p>
<p class="para">Shoch 很清楚，在主人不在的情况下接管数十台闲置计算机的特权意味着他必须严格控制他的程序。他赋予蠕虫寻找闲置 Altos、通过网络启动主机以及通过在机器之间发送自身副本来复制自身的能力。但他严格禁止蠕虫访问任何 Alto 的磁盘驱动器——这是必要的预防措施，以免蠕虫无意中覆盖某人的工作，他知道这会被视为“一种极其反社会的行为”。</p><p class="para">Shoch was well aware that the privilege of taking over scores of idle computers in their owners’ absence meant he would have to govern his program stringently. He invested his worm with the ability to seek out idle Altos, boot up a host machine through the network, and replicate itself by sending copies of itself from machine to machine. But he strictly forbade it access any Alto’s disk drive—a necessary precaution lest it inadvertently overwrite someone’s work, which he knew would be viewed as “a profoundly antisocial act.”</p>
<p class="para">即使在这些限制内，他也热衷于寻找新方法来扩展和完善蠕虫。随着时间的推移，他改进了程序，使其能够与分散的后代保持持续的通信，这样它就会知道有多少片段已经离开以及它们在做什么。母蠕虫甚至可以感知到 Alto 是否在内部有一个活跃片段的情况下崩溃，这是一个信号，表明它需要在另一个宿主上定居。</p><p class="para">Even within those limits he reveled in finding new ways to extend and elaborate the worm. In time he improved the program to the point where it could remain in constant communication with its dispersed offspring, so it would know how many segments were out and what they were doing. The mother worm could even sense if an Alto had crashed with an active segment inside, a signal that she would need to colonize another host.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch20.html.page297"></a>
<p class="para">但在想象一个绦虫肆虐的世界时，约翰·布伦纳并没有低估失控程序的顽固性。最终，肖克和他的同事们发现了一个程序有多么顽固和危险。这条虫子即将做出超出他们预见的“反社会”行为。</p><p class="para">But in imagining a world with a tapeworm gone amok, John Brunner had not underestimated the obstinacy of a runaway program. Eventually the moment arrived for Shoch and his colleagues to discover just how stubborn and dangerous one could be. The worm was about to commit an “antisocial” act beyond anything they could have foreseen.</p>
<p class="para">一天晚上，他们放出一个小蠕虫来测试控制功能。他们确信自己已经将一个完全无害的程序加载到少量 Altos 中，于是就让它运行，然后回家了。在某个时候——他们从未弄清楚确切的时间和原因——程序的某个部分严重损坏，导致主机崩溃。控制蠕虫感觉到自己丢失了一个片段，于是向另一台闲置的 Alto 发出了一条触须。那台主机崩溃了，然后是下一台，再下一台。现在，该程序正在不知不觉地寻找新的主机，并“杀死”它接触到的每一台主机。几个小时后，这场无声的大屠杀蔓延到整个大楼，直到数十台机器瘫痪。然后天亮了。</p><p class="para">One night they set a small worm loose to test a control function. Confident they had loaded a perfectly innocuous program into a modest number of Altos, they left it running and went home. At some point—they never figured out exactly when and why—one piece of the program became corrupted so badly that it crashed its host computer. Sensing it had lost a segment, the control worm sent out a tendril to another idle Alto. That host crashed, and the next, and the next. The program was now probing insatiably for new hosts and “killing” every one it touched. For hours the silent carnage spread through the building until scores of machines were disabled. Then morning came.</p>
<p class="para">泰德·凯勒就是那些回到办公室后发现机器处于紧张症状态的人之一。他毫不犹豫地重启了电脑。但很快，他发现整栋大楼都被一个恶灵控制了。每当一台机器闲置时，它就不会像往常一样进入内存诊断，而是会经历这种奇怪的发作并死机。“我们无法摆脱它，”他回忆道。</p><p class="para">Ted Kaehler was one of those who got to his office to find his machine in a state of catatonia. Without thinking twice, he rebooted. But it soon seemed that the entire building had been taken over by a malevolent spirit. Whenever a machine went idle, instead of slipping routinely into the memory diagnostic it would suffer this bizarre seizure and die. “We couldn’t get rid of it,” he recalled.</p>
<p class="para">终于，警报传到了蠕虫研究人员的耳朵里。博格斯和肖克反应过来时，天色还很早，他们几乎无法抹去睡意。他们开始拆解网络，探测其内部，就像灭鼠员通过下水道追捕老鼠一样。即使他们确信已经从每台 Alto 电脑上根除了该程序，机器仍然会莫名其妙地崩溃。肖克筋疲力尽，他发现自己又想起了<span class="italic">《冲击波骑士》</span>中的场景——“工人们在大楼里跑来跑去，徒劳地试图追赶蠕虫，并在它转移到其他地方之前阻止它。”</p><p class="para">Finally the alarm reached the worm researchers. It was still early in the morning when Boggs and Shoch responded, barely able to wipe the sleep from their eyes. They began disassembling the network and probing its recesses, like exterminators pursuing rats through a sewer line. Even after they were sure they had eradicated the program from every Alto, machines continued to crash bizarrely. Exhausted from the ordeal, Shoch found himself reimagining scenes from <span class="italic">The Shockwave Rider—</span>“workers running around the building, fruitlessly trying to chase the worm and stop it before it moves somewhere else.”</p>
<p class="para">这栋建筑里肯定藏有一群仍在寻找宿主的病虫害宿主。最后他们终于知道了虫巢的位置。三楼是行政区，楼上有十几名 Altos 员工。楼上还没有人来上班，办公室都锁上了。</p><p class="para">The building had to be harboring a reservoir of diseased worms still seeking hosts. Finally they realized where the nest was located. More than a dozen Altos were up on the third floor, the administrative quarters. No one up there had arrived for work yet, and the offices were all locked.</p>
<p class="para">这让他们别无选择，只能发射中子弹。多亏了<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch20.html.page298"></a>幸运的是，Shoch 预感到了这一点，他给蠕虫配备了自毁机制，就像间谍头目为他的特工提供自杀胶囊以防某些不可预测的灾难一样。他向以太网中注入了一个特殊编码的数据包，指示每个蠕虫立即停止正在执行的操作。他紧张地等待了几秒钟。然后他检查了系统。</p><p class="para">That left them no choice but to unleash their neutron bomb. Thanks to <a></a>a lucky precognition, Shoch had equipped the worm with a self-destruct mechanism, like a spymaster providing his agent with a suicide capsule as insurance against some unpredictable disaster. He injected a specially coded packet into the Ethernet that instructed every worm to instantly stop whatever it was doing. For a few nerve-racking seconds he waited. Then he checked the system.</p>
<p class="para">让他松了一口气的是，所有的蠕虫活动都停止了。这是个好消息。坏消息是整个以太网已经变成了一片冒烟的废墟。大楼周围散落着 100 台死掉的 Altos。“令人尴尬的结果，”他说，“留给大家看。”</p><p class="para">To his relief, all the worm activity had ceased. That was the good news. The bad news was that the entire Ethernet had been figuratively reduced to a smoking ruin. Scattered around the building were 100 dead Altos. “The embarrassing results,” he said, “were left for all to see.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">除了这个例外，蠕虫病毒是 PARC 编程武器库中受欢迎的新成员。Shoch 开始将普通版本称为“存在主义”蠕虫病毒 — — 它只是接触主机，复制自身，并在编程间隔后自毁。但还有许多其他应用程序。例如，Billboard 蠕虫病毒在系统中蜿蜒穿行，在每台机器上放置一个位图图像，例如“每日卡通”，以迎接早晨的工人。Alarm Clock 蠕虫病毒维护着一个唤醒电话表，并在适当的时间访问 PARC 的电话簿并拨打用户的电话。Peeker 蠕虫病毒记录了每晚内存测试的结果，并通知 PARC 技术人员哪些机器可能需要新芯片。</p><p class="para">With that lone exception, the worm ranked as a welcome addition to the PARC programming arsenal. Shoch came to calling the plain-vanilla version the “existential” worm—it simply reached out for hosts, copied itself, and self-destructed after a programmed interval. But there were dozens of other applications. The Billboard worm, for example, snaked through the system depositing on every machine a bitmapped image, such as a “cartoon of the day” to greet workers in the morning. The Alarm Clock worm maintained a table of wakeup calls, and at the pertinent time accessed PARC’s telephone directory and placed a call to the user’s phone. The Peeker logged the results of each night’s memory tests and notified PARC technicians which machines might need a new chip.</p>
<p class="para">Shoch 一直认为这些应用程序只是“玩具程序”。在他看来，蠕虫的真正价值在于将广泛分布的计算机整合成具有超强性能的多机单元。然而，并行计算的潜力在很长一段时间内都不会为外界所知。硅微处理器很快就会变得足够强大，无需任何帮助就能处理复杂的计算。直到几年后，科学家才再次需要同时利用多个处理器的强大功能，那时大规模并行处理将成为超级计算不可或缺的一部分。</p><p class="para">Shoch always thought of these applications as “toy programs.” In his view the worm’s real value lay in tying widely distributed computers into multi-machine units of exceptional power. Yet the potential of parallel computing would not become evident to the outside world for a long time. Silicon microprocessors would soon become powerful enough to handle complex calculations without help. Only years later would scientists again need to harness the power of multiple processors at once, when massively parallel processing would become an integral part of supercomputing.</p>
<p class="para">多年后，Shoch 蠕虫的谱系也回到了原点。在他发表了一篇关于蠕虫的论文并引用了<span class="italic">《冲击波骑士》</span>后不久，他收到了 John Brunner 本人的来信。似乎大多数科幻小说作家都怀有不言而喻的野心，想写一部<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch20.html.page299"></a>一本真正预测未来的书。他们的榜样是<span class="italic">《2001：太空漫游》</span>的多产作家阿瑟·克拉克，他因在早期的短篇小说中预测地球同步通信卫星的发明而闻名于世。</p><p class="para">Years later, too, the genealogy of Shoch’s worm would come full circle. Soon after he published a paper about the worm citing <span class="italic">The Shockwave Rider</span>, he received a letter from John Brunner himself. It seemed that most science fiction writers harbored an unspoken ambition to write a <a></a>book that actually predicted the future. Their model was Arthur C. Clarke, the prolific author of <span class="italic">2001: A Space Odyssey</span>, who had become world-famous for forecasting the invention of the geosynchronous communications satellite in an earlier short story.</p>
<p class="para">“显然他们都嫉妒亚瑟·克拉克，”肖克沉思道。“布伦纳写道，他的编辑将我的论文寄给了他。他说他‘非常高兴得知，我和亚瑟·克拉克一样，预言了未来的事件。’”肖克考虑了一下，说他只是借用了绦虫的名字，但这个概念是他自己的，不幸的是，布伦纳并没有真正发明这种蠕虫。</p><p class="para">“Apparently they’re all jealous of Arthur Clarke,” Shoch reflected. “Brunner wrote that his editor had sent him my paper. He said he was ‘really delighted to learn, that like Arthur C. Clarke, I predicted an event of the future.’” Shoch briefly considered replying that he had only borrowed the tapeworm’s name but that the concept was his own and that, unfortunately, Brunner did not really invent the worm.</p>
<p class="para">但他没有再管它。</p><p class="para">But he let it pass.</p>

She was seated before her second-floor window at PARC, which looked down on a lovely expanse of valley in its coat of lush winter green, sloping down toward Page Mill Road just out of view to the south. But her eyes were fixed on a wafer of silicon that had just come back from a commercial fabrication shop.</p>
<p class="para">晶圆上有几十种芯片设计，大部分是斯坦福大学在 PARC 技术监督下开设的课程的学生的作品。他们都致力于打造精致的机器，包括数以万计的微型晶体管，这些晶体管被塞进角质层大小的矩形空间中，全部排列在一块可以轻松放在手掌中的晶圆上。几年前，同样的计算能力还无法在一英亩的土地上实现。</p><p class="para">There were dozens of chip designs on the wafer, mostly student efforts from a Stanford course being taught under PARC’s technical supervision. They all strived toward an intricate machine elegance, comprising as they did tens of thousands of microscopic transistors packed into rectangular spaces the size of a cuticle, all arranged on a wafer that could fit comfortably in the palm of one’s hand. A few years earlier the same computing power could not have fit on an acre of real estate.</p>
<p class="para">一个设计脱颖而出，不仅仅是因为它的边缘带有自信的手工蚀刻文字：“Geometry Engine © 1979 James Clark。”其他的设计看起来只是简单的设备阵列，形成了模拟<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch21.html.page301"></a>与许多数字时钟和算术搜索引擎相比，克拉克的显然更胜一筹——即使用肉眼观察，它也比其他的更大、更深、更复杂。</p><p class="para">One design stood out, and not only because it bore along its edge the assertive hand-etched legend: “Geometry Engine © 1979 James Clark.” Where the others looked to be simple arrays of devices that formed sim<a></a>ple digital clocks and arithmetic search engines and the like, Clark’s was obviously something more—larger, deeper, more complex than the others, even when viewed with the naked eye.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic"></span>康威心想，<span class="italic">克拉克的内心一定有令人惊奇的事情发生。</span><span class="italic">但谁知道呢？</span></p><p class="para"><span class="italic">Clark’s got something really amazing going on in there</span>, Conway thought to herself. <span class="italic">But who knows what?</span></p>
<p class="para">事实证明，克拉克所做的一切是完全原创技术的基石。他在斯坦福大学几名学生的帮助下设计的“几何引擎”独一无二，将实时渲染三维图像所需的大量计算资源压缩到单个集成电路中。克拉克芯片出现后，计算机图形学的艺术和科学从此发生了翻天覆地的变化：汽车和飞机的计算机辅助设计、现代中途岛的“虚拟现实”玩具和游戏、电影《侏罗纪公园》中笨拙的恐龙<span class="italic">——</span>它们都源于那个冬天林恩·康威握着的那块小芯片的边缘。</p><p class="para">What Clark had going on, as it would turn out, was the cornerstone of an entirely original technology. The “Geometry Engine,” which he designed with the help of several of his Stanford students, was unique in compressing into a single integrated circuit the huge computing resources needed to render three-dimensional images in real time. After the appearance of Clark’s chip, the art and science of computer graphics would never be the same: The computer-aided design of cars and aircraft, the “virtual reality” toys and games of the modern midway, the lumbering dinosaurs of the movie <span class="italic">Jurassic Park</span>—they all sprang from the tiny chip Lynn Conway held by its edges that winter day.</p>
<p class="para">以几何引擎为核心，克拉克创立了硅谷图形公司，并将其发展成为如今价值数十亿美元的公司。但如果没有林恩·康威和帕洛阿尔托研究中心，他就不可能开发出几何引擎。讽刺的是，当康威首次提议让帕洛阿尔托研究中心成为设计这种极其复杂的集成电路的科学先锋时，她的许多同事都怀疑这是否值得做。</p><p class="para">With the Geometry Engine as its kernel, Clark founded Silicon Graphics Incorporated and developed it into the multibillion-dollar company it is today. But without Lynn Conway and PARC, he could not have built the Geometry Engine. The irony is that when Conway first proposed that PARC step into the vanguard of the science of designing such extraordinarily complex integrated circuits, many of her colleagues doubted it was worth doing at all.</p>

<p class="para">如果伯特·萨瑟兰 (Bert Sutherland) 没有决定给 PARC 来一次“浩劫”，康威的计划就根本无法启动。</p><p class="para">Conway’s program would never even have gotten started had not Bert Sutherland decided that PARC needed a shot of “havoc.”</p>
<p class="para">1975 年，萨瑟兰离开波士顿咨询公司 Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman 后接管了系统科学实验室的管理工作。Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman 曾是 PARC 的杰里·艾尔金德 (Jerry Elkind)、鲍勃·梅特卡夫 (Bob Metcalfe)、丹·鲍勃罗 (Dan Bobrow) 和沃伦·泰特尔曼 (Warren Teitelman) 的顾问。和他们一样，他对研究方法持有强烈的看法，这些方法并不总是符合 PARC 的正统观念，尤其是在鲍勃·泰勒 (Bob Taylor) 的计算机科学实验室中。萨瑟兰认为，在封闭环境中进行的研究注定会窒息，就像困在密闭笼子里的动物一样。他钦佩计算机科学实验室的工作，但认为泰勒和他的一些工程师<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch21.html.page302"></a>他认为，过于容易产生偏见和草率判断——这些情况使 CSL 失去了必要的自由。其结果就是自我毁灭的精英主义。</p><p class="para">Sutherland had taken over management of the Systems Science Lab in 1975 after leaving Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman, the Boston consulting firm that had earlier given PARC Jerry Elkind, Bob Metcalfe, Dan Bobrow, and Warren Teitelman. Like them, he held strong views about research methods which did not always conform to PARC orthodoxy, especially as it was practiced in Bob Taylor’s Computer Science Lab. Sutherland believed that research conducted in a closed environment was doomed to suffocate, like an animal trapped in an airtight cage. He admired the Computer Science Lab’s work but regarded Taylor and some of his engi<a></a>neers as overly prone to facile prejudices and snap judgments—conditions, he thought, that deprived CSL of the necessary aeration. The harvest was its self-destructive elitism.</p>
<p class="para">“他们是最优秀、最聪明的人，”他后来说。“这是好消息。坏消息是他们知道这一点。”</p><p class="para">“They were the best and the brightest,” he said later. “That was the good news. The bad news was that they knew it.”</p>
<p class="para">萨瑟兰不允许 SSL 变得如此与世隔绝。他的政策是通过与外界不断接触来保持其氛围的丰富。例如，继任霍尔后，他做的第一件事就是派工程师蒂姆·莫特和比尔·纽曼到位于帕洛阿尔托以南几英里的圣克拉拉的施乐复印机销售办公室进行“考古挖掘”。他们的想法是研究真正的办公室工作人员如何进行日常工作，以便更好地设计他们将来会使用的设备。这项努力产生了 OfficeTalk，这是一种复杂而集成的办公自动化系统，对后来的 Star 设计产生了重大影响。萨瑟兰还招募了认知科学领域的专家，如斯图尔特·卡德、汤姆·莫兰和约翰·西利·布朗，他们研究了真实的人如何一步一步、一个动作地使用计算机，从而对人机工程学产生了突破性的见解 - 甚至连 JCR·利克莱德 (JCR Licklider) 在 1962 年撰写有关该主题的开创性论文时都没有预料到这些见解。</p><p class="para">Sutherland did not allow SSL to become so sequestered. His policy was to keep its atmosphere enriched via continual contact with the outside world. One of his first acts upon succeeding Hall, for example, had been to send the engineers Tim Mott and Bill Newman on an “archeological dig” to Xerox’s copier sales office in Santa Clara, a few miles south of Palo Alto. The idea was for them to study how real office workers performed their daily routines, the better to design the equipment they would use in the future. This effort yielded OfficeTalk, a sophisticated and integrated system of office automation that heavily influenced the later design of the Star. Sutherland also recruited to SSL experts in cognitive science such as Stuart Card, Tom Moran, and John Seely Brown, whose research into how real people actually used computers, step by step and motion by motion, led to groundbreaking insights into man-machine ergonomics—insights that not even J. C. R. Licklider had anticipated when he wrote his own pioneering treatise on the subject in 1962.</p>
<p class="para">在 CSL，毫不奇怪，萨瑟兰的民主本能引发了抱怨——竟然在人类学上浪费宝贵的资源！——甚至在他把卡弗·米德带进 SSL 帐篷之前。然后一切都乱套了。</p><p class="para">At CSL, unsurprisingly, Sutherland’s democratic instincts provoked grumbling—wasting precious resources on anthropology, of all things!—even before he brought Carver Mead into the SSL tent. Then all hell broke loose.</p>
<p class="para">米德是加州理工学院计算机科学系最受欢迎和最有影响力的教授之一，萨瑟兰的兄弟伊万最近刚成为该系主任。米德立刻就被萨瑟兰认为是“闯入 PARC 的隔离墙内制造混乱”的合适人选。萨瑟兰知道，就纯粹的智力而言，卡弗·米德随时可以与巴特勒·兰普森和泰勒的其他枪手相媲美。米德身材矮小，精力充沛，留着黑色的胡子和山羊胡，眼神活泼，对电气工程有着自信的掌握，尤其是在无限复杂和无限小的极端领域——普通工程师不敢涉足的领域，但他却可以<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch21.html.page303"></a>他把这视为自己的个人领域。他的兴趣广泛，涉及核桃种植和粒子物理学等多种学科，这些都丰富了他的专业知识。</p><p class="para">Mead was one of the most popular and influential professors in the computer science department at California Institute of Technology, where Sutherland’s brother Ivan had recently become department chairman. Mead instantly struck him as the right person “to wander in and create some havoc” within PARC’s insulating walls. For sheer intellectual brio, Sutherland knew, Carver Mead could stand toe to toe with Butler Lampson and the rest of Taylor’s gunslingers any day. A compact, energetic man with a black mustache and goatee and lively, searching eyes, Mead possessed a confident mastery of electrical engineering, particularly at the extremes of the infinitely complex and the infinitesimally small—regions where ordinary engineers hesitated to venture but which he con<a></a>sidered his personal preserve. He filled out that expertise with a breadth of interests that encompassed subjects as diverse as walnut farming and particle physics.</p>
<p class="para">在他第一次访问 PARC 时，他和 Ivan Sutherland 正在深入研究电子系统在物理尺度边缘会发生什么情况——换句话说，晶体管可以小到什么程度而不会失去功能，以及可以构建多大和多复杂的系统而不会变得无法管理。从本质上讲，这些问题是相同的，因为随着晶体管越来越小，集成电路硅片表面的晶体管越来越密集，芯片也变得越来越复杂。直到 1976 年 Bert Sutherland 邀请 Mead 在系统科学实验室发表技术演讲时，人们才开始理解这种双重现象的含义。Mead 的正式主题是硅基集成电路的设计，但他的真正目的是提出一种新的计算机设计思维方式——这种方式可能会让 PARC 的大部分工作变得过时。</p><p class="para">At the time of his first visit to PARC, he and Ivan Sutherland were deeply engaged in studying what happened to electronic systems at the edges of the physical scale—in other words, how minuscule a transistor could be without its becoming nonfunctional, and how large and complex a system one could build without its becoming unmanageable. At their core these questions were identical, for as transistors got smaller and more densely crowded on the silicon surface of an integrated circuit, the chip became more complex. The implications of this dual phenomenon were only just becoming understood when Bert Sutherland invited Mead to give a technical address at the Systems Science Lab in 1976. Mead’s formal topic was the design of silicon-based integrated circuits, but his real purpose was to propose a new way of thinking about computer design—one that threatened to make much of PARC’s work obsolete.</p>
<p class="para">正如摩尔定律所预测的那样，自从摩尔共同创立的英特尔公司于 1971 年推出其首款微处理器以来，集成电路技术一直在飞速发展。4004 芯片本质上是一种微型晶体管的排列，它塞进了火柴盒大小的空间，却拥有相当于大型机的计算能力（大约在 1946 年）。这一成就很难引发人们对计算机架构的重大重新思考；但一年后，8008 芯片问世，其计算能力是 4004 芯片的两倍，1974 年，计算能力又翻了一番。</p><p class="para">As Moore’s Law predicted, the technology of integrated circuits had been surging ahead ever since Intel—the company Moore co-founded—introduced its first microprocessor in 1971. The 4004 chip was fundamentally an arrangement of microscopic transistors that packed into the space of a matchbook cover the computing power of a mainframe—circa 1946. That was hardly an achievement to prompt a major reconsideration of computer architectures; but a year later came the 8008, which had twice the power, and in 1974 another doubling again.</p>
<p class="para">没有理由认为这种趋势不会持续到下一个千年。在加州理工学院帕萨迪纳校区的学术基地里，米德想象着晶体管尺寸缩小和密度迅速增加的曲线几乎无限延伸。他认为，传统的计算机设计原则（MAXC 和 Alto 代表了这种设计理念的巅峰）注定会在这条曲线消失之前就从这条曲线上掉下来。这两台机器都使用集成电路来帮助控制最慢的外围设备，比如键盘和鼠标，但即使是这些芯片也属于被称为 MSI（中规模集成）的过时芯片。米德率先研究了下一步——LSI，即“大型<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch21.html.page304"></a>他开始思考“大规模集成”——他仍然在思考未来。他与伊万·萨瑟兰 (Ivan Sutherland) 合作，开始探索即将到来的小型化飞跃所带来的困难和可能性，这将使他们走向 VLSI，即“超大规模集成”。这就是他来到 PARC 传播的福音。</p><p class="para">There was no reason to think the trend would not continue well into the next millennium. From his academic aerie on Caltech’s Pasadena campus, Mead imagined the curve of shrinking transistor size and mushrooming density extending almost limitlessly into the distance. He believed that the traditional principles of computer design, of which MAXC and the Alto represented the intellectual pinnacle, were fated to fall off this curve well before it disappeared over the horizon. Both machines employed integrated circuits to help control their slowest peripheral devices, like the keyboard and mouse, but even those chips were of the passing generation known as MSI, or “medium-scale integration.” Mead had pioneered research into the next step—LSI, or “large<a></a>scale integration”—and he was still thinking ahead. In partnership with Ivan Sutherland, he began exploring the difficulties and possibilities presented by the coming quantum leap in miniaturization, which would bring them to VLSI, or “very large-scale integration.” This was the gospel he came to preach at PARC.</p>
<p class="para">他提醒听众，传统的计算机设计本质上是一种数学练习。人们从标准的布尔逻辑门（或门、与门、或非门等）中进行选择，并将它们排列成对比特流进行顺序操作。只要逻辑元件（主要是晶体管）速度慢且昂贵，而连接它们的线路速度相对较快且便宜，这种方法就行之有效，正如整个数字计算的历史一样。但这也意味着数字计算的惊人速度只是一种假象。逻辑元件是数据瓶颈，当你真正检查系统内部发生的情况时，你会发现计算机仍然受到“对单个数据项执行单个步骤”的限制，也就是说，每次只能做一件事。</p><p class="para">Traditional computer design, he reminded his listeners, was essentially a mathematical exercise. One chose from the standard inventory of Boolean logic gates—ORs, ANDs, NORs, and so on—and arranged them to operate sequentially on a stream of bits. This worked fine as long as the logic elements (mostly transistors) were slow and expensive and the wires connecting them were relatively fast and cheap, as had been true throughout the history of digital computing. But it also meant that the blinding speed of digital computation was something of an illusion. The logic elements were such data bottlenecks that when you really examined what was happening inside the system, you could see that computers were still constrained “to perform individual steps on individual items of data”—that is, to do only one thing at a time.</p>
<p class="para">新技术将彻底颠覆这种架构。随着硅基芯片变得越来越小、越来越密集，芯片上用来构成逻辑的微型晶体管比连接它们的线路速度更快、成本更低。线路<span class="italic">成了</span>瓶颈。很快，限制计算机效率的最重要因素将不再是门的顺序，而是它们在硅片上的几何排列，以及通过连接一个门到另一个门的微小路径传输电子的相对成本不断上升。计算机即将停止一次只做一件事，而是同时做多件事。因此，计算机架构师必须放弃将它们简单地设计为逻辑函数的线性序列的旧方法。他们还必须考虑如何沿最短路径将位从一个逻辑函数传输到另一个逻辑函数。</p><p class="para">The new technology would turn that architecture inside out. As silicon-based chips got smaller and denser, the microscopic transistors that were packed on them to make up the logic became faster and cheaper than the wires linking them. The <span class="italic">wires</span> became the bottlenecks. Soon the most important factor limiting the computer’s efficiency would not be the sequence of gates, but their geometric arrangement on a flake of silicon and the rising relative cost of transporting electrons over the minuscule pathways linking one to another. Computers were about to cease doing one thing at a time, in favor of doing many things simultaneously. Consequently, their architects would have to abandon the old methods of designing them simply as linear sequences of logical functions. They would have to also consider how to get bits from one logical function to another along the shortest path.</p>
<p class="para">传统数字技术要求设计师像工厂规划师一样思考，弄清楚如何将原材料从建筑物的一端运送到另一端，将成品运出。然而，硅“迫使你像城市规划师一样思考”，康威后来说道。“你必须认真思考<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch21.html.page305"></a>道路通向何方。”正如城市达到一定规模后会突然面临高速公路拥堵的威胁一样，她在 VLSI 中观察到，“如果不小心，最终可能会只有无处可去的道路。”幸运的是，VLSI 也提供了一种摆脱这种困境的方法：因为逻辑门和其他设备现在非常便宜，“如果能以减少高速公路来获得回报，那么增加它们的数量并不需要花费任何成本。”</p><p class="para">Traditional digital technology required designers to think like factory planners figuring out how to get raw materials in one end of a building and finished product out the other. Silicon, however, “forced you to think like an urban planner,” Conway said later. “You had to think hard <a></a>about where the roads go.” Just as cities reaching a certain size suddenly find themselves threatened by highway gridlock, she observed, in VLSI, “if you weren’t careful you could end up having nothing but roads going nowhere.” Fortunately VLSI also offered a way out of that quandary: Because the logic gates and other devices were now so cheap, “it didn’t cost you anything to have more of them, if that paid you back by having less highway.”</p>
<p class="para">对于通过传统方式达到巅峰的工程师来说，VLSI 充满了模糊的想法。许多人怀疑，甚至在物理上制造出像米德预言的那样微小的功能设备是否可行。即使是那些认为 VLSI 是一个有趣且潜力巨大的想法的人，也质疑它是否会取代让他们走到今天的久经考验的架构结构。在 CSL，普遍的看法是 VLSI 已经超出了他们所需的范围。“我们不必能够设计芯片，”兰普森说——当英特尔和其他芯片公司的工业设计师已经在努力设计芯片时，我们不必这样做。</p><p class="para">For engineers who had reached the top of their game the old way, VLSI was full of murky ideas. Many doubted it was physically possible even to fabricate functioning devices as tiny as the ones Mead prophesied. Even those who thought VLSI an interesting idea with great potential questioned whether it would ever supplant the tried-and-true architectural structures that had brought them this far. In CSL the general opinion was that VLSI was more than they needed to have on their plates. “We didn’t have to be able to design chips,” Lampson said—not while the industrial designers at Intel and other chip companies were already hard at work on it.</p>
<p class="para">无论如何，PARC 几乎不可能对这门模糊的科学做出多大贡献。在 CSL，“他们已经走在了自己的革命前沿”，一位研究人员后来评论道。“对他们来说，VLSI 并不是真正的主流，只是在其他地方发生的这种奇怪的事情。”</p><p class="para">In any case, PARC could hardly hope to contribute much to this nebulous science. At CSL “they were already out front in their own revolution,” one researcher later remarked. “To them VLSI was not really mainline, it was just this weird sort of thing happening somewhere else.”</p>
<p class="para">但对于萨瑟兰实验室的两位科学家林恩·康威 (Lynn Conway) 和道格拉斯·费尔贝恩 (Douglas Fairbairn) 来说，米德的演讲却产生了直接的震撼。</p><p class="para">But for two of Sutherland’s laboratory scientists, Lynn Conway and Douglas Fairbairn, Mead’s talk scored a direct hit.</p>
<p class="para">康威在 PARC 中是个罕见人物——她是一位经验丰富的高级主机设计师，但她选择对计算机科学实验室的硬件专家敬而远之。她是 PARC 的资深老将之一，1972 年加入 PARC 时，她曾在 IBM 帮助设计约克敦高地实验室的超级计算机，并在 Memorex 担任小型计算机架构师。但在 PARC，她没有参与开发 Alto 或 MAXC。相反，CSL 的智力枪战让她感到震惊，巴特勒·兰普森的威慑力也让她感到震惊。</p><p class="para">Conway was a rarity at PARC—an accomplished designer of advanced mainframes who chose to give the hardware gurus of the Computer, Science Lab a wide berth. She ranked among PARC’s senior veterans, having joined in 1972 from IBM, where she had helped design a supercomputer at the Yorktown Heights lab, and Memorex, where she had worked as an architect of minicomputers. But at PARC she had played no role in developing the Alto or MAXC. On the contrary, something about the intellectual gunplay of CSL alarmed her, as did the intimidating presence of Butler Lampson.</p>
<p class="para">“我总是很难和巴特勒打交道，”她回忆道。“他对所有关于<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch21.html.page306"></a>任何事情，但有时这会成为一种阻碍创造力的心理障碍。你可能会如此对抗和挑战自己有多聪明，以至于你无法总是看到别人也有这个很酷的想法。”</p><p class="para">“I always had a hard time dealing with Butler,” she recalled. “He had this complete photographic memory of all theory that ever existed about <a></a>anything, but sometimes that can be kind of a mental block to being creative. You can be so confrontational and challenging about how smart you are that you can’t always see that somebody else has got this cool idea.”</p>
<p class="para">和凯伊、特斯勒和舒普一样，康威发现系统科学实验室的极端分子氛围更加友好。“泰勒可以处理‘整洁’，而伯特可以处理‘混乱’，”她评论道。“在 SSL 中我可以生存。我可以对一个尚未成型的想法感到兴奋，然后去告诉伯特，他也会非常兴奋，也许会告诉我应该找谁谈谈。在 CSL 中，除非完美无缺，否则我真的很害怕提出任何东西，而且它可能会被立即否决。”</p><p class="para">Like Kay, Tesler, and Shoup, Conway found the ambiance more obliging among the Systems Science Lab’s lunatic fringe. “Taylor was someone who could manage the ‘neats’ and Bert could manage the ‘scruffles,’” she remarked. “In SSL I could survive. I could get all excited about an idea that was half-formed and go tell Bert about it, and he’d get all excited about it, maybe tell me somebody I should talk to about it. In CSL I’d be really afraid to present anything until it was perfect, and it would probably get immediately shot down anyway.”</p>
<p class="para">她在 PARC 的首份工作可以说是实施半成型想法的一次严峻考验。这份工作是设计和构建一个称为 Sierra 的组合传真和光学扫描系统，其目的是通过剥离文本并以压缩数字形式发送的技巧，高速传输混合文本和图形的页面，只留下图形通过传统（且速度较慢）传真传送。因此，人们希望整个页面的传输速度比传真为单个连贯图像快得多。</p><p class="para">Her inaugural assignment at PARC had been something of an acid test in the implementation of half-formed ideas. The job was to design and build a combination fax and optical scanning system known as Sierra, the aim of which was to transmit pages of mixed text and graphics at high speed via the trick of stripping off the text and sending it in compressed digital form, leaving only the graphics to be conveyed by conventional (and slower) fax. The entire page, it was hoped, would therefore transmit much faster than if faxed as a single coherent image.</p>
<p class="para">得益于她在 IBM 接受的大型计算机培训和在 Memorex 的实践经验，Conway 能够在 18 个月内制造出这台机器，这让所有人都感到惊讶。令他们失望的是，这台机器变成了两个巨大的专用硬件机架，耗电量大到足以加热一栋建筑。</p><p class="para">Thanks to her big-iron training at IBM and hands-on experience at Memorex Conway was able to get the machine built in eighteen months, to everyone’s candid surprise. To their disappointment, it emerged as two gargantuan racks of special-purpose hardware that devoured so much power one could heat a building with it.</p>
<p class="para">“你可以建造它，但你不会从中赚到任何钱，”她若有所思地回忆道。“它是如此庞大、如此混乱，有如此多奇特的小系统，它所展示的只是建筑师可以设想和建造有用的系统，而这些系统需要太多的电路，在经济上是不可行的。”</p><p class="para">“You could make it, but you wouldn’t make any money off it,” she recalled wistfully. “It was such a giant, kludged-up thing with so many exotic little systems that all it demonstrated was that architects could envision and build useful systems that would take too much circuitry to be financially viable.”</p>
<p class="para">只要 Sierra 的封装如此笨重，它就永远不可能实现。英特尔的新款 4004 将数千个晶体管封装在一个芯片上——她的硬接线机器的整块电路板缩小到可以用拇指和食指握住的东西——这为 Conway 提供了第一个线索，即电路最终可能如何在可管理的封装中重新实现。一类新架构的线索<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch21.html.page307"></a>灵魂就在她内心深处，对她低语。“痒痒的，”她说，“想被挠。”</p><p class="para">Sierra would never be feasible as long as it came in such an unwieldy package. Intel’s new 4004, which packed thousands of transistors onto one chip—a full circuit board’s worth of her hard-wired machine reduced to something you could hold between thumb and index finger—provided Conway with the first hint of how the circuitry might eventually be reimplemented in a manageable package. The hint of a new class of architec<a></a>tures was somewhere inside there, whispering to her. “The itch,” she said, “was trying to be scratched.”</p>
<p class="para">道格·费尔贝恩 (Doug Fairbairn) 是米德的第二位忠实信徒，他通过斯坦福人工智能实验室来到 PARC，在那里他曾与凯和特斯勒共事。“在斯坦福获得硕士学位后，我去了欧洲，”他回忆道。“六个月后我回来了。我不太想开始职业生涯，但在想，我的下一份工作是什么？然后我听说了施乐公司，我想，‘如果艾伦·凯在那里，我敢打赌我面试时就不必打领带了。’而我并没有打领带。”</p><p class="para">Doug Fairbairn, Mead’s second true believer, had arrived at PARC by way of the Stanford artificial intelligence lab, where he had worked with Kay and Tesler. “After getting my master’s at Stanford I’d gone to Europe,” he recalled. “After six months I came back. I wasn’t very driven to start a career but was thinking, what’s my next job? Then I heard about Xerox and thought, ‘If Alan Kay’s there, I bet I won’t have to wear a tie to the interview.’ And I didn’t.”</p>
<p class="para">采访对象是比尔·英格利什。像往常一样，英格利什急切地寻找工程师来帮助他和比尔·杜瓦尔完成 POLOS。费尔贝恩花了三年时间研究 POLOS 硬件，实现终端系统，这意味着将电视显示器、键盘和鼠标整合在一起。（后者的人体工程学设计耗费了他数周时间。“我花了很多时间在电线上。如果你把手拿开，普通的电线会导致鼠标移动。然后我发现了一根缠绕的电线，它固定在原处，但不断散开。我们最终花了大量的时间寻找合适的绝缘电线。”）</p><p class="para">The interview was with Bill English. As usual, English was in desperate search of engineers to help him and Bill Duvall complete POLOS. Fairbairn spent three years entangled in POLOS hardware implementing the terminal system, which meant bringing together the TV display, keyboard, and mouse. (The ergonomic design of the latter consumed him for weeks. “I spent a lot of time on the cord. A normal cord would cause the mouse to move if you took your hand off. Then I found a wound cord that stayed put, but constantly unraveled. We ended up spending an incredible number of hours looking for the right insulated cord.”)</p>
<p class="para">伯特·萨瑟兰 (Bert Sutherland) 比泰勒更愿意容忍实验室中的独立项目，但当这些项目没有成功时，他会更加无情地挥舞斧头，1975 年，他在几周内相继取消了 Sierra 和 POLOS——前者是因为不切实际，后者是因为它最终毫无疑问地被 Alto 取代。几个月后，当米德出现时，他的两位王牌硬件设计师仍在寻找下一个项目。无论是因为他们被迫无所事事，还是因为他们在构建规模失控的系统方面的经验，他们都对他关于如何处理机器复杂性的讨论着迷。</p><p class="para">Bert Sutherland, who was more willing than Taylor to tolerate independent projects in his lab, but wielded an even more ruthless hatchet when they did not work out, canceled Sierra and POLOS within weeks of each other in 1975—the former because of its, impracticality, the latter because it was finally and unmistakably overtaken by the Alto. His two ace hardware designers were still looking for their next projects when Mead showed up a few months later. Whether it was their enforced idleness or their experience in building systems whose sheer size had gotten out of hand, both were captivated by his discussions of how to handle machine complexity.</p>
<p class="para">费尔贝恩回忆道：“林恩·康威和我说过，‘这个 VLSI 真是太棒了。’”他们沉浸在新技术中，费尔贝恩每周从帕洛阿尔托通勤到他父母在洛杉矶的家，这样他就可以旁听米德在加州理工学院的课程。</p><p class="para">“Lynn Conway and I,” Fairbairn remembered, “were the ones who said, ‘This VLSI is hot shit.’” They immersed themselves in the new technology, Fairbairn commuting weekly from Palo Alto to his parents’ home in Los Angeles so he could sit in on Mead’s classes at Caltech.</p>
<p class="para">米德同样被 PARC 纯粹的创新氛围所吸引。他在校园里度过了多年，也参与过商业创业，他认为 PARC 是两者的独特结合，没有低调<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch21.html.page308"></a>两边都一样。“这里的团队合作比学术界多得多，”他说。“重点是把事情做好，而不是发表论文。”</p><p class="para">Mead was similarly seduced by PARC’s atmosphere of pure invention. Having spent years on campus and also been involved in commercial startups, he viewed PARC as a unique hybrid of both without the down<a></a>side of either. “There was a lot more teamwork than in academia,” he said. “It was about getting things done, not about publishing papers.”</p>
<p class="para">他也没有在英特尔等努力工作的企业中观察到的那种将产品推出门外的热情。相反，他发现自己被一种学习的热情所包围，这种热情驱使人们早早来到实验室，一直待到深夜。米德认为自己是一个病态的早起者，但他从不记得在 PARC 的哪个早晨他是第一个到达大楼的人。“我早上六点到，”他说，“艾伦·凯已经在那里了。”</p><p class="para">Nor was there the agitation to get product out the door he had observed at hard-charging enterprises like Intel. Instead he found himself surrounded by the enthusiasm for learning as an end in itself that drives people to come early to their labs and stay late into the night. Mead considered himself a pathologically early riser, but he could never remember a morning at PARC on which he was the first one in the building. “I’d get in at six in the morning,” he said, “and Alan Kay would already be there.”</p>
<p class="para">他们发明的集成计算环境的强大功能给他留下了更深刻的印象。“对我来说，这套由网络、Altos 以及文件和打印机服务器组成的系统非常强大，而且它将成为计算的主流。”</p><p class="para">He was even more profoundly impressed by the power of the integrated computing environment they had invented. “It was really obvious to me that this whole thing with the network and Altos and the file and printer servers was dynamite, and that it was going to be the way computing got done.”</p>
<p class="para">接下来的一年，加州理工学院和 PARC 互相学习。米德传授了他在微电子和计算机科学方面的理论，康威和费尔贝恩则通过开发设计方法和工具回报米德，这些方法和工具使工程师能够在 Alto 大小的工作站上创建前所未有的复杂集成电路。VLSI 科学的发展正如米德所预测的那样。以前只能通过六英尺金属架上悬挂的二极管和电线的毛茸茸垫子来实现的系统，现在被简化为硅晶片银色表面上的精致蚀刻——而且它们有效。它们正在接近模块化的目标，曾经需要一平方码原理图的电路可以简化为单个紧凑芯片，计算机设计师可以将其插入机器，就像一个简单的积木，孩子们可以用它建造摩天大楼模型。</p><p class="para">For the next year Caltech and PARC educated each other. Mead transferred his theories about microelectronics and computer science, and Conway and Fairbairn paid him back by developing design methods and tools giving engineers the ability to create integrated circuits of unprecedented complexity on Alto-sized workstations. The science of VLSI was developing exactly as Mead had predicted. Systems that previously could be realized only as shaggy mats of diodes and wire strung on six-foot metal racks were getting reduced to filigreed etchings on the silvery surface of a silicon wafer—and they worked. They were approaching the goal of modularity, in which circuits that once required a square yard of schematic diagram could be reduced to a single compact chip for a computer designer to plug into a machine, like a simple building block from which a child can build a model skyscraper.</p>
<p class="para">“这让我们朝着设计和建造更大、更好、更优雅的东西的方向前进，”康威说。“每个人的雄心都在逐月增加。”</p><p class="para">“This headed us in the direction of designing and building bigger, better, more elegant things,” Conway said. “Everybody’s ambition was cranking up month by month.”</p>
<p class="para">他们是一个吵闹的群体，喜欢在走廊里大声争论，有时甚至会生气，让人想起了大喊大叫的经销商。康威和米德是一对难相处的队友，有时合作，有时公开争吵如何组织和解释一项技术运动<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch21.html.page309"></a>以极快的速度向前推进。“卡弗和我都被这一切搞得焦头烂额，”康威回忆道。“我们互相竞争、互相冲突，这个项目周围有太多的噪音，看起来不太合理。”</p><p class="para">They were a noisy group, given to loud and sometimes angry debates in the hallways that reminded people of a Dealer in full cry. Conway and Mead made for prickly teammates, sometimes collaborating, sometimes quarreling openly about how to organize and explain a technology mov<a></a>ing ahead at breakneck speed. “Carver and I were both highly crazed by all this,” Conway recalled. “We’d compete and conflict with each other and there was so much noise around the project that it didn’t seem completely sane.”</p>
<p class="para">VLSI 也让一些同事望尘莫及。计算机科学实验室仍然坚持 VLSI 是一种未经测试的技术，除非有证据表明芯片可以大规模生产和利用，否则这种技术将一直如此。米德已经习惯了这种怀疑态度，总体上并不为此担心。“当时，人们普遍认为，如果你把这些东西做得更小、更快，它们就会融化，”他回忆道。早在 1971 年，他就写了一篇论文，预测微型芯片很快就会成为每部电话、洗衣机和汽车的一部分。他目前在技术领域看到的任何迹象都表明他应该改变自己的看法。</p><p class="para">VLSI also left some of their colleagues behind. The Computer Science Lab still held to the party line that VLSI was an untested technology and would remain so until there was proof the chips could be manufactured and exploited on a commercial scale. Mead was accustomed to such skepticism and on the whole untroubled by it. “At the time, the common wisdom was that if you make these things smaller and faster they’ll just melt,” he recalled. As early as 1971 he had written a paper predicting that the tiny chips would soon be part of every telephone, washing machine, and car. Nothing he had yet seen on the technical landscape suggested he should revise his opinion.</p>
<p class="para">但康威和费尔贝恩更在意帕洛阿尔托研究中心其他人如何看待他们的工作。她觉得 CSL 并没有给予他们信任。“他们似乎没有意识到我们是原则性很强的科学家，会对事物进行自我检查。”</p><p class="para">But Conway and Fairbairn were more sensitive to how their work was viewed by others at PARC. She felt CSL was not giving them the benefit of the doubt. “They didn’t seem to recognize that we were principled scientists who had our own self-check on things.”</p>
<p class="para">她是对的：CSL 非常怀疑。“我不喜欢 Lynn Conway 团队所做的事情，我认为他们没有多大成效，”Lampson 抱怨道，他很不情愿看到宝贵的 PARC 资源被浪费在投机的无底洞里。雪上加霜的是，就在 CSL 希望推出一些新计划时，施乐再次缩减预算。</p><p class="para">She was right: CSL was profoundly dubious. “I didn’t like what Lynn Conway’s group was doing and I didn’t think it was very productive,” Lampson complained, troubled to see valuable PARC resources draining down a speculative rathole. Adding to the pain, Xerox was again tightening up the budget just as CSL was hoping to launch a few new initiatives.</p>
<p class="para">“PARC 资源是一场零和博弈，我们认为有很多机会可以做很多事情，”他回忆道。“我们想涉足数据库和电子表格之类的领域，而这些领域过去我们完全忽略了。我们想在用户界面和编程环境等方面做大量工作。我们尽了最大努力，但显然，有了更多的资源，我们就能做更多的事情。”</p><p class="para">“There was a zero-sum game in PARC resources and we thought there were all kinds of great opportunities for things we might do,” he recalled. “We wanted to get into databases and things like spreadsheets which we had completely ignored in the past. We wanted to do a lot of work on user interfaces and programming environments, all sorts of things. We did what we could, but it seemed clear that with more resources we could do a lot more.”</p>
<p class="para">康威开始觉得必须采取一些措施来反击 CSL 的批评。萨瑟兰是她工作的坚定捍卫者，但他本质上并不是一个喜欢对抗的人。如果计算机实验室——尤其是兰普森，他赢得了管理层的尊重——继续吹毛求疵<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch21.html.page310"></a>考虑到投入到 VLSI 这一前景不明朗的领域的资金，谁知道她能在 PARC 坚持多久？尤其是这项技术的威力并没有一目了然。与商用集成电路相比，VLSI 的原理图表面上看起来简单而业余，因为它们采用了新颖、不为人熟知的设计技术，而这些技术在构建前几代集成电路时从未使用过。</p><p class="para">Conway started to feel that something had to be done to fight off CSL’s criticisms. Sutherland was a strong defender of her work, but by nature he was not a confrontational individual. If the computer lab—particularly Lampson, who commanded management’s respect—continued to carp <a></a>at the money being spent on the hazy potential of VLSI, who knew how long she could survive at PARC? Especially since the power of the technology did not leap out at first glance. Compared to commercial integrated circuits, the schematics of VLSI looked simple and amateurish on the surface, because they employed novel, unfamiliar design techniques that had never been employed in building earlier generations of integrated circuits.</p>
<p class="para">有一天，当她和米德、费尔贝恩讨论这个问题时，她意识到这个问题不仅仅是科学问题，也是文化问题。VLSI 出现的时间还不够长，甚至还来不及制作教科书和大学课程——她坚信，这些是可靠科学的必备条件，可以迫使其他人认真对待它。</p><p class="para">While discussing this one day with Mead and Fairbairn she realized the problem was not just scientific, but cultural. VLSI had not been around long enough even to generate textbooks and college courses—the paraphernalia of sound science that, she was convinced, would force everyone else to take it seriously.</p>
<p class="para">“我们应该写一本书，”她告诉米德。“如果一本书能够传达最简单、最优雅的 VLSI 设计规则和方法，那么它就会看起来像一门成熟的、经过验证的科学，就像教科书通常所介绍的那样，它已经存在了 10 到 15 年。”</p><p class="para">“We should write the book,” she told Mead. “A book that communicates the simplest, most elegant rules and methods for VLSI design would make it look like a mature, proven science, like anything does if it’s been around for the ten or fifteen years you normally have behind a textbook.”</p>
<p class="para">米德对此表示怀疑。他们没有出版商，而且由于他们通常在相距五百英里的两个地方工作，因此很难进行合作。</p><p class="para">Mead was skeptical. They had no publisher and, given that they normally worked in two locations five hundred miles apart, no easy way of collaborating.</p>
<p class="para">她回答说：“这就是你错的地方。如果不是为了推动她提议的项目，PARC 周围所有技术的目的又是什么呢？他们让 Altos 运行 Bravo，这是一个连接远距离合作者的网络，还有高速激光驱动的 Dover 打印机，用于制作专业的手稿。</p><p class="para">That’s where you’re wrong, she replied. What was the aim of all the technology that surrounded them at PARC, if not to facilitate just the project she was proposing? They had Altos running Bravo, a network to link long-distance collaborators, and high-speed laser-driven Dover printers to produce professional-looking manuscripts.</p>
<p class="para">“有了这些，”她说，“我们就可以做到，并且可以快速发布，而且它看起来<span class="italic">就像</span>一本普通的教科书。”</p><p class="para">“With all that,” she said, “we can do it, and get it out there fast, and it’ll <span class="italic">look</span> just like a regular textbook.”</p>
<p class="para">那年夏天，他们合作编写了这项新技术的开创性教材，而康威为提炼和传播 VLSI 福音所做的努力只是其中之一。同年，她同意在麻省理工学院教授一门客座课程（使用仍在完善的教科书的前几章），然后将她的讲义打印出来，供越来越多感兴趣的大学的教师使用。到 1979 年中期，她已经能够为十几所学校提供额外的奖励：如果他们愿意将学生的设计传送给<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch21.html.page311"></a>PARC 通过 ARPANET 安排芯片的制造、包装，然后返回给学生进行测试。</p><p class="para">Their collaboration that summer on what became the seminal text of the new technology was only one of Conway’s efforts to distill and spread the VLSI gospel. The same year she agreed to teach a guest course at MIT (using the first few chapters of the still-maturing textbook), then printed up her lecture notes for instructors at an ever-enlarging circle of interested universities. By mid-1979 she was able to offer an additional incentive to a dozen schools: If they would transmit student designs to <a></a>PARC over the ARPANET, PARC would arrange to have the chips built, packaged, and returned to the students for testing.</p>
<p class="para">那年夏天，她的提议引起了时任斯坦福大学电气工程副教授的吉姆·克拉克 (Jim Clark) 的注意。</p><p class="para">That summer her offer came to the attention of Jim Clark, then an untenured associate professor of electrical engineering at Stanford.</p>
<p class="para">克拉克之前没有集成电路设计方面的专业知识。“他之前甚至从未在硅片上工作过，”康威回忆道。但他在计算机图形学方面的专业知识来自 PARC 领域：他在犹他大学获得博士学位，他的论文导师是伊凡·萨瑟兰 (Ivan Sutherland)，他的研究资金来自 ARPA。</p><p class="para">Clark had no prior expertise in integrated circuit design. “He’d never even worked in silicon before,” Conway recalled. But his expertise in computer graphics came from well within PARC’s universe: He had received his doctorate at the University of Utah, where his thesis advisor was Ivan Sutherland and his research funding had come from ARPA.</p>
<p class="para">在犹他州和后来的斯坦福大学，克拉克一直渴望将图形技术推向现有硬件的极限。正如他的一名斯坦福学生后来回忆起 1979 年的一次会议时所说：“第一天我去和吉姆谈话时，他指着墙上挂着的一张飞机图片说：‘我要采取这个行动。’”</p><p class="para">At Utah and later at Stanford, Clark was driven by the impulse to push the technology of graphics beyond the limits of existing hardware. As one of his Stanford students later recalled of a meeting in 1979, “The first day I went to speak to Jim, he pointed to a picture of an airplane he had up on the wall. ‘I’m going to make this move,’ he said.”</p>
<p class="para">自从鲍勃·梅特卡夫之后，PARC 就再也没有人像他一样，他积极探索自己工作的所有商业可能性，不管学术如何。（“我喜欢商业的衡量标准，”他在 1994 年接受采访时说。“那就是钱。这很简单。你要么赚钱，要么不赚钱。大学的衡量标准是政治。”）</p><p class="para">Like no one PARC had seen since Bob Metcalfe, he was also driven to explore all the commercial possibilities of his work, academia be damned. (“I love the metric of business,” he told an interviewer in 1994. “It’s money. It’s real simple. You either make money or you don’t. The metric of the university is politics.”)</p>
<p class="para">克拉克立刻意识到，VLSI 提供的计算效率是拓展计算机图形潜力的关键。那年夏天，他搬到了 PARC，接管了康威隔壁的一间空置办公室，沉浸在 VLSI 知识中。四个月内，他就完成了 Geometry Engine 芯片，这是那年夏天全神贯注的成果。</p><p class="para">Clark understood at once that the computing efficiency VLSI offered was the key to expanding the potential of computer graphics. That summer he essentially relocated to PARC, taking over a vacant office next door to Conway’s and steeping himself in VLSI lore. Within four months he had finished the Geometry Engine chip, the product of that summer’s total immersion.</p>
<p class="para">与其他项目相比，克拉克的芯片或许更能实现康威让 VLSI 获得信誉的愿望。它不仅使计算机图形成为高性能计算的一个有利可图的领域，还表明可以快速设计出前所未有的复杂电路，然后大批量生产，在工业环境中完美运行。该技术最终发展成为当今一代的摩托罗拉和英特尔微处理器，这些微处理器运行着世界上大多数台式计算机以及各种专用电路。卡弗·米德的预言确实成真了。VLSI 确实让每部电话、<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch21.html.page312"></a>洗衣机、汽车，以及成千上万种其他日常用具，都变成了微型计算机。（克拉克的期望也实现了：硅谷图形公司让他成为了千万富翁。）</p><p class="para">Perhaps more than any other project, Clark’s chip fulfilled Conway’s quest to give VLSI credibility. Not only did it launch computer graphics as a profitable segment of high-powered computing, it showed that the unprecedentedly complex circuits could be designed rapidly, and then manufactured in huge quantities that would work flawlessly in an industrial context. The technology eventually matured into today’s generation of Motorola and Intel microprocessors, which run most of the world’s desktop computers, as well as a wide range of special-purpose circuits. Carver Mead’s prediction did come true. VLSI did turn every telephone, <a></a>washing machine, and car—and thousands of other workaday appliances as well—into tiny computers. (Clark’s expectations were fulfilled too: Silicon Graphics Inc. made him a multi-millionaire.)</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">在与 Lynn Conway 完成 VLSI 文本后，Carver Mead 为 PARC 做了另一项工作。他访问了斯坦福，警告施乐公司压制 PARC 的创造力会带来危险。</p><p class="para">Carver Mead performed one more service for PARC after completing of the VLSI text with Lynn Conway. This was a visit he paid to Stamford to warn Xerox of the dangers of squelching the inventiveness at PARC.</p>
<p class="para">这个使命源于他一天与帕克和伯特·萨瑟兰的一次谈话。“我告诉他们，施乐必须振作起来，”他回忆道，“因为大公司不可能利用这种快速发展的形势。人们会感到沮丧，然后创办自己的公司。帕克说，‘你应该和公司总部的人谈谈。’”</p><p class="para">The mission grew out of a conversation he had one day with Pake and Bert Sutherland. “I told them Xerox has got to get itself together,” he recalled, “because there’s no way a big company can take advantage of things moving this fast. People will get frustrated and start their own companies. Pake said, ‘You should talk to the people at corporate headquarters.’”</p>
<p class="para">米德对英特尔等新技术公司的熟悉，为他赢得了麦科洛和卡恩斯的尊重。“我和这些人度过了一个愉快的早晨，”他说。“我告诉他们，‘你们再也没有比这更好的机会了。如果人们因为看不到任何进展而离开，那就像 PARC 内部爆炸了一颗炸弹。唯一的问题是，你是参与其中并推动它，还是让它发生在别人身上。’”</p><p class="para">Mead’s familiarity with new-technology companies such as Intel won him a respectful audience from McColough and Kearns. “I spent a delightful morning with those guys,” he said. “I told them, ‘You’ll never have a better shot. If people leave because they don’t see anything happening, that’ll be like a bomb going off inside PARC. The only question is whether you participate and enable it, or let it happen for someone else.’”</p>
<p class="para">“你有什么建议？”科恩斯问道。</p><p class="para">“What do you suggest?” Kearns asked.</p>
<p class="para">“成立一个风险投资部门，”米德建议道。“嗅出技术，找到它，孵化它。在事情发生时持有股权，否则一切都会消失，你也不会拥有任何股份。”</p><p class="para">“Set up a venture capital arm,” Mead advised. “Smell out the technology, find it, incubate it. Take an equity position in things as they happen, otherwise it’ll all be gone and you won’t have any part of it.”</p>
<p class="para">他所提出的方案在二十年后成为美国企业的标准操作程序，被称为“内部创业”——一种在公司根深蒂固的官僚机构的束缚之外培育创新的方法。然而，1979 年，施乐管理层认为这个概念太复杂，不值得认真对待。那天午餐时，卡恩斯向米德透露，传统对施乐的控制几乎过于强大，甚至连他这个总裁兼董事长的继承人都无法接受。</p><p class="para">What he proposed would become standard operating procedure in American business twenty years later under the label “intrapreneuring”—a way to nurture innovation outside the dead hand of a corporation’s entrenched bureaucracy. In 1979, however, Xerox management regarded the concept as too elaborate to take seriously. That day over lunch Kearns confided to Mead that tradition’s hold on Xerox was almost too powerful even for him, its president and heir apparent to the chairmanship.</p>
<p class="para">“我来给你讲一个大公司的故事吧，”卡恩斯说。施乐公司雇佣了一群工程师来拆解每台从生产线上下来的新机器。他们的目标是找出最有可能出现的问题<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch21.html.page313"></a>服务工程师们会发现在日常操作的压力和紧张下会出现的问题，制定修复程序，并提醒设计工程师注意他们的错误。然而，每一款新机型都包含与上一款相同的设计错误。最后，服务工程师们自己设计了机器。这就是 3100 型，这是一款拟议的台式复印机，它具有高可靠性和不错的分辨率，是施乐公司能够提供的最接近日本机型的产品，而日本机型正在蚕食其客户群。然而，这些盗版研究工程师非但没有赢得公司的赞扬和奖励，反而因干涉设计过程而受到广泛谴责。</p><p class="para">“Let me tell you a story about big companies,” Kearns said. Xerox employed a group of engineers to tear apart every new machine coming off the production line. Their goal was to figure out the most likely prob<a></a>lems that would crop up under the stress and strain of daily operation, develop routines to fix them, and warn the design engineers of their mistakes. Yet every new model incorporated the same design blunders as the last. Finally the service engineers took matters into their own hands by designing their own machine. This was the Model 3100, a proposed desktop copier which, with its high reliability and decent resolution, was the closest thing Xerox could offer to compete with the Japanese models devouring its customer base. Yet instead of winning praise and rewards from the company, the bootlegging research engineers were widely vilified for interfering in the design process.</p>
<p class="para">“你知道吗？”卡恩斯告诉米德。“我大部分时间都在努力阻止公司其他人杀死那些人。”</p><p class="para">“You know what?” Kearns told Mead. “I spend most of my time trying to keep the rest of the company from killing those guys.”</p>
<p class="para">米德摇了摇头。没有哪家公司像帕洛阿尔托研究中心这样饱受部落冲突之苦，才会愿意接受帕洛阿尔托研究中心的慷慨馈赠。他带着一份含糊不清的、但又颇有先见之明的信息回到了加利福尼亚，他对自己曾使用过的这些强大技术的未来命运感到十分担忧。他确信这些技术迟早会被开发出来，并推向全世界。但他几乎同样确信，当这一切发生时，施乐公司将郁闷地站在场边。</p><p class="para">Mead shook his head. No company so riven by tribal conflicts would ever bring itself to welcome the exceptional gifts of PARC. He returned to California with a mixed message, if a prescient one, about the likely fate of the powerful technologies he had himself used to such wonderful effect. He was sure they would sooner or later be developed and marketed for the world. But he was almost equally sure that when this happened, Xerox Corporation would be standing glumly on the sidelines.</p>

<div class="chapterBody">
<p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">有</span></span>一天，艾伦·凯 (Alan Kay) 独自坐在系统科学实验室的会议室里，心里有一种强烈的冲动，想抛弃 Smalltalk，从头开始。</p><p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">O</span></span>ne day Alan Kay sat alone in the conference room of the Systems Science Lab, feeling a powerful urge to trash Smalltalk and start over from scratch.</p>
<p class="para">一段时间以来，他一直不安地看着自己的团队屈服于软件界的“大而化”。随着 Smalltalk 的每一次迭代（他们现在已经是第四个版本，即 Smalltalk-76），他觉得这种语言变得更加复杂、更加精妙，并且越来越偏离他最初设想的简单到儿童都能学习的系统。</p><p class="para">For some time he had watched uneasily as his own group succumbed to the software equivalent of biggerism. With every iteration of Smalltalk—they were now on the fourth version, Smalltalk-76—he felt the language had become more elaborate, more sophisticated—and farther removed from his original vision of a system easy enough for children to learn.</p>
<p class="para">但 Smalltalk-76 只是 Kay 梦想的又一个打击，她梦想的是开发一种透明而简单的编程语言。可悲的是，第一个打击是由孩子们自己造成的。他们已经停止学习了。</p><p class="para">But Smalltalk-76 was only the latest blow to Kay’s dream of a transparently simple programming language. The first, sadly, had been delivered by the children themselves. They had stopped learning.</p>
<p class="para">Kay 和 Adele Goldberg 在教 Jordan 家的孩子编程时感到的胜利感还未消退，她们就意识到自己取得的成就远没有自己想象的那么好。虽然有十到十二个孩子在编程方面表现出了真正的天赋和创造力，但这些孩子其实是来自全国最好的学校系统的天才班的优秀学生。大多数<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch22.html.page315"></a>乔丹家的孩子们仍然在努力学习最基本的概念，就好像他们用希腊语编程一样。</p><p class="para">The flush of triumph Kay and Adele Goldberg felt from teaching the Jordan kids how to program had barely worn off before they realized they had accomplished far less than they thought. While ten or a dozen kids had shown genuine aptitude and creativity in programming, these turned out to be the cream of an exceptional subset, pupils from the gifted track of one of the best school systems in the country. Most of <a></a>the Jordan kids still struggled with the most rudimentary concepts as though they were programming in Greek.</p>
<p class="para">Kay 意识到自己从一开始就期望过高。无论软件界面多么清晰，命令多么自然，编程对孩子来说仍然很困难——更不用说他曾经尝试教过的 PARC 的许多非专业成年人——只有两种方法可以克服：凭直觉（这是少数人才能获得的天赋），或者被告知答案。那天在 SSL 会议室，他终于向现实屈服了，他坐在白板上思考，上面潦草地写下了一个简单问题的代码，而这个问题让他的受试者感到困惑。他震惊地意识到，这里面充满了只有像他一样已经沉浸在计算技术和文化中的人才能理解的想法。“我数了一下这个小程序中不明显的想法的数量。一共有 17 个，”他回忆道。“其中一些就像建筑设计中的拱门概念：如果你还不知道它们，就很难发现。”</p><p class="para">Kay realized he had expected too much from the start. No matter how lucid the software interface or natural the commands, programming still presented difficulties to children—not to mention to many of the non-professional adults at PARC he had tried teaching as well—that could only be surmounted in one of two ways: by intuition (a gift granted to a precious few), or by being told the answer. He finally capitulated to reality that day in the SSL conference room, as he sat pondering a whiteboard on which he had scribbled out the code for a simple problem that had left his subjects confounded. With a shock he realized it was full of ideas obvious only to those who were, like himself, already steeped in the techniques and culture of computing. “I counted the number of nonobvious ideas in this little program. They came to 17,” he recollected. “And some of them were like the concept of the arch in building design: very hard to discover, if you don’t already know them.”</p>
<p class="para">他沮丧地发现，起初在一群青春期前儿童中似乎取得了惊人的突破，但实际上只不过是“黑客现象”在起作用：“对于任何特定的追求，只有 5% 的人会自然而然地投入其中，而大约 80% 的人能够及时学会，却发现这根本不自然。”同样痛苦的是，即使是最有天赋的孩子，要想保持学习曲线，也需要老师和学生付出巨大的努力——即使是在帕洛阿尔托，这样一个不可能大规模复制的理想环境。</p><p class="para">He was disheartened to discover that what had seemed at first to be a spectacular breakthrough with a group of preadolescents was nothing more than the “hacker phenomenon” at work: “For any given pursuit, a particular five percent of the population will jump into it naturally, while the eighty percent or so who can learn it in time do not find it at all natural.” It was also painfully evident that maintaining the learning curve of even the most talented kids demanded a tremendous effort by teacher and student—even here in Palo Alto, an ideal setting that would be impossible to reproduce on a large scale.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">也许他所寻求的本能可理解的编程系统终究只是一种幻想。正如阿黛尔不断提醒他的那样，“如果只有部分</span>孩子成功，那么就很难说成功。”</p><p class="para">Perhaps the instinctively understandable programming system he sought was a chimera after all. As Adele kept reminding him, “It’s hard to claim success if only <span class="italic">some</span> of the children are successful.”</p>
<p class="para">他不得不怀疑自己的方法是否被误导了。他曾坚信，在孩子很小的时候教他们编程会永久地塑造他们的思维过程。他真正的抱负是为他们提供一个通往人类启蒙的窗口。然而，他的实验却让他得出了一个矛盾的结论。编程并没有教会人们如何思考——他意识到他<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch22.html.page316"></a>因为他认识太多心胸狭窄的程序员，所以他现在深入思考了这个问题，认为事实并非如此。事实恰恰相反：每个人根深蒂固的思维方式都会影响他或她的编程方式。</p><p class="para">He was forced to wonder whether his very approach had been misguided. He had been convinced that teaching kids to program at an early age would permanently shape their thought processes. His real ambition had been to provide them with a singular window on human enlightenment. Yet his experiments led him to a contradictory conclusion. Programming did not teach people how to think—he realized he <a></a>knew too many narrow-minded programmers for that to be so, now that he considered the question in depth. The truth was the converse: Every individual’s ingrained way of thinking affected how he or she programmed.</p>
<p class="para">难道人类创造力的其他领域不也是如此吗？“相当多的艺术家、科学家、哲学家在他们的专业之外相当无趣（有人怀疑他们专业内也一样），”他后来说。“我们需要警惕的第一首歌是承诺将有趣的追求与有趣的想法联系起来的歌。音乐并不在钢琴里，你有可能从茱莉亚音乐学院毕业却没有发现或感受到它。”</p><p class="para">And was it not the same in every other field of human creativity? “A remarkable number of artists, scientists, philosophers are quite dull outside of their specialty (and one suspects within it as well),” he said later. “The first siren’s song we need to be wary of is the one that promises a connection between an interesting pursuit and interesting thoughts. The music is not in the piano, and it is possible to graduate Juilliard without finding or feeling it.”</p>
<p class="para">突然间，他强烈地渴望抛弃所有旧工具，重新开始。在他第一次向学习研究小组概述他的想法后不到四年，他就准备再次尝试简化。受 Ideaspace 新愿景的吸引，他于 1976 年 1 月将整个团队带到 Pajaro Dunes 进行为期三天的外出活动，规划新的旅程。他重新燃起热情，甚至为这次静修活动定了一个主题——“让我们刻录我们的磁盘包”，这暗指他们保存 Smalltalk 主代码的黄色 Alto 存储磁盘。</p><p class="para">Suddenly he felt a powerful desire to throw out all the old tools and start afresh. Scarcely four years after he had first outlined his ideas to the Learning Research Group, he was ready to make another run at the grail of simplicity. Drawn toward a new vision of Ideaspace, he brought the entire group to Pajaro Dunes for a three-day offsite in January 1976 to chart the new journey. Reinfused with enthusiasm, he even gave the retreat a theme—“Let’s burn our disk packs,” an allusion to the big yellow Alto storage disks on which they kept Smalltalk’s master code.</p>
<p class="para">然后他发现他们不再愿意盲目跟随他了。</p><p class="para">Then he discovered that they were no longer willing to follow him blindly.</p>
<p class="para">这一发现令人震惊。他花了大部分时间试图诱使他们重新开始一个与 Alto/Smalltalk 截然不同的硬件和软件系统。一天晚上，他惊呼道：“没有生物体可以在自己的废物中生存。”在早些时候，这会让他们开始一场主题之旅，参观 Ideaspace，探索死亡和重生的多种目的。这一次，他们认为这是对他们自己对不断增长的工作的投资的威胁，并拒绝了他。</p><p class="para">The revelation was staggering. He spent most of the retreat trying to inveigle them into a fresh start on a hardware and software system radically different from Alto/Smalltalk. “No biological organism can live in its own waste products,” he exclaimed one evening. In earlier days that would have started them off on a thematic tour of Ideaspace and an exploration of the multifarious purposes of death and renewal. This time they took it as a threat to their own investment in a growing body of work, and turned him down.</p>
<p class="para">“当艾伦说要刻录我们的磁盘包时，丹·英格尔斯必须这么做，”黛安娜·梅里回忆道。“但丹做不到。这些磁盘上有太多数据需要他重新创建，这让他很难放手。我们失去了拆开一切的意愿。艾伦最终意识到这是不可能的。”</p><p class="para">“When Alan said to burn our disk packs it was Dan Ingalls who would have had to do it,” recalled Diana Merry. “And Dan couldn’t do it. There were too many bits on those disks he would have to recreate again, which made it very, very hard to let go. We lost the will to break it all apart. Alan finally had to realize it wasn’t going to happen.”</p>
<p class="para">Smalltalk 不再是他的系统。他曾经启动过它，但一旦他<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch22.html.page317"></a>将它交给了 Ingalls 和 Adele Goldberg 等“完成者”，使其成为自己的财产。Ingalls 特别决心将 Smalltalk 转变为一种全方位服务的编程语言，而 Kay 最不希望看到这种转变。如果换做其他人，他可能能够控制这项工作。但他无法与 Dan Ingalls 抗衡，他是世界上为数不多的在自己选择的领域中技能甚至让 Alan Kay 都感到敬畏的人之一。他必须放手，欣赏这个系统本来的样子，而不是他希望它变成的样子。</p><p class="para">Smalltalk was no longer his system. He had started it, but once he <a></a>turned it over to the “completers” like Ingalls and Adele Goldberg it had morphed into their own property. Ingalls was particularly determined to transform Smalltalk into a full-service programming language, the last thing Kay desired. Were it anyone else, he might have been able to keep control of the effort. But he could not fight Dan Ingalls, one of the few people in the world whose skill in his chosen field awed even Alan Kay. He had to let it go and admire the system for what it was, not what he wished it to be.</p>
<p class="para">“Pajaro 催生了 Smalltalk-76，它比 Smalltalk-72 快了 200 倍，”Kay 后来说道，他不禁对 Ingalls 精心编写的代码表示钦佩，无论它与他自己的目标相差多远。“但是，”他若有所思地补充道，“没有一个孩子为 Smalltalk-76 写过任何代码。”</p><p class="para">“Pajaro led to Smalltalk-76, which was two hundred times faster than Smalltalk-72,” Kay said later, unable to avoid expressing admiration for Ingalls’s finely crafted code, no matter how far it departed from his own goal. “But,” he added wistfully, “no kid ever wrote any code for Smalltalk-76.”</p>
<p class="para">1976 年的异地会议永久改变了凯伊团队的人员生态。正如他后来承认的那样，这并不是一场灾难。没有争吵或公开指责。他们回到 PARC 仍然是朋友和同事。“但最初四年的绝对凝聚力从未消失，”他回忆道。他们可能还会骑自行车去城里的罗萨蒂家喝啤酒、集思广益，但骑车回到 PARC 并当场实施一些前所未有的新想法的兴奋感已经消失了。对凯伊来说，这个团队失去了平衡。儿童 Dynabook 的想法已经“黯淡无光”，被每个人的职业需要和他们想要阐述现在对他来说已经是旧想法的愿望所淹没。</p><p class="para">The 1976 offsite permanently changed the human ecology of Kay’s group. It was not a disaster, exactly, as he acknowledged later. There were no shouting matches or overt recriminations. They returned to PARC still friends and colleagues. “But the absolute cohesiveness of the first four years never rejelled,” he recalled. There might still be bicycle runs to Rosati’s in town for beer and brainstorming, but the thrill of biking back to PARC and implementing some unprecedented new idea on the spot had evaporated. To Kay the team had lost its balance. The idea of a Dynabook for Children had “dimmed out,” overwhelmed by everyone’s professional imperatives and their desire to elaborate on what were now, to him, old ideas.</p>
<p class="para">Kay 一直专注于他从马歇尔·麦克卢汉那里学到的教训：一旦人类塑造了他们的工具，他们就会反过来“重塑我们”。如果工具是正确的，那就很好，但他不相信 Smalltalk 还属于这一类。在 Pajaro Dunes 场外会议的几周内，他诱使 Adele Goldberg 和 Larry Tesler（两人仍然愿意跟随他走一条岔路）加入他重新获得简单主动性的探索。</p><p class="para">Kay remained preoccupied with a lesson he had assimilated from Marshall McLuhan: Once humans shape their tools, they turn around and “reshape us.” That was fine if the tools were the right ones, but he was unconvinced that Smalltalk fell into that category any longer. Within a few weeks of the Pajaro Dunes offsite he enticed Adele Goldberg and Larry Tesler, two who were still willing to follow him off on a tangent, into joining his quest to regain the simplicity initiative.</p>
<p class="para">结果就是 Notetaker。</p><p class="para">The result was the Notetaker.</p>
<p class="para">Kay 在 1976 年初首次勾勒出 Notetaker 的轮廓时，它的尺寸足够小，可以放在用户的膝盖上。虽然 Notetaker 的基本概念直接继承自 Alto，但它将抛弃 Alto 的硬接线和<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch22.html.page318"></a>微代码架构转而采用微处理器架构，这是英特尔和其他公司正在开发的新型硅基集成电路系列。凯在他的第一幅草图中融入了许多尚未出现在市场上的创新技术——但他坚持认为，这些技术在几年内都不会出现。</p><p class="para">As Kay first sketched it out early in 1976, the Notetaker would be compact enough to perch on the user’s lap. Although a direct descendant of the Alto in its basic concept, it would jettison the Alto’s hard-wiring-and-<a></a>microcode architecture in favor of one using microprocessors, the new family of silicon-based integrated circuits being developed by Intel and others. In his first sketches Kay incorporated a number of innovative technologies that had not yet appeared in the marketplace—but nothing, he insisted, that would not be available within a few years.</p>
<p class="para">很快，有一件事变得清晰起来：在开发 Notetaker 时，Kay 的团队将独自一人。向 CSL 寻求硬件帮助的日子已经过去了。Lampson 在实验室中对技术问题拥有绝对权威，他对 Kay 的新项目持冷淡的蔑视态度。</p><p class="para">One thing that shortly became clear was that in building the Notetaker, Kay’s group would be on its own. The days of turning to CSL for hardware help were past. Lampson, whose word on technical issues was paramount in that lab, regarded Kay’s new project with icy disdain.</p>
<p class="para">“艾伦有时并不真正了解现实，”他后来说。Notetaker 违背了兰普森的研究优先原则，该原则指出，人们需要展望未来，但不能太远。作为一台时间机器，Notetaker 被定位在遥远的未来，兰普森无法相信它能教给 PARC 任何有用的东西。考虑到新芯片的局限性，这台机器比他们曾经制造过的任何机器都更小、更慢、更笨重。</p><p class="para">“Sometimes Alan isn’t really in touch with reality,” he said later. The Notetaker offended Lampson’s doctrine of research priorities, which stated that one needed to look ahead of the curve, but not too far ahead. As a Time Machine the Notetaker was pitched so far into the future that Lampson could not believe it would teach PARC anything useful. Given the limitations of the new chips, the machine was shaping up to be smaller, slower, and dumber than anything they had ever built.</p>
<p class="para">“我告诉他们，在当今技术的限制下，你无法制造出任何有趣的东西，”兰普森回忆道。“你可以制造一个可以工作的小玩意，并且可以对其进行编程。但你无法让它做任何有趣的事情，因为技术的限制太多了。事实证明这是完全正确的。”</p><p class="para">“I told them that within the limitations of the technology of today you will not be able to build anything interesting,” Lampson recalled. “You’ll be able to build a gadget that will work and it will be possible to program it. But you won’t be able to make it do anything interesting because the technology’s just too limiting. And that turned out to be absolutely correct.”</p>
<p class="para">对于 Kay、Goldberg 和 Tesler 来说，这只是 Butler 的极度微妙。他有什么资格说什么是“有趣”？如果他们能制造出一台真正便携的机器，拥有 Alto 的 50%、30% 或 10% 的功能，那难道不“有趣”吗？无论如何，他也曾提出过同样的论点，认为 Dick Shoup 的 Superpaint 太超前了。好吧，系统科学实验室为 Shoup 提供了一个躲避 CSL 冷漠蔑视的避难所。如果有必要，他们会自己全力以赴地开发 Notetaker。</p><p class="para">To Kay, Goldberg, and Tesler this was just Butler being exceedingly subtle. Who was he to say what was “interesting”? If they could build a truly portable machine that had, say, fifty percent of the Alto’s functionality, or thirty percent, or ten, would that not be “interesting”? In any case, he had made the same arguments about Dick Shoup’s Superpaint being too far ahead of the curve. Well, the Systems Science Lab had given Shoup a refuge from CSL’s cold contempt. If necessary they would steam ahead with the Notetaker by themselves.</p>
<p class="para">但兰普森拒绝 Notetaker 的原因不仅仅是他对设计的怀疑。大约在 Kay 第一次提出他设计一款紧凑型便携式机器的想法时，CSL 已经对一个与其截然相反的想法产生了兴趣。当 Kay 鄙视大而无当的思想时，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch22.html.page319"></a>计算机科学实验室正在拥抱它，他们把这种梦幻计算机称之为 Dorado。</p><p class="para">But there was more to Lampson’s dismissal of the Notetaker than his doubts about the design. At about the time Kay first broached his idea for a compact portable machine, CSL had come under the spell of an idea that amounted to its polar antithesis. While Kay was scorning biggerism, <a></a>the Computer Science Lab was embracing it, in the form of a dream computer they called the Dorado.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">和 Notetaker 一样，Dorado 也声称 Alto 是其直接前身。但两者的相似之处仅此而已。Dorado 将成为有史以来最雄心勃勃的计算机 PARC。Notetaker 刻意保持低调紧凑，而 Dorado 则速度快、功能强大、体积大、噪音大。Notetaker 小到可以装进手提箱，而 Dorado 则大小如一台工业冰箱，配有五台散热风扇，轰鸣声如同“一架 747 起飞”。</p><p class="para">Like the Notetaker, the Dorado claimed the Alto as its direct forebear. But the resemblance ended there. The Dorado was to be the most ambitious computer PARC ever built. Where the Notetaker was to be deliberately modest and compact, Dorado would be fast, powerful, big, and noisy. Where the Notetaker turned out small enough to fit inside a suitcase, the Dorado was the size of an industrial refrigerator, with five fans for heat dispersion that roared like “a 747 taking off.”</p>
<p class="para">Dorado 是盛行的“大而无当”主义的产物，这一点从其首席设计师 Thacker 对其早期抱负的描述中可以看出：“最初的想法是，它将延续 Alto 的简约传统。我把它描述成一款 40 纳秒的 Nova（即时钟速度更快的 Nova）。” <span class="sup">*</span></p><p class="para">That the Dorado was the product of rampant biggerism is evident from the way Thacker, its principal designer, described his earliest ambitions: “The original idea was that it would continue in the simple tradition of the Alto. I described it as sort of a 40-nanosecond Nova (that is, a Nova with a much faster clock).”<span class="sup">*</span></p>
<p class="para">他的计划很简单，就是建造一台机器，让他能够测试新一代芯片，这些芯片据称比他在 MAXC 和 Alto 中使用的芯片更快、更可靠。但是到了 1976 年，当项目终于开始时，这些简单的目标就被同事们的雄心壮志所淹没了。当 Thacker 在运行 SIL（他的自动电路设计程序）的 Alto 上布置出 Dorado 的初步原理图时，<span class="italic">除了</span>SIL，几乎没有任何程序可以在 Alto 上运行。当第一批 Dorado 电路板从生产线上下来，装进一个七英尺的机柜时，PARC 技术的蓬勃发展已经生产出 Mesa，这是一个如此之大的编程系统，它可以塞满大楼里任何 Alto 的缝隙。</p><p class="para">His plan was simply to build a machine that would enable him to test a new generation of chips that promised to be faster and more reliable than those he had used in MAXC and the Alto. But by 1976, when the project finally got under way, those modest goals were overwhelmed by the vaulting ambitions of his colleagues. When Thacker laid out the Dorado’s preliminary schematic on an Alto running SIL, his program for automated circuit design, there was scarcely anything available to run on the Alto <span class="italic">except</span> SIL. By the time the first Dorado circuit boards came off a manufacturing line to be fitted into a seven-foot cabinet, the flowering of PARC technology had produced Mesa, a programming system so big it could burst the seams of any Alto in the building.</p>
<p class="para">“Dorado 确实比我计划的要复杂得多，”多年后 Thacker 懊悔地说道。“我确实认为这是第二系统综合症在起作用。你成功了，然后你说，‘我要造一个稍微好一点的东西。’Dorado 可能更好，但它确实<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch22.html.page320"></a>“当然要复杂得多。花了五年时间才开始工作，而且有几次失败。”</p><p class="para">“The Dorado certainly got more complex than I had planned on,” Thacker said ruefully years later. “I do think it was the second-system syndrome at work. You’re successful and you say, ‘I’ll build something that’s a little bit better.’ Dorado may have been better, but it was cer<a></a>tainly a lot more complicated. It took five years to get working and there were several false starts.”</p>
<p class="para">第一次事故发生在他还被分配到位于 Coyote Hill 街对面的旧 34 号楼的系统开发部时。那时 Dorado 已被指定为 SDD 计划制造的数字复印机的核心。很快人们发现，该计划的缺陷在于，Thacker 急于在新设计中安装的新芯片使用起来非常麻烦。这些芯片采用一种称为 ECL（即“发射极耦合逻辑”）的技术，确实比他们在 Alto 中使用的 TTL（“晶体管-晶体管逻辑”）芯片快得多，而且错误更少。但它们也非常耗电，会产生大量热量，因此需要接入额外的电源来驱动风扇。当 Thacker 完成 Dorado 处理器的初版设计时，他知道他永远无法让 SDD 以足够低的价格将其作为商业产品发布。</p><p class="para">The first of these occurred while he was still assigned to the Systems Development Division in the old Building 34 across the street from Coyote Hill. By then the Dorado had been designated to be the heart of a digital copier SDD was planning to build. The flaw in this plan, it quickly emerged, was that the new chips Thacker had been so eager to fit in his new design were a major headache to use. Employing a technology known as ECL, for “emitter-coupled logic,” they were indeed much faster and less buggy than the TTL—“transistor-transistor logic”—chips they had used in the Alto. But they were also terrible power hogs and threw off huge volumes of heat, which required patching in an additional power source to drive a fan. By the time Thacker finished his first-cut design of the Dorado processor, he knew he could never make it cheap enough for SDD to ship as a commercial product.</p>
<p class="para">实验室重组。Thacker 重新开始为 Star 开发处理器，该处理器将使用有缺陷的旧式（但很熟悉）TTL 芯片。这演变成了命运多舛的 Dolphin。与此同时，Dorado 项目回到了计算机科学实验室，该实验室不受 SDD 面临的发货期限和商业价格点的巨大压力。Lampson 后来回忆说，CSL 的每个人都从一开始就知道 Dorado“完全不实用”。但如果商业市场不愿意花钱购买，他们肯定会的。Dorado 将成为有史以来最大、最好的时间机器。</p><p class="para">The labs regrouped. Thacker started over on a processor for the Star that would use the buggy old (but familiar) TTL chips. This evolved into the ill-fated Dolphin. Meanwhile, the Dorado program returned to the Computer Science Lab, which was immune to the ferocious pressures of shipment deadlines and commercial price points afflicting SDD. Everyone at CSL knew from the start, Lampson recalled later, that the Dorado would be “entirely impractical as a product.” But if the commercial marketplace was not prepared to spend the money to get one, they certainly were. The Dorado would be the biggest and best Time Machine ever.</p>
<p class="para">负责监督这项必将创下纪录的工程项目的是塞韦罗·奥恩斯坦。奥恩斯坦性格严肃而热情，他的专业履历包括与韦斯·克拉克合作开发 LINC 以及在 Bolt、Beranek &amp; Newman 为 ARPANET 建造第一台 IMP 的关键角色。他的黑胡子和浓眉让他看起来像圣经中的先知，但隐藏着艺术家的气质。他是职业音乐家的儿子——在哈佛大学读本科时，他曾短暂地考虑过攻读音乐学位，但最终选择了地质学。无论如何，他那敏感的性格非常适合 CSL 严苛的环境<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch22.html.page321"></a>在那里，他那句“<span class="italic">胡说！</span> ”变成了和查克·塔克的“胡说！”一样熟悉的狩猎叫声。尽管他是由艾尔金德招募到 CSL 的，但他固执而严谨的思想很快赢得了鲍勃·泰勒的支持，后者很快邀请他加入自己的核心圈子——灰胡子。</p><p class="para">The man assigned to oversee what was sure to be a record-breaking engineering project was Severo Ornstein. A solemn and intense individual whose professional resume included critical roles in the development of the LINC with Wes Clark and the construction of the first IMPs for the ARPANET at Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman, Ornstein’s black beard and beetling eyebrows gave him the stern mien of a biblical prophet but masked an artist’s temperament beneath. He was the son of professional musicians—as a Harvard undergraduate he had briefly dallied with the idea of taking a music degree before settling instead on geology. In any case, his prickly temperament fit well into CSL’s unforgiving environ<a></a>ment, where his barked “<span class="italic">Nonsense!</span>” became as familiar a hunting call as Chuck Thacker’s “Bullshit!” Although he had been recruited to CSL by Elkind, his stubborn and rigorous mind rapidly won over Bob Taylor, who soon invited him into his inner circle, the Greybeards.</p>
<p class="para">Ornstein 在硬件项目方面拥有丰富的经验，因此他自然而然地成为了 Dorado 项目负责人，尽管他对这项工作的严谨评估让同事们对该项目规模感到不安。“我说过，这个项目需要两年时间，需要十个人，”他回忆道。“这是其他人谈论的两倍。”</p><p class="para">Ornstein’s long experience with quixotic hardware projects made him a natural to head up the Dorado effort, even if his tough-minded assessment of the job made his colleagues uneasy about the scale of the undertaking. “I said it would take two years and ten people,” he recalled. “That was twice what anyone else was talking about.”</p>
<p class="para">有一天，兰普森把他拉到一边，试图劝说他。“听着，塞韦罗，我知道你是对的，”他说。“但如果你告诉人们需要多长时间，他们就不会开始。你必须对他们撒谎。”几乎可以想象奥恩斯坦会如何爆发性地回答：“<span class="italic">胡说！</span> ”事实上，他的估计是正确的。</p><p class="para">One day Lampson took him aside for an attempt at jawboning. “Look, Severo, I know you’re right,” he said. “But if you tell people how long it’ll take they’ll never start it. You have to lie to them.” One could almost imagine Ornstein’s eruptive reply: “<span class="italic">Nonsense!</span>” In the event, his estimate was right on the money.</p>
<p class="para">与 MAXC（体积更大但预计不会量产）和 Alto（虽然量产但体积较小）相比，建造 Dorado 带来了新的物流问题。由于 Coyote Hill 没有空间容纳装配线，Ornstein 在距离汉诺威街约一英里的地方租了另一栋建筑，后来被称为“车库”。</p><p class="para">Building the Dorado presented new logistical issues compared with MAXC, which was physically a bigger machine but was not expected to be mass-produced, or the Alto, which was mass-produced but small. Since there was no room for an assembly line on Coyote Hill, Ornstein rented another building about a mile away on Hanover Street, which became known as the “Garage.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">CSL 工程师对制造 Dorado 的执着助长了 Notetaker 团队朝相反方向发展的倾向。鉴于 CSL 决心通过制造比 Alto<span class="italic">更大的</span>机器来颠覆 Dynabook 概念，“我们还要很长时间才能拥有 Dynabook，”Goldberg 有一天说。“让我们做一些介于 Alto 和 Dynabook 之间的事吧。”</p><p class="para">The CSL engineers’ fixation on building the Dorado helped fuel the Notetaker team’s inclination to go in the opposite direction. Given CSL’s determination to pervert the Dynabook concept by building a machine <span class="italic">bigger</span> than the Alto, “it’ll be a long time before we have the Dynabook,” Goldberg said one day. “Let’s do something that’s between the Alto and the Dynabook.”</p>
<p class="para">后来，她开始将 Notetaker 视为供孩子们在学校使用的电子笔记本。这个想法非常巧妙：它不仅为他们提供了一个可以效仿的范例，还确定了机器的物理尺寸。“这告诉我们它必须足够轻，便于随身携带，这样孩子们就可以用它在课堂上记笔记，然后带回家和学校，”Tesler 说道。</p><p class="para">In time she came to think of the Notetaker as an electronic notebook for kids to use in school. The idea was doubly ingenious: It not only gave them a paradigm to shoot for, but also established the machine’s physical dimensions. “That told us it had to be light enough to carry around so the kids could use it to take notes in class, then bring it home and back to school,” Tesler observed.</p>
<p class="para">“阿黛尔想到了 eMate，”他补充道，指的是一所小型学校<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch22.html.page322"></a>面向笔记本电脑的 Apple Computer 多年后生产，与 Kay 最初的 Dynabook 草图有着惊人的相似之处。<span class="sup">*</span> “她知道它必须比 eMate 重一些，但她希望它不会像它实际的那样，重 45 磅，比孩子还重。”</p><p class="para">“Adele had in mind the eMate,” he added, referring to a small school<a></a>oriented laptop Apple Computer manufactured years later which bore a striking resemblance to Kay’s original Dynabook sketches.<span class="sup">*</span> “She knew it had to be somewhat heavier than the eMate, though she was hoping it wouldn’t turn out to be what it did, which was forty-five pounds, heavier than the kid.”</p>
<p class="para">1976 年至 1978 年间，Dorado 和 Notetaker 项目并行不悖，但发展方向却截然相反。Dorado 规模庞大，其巨大的物理力量有时甚至压倒了 Garage 的质量控制努力。</p><p class="para">Between 1976 and 1978 the Dorado and the Notetaker projects proceeded along parallel but antithetical courses.

<p class="para">一位技术人员回忆道：“由于电流无限大，电路板很容易着火。我们看到好几块电路板真的烧起来了。风扇的功率非常大，你根本看不到烟从哪里冒出来。你可以闻到烟味，知道出了什么大问题，但你却说不出来。所以你必须关掉机器，把电路板拉出来才能发现问题。”</p><p class="para">Recalled one technician, “It was easy to set a circuit board on fire because you had this unlimited amount of current. We saw several just literally burn up. The fans were so powerful you couldn’t see where the smoke was coming out. You could smell it, and you knew that there was something seriously wrong, but you couldn’t tell. So you had to shut the machine off and pull the boards to find out.”</p>
<p class="para">一天，他和一位合伙人一起工作时，发现一块电路板冒出一缕烟，于是他靠近机器，想找出烟的来源。突然，十几个小电容器像燃烧弹一样爆炸了。技术人员倒在地上。当这些设备不再从墙上弹跳时，他们站起来，小心翼翼地查看这块出错的电路板。他们意识到，这些电容器安装反了。它们一直像微型定时炸弹一样滴答作响，直到强大的电流最终将它们和电路板炸成碎片。</p><p class="para">One day, working with a partner, he spotted a wisp of smoke coming off a board and leaned into the machine to pinpoint its source. Suddenly a dozen little capacitors went off like incendiary bombs. The technicians hit the floor. When the devices ceased ricocheting off the walls, they got to their feet and gingerly eyeballed the errant board. The capacitors, they realized, had been installed backwards. They had been ticking away like tiny time bombs until the powerful current finally blew them and the board to pieces.</p>
<p class="para">与此同时，凯伊团队的重点并不是如何通过他们的机器泵送燃烧电流，而是如何让它在电流和最小、最轻的现有部件的帮助下充分运行。</p><p class="para">Kay’s group, meanwhile, focused not on how to pump an incendiary current through their machine, but how to make it run adequately on an electrical trickle and with the smallest and lightest components available.</p>
<p class="para">道格·费尔贝恩（Doug Fairbairn）以首席硬件设计师的身份加入了该项目，他知道英特尔长期以来一直为 PARC 提供内存芯片，现在刚刚推出了一款单片处理器 ​​8086。（这是英特尔 x86/奔腾系列微处理器的前身，如今大多数计算机都采用这种处理器）<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch22.html.page323"></a>个人电脑。）在 Tesler 的帮助下，他设计出了一个由三台 8086 芯片作为整台机器大脑的设计。他们订购了英特尔生产线上生产的第一批芯片，并很快发现了产品中的缺陷，这让制造商非常沮丧。</p><p class="para">Doug Fairbairn, who had joined the effort as chief hardware designer, was aware that Intel, which had long provided PARC with memory chips, had just introduced a processor-on-a-chip, the 8086. (This was the precursor of Intel’s x86/Pentium line of microprocessors, which today power most <a></a>personal computers.) With Tesler’s help, he worked out a design in which three 8086’s would serve as the brains of the entire machine. They ordered the first chips Intel produced off the production line and promptly discovered a bug in the product, much to the manufacturer’s dismay.</p>
<p class="para">“他们说，‘我们上周才把 8086 交给你！你怎么能马上报告错误？’”特斯勒回忆道。但英特尔没有考虑到 PARC 的 DIY 心态。几年前，该实验室购买了一台价值数百万美元的罕见机器，称为 Stitchweld，它可以在一夜之间根据 Thacker 的 SIL 程序准备的数字原理图制作出印刷电路板。“结果发现，其他使用 8086 的人都没有 Stitchweld。其他人都在进行复杂的电路板设计，所以他们几个月都不知道是否有错误。但在施乐，我们在几天内就给了他们反馈。”</p><p class="para">“They said, ‘We just gave you the 8086 last week! How could you report a bug already?’”, Tesler recalled. But Intel had not reckoned with PARC’s do-it-yourself mentality. Years earlier the lab had purchased a rare million-dollar machine known as a Stitchweld, which could turn out printed circuit boards overnight from a digital schematic prepared on Thacker’s SIL program. “It turned out that no one else using the 8086 had Stitchwelds. Everyone else was going through complicated board designs, so they wouldn’t know for months if there was a bug. But at Xerox we gave them that feedback in a few days.”</p>
<p class="para">将所有东西塞进便携箱仍然是他们面临的最大挑战，因为他们不想在 PARC 机器的任何技术特性上吝啬。Notetaker 拥有一个定制的显示屏，对角线长度为 7 英寸，配有触摸屏（代替鼠标）；立体声音频扬声器和内置麦克风；128,000 字节主内存；可充电电池；以及以太网端口。</p><p class="para">Cramming everything inside a portable case remained their biggest challenge, for they did not intend to skimp on any of the technical features that made PARC machines distinctive. The Notetaker was to have a custom-built display with a seven-inch diagonal measurement and a touch-sensitive screen (to substitute for the mouse); stereo audio speakers and a built-in microphone; 128,000 bytes of main memory; a rechargeable battery; and an Ethernet port.</p>
<p class="para">事实上，后者尤其令人头痛。当然，没有它是不可能的——PARC 不可能生产出一台不联网的计算机，就像它不可能再使用电动打字机一样。但将一块标准的以太网板（现在拥有 80 多个芯片）装入 Notetaker 狭窄的内部空间也同样是不可能的。</p><p class="para">The latter, in fact, proved to be a particular headache. There was no question of going without it, of course—PARC could no more turn out a non-networked computer than it could go back to using electric typewriters. But fitting a standard Ethernet board—now boasting more than eighty chips—into the Notetaker’s cramped interior was equally out of the question.</p>
<p class="para">有一天，特斯勒穿过街道来到 34 号楼的 SDD 办公室，向以太网的发明者鲍勃·梅特卡夫讲述了这个难题。</p><p class="para">One day Tesler crossed the street to SDD’s quarters in Building 34 and laid the dilemma before Ethernet’s inventor, Bob Metcalfe.</p>
<p class="para">他问道：“为什么需要这么多筹码？”</p><p class="para">“Why does it take so many chips?” he asked.</p>
<p class="para">梅特卡夫耐心地解释了标准以太网板上每个芯片的功能以及每个芯片不可或缺的原因。特斯勒反驳说，可以丢弃大量电路而不会损害以太网的基本可操作性。他告诉梅特卡夫，虽然 PARC 的每个人都专注于高性能系统，但外面正在形成一个新的计算机设计世界。PARC 将不得不做出调整。</p><p class="para">Metcalfe patiently explained the function of every chip on the standard Ethernet board and why each was indispensable. Tesler countered that plenty of the circuitry could be discarded without undermining Ethernet’s basic operability. While everybody at PARC had their heads stuck in their high-performance systems, he told Metcalfe, a new world of computer design was taking shape on the outside. PARC was going to have to adjust.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch22.html.page324"></a>
<p class="para">特斯勒对此事的看法近乎异端。他指的是业余爱好者市场，这个市场确实正在蓬勃发展。1977 年 4 月举行的第一届西海岸计算机博览会吸引了来自整个湾区的数千名年轻狂热者。这些是认真的业余爱好者，他们用邮寄订购的套件组装了名为 Altair 和 PET 的计算机，并在每个周末聚集在一起，在 Homebrew 计算机俱乐部等聚会上交换快捷方式和软件。</p><p class="para">Tesler’s views on the matter approached the heretical. He was referring to the hobbyist market, which was indeed exploding. The first annual West Coast Computer Faire, held in April 1977, had attracted thousands of young fanatics from all over the Bay Area. These were serious amateurs who built computers named Altair and PET out of kits ordered by mail, and gathered every weekend to swap shortcuts and software at gatherings like the Homebrew Computer Club.</p>
<p class="para">他们着迷于计算机的小玩意，就像上一代人着迷于业余无线电一样。然而，多年来，他们的思维方式与那些在 PARC 学习计算机的人仍然格格不入。但 Tesler 是少数熟悉这一领域的 PARC 工程师之一，他已经看到他们知道很多 PARC 需要学习的东西。他们找到了将功能从硬件转移到软件的新方法，并偷工减料以节省资金和空间。不能将他们视为玩玩具的孩子：他们的计算机可以正常<span class="italic">工作</span>。</p><p class="para">They were enchanted with computing’s gadgetry as an end in itself, just as a previous generation had been with their ham radio sets. For many years yet their mindset would remain alien to those who had learned their computing at PARC. But Tesler, one of the few PARC engineers familiar with this niche, already saw they knew plenty that PARC would need to learn. They had found new ways to move functions out of hardware into software and to cut corners to save money and space. It wouldn’t do to dismiss them as kids playing with toys: Their computers <span class="italic">worked</span>.</p>
<p class="para">“我不认为以太网板上的所有芯片都是必需的，”他告诉梅特卡夫。“这些 PC 人员之所以能把他们的电脑做得如此便宜，是因为他们采用了所有这些技巧。我们应该开始做同样的事情。”</p><p class="para">“I don’t think the chips are all necessary on the Ethernet board,” he told Metcalfe. “These PC guys make their computers so cheap because they go through all these tricks. We ought to start doing the same.”</p>
<p class="para">“就是他们，”梅特卡夫回答道。“我们的电路板必须完美运行。”</p><p class="para">“That’s them,” Metcalfe replied. “Our boards have to work perfectly.”</p>
<p class="para">“也许如此，但我们的电脑单是零件就价值一两万美元，而他们的电脑<span class="italic">售价</span>仅为一百美元。我们想做一款便宜的便携式电脑，每块主板只能容纳二十五个芯片。”</p><p class="para">“Maybe so, but our computers are worth ten to twenty thousand dollars in parts alone and they <span class="italic">sell</span> theirs for a hundred buck. We’re trying to do a cheap portable computer and we only have room for twenty-five chips on each board.”</p>
<p class="para">“那你就永远做不到以太网了，”梅特卡夫回答道。“你必须等待以太网集成电路的出现，而这至少还要五年的时间。”</p><p class="para">“Then you’ll never do Ethernet,” Metcalfe replied. “You’ll have to wait for the Ethernet integrated circuit, which is at least five years away.”</p>
<p class="para">“我们等不及了，”特斯勒回答道。</p><p class="para">“We can’t wait,” Tesler replied.</p>
<p class="para">然后他再次穿过马路，开始证明梅特卡夫是错的。特斯勒和费尔贝恩将以太网设计压缩得像拧干一块湿海绵一样，通过将更多的工作分摊给软件，将其压缩到 24 个芯片，这比梅特卡夫认为的要多。结果是一块电路板勉强跟上每秒 3 兆比特的 PARC 以太网——但它确实适合 Notetaker。（“梅特卡夫很喜欢它，”特斯勒回忆道。“但他已经在为 SDD 开发 10 兆比特的以太网，所以这与他正在做的任何事情都无关。”）</p><p class="para">Then he recrossed the street and set about proving Metcalfe wrong. Tesler and Fairbairn compressed the Ethernet design as you might wring out a damp sponge, working it down to twenty-four chips by shunting more of the work to software than Metcalfe thought possible. The result was a board that just barely kept up with the three-megabit-per-second PARC Ethernet—but that did fit inside the Notetaker. (“Metcalfe loved it,” Tesler recalled. “But he was already working on the ten-megabit Ethernet for SDD, so it wasn’t relevant to anything he was doing.”)</p>

<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch22.html.page325"></a>
<p class="para">1978 年，车库实验室推出了第一台 Dorados，并获得了广泛赞誉。参与过之前所有 CSL 硬件项目的 Ed Fiala 评价道：“Dorado 是 PARC 制造的唯一一台真正出色的计算机。”Alto 的速度甚至在当时也算慢，而 Dorado 以任何当代标准来看都是速度恶魔。“所有老旧的 Alto 软件在 Dorado 上运行得如此之快，以至于我因为没有等待而头疼，”Jim Morris 回忆道。“突然间，我第一次意识到，<span class="italic">我就是</span>瓶颈。”</p><p class="para">The Garage rolled out the first Dorados in 1978 to conspicuous acclaim. “The Dorado was the only really great computer that PARC built,” judged Ed Fiala, who had played a role in every previous CSL hardware project. Where the Alto had been slow even for its time, the Dorado was a speed demon by any contemporary standard. “All the funky old Alto software ran on the Dorado so fast I got headaches from not waiting,” Jim Morris recalled. “Suddenly I realized that for the first time, <span class="italic">I’m</span> the bottleneck.”</p>
<p class="para">对于一台时间机器来说，Dorado 的价格也相对便宜。摩尔定律开始真正发挥其威力：这台机器的零件成本仅为 50,000 美元左右，却能提供三台强大的数字设备公司 VAX-11/780 工作站的计算资源，而 1980 年每台工作站的售价为 500,000 美元。</p><p class="para">For a Time Machine, the Dorado was also relatively inexpensive. Moore’s Law was beginning to make its power known in earnest: The machine cost only about $50,000 in parts while delivering the computing resources of three powerful Digital Equipment Corporation VAX—11/780 workstations, which sold for $500,000 each in 1980.</p>
<p class="para">这台机器的强大功能几乎动摇了其创造者的信念，他们认为自己正在打造一台供个人使用的设备。“很难将 Dorado 视为一台个人机器，因为它消耗 2,500 瓦的电力，大小与冰箱相当，每分钟需要 2,000 立方英尺的冷却空气，”Thacker 后来说道。但这毕竟是时间机器的本质。尽管 Dorado 功能强大，但他仍然相信，五年或十年内，个人用户将可以在桌面上使用同等规模的设备，而他是对的。</p><p class="para">The machine’s power almost shook its creators’ faith that they were building something for individuals to use. “It was difficult to think of the Dorado as a personal machine, since it consumed 2,500 watts of power, was the size of a refrigerator, and required 2,000 cubic feet of cooling air per minute,” Thacker said later. Yet that, after all, was the essence of the Time Machine. Potent as the Dorado was, he was still confident that something on the same scale would be available on a desktop to the individual user within five or ten years, and he was right.</p>
<p class="para">与此同时，CSL 的程序员们开始着手解决 Alto 速度和内存限制的问题。Deutsch、Teitelman 和其他几个人已经编制了一份“愿望清单”，列出了理想编程系统所需的所有功能。令他们高兴的是，Dorado 功能强大，可以将所有这些功能整合到一个他们称之为“Cedar”的系统中。</p><p class="para">Meanwhile the CSL’s programmers plunged into work that had been stymied by the Alto’s limitations of speed and memory. Deutsch, Teitelman, and several others had already compiled a “wish list” of desirable features of an ideal programming system. To their delight, Dorado was powerful enough to incorporate them all into a system they called “Cedar.”</p>
<p class="para">Cedar 结合了 Mesa 和 Smalltalk 的最佳功能。它提供了前者的工业强度和清晰度，允许一个人编写的程序被其他人理解和阐述，同时又不放弃后者的图形灵活性或其精巧的功能，例如“垃圾收集”——这是一种内务管理功能，通过自动清除程序不再需要的数据占用的内存空间来更有效地使用内存。</p><p class="para">Cedar combined the best features of Mesa and Smalltalk. It offered the former’s industrial strength and clarity, which allowed programs written by one person to be understood and elaborated on by others, without giving up the latter’s graphical flexibility or its nifty features such as “garbage collection”—a sort of housekeeping function that used memory more efficiently by automatically clearing memory space occupied by data a program no longer needed.</p>
<p class="para">尽管性能有所提升，但 Dorado 还是存在一些重大缺陷。首先，它无法与人类共存于办公室<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch22.html.page326"></a>机器对电力的贪婪需求使其像烧烤炉一样散发热量，而风扇发出的噪音令人难以想象。为了让机器足够安静以适合办公室使用，设计师尝试将其装在一个非常笨重的箱子里，这个箱子被戏称为“装甲运兵车”。但塞在里面的隔音材料只会使系统运行更热，这会使风扇工作更辛苦，从而产生更多的噪音和热量，形成无休止的恶性循环。</p><p class="para">For all its performance enhancements, the Dorado did have a few significant flaws. For one thing, it could not coexist in an office with a human <a></a>being. The machine’s voracious appetite for electricity made it radiate heat like a barbecue pit, while the fans created an unimaginable din. In an attempt to make the machine quiet enough for an office, the designer tried housing it in a case so bulky it was nicknamed the “armored personnel carrier.” But the sound-insulating material stuffed inside only made the system run hotter, which made the fans work harder, which created more noise and heat in an endless, vicious circle.</p>
<p class="para">“它们在办公室里产生的暖气非常高效，以至于那个人几乎只能穿着内衣工作，”PARC 的一名技术员查尔斯·索辛斯基回忆道。最终他们想出了一个解决方案，将 Dorados 从办公室里全部撤走，将 20 台机器放在一个空调<span class="italic">很好</span>的房间里，通过电缆将它们连接到各个办公室的终端、键盘和鼠标上。</p><p class="para">“They were such an efficient heater in the office that the guy just about had to work in his underwear,” recalled Charles Sosinski, a PARC technician. Eventually they hit upon the solution of removing the Dorados from the offices altogether, stowing twenty machines together in a single, <span class="italic">very</span> well air-conditioned room from which they were linked by cable to the terminals, keyboards, and mice in individual offices.</p>
<p class="para">但这些技术问题从未平息人们对快速、强劲机器的强烈需求。</p><p class="para">But these technical problems never quelled the furious demand for the swift and robust machines.</p>
<p class="para">“人们会说，‘我可以在一小时内完成我的工作，而使用 Alto 则需要一整天的时间，’”Sosiaski 回忆道。自从 CSL 地下车间生产出两台绰号为 Bilbo 和 Gandalf 的典型 Altos 以来，PARC 首次出现了计算机不够用的情况。即使在全面生产开始后，车库每年也只能生产出不超过 10 到 15 台 Dorado；1982 年，只有 30 台 Dorado 还在生产。一些初级科学家，尤其是那些不在 CSL 青睐的职位上的科学家，只能重温分时计算的糟糕旧时光。“很长一段时间内，很难得到 Dorado，”Diana Merry 回忆道。“当我们编写 Smalltalk-80 时，我不得不深夜才来，因为这是得到一台 Dorado 来工作的唯一方法。”</p><p class="para">“People would say, ‘I could get my work done in an hour, and it would take me all day on an Alto,’” Sosiaski remembered. For the first time since a couple of prototypical Altos nicknamed Bilbo and Gandalf emerged from CSL’s basement shop, there were not enough computers at PARC to go around. Even after full-scale production began, the Garage was able to turn out no more than ten or fifteen Dorados a year; in 1982 there were still only thirty in existence. Some junior scientists, especially those outside the favored halls of CSL, were reduced to reliving the bad old days of time-sharing. “It was very hard to get Dorados for quite a long time,” recalled Diana Merry. “When we were writing Smalltalk-80 I would have to come in late at night, because that was the only way to get one to work on.”</p>
<p class="para">几乎与 Dorado 同时，Notetaker 的第一台原型机也完工了。Kay 立刻称其为一次胜利。Notetaker 缺乏 Dorado 的强大动力，但其敏捷性弥补了这一缺陷。</p><p class="para">Almost simultaneously with the Dorado, the first Notetaker prototype was completed. Kay immediately termed it a triumph. What it lacked in the Dorado’s overwhelming power it made up for with a sort of bantam-scale élan.</p>
<p class="para">Notetaker 运行的是 Smalltalk-76 的精简版，其巧妙的物理设计被六年后第一代所谓的“便携式”计算机毫不掩饰地模仿。合上后，这台计算机看起来就像一个鼓鼓囊囊的塑料公文包。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch22.html.page327"></a>通过翻转两个闩锁，可以像打开一个裂开的鸡蛋一样将其横着打开。屏幕和磁盘驱动器位于较大的部分，当盒子平放在桌子上时，面向用户。键盘是第二个较小的部分的一部分，通过柔性电缆连接到第一个部分。</p><p class="para">The Notetaker ran a compact version of Smalltalk—76 and boasted an ingenious physical design that would be shamelessly mimicked by the first generation of so-called “luggable” computers six years later. When closed the computer looked like a plump plastic attaché case. One <a></a>opened it cross-sectionally, like a cracked-open egg, by flipping two latches. The screen and disk drive were set in the larger piece, facing the user when the box was laid flat on a table. The keyboard was part of the second, smaller section, connected to the first by a flexible cable.</p>
<p class="para">Notetaker 用螺栓重新固定成一个整体，可以携带，尽管需要很大的力气。用内置手柄提起它会使塑料外壳变形。“我们过去常说它每块运行一次就会有五个突出部分，”凯开玩笑说。为了避免外壳破裂，将价值一万美元的部件像从湿纸袋中倒出的杂货一样倒在地上，特斯勒和费尔贝恩制造了一个滚动推车，还可以勉强将其滑入客机座位下。一天，费尔贝恩带着原型机去罗切斯特进行展示，在飞行途中用电池启动了它，因此成为第一个在飞机上操作个人电脑的人——这是众多在 35,000 英尺高空工作电子公路战士中的第一个。</p><p class="para">Bolted back into one piece, the Notetaker could be carried, albeit with great effort. Lifting it by the built-in handle strained the plastic case until it warped. “We used to say it ran at five herniations per block,” Kay joked. To avoid rupturing the case and dumping ten thousand dollars’ worth of components on the ground like groceries out of a wet paper bag, Tesler and Fairbairn built a rolling cart that also allowed them to slide it, just barely, under the seat of an airliner. One day Fairbairn, bringing the prototype to Rochester for a show-and-tell, fired it up on its batteries in midflight, therefore becoming the very first person to operate a personal computer on an airplane—the first of a legion of electronic road warriors wired to their work at 35,000 feet.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">Dorado 和 Notetaker 还有一个共同点。它们是 PARC 第一代科学家在 PARC 开展的最后几个重大项目。1978 年至 1982 年间，Dorado 几乎完全取代了 Alto，成为 PARC 内部的首选计算机，并引起了外部客户的大量兴趣。但除了小批量的 Garage 之外，施乐从未批准过任何其他装配线。到了 1983 年，一系列戏剧性事件导致 Dorado 失去了设计团队，并使其成为技术孤儿。</p><p class="para">The Dorado and the Notetaker shared one other distinction. They were the last major projects undertaken at PARC by the scientists of its first generation. Between 1978 and 1982 the Dorado almost entirely replaced the Alto as the computer of choice inside PARC, and elicited numerous expressions of interest from customers on the outside. But no assembly line other than the low-volume Garage was ever approved by Xerox. Come 1983, a series of dramatic events would strip the Dorado of its design team and render it a technological orphan.</p>
<p class="para">学习研究小组制造了 10 台 Notetaker，并像往常一样试图让施乐对该产品产生兴趣，但徒劳无功。特斯勒花了一年多的时间飞往全国各地向部门高管展示原型。但 PARC 在斯坦福或罗切斯特的影响力已经明显减弱。“施乐高管做出了各种承诺，”特斯勒说。“我们会购买 20,000 台，只需与弗吉尼亚州的这位高管交谈，然后再与康涅狄格州的这位高管交谈。一年后，我准备放弃了。”</p><p class="para">The Learning Research Group manufactured ten Notetakers and tried in vain, as usual, to interest Xerox in the product. Tesler spent the better part of a year flying around the country displaying the prototype to division executives. But whatever influence PARC ever had in Stamford or Rochester had visibly drained away. “Xerox executives made all sorts of promises,” Tesler said. “We’ll buy 20,000, just talk to this executive in Virginia, then talk to this executive in Connecticut.’ After a year I was ready to give up.”</p>
<p class="para">在最后一台 Notetaker 建成后不久，Alan Kay 宣布他将休一个承诺已久的假。对于 Kay 来说，这个项目的兴奋感已经让位于他熟悉的绝望感。Notetaker<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch22.html.page328"></a>它与他曾经用来展示 Dynabook 的旧纸板模型非常相似。但他不安分的性格使他关注的不是它有多接近，而是它的不足之处。他表面上对创造新机器的喜悦掩盖了他真正的失望，因为它在重量和尺寸上的妥协再次“挤掉了它最初针对的最终用户”——也就是孩子们。</p><p class="para">Soon after the last Notetaker was built, Alan Kay announced that he was taking a long-promised sabbatical. For Kay the project’s exhilaration had already yielded to his familiar feelings of despair. The Notetaker was <a></a>enticingly similar to the old cardboard model he had once used to illustrate the Dynabook. But his unquiet nature was to focus not on how close it came but on where it fell short. His outward glee at creating a new machine masked his real disappointment at how its compromises on weight and size had once again “squeezed out the end-users for whom it was originally aimed”—that is, the children.</p>
<p class="para">南加州向他招手。他有了一位新女友邦妮·麦克伯德 (Bonnie MacBird)，两人是在她研究一部关于电脑奇才的剧本时相识的，她住在洛杉矶。（经过好莱坞高管们的不断修改，这部剧本最终成为电影<span class="italic">《电子世界争霸战》</span>，该片于 1982 年上映，当时凯和麦克伯德结婚两年。“我们喜欢说，婚姻比电影好得多，”他说。）他宣布自己将暂时搬到洛杉矶上风琴课。他再也没有回到 PARC。</p><p class="para">Southern California beckoned. He had a new girlfriend, Bonnie MacBird, who he had met while she was researching a screenplay about computer wizards and who lived in Los Angeles. (After endless tinkerings by Hollywood executives this screenplay became the movie <span class="italic">Tron</span>, which came out in 1982, two years after Kay and MacBird were married. “We like to say the marriage turned out a lot better than the movie,” he said.) He announced he was temporarily relocating to L.A. to take organ lessons. He never returned to PARC.</p>
<p class="para">在他离开后，阿黛尔·戈德伯格 (Adele Goldberg) 接手了团队。她是合乎逻辑的选择，就像英格尔斯 (Ingalls) 一样，她是一位冠军实施者，她通过指导 Smalltalk 的下一个版本 Smalltalk-80 得以完成。几年后，她与另一位团队成员戴夫·罗布森 (Dave Robson) 编写了权威的 Smalltalk 教科书。</p><p class="para">Adele Goldberg took over the group after his departure. She was the logical choice, like Ingalls a champion implementer, as she proved by shepherding the next version of Smalltalk to completion—Smalltalk—80. A few years later with Dave Robson, another team member, she wrote the definitive Smalltalk textbook.</p>
<p class="para">但是，没有了凯，学习研究小组的创意源泉，情况就大不相同了。“他离开后，我们就像被掏空了心一样，”梅里回忆道。“他离开后不久，我们又举办了一次 Pajaro Dunes 异地活动。我记得那次活动非常令人难过，那是艾伦不在时举办的第一场 Pajaro Dunes 活动。我们非常想念他。从很多方面来说，这真的是许多美好事物的终结。”</p><p class="para">But the Learning Research Group was a very different place without Kay, its font of ideas. “It was like getting our heart cut out when he left,” Merry recalled. “It wasn’t too long after he left that we had another Pajaro Dunes offsite. I remember that being very sad, the first Pajaro Dunes when Alan wasn’t there. We missed him very badly. It really was in many ways the end of a lot of the good stuff.”</p>
<p class="para">其余的人又坚持了几年，完成了旧项目。有些人开始寻找新的挑战。拉里·特斯勒厌倦了自己徒劳无功地试图让施乐公司对 Notetaker 产生兴趣，只等着一个信号来决定他何时何地离开。</p><p class="para">The rest of them hung on for another couple of years, finishing old projects. Some started looking for new challenges. Larry Tesler, fed up by his fruitless quest to interest Xerox in the Notetaker, was awaiting only a sign of when and where he should go.</p>
<p class="para">1979 年的一天，当一位硅谷传奇人物走进 PARC 的前门时，这个标志出现了。</p><p class="para">That sign appeared one day in 1979, when a Silicon Valley legend in the making walked through PARC’s front door.</p>

<p class="para">苹果电脑联合创始人访问 PARC 的经历是个人电脑的开创性传奇之一，据说他从那里萌生了后来让苹果 Macintosh 声名鹊起的想法，就像大卫和歌利亚的故事或老鼠和受伤爪子的狮子的寓言一样充满戏剧性和影响。它包含足够的素材来为不止一家公司，而是两家公司——施乐和苹果——创造神话。如果要证明它的重要性，只需看看这个事实：迄今为止，没有两个人对这一事件的回忆是完全一样的。</p><p class="para">The Apple Computer co-founder’s visit to PARC, from which he reputedly spirited off the ideas that later made the Apple Macintosh famous, is one of the foundation legends of personal computing, as replete with drama and consequence as the story of David and Goliath or the fable of the mouse and the lion with an injured paw. It holds enough material to serve the mythmaking of not one corporation but two, Xerox and Apple. If one seeks proof of its importance, one need look no further than the fact that to this date no two people involved in the episode recollect it quite the same way.</p>
<p class="para">对于 PARC 的编年史家来说，这带来了独特的困难。PARC 历史上没有哪件轶事像它这样背负着如此多的矛盾证词。乔布斯的到访及其后果的集体记忆如此生动，以至于一些前 PARC 科学家不再确定他们是否亲自到场，还是后来才听说的。PARC 工程师和他们来自苹果的客人彼此之间（以及他们自己之间）对谁做了演示的哪一部分、有多少次演示以及演示何时进行、乔布斯和他的团队是否看到过这些事情意见不一。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch23.html.page330"></a>Alto 还是 Dorado；史蒂夫·乔布斯是否迫切希望了解 PARC 的技术，或者他对大公司生产的任何产品都持怀疑态度，所以需要有人哄骗他前往。</p><p class="para">For a chronicler of PARC this presents a unique difficulty. No anecdote from PARC’s history is burdened by so much contradictory testimony. The collective memory of the Jobs visit and of its aftermath is so vivid that some former PARC scientists are no longer sure whether they were there themselves, or just heard about it later. PARC engineers and their guests from Apple disagree with each other (and among themselves) about who delivered which portions of the demonstration; on how many demos there were and when they took place; whether Jobs and his people saw <a></a>an Alto or a Dorado; and whether Steve Jobs was desperate to get a look at PARC’s technology, or so dubious about anything produced by a big corporation that he had to be wheedled into going in the first place.</p>
<p class="para">其中一些差异是由于演示的拼凑性质造成的。“没有人知道发生的一切，因为没有人一直都在场，”拉里·特斯勒说，他比大多数人都更亲身参与了演示。</p><p class="para">Some of these discrepancies result from the demo’s patchwork nature. “Nobody knows everything that happened, because there’s nobody that was there all the time,” says Larry Tesler, who was present for more of it than most.</p>
<p class="para">除了阿黛尔·戈德堡 (Adele Goldberg)，没有人能确定乔布斯演示的最终真相。不过，她同意特斯勒的观点，即几乎任何人都很难确定演示的最终真相。她认为乔布斯演示就像八个盲人摸象的故事，每个人抚摸的是同一头大象的不同部位：“在人们的记忆中，有这么多双眼睛盯着这头大象，这真是难以置信。这真是让我震惊。有时我不得不说，‘我是对的！因为我一直都是那里唯一的人！’”</p><p class="para">Nobody, that is, except Adele Goldberg, who nevertheless agrees with Tesler that it is difficult for almost anyone to have a lock on the demo’s ultimate truth. She thinks of the Jobs demo in terms of the story about the eight blind men and the elephant, each one stroking a different part of the same animal: “It’s unbelievable to me the number of eyes on this elephant in people’s memories. It just astounds me. Sometimes I just have to go, ‘I’m right! Because I was the only one there all the time!”</p>
<p class="para">有些前后矛盾是苹果的神话，而不是 PARC 的神话。史蒂夫·乔布斯和他的团队认为 PARC 是一块被浪费的无价之宝，这一观点旨在说明乔布斯无与伦比的敏锐洞察力和施乐的愚钝。作者写道：“你可以进行汉莎航空抢劫，也可以进行火车大劫案……最狡猾的伎俩是苹果在白天突袭施乐帕洛阿尔托研究中心。”也许更想宣传苹果的英雄愿景，而不是了解真正发生的事情。</p><p class="para">Some inconsistencies are the product of Apple’s mythmaking rather than PARC’s. The idea that Steve Jobs and his troops saw in PARC a priceless, squandered gem aims to say as much about Jobs’s peerless perspicacity as Xerox’s obtuseness. The author who wrote, “You can have your Lufthansa Heist, your Great Train Robbery…the slickest trick of all was Apple’s daylight raid on the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center” perhaps desired more to promote a heroic vision of Apple than to get at what really happened.</p>
<p class="para">然而，我们有可能解决所有这些问题，并重建一个从未完整讲述过的故事。首先回答最明显的问题：有两次单独的演示，而不是一次，第二次演示涵盖了所有最机密的材料。它们发生在 1979 年 12 月。这台电脑几乎肯定是 Alto，主要演示者是 Goldberg、Tesler、Dan Ingalls 和 Diana Merry。史蒂夫·乔布斯最初对 PARC 可能提供的东西持怀疑态度，但他让工程师说服了他。至于乔布斯的敏锐度，他后来承认，他在 PARC 看到了三个令人眼花缭乱的创新，但第一个是如此令人眼花缭乱，以至于他忽视了第二个和第三个的重要性。</p><p class="para">Yet it is possible to resolve all these accounts and reconstruct a story that has never before been told in its entirety. To take the most obvious questions first: There were two separate demonstrations, not one, and the second covered all the most secret material. They occurred in December 1979. The computer was almost surely an Alto and the principal demonstrators were Goldberg, Tesler, Dan Ingalls, and Diana Merry. Steve Jobs was initially skeptical of what PARC might have to offer but allowed his engineers to convince him otherwise. As for Jobs’s acuity, he later admitted that he was shown three mind-bending innovations at PARC, but the first one was so dazzling it blinded him to the significance of the second and third.</p>
<p class="para">也许最重要的是，史蒂夫·乔布斯的演示并不是苹果的一个随机事件或运气，就像有时被描述的那样。苹果的<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch23.html.page331"></a>工程师们知道他们要做什么。他们煞费苦心地为这一刻做好了计划，来到 PARC 时做好了充分的准备，能够提出正确的问题并解读答案。事实上，著名的乔布斯演示的种子早在八个月前就已经精心种下。</p><p class="para">Perhaps most important, the Steve Jobs demo was not a random event or a stroke of luck for Apple, as it has sometimes been portrayed. Apple’s <a></a>engineers knew what they were after. They had taken great pains to plan for the moment, and they arrived at PARC fully prepared to ask the right questions and interpret the answers. The seed of the famous Jobs demo, in fact, had been carefully planted eight months earlier.</p>
<p class="para">那是 1979 年 4 月 2 日在西好莱坞日落大道 9200 号的一栋办公楼里举行的一次会议。主办方是施乐开发公司，这是一家独特的小公司，其运营独立于斯坦福总部。</p><p class="para">The occasion was a meeting on April 2, 1979, in an office building at 9200 Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood. The host was Xerox Development Corporation, a unique little fiefdom that operated with great independence from the headquarters in Stamford.</p>
<p class="para">史蒂夫·乔布斯是典型的反主流文化企业家，他当时正向企业巨头施乐提出交易。他知道施乐希望投资苹果，而苹果即将上市，这是当时最令人期待的股票发行之一。乔布斯愿意让施乐参与其中，作为交换，乔布斯可以使用施乐的技术（具体是什么技术，他还不太清楚）以及施乐的营销知识。</p><p class="para">Steve Jobs, the quintessential countercultural entrepreneur, was there to offer the corporate behemoth of Xerox a deal. He knew Xerox desired to invest in Apple, which would soon go public in one of the most eagerly anticipated stock offerings of the era. Jobs was willing to let the company in on the ground floor in return for access to Xerox technology—just what technology, he was not yet quite sure—and to Xerox’s marketing knowledge.</p>
<p class="para">施乐开发公司负责人已经习惯听到这样的宣传。XDC 成立的目的是对小型科技公司进行战略投资，它的存在就像是亚伯拉罕·扎雷姆 (Abraham Zarem) 的私人游乐场，这位才华横溢但令人讨厌的高管就是他。施乐收购阿贝·扎雷姆博士的方式与收购马克斯·帕列夫斯基的方式相同：收购他的公司。对于扎雷姆来说，这家公司是位于帕萨迪纳的光电系统公司，顾名思义，该公司从事包括激光在内的尖端光学技术的研究。当施乐于 1962 年收购 EOS 时，乔·威尔逊 (Joe Wilson) 预测，十年内，该公司的大部分利润将来自此类新技术。这从未发生过，但此次收购确实使扎雷姆成为施乐最大的股东，直到七年后被帕列夫斯基取代。那时，施乐对扎雷姆将 EOS 转变为主要政府承包商的昂贵且徒劳无功的尝试感到失望，正在寻找让他开心但又分心的方法。答案是成立一个风险投资部门并让他负责。XDC 就这样诞生了。</p><p class="para">This was the sort of pitch the principals of Xerox Development Corporation were used to hearing. Formed for the purpose of making strategic investments in small technology companies, XDC existed as a sort of personal playground for a brilliant but rather irksome executive named Abraham Zarem. Xerox had acquired Dr. Abe Zarem the same way it got Max Palevsky: by purchasing his company. In his case it was Pasadena-based Electro-Optical Systems, which, as its name implied, did research in leading-edge optical technologies, including lasers. When Xerox bought EOS in 1962, Joe Wilson predicted that within a decade most of the corporation’s profits would come from such new technologies. That never happened, but the acquisition did turn Zarem into Xerox’s single largest shareholder, a distinction he held until dislodged by Palevsky seven years later. By then Xerox, disenchanted with Zarem’s costly and fruitless attempts to transform EOS into a major government contractor, was searching for away to keep him happy but distracted. The answer was to create a venture unit and place him in charge. Thus was XDC born.</p>
<p class="para">尽管 Zarem 有种种缺点，但他在将技术从实验室转移到商业市场的艰难过程中经验丰富；这就是他一开始就将 EOS 变成有吸引力的收购目标的原因。到 1979 年，他看到同样熟悉的<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch23.html.page332"></a>当 PARC 的工作出现问题时，他决定插手。他的想法是将技术转交给一家年轻、有抱负、成本结构适中的公司——这家公司不会无休止地犹豫一项有前途的创新是否适合其传统的产品线，而是会直接向前迈进（同时向施乐支付专利费）。比如说，苹果这样的公司。</p><p class="para">For all his faults, Zarem was an experienced hand at the difficult process of moving technology from the laboratory to the commercial marketplace; that was how he had made EOS into an attractive acquisition target in the first place. By 1979, seeing that the same familiar <a></a>issues had sprung up around PARC’s work, he resolved to stick his nose in. His idea was to turn the technology over to a young, hungry company with a modest cost structure—one that would not dither endlessly about whether a promising innovation would fit into its tradition-encrusted product line but would simply march ahead (while paying Xerox royalties). A company, say, like Apple.</p>
<p class="para">这个想法并非完全不切实际。苹果公司发展势头强劲。苹果公司由乔布斯和他的高中同学史蒂夫·沃兹尼亚克在硅谷车库里创立，并成功实现了产品线从沃兹小型个人电脑的套件版本向功能更丰富的版本 Apple II 的过渡。这台机器在业余爱好者市场上独树一帜。它出厂时已经组装好，配有键盘（尽管需要单独的显示器）。在乔布斯出现在 Zarem 团队面前后不久，苹果公司开始将其与 VisiCalc 捆绑销售，VisiCalc 是一款独特的软件程序，被称为财务电子表格——一款“杀手级应用”，它一手将 Apple II 变成了一款受欢迎的商务工具。</p><p class="para">The idea was not wholly implausible. Apple was coming on strong. Started in the proverbial Silicon Valley garage by Jobs and his high school classmate Steve Wozniak, Apple had successfully negotiated the transition in its product line from kit versions of Woz’s little personal computer to a more versatile version, the Apple II. This machine was unique in the hobbyist market. It came already assembled, with a keyboard (although it required a separate monitor). Shortly after Jobs’s appearance before Zarem’s group, Apple started bundling it with VisiCalc, a unique software program known as a financial spreadsheet—a “killer app” that would single-handedly turn the Apple II into a popular businessman’s tool.</p>
<p class="para">1978 年，苹果公司员工不足 40 人，但已成为被称为风险投资家的小型投机私人投资者群体中最抢手的投资对象之一。1979 年夏天，该公司通过“夹层”融资筹集了 700 万美元，这通常是一家公司向公众出售股票前的最后一次私募，16 位买家包括一些美国最著名的机构投资者。如果不是乔布斯的一位顾问最终赢得了一场旷日持久的争论，施乐几乎肯定会被拒之门外。</p><p class="para">With fewer than forty employees in 1978, Apple was already one of the most sought-after investments among the small community of speculative private investors known as venture capitalists. When the company raised $7 million in “mezzanine” financing during the summer of 1979, traditionally one of the last private offerings before a company sells stock to the public, the sixteen buyers included some of the most protuinent institutional investors in the country. Xerox would almost surely have been shut out, had not one of Jobs’s advisors finally won a long-standing argument.</p>
<p class="para">这位顾问是杰夫·拉斯金 (Jef Raskin)，他是一位才华横溢的计算机工程师和艺术家，加入苹果公司帮助设计 Apple II。拉斯金知道，苹果创始人对大企业的低评价源自沃兹尼亚克在惠普担任工程师的经历，当时他提出的个人电脑项目提案遭到老板的拒绝。拉斯金回忆说，这件事“从此成为他们心理动机的一部分”。“乔布斯反复告诉我（以及他能联系到的任何人），像施乐这样的大公司做不出任何有趣的事情。”</p><p class="para">The advisor was Jef Raskin, a talented computer engineer and artist who had joined Apple to help design the Apple II. Raskin knew that the Apple founders’ low opinion of big business was the product of Wozniak’s experience as an engineer at Hewlett-Packard, where his proposal for a personal computer project had been rebuffed by his bosses. The incident “ever after remained part of their psychological motivation,” Raskin recalled. “Jobs repeatedly told me (and anybody else he could get hold of) that a large corporation like Xerox couldn’t do anything interesting.”</p>
<p class="para">但拉斯金有朋友在 PARC 工作。在他们的邀请下，他曾在 Coyote Hill Road 上观看了令人眼花缭乱的新技术的诞生。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch23.html.page333"></a>在筹集夹层融资时，乔布斯说服了乔布斯。当施乐公司要求加入交易时，乔布斯提出了自己的建议：作为邀请 PARC 的条件，他将以每股 10.50 美元的价格向该公司出售 10 万股私人股票。XDC 同意支付 105 万美元，由此建立了高科技历史上最不可能的联盟之一（尽管持续时间最短）。</p><p class="para">But Raskin had friends working at PARC. At their invitation, he had watched dazzling new technologies take shape on Coyote Hill Road. <a></a>Around the time the mezzanine financing was being assembled, he won Jobs over. When Xerox asked to be included in the deal, Jobs made his pitch: In exchange for an invitation to PARC, he would sell the corporation 100,000 private shares at $10.50 each. XDC agreed to fork over the $1.05 million, and one of the unlikeliest—if shortest-lived—alliances in high technology history was forged.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">如果说史蒂夫·乔布斯对大公司一直心存疑虑，那么苹果电脑在大多数 PARC 工程师眼中几乎是无足轻重的。这些工程师都是博士，曾参与过世界上一些最大的计算机项目；而苹果电脑则是一群捣鼓者。当时的“个人电脑”是业余爱好者的工具包，这些装置的名字包括 Altair 和 Commodore PET，它们被拆开，让 16 岁的孩子们往上面滴焊料，直到它们开始工作，这通常会让他们自己都感到惊奇，因此他们可以花上几个小时盯着作为输出显示器的闪烁红灯。真是个笑话！闪烁的灯在 20 世纪 50 年代随 Whirlwind 电脑一起消失；它们与 PARC 对计算的定义（带有图形程序和位图显示的 Altos）一样重要，就像弗林特时代的遗物一样。Coyote Hill 的普遍看法是苹果的客户是在浪费时间。他们不太聪明，都是自学成才，他们的机器只是玩具。</p><p class="para">If Steve Jobs harbored an enduring mistrust of big companies, Apple Computer was scarcely a blip on the radar screen of most PARC engineers. They were Ph.D.s who had worked on some of the biggest computing projects the world had ever seen; Apple was a bunch of tinkers. The “personal computers” of the day were hobbyists’ kits, contraptions with names like the Altair and the Commodore PET that arrived in pieces for sixteen-year-olds to drip solder on until something started to work, usually to their own amazement, so they could spend hours staring at the blinking red lights that served as output displays. What a joke! Blinking lights had gone out with the Whirlwind computer in the 1950s; they were as relevant to PARC’s definition of computing—Altos with graphics programs and bitmapped displays—as were relics of the Flint Age. The general opinion on Coyote Hill was that Apple’s customers were a waste of time. They were not very sharp, they were self-taught, and their machines were toys.</p>
<p class="para">至少，从未见过史蒂夫·乔布斯的人的反应是这样的。那些认识他的人对他的印象更深刻，但往往不那么好。</p><p class="para">Such, at least, was the reaction of people who had never met Steve Jobs. Those who had made his acquaintance came away with a stronger, and often less favorable, impression.</p>
<p class="para">这一时期的乔布斯——可以称之为“前阿玛尼时代”——衣冠不整，就像是荣誉勋章。他永远穿着蓝色牛仔裤，留着一撮似乎永远长不出来的黑胡子。他那薄薄的嘴唇上似乎挂着一丝心知肚明的笑容。自从他二十岁，纸面上一文不值以来，他的骄傲和蔑视就赤裸裸地展现出来。阻挠他，无论你是八年级辍学生还是电气工程博士，都无关紧要；他会把你的论点当成脱粒机刀片上的谷壳一样驳斥。</p><p class="para">The Jobs of this period—call it the “pre-Armani era”—wore scruffy like a badge of honor. He was perpetually clad in blue jeans, with a black beard that never seemed to grow in. His thin lips seemed locked in a knowing smirk. Ever since he was twenty years old and worth zero on paper he had worn his pride and contempt nakedly. Thwart him, and it scarcely mattered whether you were an eighth-grade dropout or a Ph.D. in electrical engineering; he would trash your arguments like they were so much chaff in the blades of a thresher.</p>
<p class="para">乔布斯的同事们给他贴了一个标签，说他对自己眼光和判断力的坚定信心。他们称之为“现实扭曲力场”。他<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch23.html.page334"></a>他生活在自己的世界观中，似乎主要是为了把它强加给别人而存在。他有一种让人无法忍受的傲慢和比同龄人老练的感觉。正是这些品质让他能够通过讲述他如何创立苹果的故事来吸引 XDC 经验丰富的投资者。这些品质，以及他在 24 岁时就已成为一家市值 7000 万美元的公司的董事长这一事实。</p><p class="para">Jobs’s associates had a label for his unyielding confidence in his own vision and judgment. They called it his “reality distortion field.” He <a></a>lived securely within his worldview and seemed to exist chiefly for the purpose of imposing it on others. He had a way of seeming at once intolerably brash and older than his years. Those were the qualities that enabled him to hold the experienced investors of XDC rapt by relating the story of how he had founded Apple. Those, and the fact that at the age of twenty-four he was the chairman of a company already worth $70 million.</p>
<p class="para">少数 PARC 工程师，如拉里·特斯勒，并没有让他们对苹果客户或乔布斯个性的先入之见蒙蔽了他们对这些小型计算机可能带来的发展方向的认识。特斯勒没有回避日益壮大的年轻黑客地下世界，而是一头扎了进去。一两年来，他一直参加诸如家酿计算机俱乐部会议之类的文化活动，年轻的 Altair 和 Commodore 用户会在那里交换他们的微型软件程序和知识。他对苹果并不陌生，曾和一位在苹果公司工作的女士约会过。“1978 年，我作为她的约会对象参加了苹果的野餐，当时有 30 名员工，”特斯勒回忆道。“那是在雷德伍德城的海洋世界，全体员工和孩子们围坐在四张野餐桌旁。”</p><p class="para">A small handful of PARC engineers, like Larry Tesler, had not allowed their preconceptions about Apple’s customers or Jobs’s personality to cloud their perception of where these little computers might lead. Rather than shun the growing underground of youthful hackers, Tesler dove in. For a year or two he had been attending such cultural events as meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club, where young Altair and Commodore users met to trade their tiny software programs and swap lore. He was no stranger to Apple, having gone out with a woman who worked for the company. “I’d been to an Apple picnic as her date in 1978, when there were thirty employees,” Tesler recalled. “It was at Marine-world in Redwood City and the entire staff, with kids, fit around four picnic tables.”</p>
<p class="para">特斯勒认为 PARC 的正统观念使其对这种另类文化视而不见。他还认为自己明白其中的原因。PET 和 Apple 并非 Alto 和 PARC 制造的几乎所有其他机器那样，是学术分时传统的纯正产物。它们源自完全不同的技术，即硅微处理器，即英特尔和摩托罗拉开发的所谓“芯片计算机”（Apple 长期以来都是围绕摩托罗拉芯片设计的，而后来出现的 IBM 兼容 PC 则基于英特尔版本）。正如他在 Notetaker 的设计阶段给鲍勃·梅特卡夫讲课时所说，他相信 PARC 可以向孩子们学习。事实上，<span class="italic">必须</span>这样做。他觉得，如果 PARC 不改变态度，总有一天它会回头看，发现自己已经过去了。</p><p class="para">Tesler thought PARC orthodoxy had blinded it to this alternative culture. He also thought he understood why. PETs and Apples were not the pedigreed offspring of the academic time-sharing tradition like the Alto and almost every other machine PARC had built. They had sprouted from an entirely different technology, that of the silicon microprocessor, the so-called “computer-on-a-chip” developed by Intel and Motorola (Apple would long be designed around the Motorola chip, while IBM-compatible PCs, which came later, would be based on the Intel version). As he had lectured Bob Metcalfe during the Notetaker’s design phase, he believed PARC could learn from the kids. In fact, <span class="italic">had</span> to. If PARC did not change its attitude, he felt, it was going to look back one of these days and discover it had been passed by.</p>
<p class="para">特斯勒的观点在 Coyote Hill 广为人知，1979 年末的一天，哈罗德·霍尔 (Harold Hall) 召集他到办公室参加秘密会议。特斯勒到达后发现自己参加了一个整洁的小聚会，其中包括比尔·冈宁 (Bill Gunning) 和罗伊·拉尔 (Roy Lahr)，后者是施乐公司的一名职员，曾被解雇<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch23.html.page335"></a>由阿贝·扎雷姆 (Abe Zarem) 负责密切关注乔布斯的情况。他们解释说，他们正在寻求有关如何进入个人电脑市场的建议，并听说特斯勒可能是理想的人选。</p><p class="para">Tesler’s opinion was well enough known on Coyote Hill that one day in late 1979 Harold Hall summoned him to a secret meeting in his office. Tesler arrived to find himself part of a tidy little gathering that included Bill Gunning and Roy Lahr, a Xerox functionary who had been dis<a></a>patched by Abe Zarem to keep a solicitous eye on Jobs. They explained that they were seeking advice on how to manage an entry into the personal computer market and had heard Tesler might be an ideal source.</p>
<p class="para">“你看，”拉尔透露，“我们已经投资了苹果。”</p><p class="para">“You see,” Lahr revealed, “we’ve invested in Apple.”</p>
<p class="para">“我说，‘太好了，’”特斯勒回忆道。“拉尔和冈宁解释说，施乐无法以足够低的成本制造出电脑来竞争，因为它的成本结构非常高。‘如果我们制造一个回形针，它将花费三千美元，’他们抱怨道。我同意。”</p><p class="para">“I said, ‘That’s great,’” Tesler recalled. “Lahr and Gunning explained that Xerox couldn’t build computers cheaply enough to compete because its cost structures were very high. ‘If we built a paper clip it would cost three thousand bucks,’ they complained. I agreed.”</p>
<p class="para">然后他们告诉特斯勒，他们的计划是让苹果为施乐公司生产电脑。</p><p class="para">Then they informed Tesler that their scheme was to get Apple to build computers for Xerox.</p>
<p class="para">“什么样的安排？”他问道。</p><p class="para">“Under what kind of arrangement?” he asked.</p>
<p class="para">“我们还不知道，”拉尔回答道。“但他们接受了我们的钱，条件是他们必须了解施乐帕洛阿尔托研究中心的情况。他们其实不需要钱，因为每个人都想加入苹果。但他们让我们投资。”</p><p class="para">“We don’t know yet,” Lahr replied. “But they took our money on condition they could see what was going on at Xerox PARC. They didn’t really need the money because everyone wanted in on Apple. But they let us invest.”</p>
<p class="para">特斯勒热衷于让苹果了解 PARC 内部情况，这使他在 Coyote Hill 成为明显的少数派，尤其是在系统科学实验室内，因为大部分 Smalltalk 软件仍然受到官方的严密保护。</p><p class="para">Tesler’s enthusiasm for giving Apple a look inside PARC placed him in a distinct minority on Coyote Hill, especially within the Systems Science Lab, where much of the Smalltalk software was still officially closely guarded.</p>
<p class="para">实验室分裂成对立的阵营，其成员资格主要取决于对施乐最终可能自行推出该技术的可能性的评估。几乎已经放弃的特斯勒认为没有理由不向苹果展示他们拥有的一切。阿黛尔·戈德堡仍然怀有希望，希望他们能在施乐的旗帜下将 Smalltalk 推向市场——或者至少施乐可能会让他们保留对他们多年来辛苦工作的部分控制权——但她有不同的看法。她坚定地认为，将 PARC 的知识产权披露给一支能够理解它、甚至更糟的是将其用于商业用途的工程师团队将是一个致命的错误。“我希望达成交易，”特斯勒观察到。“阿黛尔试图扼杀交易。” <span class="sup">*</span></p><p class="para">The lab fragmented into opposite camps, their membership largely based on how one assessed the chances that Xerox might eventually get around to bringing out the technology on its own. Tesler, who had all but given up, saw no reason not to show Apple everything they had. Adele Goldberg, who still cherished the hope that they might yet bring Smalltalk to market under the Xerox banner—or at least that Xerox might let them keep some control over the work they had slaved over for so many years—had a different view. She felt adamantly that disclosing PARC’s intellectual property to a team of engineers capable of understanding it and, worse, exploiting it commercially would be a mortal error. “I wanted a deal to happen,” Tesler observed. “Adele was trying to kill one.”<span class="sup">*</span></p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch23.html.page336"></a>
<p class="para">特斯勒并不是想让 Smalltalk 被广泛发布，戈德伯格也希望它保持秘密。问题更复杂，谁应该看到这项技术，以及在什么情况下可以看到。例如，戈德伯格很乐意向合法的企业客户展示 Smalltalk，这些客户愿意通过支付进一步开发费用来支持该小组的研究。</p><p class="para">It was not that Tesler wanted Smalltalk to be widely published and Goldberg wished it kept secret. The issue was the more complex one of who should see the technology and under what circumstances. Goldberg, for example, was happy to demonstrate Smalltalk to legitimate corporate clients who were prepared to help support the group’s research by paying for further development.</p>
<p class="para">大约一年前，她和特斯勒因向另一家对 Smalltalk 感兴趣的企业进行演示而分道扬镳。这家企业就是中央情报局。中央情报局在施乐公司特别信息系统部门的支持下，派遣了一支工程师团队前往 PARC，该部门向联邦政府出售定制系统。</p><p class="para">That had been the case about a year earlier, when she and Tesler ended up in opposing camps over a demo to another enterprise that expressed interest in Smalltalk. This was the Central Intelligence Agency. The CIA had sent a team of engineers to PARC under the auspices of Xerox’s Special Information Systems division, which sold customized systems to the federal government.</p>
<p class="para">戈德伯格对中情局对她的工作感兴趣感到欣慰。她认为，中情局是施乐的传统付费客户，多年来经常收到 Smalltalk 演示，而且其代表似乎“非常有趣和创新”。她认为，中情局对 Smalltalk 和 Dynabook 表现出的好奇心，不禁让这些技术及其发明者在施乐公司内部的可信度更高——而且，她后来表示，至少，参观 PARC 的中情局人员的需求与 Dynabook 订购和传达信息的功能完全契合。</p><p class="para">Goldberg was gratified by the CIA’s interest in her work. She viewed the agency as a traditional Xerox paying customer of the sort that routinely got Smalltalk demos over the years, and one whose representatives further seemed “remarkably interesting and innovative.” The agency’s manifest curiosity about Smalltalk and the Dynabook could not help but give those technologies and their inventors added credibility within Xerox, she figured—and at the very least, she said later, the CIA people touring PARC had needs that fit perfectly with the Dynabook’s capabilities for ordering and communicating information.</p>
<p class="para">相比之下，思想开明的特斯勒将中情局的来访视为一次伯克利式宣传的机会。中情局演示当天，他穿着风衣、戴着墨镜、戴着一顶拉到额头上的软呢帽来上班。然后，他整天在 PARC 的食堂和会议室里徘徊，怒视来访者，这让他的同事们觉得很有趣。</p><p class="para">By contrast, the liberal-minded Tesler treated the CIA visit as a chance for Berkeley-style agitprop. The day of the agency demo he came to work wearing a trenchcoat, dark glasses, and a fedora pulled down over his brow. Then he spent the day hanging around the PARC commissary and conference rooms glowering at the visitors, much to the amusement of his own co-workers.</p>
<p class="para">特斯勒认为苹果与众不同，因为它不太可能将 Smalltalk 用于邪恶目的；戈德堡认为苹果与众不同，因为它很可能会成为施乐的竞争对手，而不是客户。无论如何，在辩论初期就清楚的一件事是，乔布斯团队展示什么和展示多少并不由 PARC 决定。工程师可以决定如何进行演示，但施乐总部已经下令，无论如何，它都会发生。</p><p class="para">Tesler thought Apple was different because it was unlikely to put Smalltalk to nefarious use; Goldberg thought it was different because it was likely to become a Xerox competitor rather than a customer. In any case, one thing that became clear early in the debate was that the decision of what and how much to show Jobs’s team did not rest with PARC. The engineers could decide how to stage the demo, but Xerox headquarters had decreed that one way or another, it was going happen.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch23.html.page337"></a>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">乔布斯后来表示，12 月初的一天，他和团队抵达 PARC 时，并没有对那里的景象抱有太大期望。“我以为那将是一个有趣的下午，”他说。“但我对将会看到什么却没有概念。”</p><p class="para">Jobs later maintained that he harbored few expectations about what he would be shown at PARC when he arrived with his team one day early in December. “I thought it would be an interesting afternoon,” he said. “But I had no real concept of what I’d see.”</p>
<p class="para">他所看到的只是学习研究小组所知道的经过删节的展示。乔布斯看到了 Alto、鼠标、Bravo 和其他几种 CSL 技术，以及 Smalltalk 中有限数量的无害图形应用程序。</p><p class="para">What he did see was as bowdlerized a show-and-tell as the Learning Research Group knew how to deliver. Jobs saw the Alto, mouse, Bravo, and several other CSL technologies, as well as a limited number of innocuous graphical applications in Smalltalk.</p>
<p class="para">“这就像是一个文字处理器和绘图工具的演示，展示了当时的工作情况，”戈德堡多年后回忆道。“没有造成任何损害，也没有问题。他们所看到的，每个人都看到了。他们与我们进行的对话，每个人都看到了。没有理由不这样做，这很好。”</p><p class="para">“It was very much a here’s-a-word-processor-there’s-a-drawing-tool demo of what was working at the time,” Goldberg recalled years later. “No harm done, no problem. What they saw, everyone had seen. The conversation they had with us, everyone had. There was no reason not to do it, it was fine.”</p>
<p class="para">乔布斯离开时，似乎对自己这次经过精心打磨的参观感到满意。但他很快发现，自己被剥夺了多少信息。两天后，他和随行人员回来了，准备进行第二次演示。霍尔感到困惑，于是把他们领进一间会议室，以便更好地了解他们希望了解的内容。戈德堡还没有上班，所以学习研究小组的特斯勒和戴安娜·梅里坐在那里。谈判很艰难。乔布斯坐在那里坐立不安，而苹果公司严厉的总裁迈克·斯科特则与霍尔进行了一轮高管演讲。</p><p class="para">Jobs left, apparently content with his sanitized tour. He quickly discovered, however, how much information had been denied him. Two days later he and his entourage returned, primed for a second demonstration. Bemused, Hall ushered them into a conference room to get a better idea of what they hoped to learn. Goldberg had not yet arrived for work, so Tesler and Diana Merry from the Learning Research Group sat in. The parley was a rocky one. Jobs sat fidgeting while Apple’s hard-nosed president, Mike Scott, engaged in a round of executive-speak with Hall.</p>
<p class="para">“我们进行了一段非常绕口令的对话，持续了大约四五分钟，而对于史蒂夫·乔布斯来说，这就像七个永恒一样，”特斯勒回忆道。突然间，过度活跃的乔布斯勃然大怒。</p><p class="para">“We were having this very beat-around-the-bush conversation that went on for about four or five minutes, which for Steve Jobs is like seven eternities,” Tesler recalled. Suddenly the hyperactive Jobs blew his top.</p>
<p class="para">“别再胡闹了！”他从椅子上跳起来，大声喊道。“保守这些秘密毫无意义。如果我们不互相交流，我们将一事无成。”他转向斯科特，命令道：“斯科特，告诉他们我们想要什么！”</p><p class="para">“Let’s stop this bullshit!” he cried, leaping from his chair. “There’s no point trying to keep all these secrets. We’ll never accomplish anything if we don’t talk to each other.” Turning to Scott, he ordered, “Scotty, tell them what we want!”</p>
<p class="para">斯科特做了一个恼怒的手势，好像他知道现在任何试图安抚乔布斯的尝试都是徒劳的。他深吸了一口气，但还没等他说出话来，乔布斯就打断了他的话：“我们必须告诉他们 Lisa 的事！”</p><p class="para">Scott gave an exasperated gesture, as if he knew that any attempt now to settle Jobs down would be pointless. He took a deep breath, but before he could get a word out Jobs interrupted, “We need to tell them about the Lisa!”</p>
<p class="para">苹果团队看上去很震惊。“好吧，告诉我为什么我们不能！”乔布斯<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch23.html.page338"></a>惊呼道。“这些家伙以为我们会制造出施乐电脑，而制造它需要花费一万美元。但我们都知道，我们希望他们能帮助我们制造 Lisa！”</p><p class="para">The Apple group looked stricken. “Well, tell me why we can’t!” Jobs <a></a>exclaimed. “These guys think we’re going to make the Xerox computer, which would cost ten thousand bucks to build. But we all know we want them to help us with the Lisa!”</p>
<p class="para">PARC 团队听得目瞪口呆。Lisa 这个名字以前从未出现过。甚至 Lahr 也感到困惑。最后有人问：“Lisa 是什么？”</p><p class="para">The PARC team listened in astonishment. Lisa was a name that had never come up before. Even Lahr seemed perplexed. Finally someone asked, “What’s Lisa?”</p>
<p class="para">一阵令人尴尬的沉默之后，一位苹果工程师无奈地解释道：“Lisa 是我们设计的一款办公电脑，采用位图屏幕和简单的用户界面。我们认为你们的一些技术将有助于让这台机器更易于使用。”</p><p class="para">After an uncomfortable silence, an Apple engineer explained with resignation, “Lisa is an office computer we’ve designed with a bitmapped screen and a simple user interface. We think some of your technology would be useful in helping make the machine easier to use.”</p>
<p class="para">特斯勒很着迷，这不仅仅是因为他自己的女儿名叫丽莎。苹果显然是在高度保密的情况下开发了这个项目——如此保密以至于它对自己的保姆罗伊·拉尔来说就像晴天霹雳。“它完全打乱了拉尔对这次会议的想法，”他非常开心地回忆道。特斯勒也知道苹果团队是正确的：Smalltalk 界面（他们尚未看到其中的部分）<span class="italic">将使</span>计算机更易于使用。他甚至有点高兴苹果现在强行提出这个问题。为什么不向他们展示 Smalltalk？如果施乐不打算销售个人电脑，为什么学习研究小组的所有工作都要白费呢？</p><p class="para">Tesler was fascinated, and not only because his own daughter’s name was Lisa. Apple had obviously developed this project in great secrecy—so great that it had come as a bolt from the blue to its own babysitter, Roy Lahr. “It completely threw in the air Lahr’s idea of what this meeting was all about,” he recalled with great amusement. Tesler also knew the Apple team was correct: The Smalltalk interface, parts of which they had not yet seen, <span class="italic">would</span> make computers easier to use. He was even a little pleased that Apple had now forced the issue. Why not show them Smalltalk? If Xerox was not going to market a personal computer, why should all the Learning Research Group’s work simply go to waste?</p>
<p class="para">当这场闹剧还在上演时，阿黛尔·戈德堡 (Adele Goldberg) 来上班，却发现史蒂夫·乔布斯 (Steve Jobs) 已经回到了公司。她既不觉得好笑，也不觉得好奇，反而觉得很愤怒。</p><p class="para">While this drama was still playing out, Adele Goldberg arrived for work, only to learn that Steve Jobs was back on the premises. She was neither amused nor intrigued, but incensed.</p>
<p class="para">“我来上班时，史蒂夫·乔布斯和整个 Lisa 编程团队（大约十人）都在会议室里。没有任何预兆。两天后。然后哈罗德·霍尔和罗伊·拉尔来到走廊，向我解释说我应该给他们做第二次演示。”</p><p class="para">“I come in to work and there was Steve Jobs and the entire Lisa programming team, ten of them or so, in the conference room. No warning. Two days later. Then Harold Hall came out in the hallway with Roy Lahr to explain to me that I’m supposed to give them a second demo.”</p>
<p class="para">“听着，阿黛尔，这没什么大不了的，”霍尔说。他提醒她，PARC 可以向乔布斯展示比他已经看到的更多的东西，而不必向他展示一切。PARC 的 Smalltalk 演示分为两个等级——机密（针对公司大人物和其他特别批准的 VIP）和非机密。“告诉特斯勒只给乔布斯常规的非机密简报，”霍尔说。“这会让他眼花缭乱，他永远不会知道他没有得到机密披露。”</p><p class="para">“Look, Adele, it’s no sweat,” Hall said. He reminded her that PARC could show Jobs more than he had already seen without necessarily showing him everything. There were two grades of Smalltalk demo at PARC—classified (for corporate bigwigs and other specially cleared VIPs) and unclassified. “Tell Tesler to just give Jobs the regular unclassified briefing,” Hall said. “It’ll dazzle him and he’ll never know he didn’t get the confidential disclosure.”</p>
<p class="para">戈德伯格的情绪稍微平复了一点。她勉强承认<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch23.html.page339"></a>如果演示符合 Hall 的规格，就不会造成太大的损害——<span class="italic">如果</span>……但是谁知道在苹果公司，精明的工程师们在大楼里再待一两个小时还能学到什么，他们还会坚持要展示多少东西？她内心深处对苹果公司被允许哄骗进入大楼感到沮丧。她同样指责 Hall 和 Lahr 缺乏技术知识，没有意识到向苹果公司（尤其是其专业程序员）展示任何东西的风险。</p><p class="para">Goldberg was mollified, but just barely. Begrudgingly, she admitted <a></a>that if the demo kept to Hall’s specifications, there would be little harm done—<span class="italic">if</span>. But who knew what else the savvy Apple engineers might pick up during another hour or two on the premises, and how much more they might insist on being shown? Deep down she was frustrated that Apple had been permitted to wheedle its way into the building in the first place. She blamed Hall and Lahr equally for lacking the technical savvy to understand the risks of showing Apple—especially its professional programmers—anything at all.</p>
<p class="para">“我们从来没有给其他公司的工程团队上过私人编程课，”她后来说。“也没有人告诉我这样做的理由。”</p><p class="para">“We had never, ever given a private programming lesson to another company’s engineering team,” she said later. “And no one informed me of any reason to do so.”</p>
<p class="para">然而，正如她所担心的那样，非机密演示仍然不够。霍尔刚回到办公室，电话就响了。电话里是斯坦福打来的，电话里是施乐公司业务规划小组负责人比尔·苏德斯，他怒不可遏。苏德斯直截了当地告诉霍尔，乔布斯想看什么就看什么，包括 Smalltalk 的全部内容。“你<span class="italic">必须</span>向乔布斯先生提供机密简报！”他大声说道。</p><p class="para">As she feared, however, the unclassified demo was still not enough. Almost as soon as Hall returned to his office, his phone rang. On the line directly from Stamford was a livid Bill Souders, the head of Xerox’s business planning group. Souders informed Hall bluntly that Jobs was to be shown whatever he wanted to see, up to and including all of Smalltalk. “You <span class="italic">will</span> give Mr. Jobs the confidential briefing!” he barked.</p>
<p class="para">霍尔感到很困惑。比尔·苏德斯对软件和编程环境的了解甚至比他还要少，不可能理解 PARC 专有技术的重要性。霍尔只能假设乔布斯不知何故当场发现自己被骗了——可能是特斯勒或团队中的其他人不明智地透露了他收到的另一份低质量简报——并从罗伊·拉尔那里得到了一些意见。拉尔可能直接向阿贝·扎雷姆提出了投诉，后者在康涅狄格州发动了大炮轰击 PARC，迫使其屈服。无论过程如何，它都以闪电般的速度发生。霍尔对苹果在施乐高层的影响力之高感到惊讶。</p><p class="para">Hall was mystified. Bill Souders, who knew even less than he did about software and programming environments, could not possibly understand the importance of PARC’s proprietary technology. Hall could only assume that Jobs had somehow discovered on the spot that he had been conned—possibly Tesler or someone else on the team had unwisely let drop that he was receiving another subpar briefing—and taken a piece out of Roy Lahr. Lahr presumably blitzed his complaint directly to Abe Zarem, who fired up the big guns in Connecticut to shell PARC into capitulation. Whatever the process, it had occurred with lightning speed. Hall marveled at how high up in the Xerox hierarchy Apple’s influence seemed to reach.</p>
<p class="para">尽管如此，霍尔还是忠实地遵循着公司指挥链，无论其中有多少环节是投机者和白痴。他回忆说，重要的是苏德斯的“权威是不容置疑的，他使用了军事命令式的语言。这和我在 1943 年接受基本训练时被告知‘你<span class="italic">必须</span>捡起那个烟蒂！’的情况一模一样。”</p><p class="para">Still, Hall was nothing if not a faithful follower of the corporate chain of command, no matter how many of the links were time-servers and idiots. The important thing, he recalled, was that Souders’s “authority was unmistakable and he used the military imperative language. It was exactly as in 1943 in basic training when I was told, ‘You <span class="italic">will</span> pick up that cigarette butt!’”</p>
<p class="para">他顺从地向演示团队传话说，他们要<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch23.html.page340"></a>乔布斯和他的工程师们受到了盛大的礼遇。戈德伯格惊呆了。她最可怕的噩梦正在展开：苹果公司关于什么能看什么不能看的来之不易的共识即将被打破。她气得满脸通红，眼泪汪汪地对霍尔说：“这太疯狂了！这是我听过的最愚蠢的话。”</p><p class="para">Obligingly, he passed word to the demo team that they were to give <a></a>Jobs and his engineers the full-dress treatment. Goldberg was stunned. Her worst nightmare was unfolding: The hard-won understanding about what Apple could and could not see was about to be breached. Turning red and teary with rage, she told Hall, “That’s nuts! It’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.”</p>
<p class="para">这只是开始。霍尔和拉尔护送她到霍尔的办公室，试图让她平静下来。这是一场艰苦的斗争，据她估计，这场斗争持续了大约三个小时。</p><p class="para">That was for starters. Hall and Lahr escorted her into Hall’s office to try to calm her down. It was an uphill struggle that lasted, by her estimation, about three hours.</p>
<p class="para">“我最后对哈罗德说，‘你犯了一个大错误，’”她回忆道。“‘你正在抛弃这家公司本身甚至没有机会考虑使用的东西。你必须命令我这么做，因为我不是自愿走进去的。’”</p><p class="para">“I finally said to Harold, ‘You are making a really big mistake,’” she recalled. “‘You are throwing away something that this company itself hasn’t had a chance to even consider using. And you’ll have to order me to do it, because I’m not walking in there voluntarily.’</p>
<p class="para">“他确实这么做了。”</p><p class="para">“And that’s what he did.”</p>
<p class="para">在此期间，梅里和特斯勒一直在试图用更多普通的演示来分散史蒂夫·乔布斯的注意力。他们几乎受够了乔布斯的不断哄骗，突然，阿黛尔·戈德堡又回到了现场。“我仍然记得她，”梅里回忆道。“她扎着辫子，脸红得像甜菜。她手里拿着我们的一个黄色磁盘包，上面有 Smalltalk。”</p><p class="para">Merry and Tesler had spent the intervening time trying to keep Steve Jobs distracted with more of the plain-vanilla demonstration. They had just about had it with his constant wheedling when, suddenly, Adele Goldberg arrived back on the scene. “I can still see her,” Merry recalled. “She was in pigtails and her face was red as a beet. And she was holding one of our yellow disk packs with Smalltalk on it.”</p>
<p class="para">演示开始了。Smalltalk 的全套演示令人叹为观止。有 Goldberg 编写的教育应用程序和 Tesler 的软件开发工具。Merry 演示了她的样稿编辑器，这是一个漂亮的程序，内置动画功能，用户可以将文本和图片合并到单个文档中。几乎每个程序都具有在任何地方的研究原型中从未见过的功能，更不用说在商业系统中了。“Smalltalk 有很多东西，”Tesler 回忆道。“你可以看三十遍，每次都能看到新的东西。”</p><p class="para">The demo began. A full-dress Smalltalk show-and-tell was a sight to behold. There were educational applications Goldberg had written and software development tools by Tesler. Merry demonstrated her galley editor, a nifty program with animation capabilities built in so that a user could incorporate text and pictures into a single document. Almost every program had capabilities that had never been seen in a research prototype anywhere, much less in a commercial system. “There was lots to Smalltalk,” Tesler remembered. “You could see it thirty times and see something new every time.”</p>
<p class="para">有趣的是——或者对戈德堡来说，不祥的是——苹果工程师们的专注程度。比尔·阿特金森是一位才华横溢的程序员，后来他在 Macintosh 上打下了独特的烙印，他的眼睛一直盯着屏幕，仿佛被磁场固定在那里。他站得如此之近，以至于当特斯勒进行他被分配的演示部分时，他能感觉到阿特金森的呼吸喷在他脖子后面。</p><p class="para">What was interesting—or to Goldberg, ominous—was the intensity with which the Apple engineers paid attention. Bill Atkinson, a brilliant programmer who would later put his distinctive stamp on the Macintosh, kept his eyes on the screen as though they were fixed there by a magnetic field. He was standing so close that as Tesler conducted his assigned portion of the demo he could feel Atkinson’s breath on the back of his neck.</p>
<p class="para">阿特金森显然做好了准备。“他问的是极其详细的信息<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch23.html.page341"></a>“他提出了很多巧妙的问题，而这些问题他单凭看屏幕是想不到的，”特斯勒回忆道。“后来才知道，他们读过我们发表的每一篇论文，演示只是提醒他们想问我们的问题。但我印象非常深刻。他们问了所有正确的问题，并理解了所有的答案。我很清楚，他们比施乐更了解我们的东西。”</p><p class="para">Atkinson had clearly come prepared. “He was asking extremely intel<a></a>ligent questions that he couldn’t have thought of just by watching the screen,” Tesler recalled. “It turned out later that they had read every paper we’d published, and the demo was just reminding them of things they wanted to ask us. But I was very impressed. They asked all the right questions and understood all the answers. It was clear to me that they understood what we had a lot better than Xerox did.”</p>
<p class="para">有了这种罕见的心灵鼓励，学习研究小组对他们的研究对象产生了兴趣。他们甚至沉迷于一些他们最喜欢的魔术。有一次，乔布斯看到一些文字以正常方式逐行滚动在屏幕上，他说：“如果它能像纸张一样流畅地逐像素移动，那就太好了。”</p><p class="para">Given this rare psychic encouragement, the Learning Research Group warmed to their subject. They even indulged in some of their favorite legerdemain. At one point Jobs, watching some text scroll up the screen line by line in its normal fashion, remarked, “It would be nice if it moved smoothly, pixel by pixel, like paper.”</p>
<p class="para">有了 Ingalls 的键盘，这就像要求新奥尔良爵士乐队演奏“Limehouse Blues”。他在一个显示几行 Smalltalk 代码的窗口上单击鼠标，做了一些小编辑，然后返回文本。<span class="italic">瞧！</span>滚动现在是连续的。</p><p class="para">With Ingalls at the keyboard, that was like asking a New Orleans jazz band to play “Limehouse Blues.” He clicked the mouse on a window displaying several lines of Smalltalk code, made a minor edit, and returned to the text. <span class="italic">Presto!</span> The scrolling was now continuous.</p>
<p class="para">苹果工程师们惊讶得瞪大了眼睛。在任何其他系统中，程序员都必须重写代码并重新编译程序的一大块，甚至可能是全部。这个过程可能需要几个小时。由于 Smalltalk 具有面向对象的模块化，如此小的更改从来不需要重新编译超过十到二十行的代码，这可以在一两秒钟内完成。“这基本上是瞬间完成的，”Ingalls 回忆道。当然，作为 Smalltalk 的创建者之一，他能够像本能一样做出改变，这很有帮助。“我们是敲钟人，”他坦言。“我们对这个系统了如指掌。”</p><p class="para">The Apple engineers’ eyes bulged in astonishment. In any other system the programmer would have had to rewrite the code and recompile a huge block of the program, maybe even all of it. The process might take hours. Thanks to its object-oriented modularity, in Smalltalk such a modest change never required the recompiling of more than ten or twenty lines, which could be done in a second or two. “It was essentially instantaneous,” Ingalls recalled. Of course, it helped that as one of Smalltalk’s creators he was able to make the change as though by instinct. “We were ringers,” he confessed. “We knew that system from top to bottom.”</p>
<p class="para">“他们完全被震撼了，”特斯勒证实道。“乔布斯挥舞着手臂，说：‘这家公司为什么还没有把这个产品推向市场？这是怎么回事？我不明白！’与此同时，其他人则试图忽略这些叫喊声。他们必须集中精力，在他们即将到达的这一小时内尽可能多地学习。”</p><p class="para">“They were totally blown away,” Tesler confirmed. “Jobs was waving his arms around, saying, ‘Why hasn’t this company brought this to market? What’s going on here? I don’t get it!’ Meantime the other guys were trying to ignore the shouting. They had to concentrate and learn as much as they could in the hour they were going to be there.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">Lisa 和 Macintosh 的诞生神话认为，史蒂夫·乔布斯在 PARC 令人眼花缭乱的技术的启发下，直接回到苹果总部，撕毁了一年来为 Lisa 用户界面所做的规划。乔布斯自己回忆说，那天下午他“疯疯癫癫地”回到办公室，坚称 Lisa<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch23.html.page342"></a>重新配置以复制 Alto 的动态显示。“那真是一个世界末日的时刻，”他说。“我记得在看到图形用户界面的十分钟内，我就知道每台计算机将来都会以这种方式工作。这太明显了。”</p><p class="para">The creation myth of the Lisa and Macintosh holds that Steve Jobs, in the grip of an epiphany brought on by PARC’s dazzling technology, headed straight back to Apple headquarters and ripped up a year’s worth of planning for the Lisa user interface. Jobs himself recalled how he returned to his office that afternoon “a raving maniac,” insisting the Lisa <a></a>be reconfigured to replicate the Alto’s dynamic display. “It was one of those apocalyptic moments,” he said. “I remember within ten minutes of seeing the graphical user interface stuff, just knowing that every computer would work this way some day. It was so obvious.”</p>
<p class="para">类似的事情确实发生了，但没有那么大的<span class="italic">轰轰烈烈</span>。 Smalltalk 界面的基本外观和功能（可以说是它的“外观和感觉”）确实在 Lisa 和 Macintosh 中得到了体现。</p><p class="para">Something of the sort did happen, but without quite so much <span class="italic">sturm und drang</span>. The essential appearance and functionality of the Smalltalk interface—its “look and feel,” so to speak—did become reflected in that of the Lisa and Macintosh.</p>
<p class="para">Lisa 的设计师中有很多都是从惠普古板的郊区搬来的，他们已经设计了图形用户界面，但他们的版本比 Alto 的版本静态得多。例如，他们的版本缺乏 Smalltalk 的动态重叠窗口，而是一次显示一个活动应用程序，在整个屏幕上进行对话。</p><p class="para">Lisa’s architects, many of them transplants from the staid purlieus of Hewlett-Packard, had already designed a graphical user interface, but their version was far more static than the Alto’s. Theirs lacked Smalltalk’s dynamic overlapping windows, for example, but rather displayed one active application at a time, talking up the whole screen.</p>
<p class="para">Lisa 最初也没有那么依赖鼠标。这是 Apple 内部激烈争论的话题。最初 Lisa 界面的主要指点设备是所谓的“软键”，它以菜单的形式出现在屏幕上，随时列出用户的命令选项：例如，如果活动应用程序是文本编辑器，它可能会提供<span class="italic">插入</span>和<span class="italic">删除</span>选项。用户使用键盘按键在屏幕上移动箭头来选择软键，然后按“Enter”键执行命令。鼠标可用，但很少使用，完全是可选的。</p><p class="para">Nor did the Lisa originally place as much reliance on the mouse. This was the subject of heated disagreement within Apple. The main pointing device of the original Lisa interface was something called a “softkey,” which appeared on the screen as a sort of menu listing the command options for the user at any given moment: If the active application was a text editor, for example, it might offer the choices of <span class="italic">insert</span> and <span class="italic">delete</span>. The user selected a softkey by using keyboard keys to move an arrow on the screens, then executed the command by striking “enter.” The mouse was available, but it was scantily used and entirely optional.</p>
<p class="para">比尔·阿特金森在演示过程中的专注力给特斯勒留下了深刻的印象，他花了几个月的时间尝试设计一个更具动态性的界面。但他无法解决几个编程问题，包括如何将文本写入屏幕不规则形状的区域——例如，一个窗口的一角从另一个窗口下方露出来。当然，这是丹·英格尔斯很久以前通过 BitBlt 解决的问题（但从未发表过）。阿特金森后来坚持认为，看到 Alto 屏幕上重叠的窗口对他来说更多的是一种信心的建立，而不是解决他的困境。他后来以自己的方式解决了同样的问题，但正如他后来所说，“那次旋风之旅给我留下了深刻的印象。知道它可以做到让我有能力发明一种可以做到的方法。”</p><p class="para">Bill Atkinson, whose intense concentration during the demo left such a strong impression on Tesler, had spent months trying to design a more dynamic interface. But he had been unable to solve several programming problems, including how to write text into an irregularly shaped region of the screen—for example, the corner of one window peeking out from beneath another. This, of course, was a problem Dan Ingalls had long since solved via BitBlt (but had never published). Atkinson later maintained that seeing the overlapping windows on the Alto screen was for him more a confidence-builder than a solution to his quandary. He subsequently solved the same problem in his own way but, as he later remarked, “That whirlwind tour left an impression on me. Knowing it could be done empowered me to invent a way it could be done.”</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch23.html.page343"></a>
<p class="para">演示还为他赢得了鼠标之战提供了必要的弹药。阿特金森认为，鼠标应该成为每台 Lisa 电脑的标准配置，而不是选配；只有这样，苹果才能确保软件开发人员始终将其作为系统不可或缺的一部分。在 PARC 之后，史蒂夫·乔布斯或其他任何人都不会再与他争论。<span class="sup">*</span></p><p class="para">The demo also gave him the necessary ammunition to win the battle over the mouse. Atkinson thought the device needed to be standard equipment on every Lisa, rather than an option; only then would Apple be sure that software developers would always deploy it as an integral part of the system. After PARC he no longer got an argument from Steve Jobs, or anyone else.<span class="sup">*</span></p>
<p class="para">另一方面，阿特金森发现 Smalltalk 存在许多缺点，他决心加以纠正。首先，它的速度非常慢，这是 Alto 轻量级内存和语言“解释”结构的产物，这给中央处理器带来了太多负担，超出了它可以轻松处理的范围。“系统性能下降了十倍，这很明显，”他回忆道。“对于商业应用来说，它的速度不够快。你会看到字符一个接一个地出现在屏幕上，就像在一个速度慢得令人痛苦的调制解调器上一样。”</p><p class="para">On the other hand, Atkinson discerned in Smalltalk numerous shortcomings he resolved to correct. For one thing, it was painfully slow, an artifact of the Alto’s lightweight memory and the language’s “interpreted” structure, which loaded the central processing unit with more work than it could comfortably handle. “The system was crippled by a factor of ten, and it showed,” he recalled. “It wasn’t fast enough for a commercial application. You would watch characters appear on the screen one by one, like on a agonizingly slow modem.”</p>
<p class="para">至于乔布斯，他已经“沉迷”于他所见的用户界面的强大功能，以至于忽略了向他展示的另外两个现象：面向对象编程（这是 Smalltalk 的精髓）和网络。在乔布斯演示时，PARC 有大约 200 台 Altos 连接到以太网，这一事实并没有给苹果团队留下深刻印象。无论是 Lisa 还是 Macintosh 的第一版都没有配备网络端口。（一个著名的故事是，乔布斯回答有关如何将 Mac 联网的问题时，向提问者扔了一张软盘，然后大喊：“这就是我的网络！”）</p><p class="para">As for Jobs, he was so “saturated” by the power of the user interface he had seen that he ignored the other two phenomena he was being shown: object-oriented programming, which was the essence of Smalltalk, and networking. The fact that PARC had some 200 Altos connected to the Ethernet at the time of the Jobs demo made no impression on the Apple team. Neither the Lisa nor the first versions of the Macintosh were equipped with network ports. (A famous story had Jobs answering a question about how to network the Mac by flinging a floppy disk at the questioner and barking, “There’s my fucking network!”)</p>
<p class="para">也许 PARC 对 Lisa 和 Macintosh 最重要的影响是精神层面的。Lisa 设计师在访问后的一个月左右制定的设计宣言可能完全出自艾伦·凯或拉里·特斯勒的头脑。“Lisa 必须使用起来很有趣，”它命令道。“它不会成为一个被人‘因为它是工作的一部分’或‘因为老板让他们这么做’的系统。必须特别注意用户交互的友好性和微妙之处，使使用 Lisa 变得有意义并丰富工作。”</p><p class="para">It may be that PARC’s most important influence on the Lisa and Macintosh was a spiritual one. A design manifesto the Lisa designers produced with a month or so of their visit could have sprung full-blown from the mind of Alan Kay or Larry Tesler. “Lisa must be fun to use,” it commanded. “It will not be a system that is used by someone ‘because it is part of the job’ or ‘because the boss told them to.’ Special attention must be paid to the friendliness of the user interaction and the subtleties that make using the Lisa rewarding and job-enriching.”</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch23.html.page344"></a>
<p class="para">尽管 PARC 对苹果产生了诸多影响，但从长远来看，苹果对 PARC 科学家本身的影响可能更为显著。他们一开始对乔布斯和他的客户不屑一顾，但他对他们工作的狂热热情却如闪电般击中了他们。这是一个强有力的信号，表明外界将欢迎他们在为冷漠的施乐公司辛勤工作的同时，在自己的宫殿里取得的一切成就。史蒂夫·乔布斯所做的不仅仅是打开了 PARC 思想的闸门。他开启了人才外流的时代。</p><p class="para">And for all the impact that the PARC had on Apple, over the long run Apple’s impact on the PARC scientists themselves may have been more pronounced. They had started out disparaging Jobs and his customers, but his fanatic enthusiasm for their work hit them like a lightning bolt. It was a powerful sign that the outside world would welcome all they had achieved within their moated palace while toiling for an indifferent Xerox. Steve Jobs did more than open the floodgates of ideas out of PARC. He started the exodus of human beings.</p>
<p class="para">拉里·特斯勒是第一批离开的人之一。在乔布斯来访之前的那个夏天，特斯勒游历了欧洲。在法国的一个乡村，他停下来让一位算命师给他算塔罗牌。“她只是一位有趣的法国老太太，她做了一堆预言，全都成真了。也许这些都是自我实现的预言。她告诉我我会在一年内辞职，而我在 11 个月后就辞职了。当时我简直不敢相信她。我说，‘但我有一份最好的工作……’但也许我已经准备好了。”</p><p class="para">Among the first to go was Larry Tesler. During the summer preceding Jobs’s visit, Tesler had traveled around Europe. In a rural French village he stopped to have his tarot read by a fortune teller. “She was just an interesting old French lady who made a bunch of predictions, all of which came true. Maybe they were self-fulfilling prophecies. She told me I’d leave my job within a year, and I left eleven months later. I couldn’t believe her at the time. I said, ‘But I have the very best job…’ But maybe I was ready.”</p>
<p class="para">1980 年初，乔布斯向施乐公司申请在 Lisa 中使用 Smalltalk 的许可。施乐公司出于对专有技术的骄傲，出乎意料地拒绝了他。（该公司已经剥离了其在苹果公司的股权，因此错过了这家电脑公司在 1980 年首次公开募股时市值大幅上涨的机会。）史蒂夫·乔布斯转而向 Smalltalk 的开发人员之一特斯勒提出了邀请。</p><p class="para">Early in 1980 Jobs asked Xerox for a license to use Smalltalk in the Lisa. In an unexpected burst of proprietary pride, Xerox turned him down. (The company had already divested its equity in Apple, thus missing out on the computer company’s extraordinary run-up in value at the time of its 1980 initial public stock offering.) Steve Jobs made his offer instead to Tesler, one of Smalltalk’s developers.</p>
<p class="para">特斯勒注意到了神秘的塔罗牌，于是在 4 月接受了这份工作。他后来领导了 Lisa 用户界面团队，并参与设计了 Macintosh，最终升任苹果首席科学家。他等待的迹象终于出现了。PARC 的精英主义开始显得陈旧，甚至有点反动。</p><p class="para">Heeding the mysterious tarot, Tesler accepted the job that April. He would go on to head the Lisa user interface team and to help design the Macintosh, eventually rising to the position of Apple’s chief scientist. The sign he was waiting for had come. PARC’s elitism had begun to seem threadbare, and even a little reactionary.</p>
<p class="para">“我记得有一次我对鲍勃·泰勒说，‘你知道，我一直在参加这些 Homebrew 计算机会议，我一直在与苹果公司的人交谈，并在个人电脑领域混迹。有很多聪明人将在个人电脑领域遥遥领先于 PARC。施乐公司永远也赶不上，即使有更好的产品。”</p><p class="para">“I remember once I said to Bob Taylor, ‘You know, I’ve been going to these Homebrew computer meetings and I’ve been talking to people at Apple and hanging out in the personal computer scene. There’s a lot of smart people out there who are going to run way ahead of PARC in PCs. Xerox will never catch up, even with better stuff.”</p>
<p class="para">“泰勒一边抽着烟斗一边说：‘不，这不会发生，因为我们这里有最聪明的人。我相信如果你拥有最聪明的人，你最终会领先。’</p><p class="para">“And Taylor smoked his pipe and said, ‘No, that’s not going to happen, because we have the smartest people here. I believe if you have the smartest people you’ll end up ahead.’</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch23.html.page345"></a>

<p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">早</span></span>在史蒂夫·乔布斯到来之前，PARC 就面临着痛苦变革的前景。麻烦即将来临的第一个迹象出现在 1978 年 5 月，当时正值当年在旧金山举行的年度公司会议之后。那个星期五，当施乐代表团已经返回东部时，乔治·帕克接到了杰克·戈德曼打来的电话。</p><p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">E</span></span>ven before Steve Jobs’s arrival on the scene PARC had been facing the prospect of wrenching change. The first sign that trouble lay ahead came in May 1978, just after that year’s annual corporate meeting in San Francisco. That Friday, when the Xerox contingent had already returned back East, George Pake got a phone call from Jack Goldman.</p>
<p class="para">就两人的职业生涯而言，这次通话几乎与八年前高盛向帕克提供管理一个独特的新研究中心的机会一样重要。但这次的杰克·高盛已经不同了。帕克的这位老导师远没有达到事业的顶峰，也没有掌握强大工业机器的所有资源，他听起来既害怕又抱怨。</p><p class="para">In terms of both men’s careers, it was almost as momentous a call as the one eight years earlier when Goldman had offered Pake the chance to manage a unique new research center. But this was a different Jack Goldman. Pake’s old mentor, far from being at the top of his game with all the resources of a powerful industrial machine at his command, sounded frightened and querulous.</p>
<p class="para">“乔治，”他说，“你周一一定要来康涅狄格。我得跟你谈谈。他们要夺走我的研究实验室。”</p><p class="para">“George,” he said, “you gotta be here in Connecticut on Monday. I gotta talk to you. They’re taking the research labs away from me.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">只要杰克·戈德曼在彼得·麦考洛的庇护下辛勤工作，他就会赢得与施乐文化和官僚机构的斗争，尤其是在早期关于将所有施乐研究成果集中在自己手中以及建立<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch24.html.page347"></a>帕洛阿尔托研究中心。但随着 20 世纪 70 年代“失去的十年”的过去，施乐公司越陷越深，高盛与董事长的距离越来越远，他的影响力也越来越小。正如麦考洛从福特公司招募高盛来重振施乐公司的研究一样，他引进了一批外部财务专家来更新公司糟糕的收入和支出结构。他们越来越掌控着公司。</p><p class="para">As long as Jack Goldman had toiled under the protective shade of Peter McColough he tended to win a fair share of his battles with Xerox culture and bureaucracy, especially the early crucial skirmishes over the consolidation of all Xerox research in his own hands and the establishment of <a></a>PARC. But as the lost decade of the 1970s wore on and Xerox sank deeper into its slough, Goldman’s distance from the chairman’s ear lengthened and his influence waned. Just as McColough had recruited Goldman from Ford to reanimate Xerox research, he had imported a group of outside finance experts to modernize the company’s ailing revenue and expense structures. More and more, they were in charge.</p>
<p class="para">事实证明，他们是一支僵化而自我延续的队伍。公司总裁阿奇·麦卡德尔 (Archie McCardell) 来自福特，他对数字的热情堪比古代数字命理学家，他从福特招募了曾经的上司吉姆·奥尼尔 (Jim O'Neill) 来领导信息技术集团。很快，其他三名福特人也加入了他们的行列，他们聚集在施乐管理层的最高层。到 1978 年初，戈德曼仍然是施乐董事会成员，但不再直接向彼得·麦科洛汇报。相反，他在组织阶梯中被降了三级，人数不敌新来者。</p><p class="para">They proved to be a stultifying and self-perpetuating cadre. Company President Archie McCardell, whose passion for figures rivaled that of the ancient numerologists, came from Ford, whence he recruited Jim O’Neill, who had once been his superior, to head the Information Technology Group. Soon they were joined by three other Ford men, clustered in the highest stratum of Xerox management. By the start of 1978 Goldman was still a member of Xerox’s board of directors, but no longer reported directly to Peter McColough. Instead he was sequestered three rungs down in the organizational ladder and outnumbered by the newcomers.</p>
<p class="para">他无法接受<span class="italic">事实上的</span>降职，也无法接受麦卡德尔和奥尼尔带来的陌生管理文化。当他目睹新人从远离权力中心的有利位置努力阻止施乐公司衰落却徒劳无功时，他变得更加暴躁。一位忠诚的支持者回忆道，杰克·戈德曼的气场开始消退，“他面对无能的领导时表现出的毫无疑问的粗鲁态度加速了这种气场，而这种无能的领导在施乐公司的高层中比比皆是。”</p><p class="para">He did not take well to the <span class="italic">de facto</span> demotion, nor to the alien management culture that McCardell and O’Neill had brought with them. As he witnessed the new men’s ineffectual struggle to stem Xerox’s decline from a vantage point hopelessly remote from the seat of power, he became more irascible. Jack Goldman’s aura was beginning to fade, one loyalist recalled, “accelerated by his indubitably abrasive manner in the presence of incompetence, which was abundant at the higher levels of Xerox.”</p>
<p class="para">这种对新任高管的评价有些不公平。许多人只是在错误的公司里担任了错误的职位。施乐需要采用激进的新技术来重振其产品线。但他们试图通过应用时髦的新管理理论和精打细算来榨干同样疲惫的复印机的最后一滴血。如果危机的根源仅仅是施乐的自满或糟糕的经济状况，他们的重组和削减成本战略可能会取得成果。但问题要深远得多。</p><p class="para">This was a somewhat unfair assessment of the new executives. Many were simply in the wrong place in the wrong company. Xerox needed to embrace radical new technologies to resuscitate its product lines. But they were trying to squeeze the last drops of blood from the same tired copiers by applying snazzy new management theories and pinching pennies. Had the crisis been rooted solely in Xerox’s complacency or a bad economy, their reorganizations and cost-cutting strategies might have borne fruit. But the affliction ran much deeper.</p>
<p class="para">或许，最能体现新技术专家与金融工程师之间冲突的，是迈伦·特里布斯（Myron Tribus）短暂而痛苦的职业生涯。他曾被高盛推荐担任高级副总裁。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch24.html.page348"></a>1972 年，他被任命为研究与工程总裁，但在 1974 年底前被奥尼尔赶下台。特里布斯脾气暴躁，曾任商务部官员和达特茅斯学院工程系主任。正如戈德曼所言，他也是“这个国家最杰出的工程师之一。他是个很难相处的人，当你和天才打交道时，这种情况经常发生，但他绝对是一位才华横溢的工程师。”</p><p class="para">Perhaps the best illustration of the conflict between the new technologists and the financial engineers was the short, bitter career of Myron Tribus, who was hired on Goldman’s recommendation as senior vice <a></a>president for research and engineering in 1972 and got driven out by O’Neill before the close of 1974. Crusty and temperamental, Tribus was a former Commerce Department official and dean of engineering at Dartmouth. He was also, as Goldman attested, “one of the most brilliant engineers in this country. A difficult guy to deal with, as is often the case when you’re dealing with geniuses, but an absolutely brilliant engineer.”</p>
<p class="para">特里布斯抵达罗切斯特几周后就意识到，施乐高管们并不将他们的业务定义为制造复印机，而是赚钱。创造收入的产品几乎无关紧要；对他们来说，如果他们生产汽车、生钢或鞋子，管理问题也不会有什么不同。“他们将施乐视为赚钱机器，并围绕这一概念进行组织，”特里布斯说。“施乐高层对技术并不真正感兴趣。”</p><p class="para">Tribus realized within a few weeks of his arrival in Rochester that Xerox executives did not define their business as making copiers, but rather as making money. The products generating the revenues were almost irrelevant; for them the issues of management would have been no different had they been turning out cars, or raw steel, or shoes. “They saw Xerox as a money pump and they organized it around that concept,” Tribus said. “The people at the top of Xerox were not really interested in technology.”</p>
<p class="para">结果，施乐的技术和工程变得非常混乱。客户投诉像风暴潮一样冲击着公司，但却没有系统将现场报告转化为产品改进。特里布斯对这种杂乱无章的环境施加了严格的秩序。他要求施乐复印机的每个零件，包括最小的弹簧，都像喷气发动机的部件一样记录在案，这样修理工和工程师只需翻开一本书就能找到故障点。“我意识到，”他说，“我们必须获得可靠性。”</p><p class="para">As a result, Xerox technology and engineering had turned distinctly slovenly. Customer complaints battered against the company walls like a storm surge, but no system existed to convert reports from the field into product improvements. Tribus imposed a rigorous order on this haphazard environment. He demanded that every part going into a Xerox copier, down to the smallest spring, be documented like a component in a jet engine so that repairmen and engineers needed only to flip open a book to locate the trouble spots. “I realized,” he said, “we had to get reliability.”</p>
<p class="para">在众多高管中，特里布斯几乎是唯一一个对 PARC 着迷的人。他经常去帕洛阿尔托，回到家后，他向奥尼尔施压，要求他推销激光打印机，作为 IBM 机器的替代品，IBM 机器速度慢、噪音大，而 IBM 机器的打印效果却很糟糕，后来被误认为是高科技计算机打印。在特里布斯的秘书从公司托运的一台 Alto 打印机中被选中后，他坦率地着迷地研究了她工作习惯的变化。“当他们拿走它检查磨损情况时，她哭了，真的哭了，”他说。“我心里想，‘这是一件大事。’”</p><p class="para">Almost alone among the top executives, Tribus was enchanted with PARC. He visited Palo Alto regularly and, back home, pressured O’Neill to market the laser printer as an alternative to the slow and noisy IBM machines whose hideous output then passed for high-tech computer printing. After Tribus’s secretary was awarded an Alto out of the corporate consignment he studied the change in her work habits with frank fascination. “When they took it away to check on its wear and tear she cried, really cried,” he said. “I thought to myself, ‘This is something really big.’”</p>
<p class="para">不幸的是，特里布斯在政府和学术界的漫长职业生涯中没有学会如何在企业高管层中生存。他天生就无法纵容下属，也无法容忍愚蠢的人；他也没有意识到保护自己侧翼的必要性。即使是副手<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch24.html.page349"></a>那些钦佩他聪明才智的下属讨厌他粗鲁和教条主义的作风。至于他的管理层同事，他们讨厌他以直率的喜悦来炫耀自己高超的技术判断，他们嗅到了他缺乏企业头脑的气味，就像狮子围着跛脚的角马一样。</p><p class="para">Unfortunately, one skill Tribus had not learned during his long career in government and academia was how to survive in a corporate executive suite. He was constitutionally unable to coddle underlings or suffer fools gladly; nor was he alert to the necessity of protecting his flank. Even sub<a></a>ordinates who admired his brains hated his brusque and doctrinaire manner. As for his peers in management, who resented the blunt delight with which he rubbed their noses in his superior technical judgment, they smelled his lack of corporate savvy like lions circling a lame wildebeest.</p>
<p class="para">最终，他被夹在奥尼尔和工程经理罗伯特·J·斯帕拉西诺之间。斯帕拉西诺在通用汽车公司磨练了他的企业内斗技巧，通用汽车是内部竞争的战场，庞蒂亚克的一位高管在这家公司赢得的赞誉不亚于击败克莱斯勒，因为他比别克的同行更聪明。奥尼尔最初指派他做特里布斯的下属，但几个月后，他安排让这位下属承担更多责任，而特里布斯则因此受损。</p><p class="para">Eventually he ended up sandwiched in the pecking order between O’Neill and an engineering manager named Robert J. Sparacino. Sparacino had honed his corporate infighting skills at that war college of internal competition, General Motors, where an executive at Pontiac would win as much praise for outsmarting his compeers at Buick as for beating Chrysler. O’Neill at first assigned him to be Tribus’s subordinate, but over a period of months arranged to give the junior man more responsibilities at Tribus’s expense.</p>
<p class="para">“他们密谋要摆脱我，”特里布斯回忆道。“我从未在公司工作过。我发现自己身处异乡，在高层工作时，我看到很多事情都在发生，我认为这些事情简直是愚蠢的：但其他人都有 MBA 学位，而我没有，他们说着共同的语言，而我显然是个局外人。我拼命反抗这个制度，直到我的一些好朋友来找我说，‘迈伦，你看起来糟透了，从早上七点工作到晚上七点，身边都是那些只想把你搞死的人。你必须离开那里，否则一年后你就会死掉。’”</p><p class="para">“They connived to get rid of me,” Tribus recalled. “I had never been in a corporation. I found myself in an alien land, and working at the top I saw a lot of things going on that I thought were just plain stupid: But the other guys had MBAs and I did not, and they talked a common language and I was clearly an outsider. I fought that system tooth and nail until some of my good friends came to me and said, ‘Myron, you look like hell, working from seven in the morning till seven at night surrounded by guys who just want to do you in. You’ve got to get out of there or you’ll be dead in a year.’”</p>
<p class="para">1974 年，特里布斯辞职，前往麻省理工学院任教，戈德曼失去了知音和盟友。他只能以少数派的身份与福特金融集团抗争。他用谩骂来弥补人手的不足。高管层内部的挑剔越来越令人无法忍受，戈德曼对“让一位不懂摩尔定律或软件作用的会计师领导工程部门”的想法嗤之以鼻，而奥尼尔和斯帕拉西诺则对他唠叨 PARC 推出的半生不熟、无法销售的原型产品。有人听到斯帕拉西诺曾说过“办公系统在施乐公司永远不会一事无成”，许多人认为他正在努力实现这一预言。</p><p class="para">Tribus’s resignation in 1974 to accept a teaching post at MIT deprived Goldman of a soulmate and an ally. He was left to fight the Ford finance clique as a minority of one. What he lacked in manpower he made up for in vituperation. The carping within the executive suite grew intolerable, While Goldman sniped at the very idea of having “the engineering division headed up by an accountant who just didn’t understand things like Moore’s Law or the role of software,” O’Neill and Sparacino nagged him about the half-baked and unmarketable prototypes coming out of PARC. Sparacino at one point was heard to remark that “office systems will never amount to diddly-squat at Xerox,” a prophecy many thought he worked to make self-fulfilling.</p>
<p class="para">但戈德曼并不总是务实的。即使是他最亲密的盟友也承认，他对产品开发的经济学——“研发”不可或缺的后半部分——缺乏了解。</p><p class="para">But Goldman did not always have realism on his side. Even his closest allies recognized that he had little conception of the economics of product development—the indispensable second half of “R&amp;D.”</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch24.html.page350"></a>
<p class="para">“杰克不明白，如何才能把聪明人提出的好点子变成真正的产品，进入真正的市场，”他的研究管理人员乔治·怀特承认道。由于奥尼尔和斯帕拉西诺继续控制着所有的营销和工程，高盛在将研究驱动的产品推向市场方面的能力比以往任何时候都要小，即使是在市场调查中。这是他在福特的老问题（“杰克，你的东西很少装在车上，对吧？”），而恶毒的个人仇恨使这一问题更加严重。他只能眼睁睁地看着自己最珍爱的事业——向劳伦斯·利弗莫尔出售激光打印机、营销 Alto III——成为政治争吵的牺牲品。</p><p class="para">“Jack did not understand what you had to do with bright ideas from bright people to make them into real products that could go into a real market,” acknowledged George White, a member of his research management staff. And with O’Neill and Sparacino continuing to control all marketing and engineering, Goldman had less clout than ever to force research-driven products into the marketplace even as market probes. It was his old problem at Ford (“Not much of your stuff gets on a car, does it, Jack?”), exacerbated by vicious personal animosities. He could only watch powerlessly as his most cherished ventures—the laser printer sale to Lawrence Livermore, the marketing of the Alto III—became the victims of political spats.</p>
<p class="para">1977 年，奥尼尔的主要赞助人阿奇·麦卡德尔辞去施乐公司总裁一职，出任国际收割机公司首席执行官。戈德曼显然认为他可能在与对手的较量中占上风。然而，冲突却愈演愈烈。幕后暗中攻击已经够糟糕了，但当戈德曼和奥尼尔面对面时，比如在高管会议或董事会会议上，他们以咬牙切齿的尊重态度对待对方，房间里的紧张气氛显而易见。麦科洛和被任命为麦卡德尔总裁继任者的大卫·卡恩斯“对这种甚至公开的争斗感到有点尴尬”，乔治·帕克回忆道。“公司对此非常不耐烦。”</p><p class="para">After Archie McCardell, O’Neill’s chief sponsor, resigned the Xerox presidency in 1977 to become chief executive of International Harvester, Goldman apparently believed he might yet gain the upper hand over his adversaries. Instead the conflict only became more disruptive. The backdoor sniping was bad enough, but when Goldman and O’Neill were face to face, as at executive conferences or board meetings, they treated each other with such an excess of gritted-teeth deference that the tension in the room was palpable. McColough and David Kearns, who had been appointed McCardell’s successor as president, “were kind of embarrassed by the feuding, which went on even in public,” George Pake recalled. “The corporation got pretty impatient with that.”</p>
<p class="para">1978 年在旧金山举行的年度股东大会是高盛又一次光彩夺目的时刻，他邀请其他董事会成员到帕洛阿尔托参观他在郊狼山的城堡。但这是他的最后一次欢呼。他们回到斯坦福的第一天，高盛收到了大卫·卡恩斯的召集。这位新任总裁告诉他，研究需要与工程和制造更紧密地结合起来。因此，他说，他正在将研究从公司级职能部门重组为工程部门的一个分支——由吉姆·奥尼尔和鲍勃·斯帕拉西诺领导。公平地说，卡恩斯可能没有完全理解他由此发出的历史信息：自从切斯特·卡尔森和约翰·德绍尔时代以来，研究在施乐的组织结构图中从未排名如此低。</p><p class="para">The 1978 annual shareholders meeting in San Francisco was another glittering showcase for Goldman, who invited his fellow board members down to Palo Alto for a beguiling tour of his citadel on Coyote Hill. But it was his last hurrah. On their first day back in Stamford he received a summons from David Kearns. The new president informed him that research needed to be yoked more closely to engineering and manufacturing. Therefore, he said, he was reorganizing it from a corporate-level function to a subdivision of engineering—that is, under Jim O’Neill and Bob Sparacino. Kearns, to be fair, may not have fully understood the historic message he was thereby sending: Since the days of Chester Carlson and John Dessauer, research had never been ranked so low in the organizational charts at Xerox.</p>
<p class="para">戈德曼最初的反应是愤怒。他认为新总统<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch24.html.page351"></a>作为一名新手——“董事会里的后辈”，他怒气冲冲地说——在公司重组的混乱中挣扎，既不了解技术的重要性，也不了解顶尖研究人员是可以用脚投票的流动资产。他直接冲进麦科洛的办公室，威胁要当场辞职。“我猛敲他的办公桌，”他回忆道，“说，‘你不能做这种糟糕的事情！’”</p><p class="para">Goldman’s initial reaction was outrage. He viewed the new president as <a></a>a novice—“my junior on the board of directors,” he fumed—floundering in the murk of a corporate reorganization without understanding the importance of technology or that top researchers were mobile assets who could vote with their feet. He stormed directly into McColough’s office and threatened to resign on the spot. “I pounded on his desk,” he recalled, “and said, ‘You can’t do this shitty thing!’”</p>
<p class="para">麦考洛竭尽全力安抚戈德曼，但戈德曼并没有撤销卡恩斯的命令。戈德曼恢复了镇定，以务实的态度审视局势，意识到自己已经处于劣势。与他作对的势力远远不止大卫·卡恩斯，这场斗争也不仅仅是个人恩怨。施乐公司正在上演一场政治闹剧，技术和研究都是棋子。</p><p class="para">Summoning all his powers of appeasement, McColough managed to get Goldman calmed down, but he did not rescind Kearns’s order. Regaining his composure and examining the situation pragmatically, Goldman realized he was overmatched. The forces arrayed against him extended well beyond David Kearns, and the battle was more than merely personal. A political drama was unfolding at Xerox, with technology and research the pawns.</p>
<p class="para">他现在有了一个新的目标，那就是让他心爱的研究实验室——他的遗产——不落入敌人的魔掌。“研究机构的独立性使你能够吸引到你想要的那种人，”他后来解释道。“而把它放在奥尼尔这样的人手下，肯定会从第一天就毁了它。”他明白，要阻止这种情况发生，他就必须自食其力。那个星期五，当他打电话给帕洛阿尔托的乔治·帕克时，是想让他接过从他手中落下的研究重任——接任研究主管。</p><p class="para">He now had a new goal to keep his beloved research labs—his legacy—out of his enemies’ clutches. “The independence of the research organization is what enables you to attract the kind of people you attract,” he explained later. “And certainly putting it under an O’Neill type of guy would kill it from Day One.” He understood that to stop this from happening he would have to fall on his sword. When he called George Pake in Palo Alto that Friday, it was to ask him to pick up the mantle of research as it fell from his own hands—by stepping in as research chief.</p>
<p class="para">佩克对他的老板深表同情。“如果我是杰克，我会非常震惊，他们竟然毫无预警地就把这三个研究中心从我手中夺走，”他后来说。（高盛的管辖范围包括 PARC、韦伯斯特和多伦多以外的第三个实验室。）在高盛的敦促下，他那个周末飞往康涅狄格州。“我们周一一起吃早餐，他说，‘乔治，这是罗切斯特的工程师们想控制 PARC 的数字技术。’他暗示他输了这一轮。他告诉我，要想保住我们在研究中的一流科学，唯一的办法就是我同意接受监督这三个实验室的工作。”</p><p class="para">Pake felt deeply for his boss. “If I’d have been Jack I’d have been totally shocked that with no warning at all they would just yank the three research centers away from me,” he said later. (Goldman’s jurisdiction covered PARC, Webster, and a third lab outside of Toronto.) At Goldman’s urging he flew to Connecticut that weekend. “We had breakfast together on Monday and he said, ‘George, this is a play by the engineers in Rochester to gain control of the digital technology at PARC.’ He was indicating that he had lost that round. And he told me the only way to keep the first-rate science we had in research was for me to agree to take the job of overseeing the three labs.”</p>
<p class="para">帕克发现了这个计划的一些漏洞。他没有得到这份工作，他也不知道会得到这份工作。其次，他觉得自己在奥尼尔和斯帕拉西诺手下的工作不会比戈德曼更好。最后，他担心自己的健康状况。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch24.html.page352"></a>1974 年，他接受了总部为期一年的职位，并搬到了斯坦福，留下霍尔担任 PARC 代理主任。公司政治的压力使他脆弱的血压飙升，并让他濒临中风，迫使他在年底前回家。他不确定自己是否愿意接受戈德曼的工作，如果这意味着再次在斯坦福工作，他肯定不愿意。</p><p class="para">Pake detected a few flaws in the scheme. The job had not been offered to him and he had no knowledge that it would be. Second, he could not see himself functioning any more cozily under O’Neill and Sparacino than Goldman had. Finally, he was concerned about his health. Back in <a></a>1974 he had accepted a one-year staff appointment at headquarters and relocated to Stamford, leaving Hall behind as acting PARC director. The stress of corporate politics had driven his fragile blood pressure sky high and brought him to the verge of a stroke, forcing him to return home before the full year was up. He was not sure he wanted Goldman’s job under any circumstances, and certainly not if it meant working in Stamford again.</p>
<p class="para">高盛以施乐研究受到威胁为由，强行推翻了帕克的所有反对意见。高盛将帕克带进实验室与卡恩斯会面，帕克恭敬地向卡恩斯传达了高盛的可怕信息。“我告诉大卫，‘杰克和我都认为，如果让奥尼尔和斯帕拉西诺负责实验室，研究科学家们就会放弃这艘正在下沉的船。我们为建立这个研究机构付出了如此多的努力，这将是一场可怕的悲剧。’”他提出接任研究主管，但条件是他可以在帕洛阿尔托完成这项工作。“我同意，无论何时你需要我，我都会坐飞机过来，”他说。（“坐了几百次飞机后，我有点后悔了，”他后来评论道。）</p><p class="para">Goldman bulled through all Pake’s objections by invoking the threat to Xerox research. He ushered him in to meet with Kearns, to whom Pake dutifully delivered Goldman’s dire message. “I told David, ‘Jack feels and I feel that the research scientists will just abandon this sinking ship if you put O’Neill and Sparacino in charge of the labs. We worked so hard to build this research enterprise that that would be a terrible tragedy.’” He offered to take over as head of research—on condition he could do the job from Palo Alto. “I’ll just agree that whenever you want me here I’ll get on a plane and come,” he said. (“Many hundred airplane trips later I kind of regretted that,” he remarked later.)</p>
<p class="para">科恩斯表示他会考虑一下，然后告诉帕克。帕克离开科恩斯办公室时的心情和鲍勃·泰勒 1970 年离开自己办公室时的心情一样，当时他确信交易已经失败。相反，他的提议在斯坦福引起了广泛的认可，人们亲切地认为帕克是一位高水平的科学家和一位完美的绅士。他捍卫自己的立场，但从未像杰克·戈德曼那样将其变成个人的十字军东征。此外，帕克一直对在 PARC 创造优秀科学和技术的机会感到满意。“他从来没有像杰克那样有改变世界或施乐的雄心壮志，”乔治·怀特观察到。“他没有挑战其他领域（如营销和金融）的‘专家’。简而言之，他并不傲慢。”</p><p class="para">Kearns said he would think it over and let Pake know. Pake left Kearns’s office in the same frame of mind in which Bob Taylor had left his own in 1970, convinced the deal was dead. Instead, his offer evoked widespread approval in Stamford, where Pake was viewed fondly as a high-caliber scientist and a consummate gentleman. He defended his positions but never turned them into personal crusades like Jack Goldman. Furthermore, Pake had always been content with the opportunity to create good science and technology at PARC. “He never had a focused ambition to turn the world or Xerox on its ear like Jack did,” George White observed. “He didn’t challenge these other ‘experts’ in their own fields, like marketing and finance. In short, he wasn’t uppity.”</p>

<p class="para">尽管佩克仍留在帕洛阿尔托，但新职责让他无法继续担任 PARC 主任。在接替他的候选人中，有一位脱颖而出。他就是鲍勃·斯宾拉德 (Bob Spinrad)，这位和蔼可亲的纽约出生的电气工程师，从 Max 的职位升职而来。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch24.html.page353"></a>帕列夫斯基从科学数据系统公司调到高盛旗下担任公司职员。他现在是系统开发部门的负责人，负责建造星号。</p><p class="para">Even though he was staying in Palo Alto, Pake’s new responsibilities ruled out any possibility he could remain PARC’s director. Of the candidates to replace him, one stood out. He was Bob Spinrad, the genial New York-born electrical engineer who had risen from a post at Max <a></a>Palevsky’s Scientific Data Systems to a corporate staff job under Goldman. He was now head of the Systems Development Division, which was building the Star.</p>
<p class="para">斯宾拉德似乎具备了帕克最看重的研究经理的所有素质。他在哥伦比亚大学、麻省理工学院和政府核研究中心布鲁克海文国家实验室获得了科研资格。他是一位数字计算领域的老手，曾担任 SDS 的软件主管，并管理过 SDD 的大型工程团队。</p><p class="para">Spinrad seemed to have all the qualities Pake valued most in a research manager. His scientific and research credentials had been earned at Columbia, MIT, and Brookhaven National Laboratory, a government nuclear research center. He was an old hand at navigating the shoals of digital computing, having served as SDS’s software chief and managed the large-scale engineering team at SDD.</p>
<p class="para">最棒的是，斯宾拉德在东西海岸都很受欢迎。他曾与数十名 PARC 和 SDS 员工一起在企业工作组工作（包括帮助施乐电脑业务摆脱困境的 Odyssey），并经常与吉姆·奥尼尔面对面打交道。“高盛过去常常派我去和他谈话，因为他们正在打架，”他回忆道。</p><p class="para">Best of all, Spinrad was popular on both coasts. He had served with dozens of PARC and SDS people on corporate task forces (including Odyssey, which put Xerox’s computer business out of its misery), and frequently dealt face to face with Jim O’Neill. “Goldman used to send me to talk to him when he couldn’t because they were fighting,” he recalled.</p>
<p class="para">谁也没有想到，斯宾拉德最大的麻烦不是吉姆·奥尼尔，而是乔治·帕克。</p><p class="para">What no one could have predicted was that Spinrad’s biggest problem would not be Jim O’Neill, but George Pake.</p>
<p class="para">1978 年 7 月 1 日，帕克出任主任，一年后，PARC 内部围绕研究资源的争斗开始恶化。讽刺的是，这起争斗的导火索是公司同意对该研究中心进行自成立以来最大规模的扩张。即建立一项硅基集成电路新技术项目。新实验室将在一条实验生产线上生产设备，这比林恩·康威和道格·费尔贝恩与卡弗·米德合作的 VLSI 科学更进了一步。这不是一个微不足道的承诺。这意味着数百万美元的资本支出和招募一支全新的专业人员队伍。但对于帕克来说，这是一次特别令人欣慰的胜利，对他来说，这意味着 PARC 将在他自己的学术专业——固体物理学领域进行前沿研究。</p><p class="para">About a year after his accession as director July 1, 1978, PARC’s internal battle over research resources took a turn for the worse. The catalyst, ironically, was the corporation’s consent to the most significant expansion of the research center since its founding. This was the establishment of a program in the new technology of silicon-based integrated circuits. Taking the science of VLSI a few steps beyond the work Lynn Conway and Doug Fairbairn were doing with Carver Mead, the new lab would actually manufacture devices on an experimental fabrication line. This was not a trivial commitment. It meant millions of dollars in capital expenditures and the recruitment of an entirely new professional staff. But it was a particularly gratifying victory for Pake, for whom it meant that PARC would be doing cutting-edge research in his own academic specialty, solid-state physics.</p>
<p class="para">然而，IC 实验室在 Coyote Hill 并没有受到普遍欢迎，人们将其视为争夺资金和人员数量的竞争对手。CSL 提出了与 VLSI 项目相同的论点——该项目不必要地重复了其他从事集成电路制造<span class="italic">业务的公司所做的工作。</span></p><p class="para">The IC lab, however, was far from universally popular on Coyote Hill, where it was viewed as a carpetbagging rival for money and head count. CSL trotted out the same arguments used against the VLSI program—that it was unnecessarily duplicative of work done by other companies that were in the <span class="italic">business</span> of making integrated circuits.</p>
<p class="para">“施乐对集成电路研究没有任何战略需求。”<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch24.html.page354"></a>巴特勒·兰普森辩称：“你完全可以买下它：这就是反对它的关键。很有可能花掉这么多钱不仅不会带来任何实质性的回报，而且实际上会伤害到你，因为你试图在内部做那些在外部做起来更好的事情，最终你会得到更糟糕的组件。同时，在我看来，如果我们把这笔钱花在雇佣更多的计算研究人员上，我们就能得到更多的回报。”</p><p class="para">“Xerox didn’t have any strategic need for integrated circuits research,” <a></a>Butler Lampson argued. “You could buy it perfectly well: That was the crux of the argument against it. There would be a very good chance that spending all this money would not only lead to no substantial payoff but would actually hurt you, because you would be attempting to do things internally that were better to do externally, and you’d end up with worse components. Meanwhile it seemed obvious to me that if we took that money and spent it on hiring more computing researchers we’d get a lot more mileage out of it.”</p>
<p class="para">IC 实验室为斯宾拉德的长期问题——如何最好地平衡 PARC 资源——增添了新的困难因素。几乎从一开始，他就发现泰勒就在他面前恳求他的新老板，只有他自己才知道该如何做。泰勒回忆道：“我确保斯宾拉德了解情况，并鼓励他听取其他人的意见，以决定如何分配 PARC 的资源。我会问他，‘你认为 PARC 的资源分配对公司最​​有利吗？’他会说‘不’，我会说‘我认为你是对的。’”</p><p class="para">The IC lab added a difficult new factor to Spinrad’s struggle with the eternal question of how best to balance the resources of PARC. Almost from the start he found Taylor in his face, entreating his new boss as only he knew how. Taylor recalled: “I was making sure Spinrad was briefed and encouraged him to get briefed by others to decide how to allocate PARC’s resources. I’d say to him, ‘Do you think PARC’s resources are allocated to the best benefit of the corporation?’ He’d say, ‘No,’ and I’d say, ‘I think you’re right.’”</p>
<p class="para">斯宾拉德确实同意计算机科学让施乐在 PARC 的投资物有所值。但他不同意 CSL 应该以牺牲系统科学实验室为代价获得大部分预算，因为他对萨瑟兰担任 SSL 负责人期间开展的一些项目很感兴趣。“其中一些项目开始探索用户界面和社交系统的重要边缘，”斯宾拉德回忆道。“研究系统在办公室的应用。电子邮件的道德和礼仪。有些没有成功，有些成功了，但我觉得这很重要。泰勒的实验室只研究硬科学、明确的结果、可衡量的性能和通信可靠性，并没有涉及显然重要的领域：你到底要如何使用这些东西？”</p><p class="para">Spinrad did agree that computer science gave Xerox the best bang for the buck at PARC. But he disagreed that CSL should receive the lion’s share of the budget at the expense of the Systems Science Lab, for he was quite taken by some of programs Sutherland had undertaken as head of SSL. “Some of those projects were beginning to probe the edges of important things about user interfaces and social systems,” Spinrad recalled. “Studies of the applications of the systems in offices. The ethics and etiquette of e-mail. Some didn’t work out and some did, but I felt it was important. Taylor’s lab was narrowly hard sciences and unambiguous results and measurable performance and communications reliability, and it didn’t get into what clearly was the important area: How the hell are you going to use this stuff?”</p>
<p class="para">尽管如此，他还是同意泰勒的一般观点，认为物理实验室资金过剩。也许没有意识到，实际上从 PARC 成立之日起，物理实验室就在帕克的心目中扮演着鲍勃·泰勒政治平衡的角色，斯宾拉德在 1980 年 3 月采取了一项举措，无论是否公平，这一举措永远标志着他成为泰勒的爪牙。这是他为帕克准备的五年计划，他提议重新分配 PARC 的预算，以支持公司<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch24.html.page355"></a>计算机实验室（包括 SSL）并减少在普通科学实验室上的花费。</p><p class="para">Nevertheless, he did share Taylor’s general opinion that the physics labs had been overfunded. Perhaps failing to recognize that virtually since the day of PARC’s opening the physics lab had played the role in Pake’s mind of a political counterweight to Bob Taylor, Spinrad in March 1980 took a step that forever marked him, unfairly or not, as Taylor’s cat’s-paw. This was his preparation for Pake of a five-year plan in which he proposed reallocating PARC’s budget in favor of the com<a></a>puter labs (including SSL) and reducing the money spent on the General Science Lab.</p>
<p class="para">“我认为，如果我在玩一场零和游戏”——也就是说，如果 PARC 的预算总体保持不变——“我将不得不在某些领域慢慢削减开支，”他回忆道。“这不会是突然的，但有些人的牛会比其他人受到更多的伤害。我要改变现状。”</p><p class="para">“I figured if I had a zero-sum game”—that is, if PARC’s budget were to remain static overall—“I was going to have to cut back slowly in some areas,” he recalled. “It would not be sudden, but some people’s oxen were going to get gored more than others. I was going to change the status quo.”</p>
<p class="para">斯宾拉德的计划至少在一个重要方面违背了 PARC 和施乐的正统观念。施乐的企业文化始终将预算削减视为有机体每个细胞应平等分担的负担。如果要削减 10%，那么每个部门和分支机构都要削减 10%，无论它们是对公司的边际贡献者还是机器中不可或缺的齿轮。“我可能是第一个在削减方面不采取平等主义的人，”斯宾拉德回忆道。“我有偏见，我认为管理层的少数职责之一就是做出选择和判断。”</p><p class="para">Spinrad’s plan violated PARC and Xerox orthodoxy in at least one important respect. Xerox’s corporate culture always treated budget cuts as burdens to be shared equally by every cell of the organism. If a 10 percent cut was indicated, every division and branch office took a 10 percent cut whether it was a marginal contributor to the company or an indispensable cog in the machine. “I was probably the first one not to be egalitarian about cuts,” Spinrad recalled. “I had prejudices, and I thought one of the few roles management has is to make choices and judgments.”</p>
<p class="para">但在 PARC 内部，许多人发现很难区分斯宾拉德的偏见和鲍勃·泰勒的偏见。“斯宾拉德屈服于泰勒的无情压力，”哈罗德·霍尔这样评价。帕克同意。“我的看法是，泰勒在两个实验室的政治角力中占据绝对优势，因此招募了斯宾拉德。”重新分配计划直接针对帕克最喜欢的实验室的物理学家——也是泰勒的<span class="italic">眼中钉</span>——这进一步加深了这种印象。帕克花了十年时间捍卫通用科学实验室不受泰勒的挑剔。他不会坐视不管，让它现在被摧毁。</p><p class="para">But inside PARC many people found it hard to distinguish Spinrad’s prejudices from Bob Taylor’s. “Spinrad succumbed to Taylor’s unrelenting pressure,” was Harold Hall’s judgment. Pake agreed. “My perception was that Taylor, being in complete ascendancy in the political jockeying between the two labs, enlisted Spinrad.” That the reallocation plan took direct aim at the physicists in Pake’s pet laboratory—and Taylor’s <span class="italic">bête noire</span>—only reinforced that impression. Pake had spent ten years defending the General Science Lab from Taylor’s carping. He was not about to sit by and let it be gutted now.</p>
<p class="para">帕克认为情况更加紧迫，因为他对斯宾拉德的整体表现越来越怀疑。几个月来，他一直在处理研究中心内部对泰勒野心勃勃的抱怨——如果斯宾拉德对泰勒管得严一点，这些抱怨就永远不会传到他那里。此外，他认为斯宾拉德故意拖延招聘新集成电路实验室主任，导致实验室至今未能启动。</p><p class="para">Pake viewed the situation even more urgently because he harbored growing doubts about Spinrad’s overall performance. For several months he had been fielding complaints from within the research center about Taylor’s ambitions—complaints that would never have reached him if Spinrad had kept Taylor on a properly short leash. Moreover, he believed Spinrad had deliberately dragged his feet in recruiting a director for the new integrated circuits lab, which consequently had not yet gotten off the ground.</p>
<p class="para">3 月 21 日，帕克把霍尔叫到他的办公室，他显然非常痛苦，并概述了他的担忧以及他所谓的“非常疯狂的解决方案”。</p><p class="para">On March 21 Pake summoned Hall to his office and, clearly anguished, outlined his concerns along with what he called a “really zany solution.”</p>
<p class="para">“也许我可以把中心分成两部分，”他告诉霍尔。“这也许能解决问题。”</p><p class="para">“Maybe I can split the center in two parts,” he told Hall. “That might solve the problem.”</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch24.html.page356"></a>
<p class="para">具体来说，他将 PARC 分成两个独立的研究中心，这样做显然是为了孤立泰勒。其中一个是“科学中心”，由 SSL、GSL 和新的 IC 实验室组成，由霍尔领导。斯宾拉德将保留对“系统中心”的管辖权，该中心仅​​限于 CSL 和光学科学实验室。</p><p class="para">Specifically, he would divide PARC into two independent research centers, manifestly configured to keep Taylor isolated. One, the “Science Center,” would comprise SSL, GSL, and the new IC lab and be headed by Hall. Spinrad would retain jurisdiction over the “System Center,” which was limited to CSL and the Optical Science Lab.</p>
<p class="para">霍尔同意重返直线管理岗位。在佩克首次提出这一建议后数小时内，这一变化就正式生效。“我想，如果我当时是一名科学家，我肯定不知道发生了什么，”佩克后来承认，“因为突然间每个人都通过内部邮件收到这份备忘录，称 PARC 现在是两个 PARC。”</p><p class="para">Hall assented to return to line management. Within hours after Pake first broached it, the change was official. “I suppose if I had been a scientist when this was happening I wouldn’t have known what was going on,” Pake acknowledged later, “because all of a sudden everyone gets this memo through the internal mail saying PARC is now two PARCs.”</p>
<p class="para">事实上，PARC 的每个人都认为，两个研究中心共用一栋大楼（有时甚至共用一层楼）的做法从长远来看是不可持续的。但帕克认为，除了泰勒的帝国主义和 IC 实验室停滞不前的进展之外，没有其他解决办法。斯宾拉德一如既往地保持着哲学思维，心甘情愿地接受了这一拒绝。但他显然受到了惩罚，并在一年内接受了重新任命，回到了公司。</p><p class="para">In truth, everyone at PARC regarded the arrangement of two research centers sharing the same building—and in some cases the same floor—as unsustainable over the long term. But Pake could see no other solution to the dual problems of Taylor’s imperialism and the stalled progress on the IC lab. Spinrad, philosophical as ever, accepted the rebuff complaisantly. But he was clearly chastened, and within a year accepted a reassignment back to the corporate staff.</p>
<p class="para">与此同时，霍尔负责招募集成电路实验室负责人。几个月后，他确信自己终于找到了合适的人选：堪萨斯大学的物理学家威廉·J·斯宾塞。</p><p class="para">Meanwhile Hall assumed responsibility for recruiting a chief for the integrated circuits lab. After several months he was convinced he finally had his man: a physicist from the University of Kansas named William J. Spencer.</p>
<p class="para">身材魁梧的斯宾塞的学历并不出众——在堪萨斯大学获得博士学位之前，他获得了体育教育学士学位——但在 56 岁时，他的职业生涯因在贝尔实验室、桑迪亚国家实验室和劳伦斯利弗莫尔国家实验室担任管理职位而出名。虽然斯宾塞是霍尔的第三选择（另外两位候选人都拒绝了他），但随着时间的推移，他对自己找到的职位感觉越来越好。他认为，领导 IC 实验室只是比尔·斯宾塞事业的开始。他向帕克汇报时说：“当他准备好接受这份大工作时，我会告诉你，但我不禁想到，我不仅聘请了我的继任者，还聘请了你的继任者。”</p><p class="para">The physically imposing Spencer’s academic credentials were less than sterling—before taking his Ph.D. from Kansas he had gotten his bachelor’s degree in physical education—but at the age of fifty-six his professional career was distinguished by management posts at Bell Labs and the Sandia and Lawrence Livermore national laboratories. Although Spencer had been Hall’s third choice for the job (the two other candidates had turned him down), he felt better about his find as time went on. Heading the IC lab, he thought, would only be the start of things for Bill Spencer. As he reported to Pake, “When he’s ready for the big job I’ll let you know, but I can’t help thinking that I’ve hired not only my successor, but yours.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">与此同时，PARC 内部也越来越感受到来自外界的压力。“PARC 唯一的问题就是<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch24.html.page357"></a>“这完全是物理学的缺陷，”查尔斯·西蒙尼观察到。“如此明亮的恒星最终必定会爆炸。”</p><p class="para">Meanwhile, the pressure of the outside world was being felt more and more inside PARC. “The only problem with PARC was a law of <a></a>physics,” Charles Simonyi observed. “A star that bright eventually has to blow up.”</p>
<p class="para">1980 年，西蒙尼开始预感到超新星即将来临。那年秋天的一天，他发现自己在斯坦福施乐总部的走廊里徘徊，他最不期望的事情得到了证实。周围环境的富丽堂皇与这里人才济济的贫乏形成了难以想象的反差。他觉得自己完全无关紧要，就像一个任性的游客，而不是正在接受公司职员职位面试的员工。</p><p class="para">Simonyi began to sense the impending supernova in 1980. One day that fall he found himself wandering the hallways of Xerox headquarters in Stamford, having his lowest expectations confirmed. The disparity between the opulence of his surroundings and the paltriness of the brainpower housed therein beggared the imagination. He felt wholly irrelevant, like a wayward tourist rather than an employee being interviewed for a corporate staff position.</p>
<p class="para">杰瑞·艾尔金德 (Jerry Elkind) 诱使西蒙尼踏上此次旅程，他感觉到高级系统部门对他的年轻下属的吸引力正在逐渐消失。他是对的。西蒙尼将 Altos 推向世界时所享受到的兴奋感已经消退。随着 BravoX 即将完工，他不确定下一步该怎么做，尤其是考虑到没有任何迹象表明施乐打算在 ASD 的市场调查之后推出全面的商品化计划。</p><p class="para">Simonyi had been inveigled into making this trip by Jerry Elkind, who sensed that the Advanced Systems Division was losing its charm for his young subordinate. He was right. The excitement Simonyi had savored in getting Altos out to the world had worn thin. With BravoX nearing completion he was unsure of his next step, especially given the absence of any sign that Xerox meant to follow up ASD’s market probes with a full-scale merchandising program.</p>
<p class="para">当一位朋友向他展示了运行 VisiCalc 的 Apple II 时，他变得更加焦躁不安。这款电子表格程序对他来说很新奇，但功能强大得令人眼花缭乱。人们可以在网格的单元格中输入数字或公式，然后将它们链接起来，这样，一个单元格的答案就可以成为另一个单元格公式的一部分。这允许任何人以无限数量的排列方式来制表数据。它对商人和工程师来说尤其有用，他们只需在这里或那里更改一个数字，然后让网格自动计算出更改的无数后果，就可以进行“假设”分析。果然，几个月之内，VisiCalc 就将 Apple II 变成了一款商业产品。</p><p class="para">He had only grown more restive when a friend showed him an Apple II running VisiCalc. The spreadsheet program was new to him but dazzling in its power. One typed numbers or formulas into the cells of a grid and linked them, so the answer from one cell could be part of the formula of another. This allowed anyone to tabulate data in an infinite number of permutations. It was particularly valuable for businessmen and engineers, who could perform “what-if” analyses simply by altering a figure here or there and letting the grid automatically calculate the myriad ramifications of the change. Sure enough, within months VisiCalc had transformed the Apple II into a commercial sensation.</p>
<p class="para">相比之下，在 PARC，资金流动如此无限，以至于没有人会想要运行“假设”预算方案，世界上最伟大的软件工程师甚至都没有想到电子表格的想法。更让 Simonyi 感到沮丧的是，VisiCalc 简单、直观、快速——这些都是他和他的同事在过去十年的工作中努力追求的品质。</p><p class="para">By contrast, at PARC, where funds had flowed so limitlessly that no one ever felt the urge to run “what-if” budget scenarios, the spreadsheet idea had not even occurred to the greatest software engineers in the world. What Simonyi found even more depressing was that VisiCalc was simple, intuitive, and fast—all the qualities he and his colleagues had strived for in their work over the past decade.</p>
<p class="para">“这让我非常震惊，它的性能真是太棒了，”他回忆道。“他们在 Apple II 上运行它所用的周期甚至比 Alto 还要少，少得多。”</p><p class="para">“That alarmed me a lot, how good it was,” he remembered. “They were using even fewer cycles than the Alto to run it on the Apple II, way fewer.”</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch24.html.page358"></a>
<p class="para">和拉里·特斯勒一样，西蒙尼也发现了低端计算的强大力量。直到有一天他在 Apple II 上看到了 VisiCalc，他也曾认为这些业余爱好者的机器只是个笑话，它们的琐碎和 Star 的臃肿一样荒谬。现在他意识到，它们代表着 PARC 错失的未来。</p><p class="para">Like Larry Tesler, Simonyi had discovered the power of low-end computing. Until the day he saw VisiCalc on the Apple II he too had dismissed the hobbyist machines as a joke, as absurd in their triviality as the Star was in its bloat. Now he recognized in them a future that PARC had missed.</p>
<p class="para">为了指引西蒙尼进入新世界，他向他的前 SDD 老板鲍勃·梅特卡夫寻求了帮助。梅特卡夫当时正在领导自己的初创公司，这是一家以太网设备制造商，名为 3Com Corporation，总部位于帕洛阿尔托以南几英里的圣克拉拉。</p><p class="para">As a guide to the new world Simonyi turned to his former SDD boss, Bob Metcalfe, who was heading his own startup, an Ethernet equipment maker named 3Com Corporation headquartered in Santa Clara, a few miles south of Palo Alto.</p>
<p class="para">梅特卡夫很喜欢扮演 PARC 和 SDD 老同事的开拓者角色（“我是那个走出去却没有死的人，”他评论道）。他邀请西蒙尼共进午餐，一边吃着开胃菜，一边递给他一份十位年轻企业家的名单，他认为这些企业家有机会推动计算机行业走向令人兴奋的未来，并可能充分利用西蒙尼的才能。名单上的第一个名字被梅特卡夫描述为“一个疯子”，在西蒙尼眼中，这让他充满了一种反常的吸引力。他的名字是比尔·盖茨。西蒙尼永远不会见到其他任何人。</p><p class="para">Metcalfe rather relished the role of trailblazer for his old PARC and SDD colleagues (“I was the one who had gone out into the world and didn’t die,” he observed). He invited Simonyi to lunch, and over appetizers handed him a list of ten young entrepreneurs who he thought had a chance of propelling the computer industry toward its exciting future and who might make good use of Simonyi’s talents. The first name on the list was someone Metcalfe described as “a crazy guy,” which in Simonyi’s eyes bathed him with a perverse appeal. His name was Bill Gates. Simonyi would never meet any of the others.</p>
<p class="para">那顿午餐后的几个星期，西蒙尼碰巧在波音公司西雅图总部监督安装 Alto，波音公司是该公司向其交付一批 ASD 机器的 VIP 客户之一。在城里的最后一个下午，他顺便拜访了盖茨的小公司。微软的三十多名员工占据了西雅图市华盛顿湖对面贝尔维尤老国家银行大楼八层的一半空间。</p><p class="para">A few weeks following that lunch, Simonyi happened to be overseeing the installation of an Alto at the Seattle headquarters of Boeing, one of the VIP customers granted a shipment of ASD machines. On his last afternoon in town he dropped in on Gates’s little company. Microsoft’s thirty or so employees occupied half of the eighth floor of the Old National Bank building in Bellevue, just across Lake Washington from the city of Seattle.</p>
<p class="para">西蒙尼带着他的一个作品集，轻松而自信地走进了 819 号套房，因为他误以为梅特卡夫已经打过电话来开门了。事实上，他是一位不速之客。比尔盖茨当时正忙于接待一家日本制造公司的代表团，西蒙尼被带到了史蒂夫鲍尔默的办公室，他是盖茨在哈佛的朋友。与盖茨不同，鲍尔默一直在哈佛大学毕业，毕业后他签约成为微软疯狂的首席销售员和极具激励性的团队领袖。</p><p class="para">Carrying a portfolio of his work, Simonyi entered Suite 819 relaxed and confident, thanks to his mistaken impression that Metcalfe had already called to smooth the way. In fact, he was an unexpected visitor. Bill Gates being tied up at the moment with a delegation from a Japanese manufacturing company, Simonyi was escorted instead into the office of Steve Ballmer, a friend of Gates’s from Harvard. Unlike Gates, Ballmer had stayed at Harvard to graduate, after which he signed on to be Microsoft’s maniacal chief salesman and hyper-motivational troop leader.</p>
<p class="para">“我表现出了极大的信心，”西蒙尼回忆道。“我有一个很棒的投资组合，所以鲍尔默非常印象深刻。”<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch24.html.page359"></a>还只是轻描淡写。几分钟后，鲍尔默从椅子上跳了起来，大喊道：“比尔必须看看这个！”他把盖茨从会议室里拉出来，强迫他翻阅这份文件，直到西蒙尼赶飞机回家。盖茨提出送他回机场。</p><p class="para">“I projected supreme confidence and everything,” Simonyi recalled. “I had a great portfolio and so Ballmer was incredibly impressed.” This <a></a>was an understatement. After a few minutes Ballmer bounced out of his chair, exclaiming, “Bill has to see this!” He dragged Gates out of his meeting and badgered him into thumbing through the portfolio until it was time for Simonyi to catch his flight home. Gates offered him a ride back to the airport.</p>
<p class="para">“我们一起坐上车，走到登机口，”西蒙尼说，“就在那时，我们的未来几乎就此决定了。这太神奇了。比尔当时 22 岁，看上去只有 17 岁。我当时 32 岁。我们之间的沟通和他身上散发出来的能量令人难以置信。在五分钟的谈话中，我们可以看到未来 20 年的情况。”</p><p class="para">“We were going in the car and walking up to the gate together,” Simonyi said, “and then and there pretty much decided our whole futures. It was amazing. Bill was like twenty-two, looking seventeen. I was thirty-two. The bandwidth we had and the energy just flowing from him was incredible. In a five-minute conversation we could see twenty years into the future.”</p>
<p class="para">然而，他首先必须解决斯坦福公司的工作问题。西蒙尼同意回东部进行探索之旅，更多是出于对艾尔金德的礼遇，而不是其他原因。他曾经去过贝尔维尤，他已经发现，施乐公司以外的机会比康涅狄格州斯坦福的一些“技术人员的恶心工作”多得多。“我并不讨厌去那里。我觉得这将是一次不错的旅行。尽管我知道根本没机会。”</p><p class="para">First, however, he had to resolve the issue of the corporate job in Stamford. Simonyi agreed to make the exploratory trip back East more as a courtesy to Elkind than any other reason. His one visit to Bellevue had already told him that there was infinitely more opportunity outside Xerox than in some “technology staff puke job” in Stamford, Connecticut. “I wasn’t unhappy to go. I thought it would be a nice trip. Though I knew there wasn’t a chance in hell.”</p>
<p class="para">如果他犹豫不决，他与员工规划主管的面谈将决定这一问题。“这是斯坦福，他们为这六名高管专门设立了一栋大楼的侧楼，他们坐在两层秘书的椅子后面，就像政治局一样。你可以看到带宽非常小。我当时正在和我未来的雇主交谈，那家伙不知道自己在说什么，他甚至不知道自己不知道。他知道他需要一些技术方面的建议，他几乎知道他想听到什么，他的问题没有意义。不是我没有答案，而是他不知道足够多的东西来提出正确的问题。”</p><p class="para">Had he been wavering, his interviews with the staff planning executives would have decided the issue. “Here’s Stamford, they had a wing of the building just for these six executives and they’re sitting like a Politburo behind two layers of secretaries in their chairs. You could see the bandwidth was minuscule. I was talking to my prospective employer and the guy didn’t know what the hell he was talking about and he didn’t even know that he didn’t know. He knew he wanted some advice on technology and he pretty much knew what he wanted to hear and his questions didn’t make sense. It’s not that I didn’t have the answers, it’s that he didn’t know enough to ask the right questions.”</p>
<p class="para">与微软的对比令人警醒。“我们谈论的是夕阳产业和朝阳产业。这就像先去墓地或养老院，再去产房。我能闻到并感受到。你可以看到微软可以快一百倍地做事，真的，我不是在开玩笑。从那时起六年，我们在市值上超过了施乐。”</p><p class="para">The contrast with Microsoft was sobering. “We are talking about a sunset industry and a sunrise industry. It was like going into the graveyard or retirement home before going into the maternity ward. I could smell it and feel it.

<p class="para">西蒙尼在年底前又两次访问了贝尔维尤，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch24.html.page360"></a>有一次，西蒙尼带盖茨到 PARC 向他展示 Alto。由于盖茨表示对微软进军应用程序业务很感兴趣，西蒙尼便顺从地制定了一项战略，以开拓每个市场：文字处理器、电子表格、电子邮件，甚至语音识别——PARC 已经开发过的所有东西，以及它尚未开发的一些东西。西蒙尼在 BravoX 上准备了文档，并将其打印在 SLOT 上。形式服从功能：盖茨可以阅读程序，同时吸收其巨大的图形潜力，这些图形以令人眼花缭乱的各种字体和格式呈现。正如西蒙尼后来所说，这就是他成为“PARC 病毒的信使 RNA”的方式。</p><p class="para">Simonyi paid two more visits to Bellevue before the end of the year and <a></a>brought Gates down to PARC once to show him the Alto. Since Gates had expressed an interest in Microsoft’s entering the applications business, Simonyi obliged him by charting out a strategy to exploit every market: word processors, spreadsheets, e-mail, even voice recognition—everything PARC had worked on and several things it had not. Helpfully he prepared the document on BravoX and printed it on the SLOT. Form followed function: Gates could read the program and simultaneously absorb its tremendous graphic potential, laid out in a dizzying variety of typefaces and formats. As Simonyi said later, this was his way of becoming “the messenger RNA of the PARC virus.”</p>

<p class="para">Star 计划的持续时间和复杂性、SDD 内部的个人紧张关系、施乐的不断犹豫以及许多其他痛苦，在项目实现目标之前，就已经迫使许多工程师放弃了这个项目。Thacker 弃船返回 PARC。Simonyi 离开，与 Jerry Elkind 一起销售 Altos。Bob Metcalfe 于 1979 年辞职，寻找创业的主要机会。</p><p class="para">The Star program’s duration and complexity, the personal tensions within SDD, Xerox’s ceaseless vacillation, and numerous other agonies had driven many engineers off the project long before it reached the promised land.

<p class="para">甚至连这台机器的代号都表明了 SDD 想要引起施乐管理层的注意。这个代号是由 Bob Spinrad 创造的，他希望这个项目能在当时 SDD 的集团高管 Dave Culbertson 眼中显得更有光彩。</p><p class="para">Even the machine’s code name demonstrated SDD’s need to clamor for Xerox management’s attention. It had been coined by Bob Spinrad in the hope of lending the project some luster in the eyes of Dave Culbertson, a group executive to whom SDD then reported.</p>
<p class="para">“卡尔伯森是一名帆船爱好者，”大卫·利德尔回忆道，“因此斯宾拉德决定以单一设计的帆船等级来命名它。”在考虑了“闪电”和“太阳鱼”之后，他们决定使用“星星”，正如利德尔所观察到的，“这是一艘不错的帆船，也是办公室设备中可以接受的名字。”</p><p class="para">“Culbertson was a sailing enthusiast,” David Liddle recalled, “so Spinrad decided to name it after a one-design sailing class.” After considering “Lightning” and “Sunfish” they settled on “Star,” which, as Liddle observed, “was a decent sailboat and a tolerable name for an office appliance.”</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch25.html.page362"></a>
<p class="para">SDD 内部和外部的工程师经常对部门的发展方向表示怀疑。在 PARC，许多计算机工程师认为施乐公司试图将他们的发明与日渐衰落的办公垄断联系起来，这对施乐公司不利。1980 年中期，巴特勒·兰普森 (Butler Lampson) 向他的 SDD 朋友预测，他们永远不会推出产品。“他们有一个包含一百万行代码的系统，是由一群从街上雇来的人开发的，”他说。“整个过程花了四年时间，根据我的经验，任何具有这些特性的项目都有另一个特性，那就是它不会起作用。我预测它不会起作用，他们也无法推出它。”</p><p class="para">Engineers both inside and outside SDD expressed frequent doubts about the department’s course. At PARC, many computer engineers viewed the Star as Xerox’s attempt to yoke their inventions to its fading office monopoly, to the former’s disadvantage. Around mid-1980 Butler Lampson predicted to his SDD friends that they would never ship a product. “They had a system with a million lines of code in it built by a team of people hired off the street,” he said. “The whole thing took four years, and in my experience any project that had those properties had another property, which is it wouldn’t work. I predicted it wouldn’t work and they wouldn’t be able to ship it.”</p>
<p class="para">他错了。1981 年 4 月 27 日，在芝加哥举行的全国计算机大会贸易展上，SDD 正式将 Star 命名为 Xerox 8010 信息系统。</p><p class="para">He was wrong. On April 27, 1981, at the National Computer Conference trade show in Chicago, SDD formally unveiled the Star as the Xerox 8010 Information System.</p>
<p class="para">凭借其独特的 17 英寸位图屏幕和图形界面，该产品一经推出便引起轰动。该产品每小时的全套演示“让观众挤满了过道”，前 Engelbart 工程师、SDD 首批从 PARC 以外招募的员工之一 Charles Irby 回忆道。</p><p class="para">With its unique seventeen-inch bitmapped screen and graphical interface, the product was an instant sensation. Its full-dress demos every hour on the hour “had people overflowing into the aisles,” recalled Charles Irby, a former Engelbart engineer who had been one of SDD’s first recruits from outside PARC.</p>
<p class="para">厄比特别高兴地注意到，回头客中包括当时在苹果任职的拉里·特斯勒和他的 Lisa 设计团队。“他们会观看每一个演示，然后走到角落里谈论他们所看到的东西，”他回忆道。</p><p class="para">Irby was particularly amused to notice among the repeat visitors Larry Tesler, then at Apple, and his Lisa design team. “They’d watch every demo, then go off into a corner and talk about what they had seen,” he recalled.</p>
<p class="para">《星报》的成功证明了大卫·利德尔的执着，尽管多年来斯坦福总部对他冷漠甚至充满敌意，他还是设法让自己的思想和组织保持专注。年复一年，SDD 在公司组织结构中被踢来踢去——现在隶属于信息技术集团，现在隶属于施乐商业系统——直到鲍勃·贝尔维尔回忆道，“我们不再关注我们在哪里。”</p><p class="para">The Star’s success attested to the pertinacity of David Liddle, who had managed to keep his mind and his organization focused through years of indifferent and even hostile treatment from the Stamford headquarters. Year by year SDD got kicked around the corporate organizational chart—now under the Information Technology Group, now under Xerox Business Systems—until, as Bob Belleville recalled, “We just stopped paying any attention to where we were.”</p>
<p class="para">1979 年，该部门终于像搁浅的鲸鱼一样，被办公产品部门收购。这是最初由令人厌恶的鲍勃·波特管理的达拉斯业务。但在波特和他的赞助人阿奇·麦卡德尔一起搬到国际收割机公司后，该部门就被一位企业家煽动者接管了。</p><p class="para">In 1979 the division finally fetched up like a beached whale at the doors of the Office Products Division. This was the Dallas operation originally managed by the detested Bob Potter.

<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch25.html.page363"></a>
<p class="para">唐·马萨罗加入施乐公司时，施乐公司收购了舒加特联合公司，这是他与他人共同创立的一家磁盘驱动器公司。他性情急躁、喜欢冒险、粗鲁无礼、善于说服别人，似乎让人想起了谢尔比·卡特的辉煌岁月。他选择了华纳兄弟动画片中的公路赛跑者作为部门标志，以更好地嘲讽施乐公司的“土狼”，他认为这些“土狼”总是在追捕他的尾巴。“我并没有花二十年时间一步一步地在施乐公司爬升，也没有按规矩行事，”他在接受采访时说。“我做好了失败的准备。”当戴夫·利德尔飞到达拉斯向他展示 Star 软件时，他兴奋不已。“我说，‘去他的！这是一项了不起的技术，我们要把它推向市场！’”</p><p class="para">Don Massaro had joined Xerox when it purchased Shugart Associates, a disk drive company he had co-founded. Brash, risk-oriented, abrasive, and persuasive, he seemed a throwback to the glory days of Shelby Carter. For his divisional symbol he chose the Road Runner from the Warner Brothers cartoons, the better to taunt the Xerox “coyotes” he maintained were constantly out for his tail. “I had not spent twenty years of my life climbing the Xerox ladder rung by rung, playing according to the rules,” he told an interviewer. “I was prepared to fail.” When Dave Liddle flew down to Dallas to show him the Star software, he was jazzed. “I said, ‘Fuck it! This is incredible technology and we’re going to bring it to the marketplace!”</p>
<p class="para">这样的谈话正是 SDD 疲惫不堪的工程师们摆脱麻木所需要的。马萨罗是他们遇到的第一位表现出商业头脑的施乐高管。他做决定迅速，行动迅速，对自己的判断比高管名单上其他成员加起来还要自信。在他的鼓声的鼓舞下——“我认为我们又要面对 914 了，”他对《<span class="italic">商业周刊》</span>大肆宣扬——他们加倍努力让《星报》走出困境。</p><p class="para">Talk like that was just what the weary engineers of SDD needed to shake off their torpor. Massaro was the first Xerox executive they had met who displayed any business acumen at all. He made snap decisions, moved fast, and had more confidence in his own judgment than the rest of the executive roster put together. Rallying behind his drumbeat—“I think we have another 914 on our hands,” he crowed to <span class="italic">Business Week</span>—they redoubled their efforts to get the Star out the door.</p>
<p class="para">马萨罗还为施乐公司处理 PARC 技术的方式提供了一些急需的理性解释，施乐公司的大部分技术都像条件反射一样被保密，没有考虑如何最好地利用这些技术。例如，施乐公司长期以来一直坚持对以太网保密，以防有一天它选择将以太网作为专有产品进行营销。</p><p class="para">Massaro also contributed some desperately needed rationality to Xerox’s treatment of PARC technology, much of which had been kept under wraps as though by reflex without any consideration given to how best to exploit it. For example, the company had long insisted that Ethernet be kept secret in case it chose someday to market the network as a proprietary product.</p>
<p class="para">“但是施乐公司如何通过专有同轴电缆赚钱呢？”利德尔反问道。他、马萨罗和梅特卡夫提出了一个替代方案。如果其他电子公司能够被说服采用以太网作为行业标准，施乐就可以从必定会蓬勃发展的外围设备市场中获利，这些外围设备是施乐产品线的一部分，如激光打印机。这还将打破 IBM 对可联网设备市场的垄断，IBM 通过推广其劣质的“令牌环”网络来维持这一垄断——该系统一旦安装，就会迫使用户只购买 IBM 制造的外围设备。</p><p class="para">“But how would the Xerox Corporation make any money by proprietarily pulling coaxial cable?” as Liddle asked rhetorically. He, Massaro, and Metcalfe proposed an alternative. If other electronics companies could be persuaded to adopt Ethernet as an industry standard, Xerox could profit from what was sure to be an exploding market for the peripherals that were already part of its product line, like laser printers. This would also break IBM’s stranglehold on the networkable equipment market, which it maintained by promoting its inferior “token ring” network—a system that, once installed, compelled users to buy only IBM-made peripherals.</p>
<p class="para">这一论点最终在斯坦福大学获得胜利，斯坦福大学于 1979 年批准<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch25.html.page364"></a>马萨罗和利德尔批准将以太网公之于众，他们邀请英特尔和数字设备公司共同努力，将以太网从实验系统转变为具有商业可行性的稳健系统。新的工业强度规范于 1980 年作为施乐-英特尔-DEC 联合以太网标准发布。施乐的宽松许可规则允许任何公司在支付一次性 1,000 美元许可费并承诺支持书面标准后制造以太网卡、电缆、收发器和外围设备，这使以太网成为世界上使用最广泛的本地网络技术。</p><p class="para">This argument finally prevailed in Stamford, which in 1979 granted <a></a>Massaro and Liddle approval to make Ethernet public by enlisting Intel and Digital Equipment Corporation in the effort to turn it from an experimental system into one of commercially viable robustness. The new industrial-strength specifications were published in 1980 as the joint Xerox-Intel-DEC Ethernet standard. Xerox’s liberal licensing rules, which allowed any company to manufacture Ethernet cards, cables, transceivers, and peripherals after paying of a one-time $1,000 license fee pledging to support the standard as written, turned Ethernet into the most widely used local networking technology in the world.</p>
<p class="para">Don Massaro 对 SDD 工作的热情得到了最终产品的回报。他推动推出的 Star 工作站是一项了不起的成就。这台机器装在一个矮矮的米色盒子里，像它的祖先 Alto 一样，在桌子下面的脚轮上滑动，配备了以前从未见过的功能，也很少有人想象过在商用办公机器中出现。这些功能包括位图屏幕（当时施乐的宣传资料称之为“柔和的蓝色”）、鼠标（“电子指点设备”）、窗口显示和“所见即所得”的文档准备。捆绑的功能包括文本处理、绘图程序、第一个集成的“帮助”程序和电子邮件。</p><p class="para">Don Massaro’s enthusiasm for the work of SDD was requited by the ultimate product. The Star workstation he shepherded to launch was an amazing accomplishment. Enclosed in a squat beige-colored box which, like its ancestral Alto, slid on casters under a desk, the machine came packed with features no one had ever seen before and few envisioned in a commercial office machine. These included a bitmapped screen (in “muted blue,” as Xerox promotional literature described it at the time), a mouse (“an electronic pointing device”), windowed displays, and “What You See Is What You Get” document preparation. The bundled functions included text processing, a drawing program, the first integrated “help” program, and electronic mail.</p>
<p class="para">到目前为止，该系统最引人注目的功能是其图形用户界面，即通过位图屏幕与用户进行交流的风格化显示。这种围绕 Star 设计师所谓的“桌面隐喻”构建的图标和文件夹排列方式如今已为人们所熟知，似乎已成为计算的一部分。但它在 Star 上的开创性实现包括一些近二十年后才重新出现在市场上的功能。文本、公式和图形都可以在同一个文档中编辑。（比较今天的“集成”软件，其中导入文本文档的绘图不能再更改，但必须在原始图形程序中更改并重新引入文本文档。）Star 开箱即用，提供多种语言，提供字体和键盘配置，可以通过使用<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch25.html.page365"></a>“虚拟键盘”——屏幕上显示的键盘图形，向用户展示在何处查找他或她正在使用的任何语言中的独特字符。1982 年，Star 增加了一个包含 6,000 个日文<span class="italic">汉字</span>字符的内部库；最终，Star 用户能够用几乎所有现代语言起草文件，从阿拉伯语和孟加拉语到阿姆哈拉语和柬埔寨语。</p><p class="para">By far the system’s most striking feature was its graphical user interface, the stylized display that communicated with the user via the bitmapped screen. This arrangement of icons and folders built around what the Star designers called the “desktop metaphor” is so familiar today that it seems to have been a part of computing forever. But its pioneering implementation on the Star included some capabilities that had yet to resurface on the market nearly two decades later. Text, formulas, and graphics could all be edited in the same document. (Compare today’s “integrated” software, in which a drawing imported into a text document can no longer be altered, but must be changed in the original graphics program and reintroduced into the text document.) Out of the box the Star was multilingual, offering typefaces and keyboard configurations that could be implemented in the blink of an eye for writing in Russian, French, Spanish, and Swedish through the use <a></a>of “virtual keyboards”—graphic representations of keyboards that appeared on screen to show the user where to find the unique characters in whatever language he or she was using. In 1982 an internal library of 6,000 Japanese <span class="italic">kanji</span> characters was added; eventually Star users were able to draft documents in almost every modern language, from Arabic and Bengali to Amharic and Cambodian.</p>
<p class="para">顾名思义，用户看到的屏幕类似于桌面。代表文档的缩略图大小的图标排列在屏幕的一侧，代表外围设备（打印机、文件服务器、电子邮箱）的图标排列在另一侧。显示图像可以无限个性化，可以是整洁的，也可以是杂乱的，可以是井井有条的，也可以是混乱的，可以是字母顺序的，也可以是随机的，这取决于用户的个性和品味。图标本身经过精心设计，用户一眼就能识别出它们是文档页面（右上角有明显的折角）、文件夹、收件箱、时钟和废纸篓。得益于系统的面向对象软件，Star 的用户只需单击相关图标即可启动任何应用程序；机器会自动“知道”文本文档需要启动文本编辑器，绘图需要启动图形程序。没有任何系统能够与 Star 的通用命令集具有同等的一致性，其中“移动”、“复制”和“删除”在整个软件应用程序范围内执行类似的操作。</p><p class="para">As the term implied, the user’s view of the screen resembled the surface of a desk. Thumbnail-sized icons representing documents were lined up on one side of the screen and those representing peripheral devices—printers, file servers, e-mail boxes—on the other. The display image could be infinitely personalized to be tidy or cluttered, obsessively organized or hopelessly confused, alphabetized or random, as dictated by the user’s personality and taste. The icons themselves had been painstakingly drafted and redrafted so they would be instantaneously recognized by the user as document pages (with a distinctive dog-eared upper right corner), file folders, in and out baskets, a clock, and a wastebasket. Thanks to the system’s object-oriented software, the Star’s user could launch any application simply by clicking on the pertinent icon; the machine automatically “knew” that a text document required it to launch a text editor or a drawing to launch a graphics program. No system has ever equaled the consistency of the Star’s set of generic commands, in which “move,” “copy,” and “delete” performed similar operations across the entire spectrum of software applications.</p>
<p class="para">Star 是 PARC 用户友好型机器的典范。秘书无需学习编程或代码即可使用该机器，就像她无需了解驱动高尔夫球在 IBM Selectric 打字机上打字的伺服机构一样。在大多数情况下，更改字体、边距或行间距只需按一两个键或直观地单击几下鼠标即可。用户只需观察屏幕上图标或文档的移动或变化，即可了解正在发生的事情。这绝非偶然：“当计算机系统中的所有内容都显示在屏幕上时，”Star 界面设计师 David Smith 写道，“显示就变成了现实。对象和操作可以完全根据它们在显示屏上的效果来理解。”</p><p class="para">The Star was the epitome of PARC’s user-friendly machine. No secretary had to learn about programming or code to use the machine, any more than she had to understand the servomechanism driving the dancing golf ball to type on an IBM Selectric typewriter. Changing a font, or a margin, or the space between typed lines in most cases required a keystroke or two or a couple of intuitive mouse clicks. The user understood what was happening entirely from watching the icons or documents move or change on the screen. This was no accident: “When everything in a computer system is visible on the screen,” wrote David Smith, a designer of the Star interface, “the display becomes reality. Objects and actions can be understood purely in terms of their effects on the display.”</p>
<p class="para">更令人惊讶的是，其中大部分都是<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch25.html.page366"></a>施乐公司营销专家的反对导致开发进度放缓，这些专家对微不足道的小事也喋喋不休，导致开发进度延误了几个月。Irby 回忆起与达拉斯分部营销人员 Ron Johnson 就鼠标问题展开的激烈争论。</p><p class="para">What was even more remarkable was that much of this was accom<a></a>plished over the objections of Xerox marketing experts, whose kibitzing about even trivial matters slowed the development process by months. Irby recalled a particularly trying confrontation over the mouse with a marketing man from the Dallas division named Ron Johnson.</p>
<p class="para">“他第一次使用鼠标时，体验很差——显然他用的是脏鼠标，无法正确跟踪，”Irby 说。“所以两年来他一直反对我们使用这种鼠标，而我们却把所有时间都花在用户研究和测试上，向他证明这是正确的选择。我们花费了至少 100 万美元的施乐资源来证明它比光标按钮或触摸屏更好，这正是他想要的。最后，我们在一次会议上向他介绍了所有这些发现——但他仍然不接受！</p><p class="para">“The first time he’d ever used a mouse he’d had a bad experience—apparently he’d used a dirty one that didn’t track right,” Irby said. “So for two years he was against our using it, while we spent all our time on user studies and tests to show him it was the right thing. We spent at least $1 million of Xerox resources proving that it was better than a cursor button or touch screen, which is what he wanted. Finally we presented all these findings to him at a meeting—and he still wouldn’t go for it!</p>
<p class="para">“那是我极少数几次彻底发火的一次。我从椅子上站起来，冲着他大喊，说他真是个白痴。我尖叫道，‘该死的，我们要用鼠标！’然后走了出去。我们再也没有收到他的抱怨。”</p><p class="para">“That was one of the very few times when I totally exploded. I got out of my chair and towered over him and yelled about what an idiot he was being. I screamed, ‘We’re going to use the mouse, goddamn it!’ and walked out. We never got a complaint from him again.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">如果 Star 的表现能达到其给人的第一印象那样耀眼，那么施乐公司可能就能够建立并守住办公计算领域的滩头阵地，而这正是从吉姆奥尼尔 (Jim O'Neill) 到大卫利德尔 (David Liddle) 等数十位高管所渴望的。</p><p class="para">Had the Star performed up to the level of its dazzling first impression, Xerox might have been able to to establish and hold that beachhead in office computing craved by dozens of executives ranging from Jim O’Neill to David Liddle.</p>
<p class="para">但光芒很快就暗淡了。</p><p class="para">But the glow faded fast.</p>
<p class="para">用户注意到的第一个缺点是它的速度。正如一位设计师承认的那样，这个复杂的系统运行起来“像糖浆一样慢”。虽然 Dandelion 处理器比 Thacker 的 Dolphin 有了显著的改进，但它仍然无法应付在地表下运行的数百万行重型 Mesa 代码。“Star 软件的构建是为了消耗宇宙中所有可用的计算资源，”SDD 工程师 Smokey Wallace 开玩笑说。</p><p class="para">The first shortcoming users noticed was its speed. The elaborate system ran, as one of its designers acknowledged, “like molasses.” While the Dandelion processor was a marked improvement over Thacker’s Dolphin, it was still overwhelmed by the pure tonnage of a million lines of heavy-duty Mesa code running under the surface. “The Star software was built to consume all available computing resources in the universe,” cracked Smokey Wallace, an SDD engineer.</p>
<p class="para">另一个障碍是成本。Star 工作站的零售价为 16,595 美元。对于针对高性能工程市场的设备来说，这个价格可能还算合理。但这远远超过了大多数商业企业为秘书或文职人员配备资本设备所花的钱。此外，没有人能只买一台 Star 工作站，就像一个人不能只吃一片薯片一样。一次有意义的安装需要两到十个工作站，再加上一个高<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch25.html.page367"></a>高速激光打印机和以太网将它们连接在一起。这使每个用户的成本至少增加到 30,000 美元，整个集成系统的价格增加到 25 万美元或更多。一些专家预测，除非施乐公司重新教育客户正确使用它并降低价格，否则 Star 不会畅销。“对于 20 世纪 80 年代后半期来说，这是一款好产品，”一位专家说。</p><p class="para">Another hurdle was its cost. The Star workstation reached the market at a retail price of $16,595. This might have made sense for equipment aimed at a high-performance engineering market. But it was far more than most commercial businesses would spend to furnish a secretary or clerical worker with capital equipment. Furthermore, nobody could buy just one Star workstation any more than one can eat just one potato chip. A meaningful installation required two to ten workstations, plus a high<a></a>speed laser printer and Ethernet to link it all together. That raised the per-user cost to at least $30,000 and the price of the whole integrated system to a quarter of a million dollars or more. Some experts forecast that the Star would not sell until Xerox reeducated it customers to use it properly and made it cheaper. “It’s a good product,” one said, “for the second half of the 1980s.”</p>
<p class="para">在推出几个月后，Star 开始看起来像是一个严重的营销失误。这就像工程师构建一个只有工程师才会喜欢的系统的老故事——只不过 SDD 构建的不是对普通用户来说过于复杂的系统，而是过于庞大的系统。</p><p class="para">Within a few months of its launch the Star began to look like an egregious marketing blunder. It was the old story of engineers building a system that only engineers could love—except that instead of building one too complicated for average users, SDD had built one too big.</p>
<p class="para">看起来，SDD 作为一个组织是由设计师推动的，缺乏销售和营销专业人员的平衡。正如兰普森后来观察到的那样，“这家最大的优势就是营销的公司竟然成立了一个完全由工程师组成的组织，让他们进入一个全新的业务领域，这真是太神奇了。”</p><p class="para">It seemed as though SDD as an organization had been driven by designers lacking any counterweight of sales and marketing professionals. As Lampson observed later, “It was kind of amazing that this company whose biggest single strength was marketing set up an organization composed entirely of engineers to get them into a whole new line of business.”</p>
<p class="para">事实上，SDD 确实有营销建议。问题在于，这可能是施乐历史上第一次，营销专家对他们正在审查的系统如此敬畏，以至于他们自己也被工程师的热情所感染。</p><p class="para">In truth, SDD did have marketing advice. The problem was that, possibly for the first time in Xerox history, the marketing experts were so overawed by the system they were examining that they were themselves swept up in the engineers’ enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="para">最终，公司进行了一系列内部称为“Wave”研究的调查，花费了数十万美元来分析其客户群。Wave 研究是在 Spinrad 管理 SDD 期间进行的，远在该部门定价和推出 Star 之前，收集了来自近 100 家公司的决策者的电话和面对面采访数据，以及对另外 15 家企业进行为期数周的现场调查数据，并将其整理成一个架子，架子上装满了厚厚的活页夹。</p><p class="para">The upshot was a series of surveys known internally as the “Wave” studies, on which the company spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to analyze its customer base. Undertaken during Spinrad’s stewardship of SDD, well before the division priced and launched the Star, the Wave studies compiled data from telephone and face-to-face interviews with decision-makers at nearly 100 companies, as well as on-site surveys at another fifteen businesses that lasted several weeks each, into a shelf full of thick loose-leaf binders.</p>
<p class="para">Wave 得出的结论是，Star 如此优秀，潜在需求如此强烈，以至于客户会不顾价格而争相购买这项技术。对于施乐垄断的高管来说，这是一个熟悉且令人满意的领域。一台可以以任何价格出售或出租的机器——它又回到了 914 时代！</p><p class="para">Wave concluded that the Star was so good and latent demand so strong that customers would clamor for the technology regardless of price. To the monopoly-minded executives of Xerox, this was familiar and gratifying territory. A machine that could be sold or leased for any price—it was the 914 all over again!</p>
<p class="para">因此，SDD 工程师们认为自己可以自由地创建他们所能想象到的绝对最好的办公系统。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch25.html.page368"></a>几乎宗教般的狂热抓住了软件和硬件开发人员，让他们在无限的设计空间中自由发挥，他们将自己能设计出的每个复杂功能都塞进了 Star 中，而没有考虑过现实世界中一个至关重要的玩家：买家。</p><p class="para">The SDD engineers therefore considered themselves free to create absolutely the best office system they could imagine. Blinded by the <a></a>almost religious fervor that seizes software and hardware developers set loose in a boundless design space, they shoveled every sophisticated function they could contrive into the Star without giving a moment’s thought to the one real-world player whose opinion was critical: the buyer.</p>
<p class="para">“技术人员被要求尽可能地打造出最好的系统，”斯宾拉德多年后感叹道。“据我所记得，产品成本方面没有任何实质性的限制。但 Wave 研究忽略了他们没有意识到的其他事情正在发生。”</p><p class="para">“The techies were given their head to make the best system they could,” Spinrad lamented years later. “There were no constraints of any substance put on us as to the cost of the product, as far as I remember. But what the Wave studies missed was that there were other things coming along they didn’t recognize.”</p>
<p class="para">这只是轻描淡写。在 1975 年，甚至 1979 年，人们可能会认为 Star 的技术将独树一帜，它将超越市场上所有其他办公设备，成为事实上的标准<span class="italic">。</span>但在 1981 年，同样的论点却显得过于冒昧。因为在博卡拉顿的一家秘密工厂里，距离施乐举行盛大的公司野餐会的地点只有几英里，IBM 团队已经组装了一台机器，它将彻底摧毁大型集成办公系统市场。</p><p class="para">This was an understatement. In 1975, or even 1979, one might have argued that the Star’s technology would place it in a class by itself, that it would blow away every other office machine on the market on its way to becoming an instant <span class="italic">de facto</span> standard. In 1981 the same argument was dangerously presumptuous. For at a secret skunk works in Boca Raton, a couple of miles from where Xerox had held its spectacular company picnic, an IBM team had slapped together a machine that would annihilate the market for big, integrated office systems.</p>
<p class="para">1981 年 8 月，在 Star 问世仅仅四个月后，IBM 推出了国际象棋机，并简单地将其更名为个人计算机。与 PARC 所开发的技术相比，它显得平庸而无能。它的屏幕只显示 ASCII 字符，而不是位图图形和可变字体，在黑色背景上发出丑陋的单色绿光。PC 不使用鼠标，而是在键盘上用四个箭头键来费力地逐个字符、逐行移动光标。没有图标、没有桌面隐喻、没有多任务窗口、没有电子邮件、没有以太网。IBM 放弃了 Star 直观的点击操作性，强迫其客户掌握由其软件合作伙伴微软开发的一套深奥的输入命令和神秘响应词汇。Star 是集成可靠性的杰作，而 PC 则有随机崩溃的怪癖（这一特性缺陷被它留给了后来许多代微软 Windows 驱动的机器）。</p><p class="para">IBM launched its Chess machine, renamed simply the Personal Computer, in August 1981, a scant four months after the Star. Judged against the technology PARC had brought forth, it was a homely and feeble creature. Rather than bitmapped graphics and variable typefaces, its screen displayed only ASCII characters, glowing a hideous monochromatic green against a black background. Instead of a mouse, the PC had four arrow keys on the keyboard that laboriously moved the cursor, character by character and line by line. No icons, no desktop metaphor, no multitasking windows, no e-mail, no Ethernet. Forswearing the Star’s intuitive point-and-click operability, IBM forced its customers to master an abstruse lexicon of typed commands and cryptic responses developed by Microsoft, its software partner. Where the Star was a masterpiece of integrated reliability, the PC had a perverse tendency to crash at random (a character flaw it bequeathed to many subsequent generations of Microsoft Windows-driven machines).</p>
<p class="para">但是 Star 的售价为 16,595 美元以上，而 IBM PC 的售价不到 5,000 美元（全包）。Star 的操作系统<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch25.html.page369"></a>该 PC 是封闭的，只有获得 Xerox 授权编码密钥的人员才能访问，而任何愿意破解其程序的人都可以访问其电路和微代码 — — 就像 Alto 一样。</p><p class="para">But where the Star sold for $16,595-plus, the IBM PC sold for less than $5,000, all-inclusive. Where the Star’s operating system was <a></a>closed, accessible for enhancement only to those to whom Xerox granted a coded key, the PC’s circuitry and microcode were wide open to anyone willing to hack a program for it—just like the Alto’s.</p>
<p class="para">并且销量达到数百万份。</p><p class="para">And it sold in the millions.</p>
<p class="para">IBM PC 的推出改变了商业计算机市场，就像广岛原子弹爆炸改变了世界对战场武器的认识一样。PC 表明，商业用户愿意放弃图形化功能和无缝系统集成，并愿意容忍大量不稳定因素以节省价格。IBM 证明了所有警告 Star 太大、太复杂、太贵——太好了的人是对的。</p><p class="para">The introduction of the IBM PC changed the business computer market the way Hiroshima changed the world’s conception of battlefield weaponry. The PC demonstrated that the business user would gladly forego graphical bells and whistles and seamless system integration and would tolerate a large dose of flakiness in order to save on price. IBM proved correct everyone who had warned that the Star was too big, too complicated, too expensive—too good.</p>
<p class="para">IBM PC 对 Star 等大型系统造成的打击有多么严重将在接下来的一年中变得越来越明显，因为 Star 的销量落后于施乐的预测，而 PC 的销量超过了 IBM。</p><p class="para">How serious a blow the IBM PC represented to large-scale systems like the Star would become increasingly evident over the next year, as the Star’s sales lagged behind Xerox’s projections and the PC’s surpassed IBM’s.</p>
<p class="para">Star 的辉煌只持续了一段时间。1981 年 12 月，该公司的日本合作伙伴富士施乐在东京数据展上推出了日本版，利德尔、比尔英格利什和他的工程合作伙伴乔贝克尔（日本显示系统的发明者）也出席了此次展会。每台工作站的价格为 400 万日元，约合 16,000 美元。这一赞誉甚至超过了八个月前在芝加哥推出的国产同类产品。</p><p class="para">The Star was to enjoy just one more moment of triumph. In December 1981 the Japanese version was introduced at the Tokyo Data Show by Fuji Xerox, the company’s Japanese partner, with Liddle in attendance along with Bill English and his engineering partner Joe Becker, who had created the Japanese display system. The price was 4 million yen per workstation, or about $16,000. The acclaim was even greater than its domestic cousin had received in Chicago eight months earlier.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">日本计算机杂志ASCII</span>的记者写道：“这次展示力求达到最戏剧化的效果，似乎要打败其他参展商。与日本计算机制造商 400 万日元级别的办公计算机相比，Star 的性能简直是天壤之别。”</p><p class="para">“The presentation aimed at the most dramatic effect; it seemed to disembowel the other exhibitors,” wrote the correspondent of the Japanese computer journal <span class="italic">ASCII</span>. “Comparing Star with Japanese computer makers’ office computers in the 4-million-yen class, their capabilities are as different as clouds from mud.”</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">泥土变云？</span>听到日语翻译大声朗读评论中的这句话，戴夫·利德尔开心地大笑起来。“孩子，”他说，“你不可能做得比这更好了！”</p><p class="para"><span class="italic">Clouds from mud?</span> Upon hearing the phrase from a Japanese interpreter reading the review aloud, Dave Liddle burst out with a delighted laugh. “Boy,” he said, “you can’t do any better than that!”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">在 Star 推出后，SDD 的人才流失现象愈演愈烈。一天，Bob Belleville 接到了史蒂夫·乔布斯的电话，乔布斯大喊：“你这辈子做的每一件事都很糟糕，为什么不来为我工作？”迫使他辞职。Massaro 和 Liddle 于 1982 年离开，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch25.html.page370"></a>创立了 Metaphor Computer。Metaphor 很快推出了一款工作站，它表面与 Star 类似，但运行的是速度极快的摩托罗拉 68000 微处理器，这款微处理器很快成为 Apple Macintosh 的心脏和大脑。Metaphor 现在这个名字已经不为人知，但在五年多的时间里取得了巨大的成功，直到被 IBM 收购并退役。</p><p class="para">The exodus from SDD picked up steam after the Star introduction. One day Bob Belleville got a call from Steve Jobs, who badgered him into quitting by yelling, “Everything you’ve ever done in your life is terrible, so why don’t you come work for me?” Massaro and Liddle left in 1982 to <a></a>found Metaphor Computer. Metaphor soon brought out a workstation that resembled the Star on the surface, but ran on a lightning-fast Motorola 68000 microprocessor, the same one that would soon turn up as the heart and brain of the Apple Macintosh. A dimly remembered name now, Metaphor experienced great success for more than five years, until it was bought out and its nameplate retired—by IBM.</p>
<p class="para">至于 Star，它多年来一直是小众市场的巅峰之作、特色产品和传奇，有点像底特律汽车制造商为大型车展制造的豪华未来汽车（可以说是时光机），但实际上很少上路。施乐公司曾大胆预测 Star 的销量会达到数十万辆，但实际订购量只有约 3 万辆。</p><p class="para">As for the Star, it lived on for many years as the crowning glory of a niche market, a specialty product and a legend, somewhat like the fancy futuristic cars—time machines, so to speak—which Detroit auto makers manufacture for the big car shows but seldom actually get on the road. Instead of sales in the hundreds of thousands, as Xerox once dared anticipate, only about 30,000 Stars were ever ordered.</p>
<p class="para">到 1989 年，利德尔曾经预见到的能持续十年的架构已成过去。同年，<span class="italic">《计算机》</span>杂志发表了一篇由几位机器原始设计师撰写的文章，题为《施乐之星：回顾》。文章中列举了团队从痛苦经历中吸取的教训：“关注行业趋势……关注客户需求……了解竞争对手。”</p><p class="para">By 1989 the architecture that Liddle once foresaw lasting ten years was already a relic. That year <span class="italic">Computer</span> magazine published an article by several of the machine’s original designers entitled, “The Xerox Star: A Retrospective.” Among its features was a roll call of lessons the team had learned from bitter experience: “Pay attention to industry trends…Pay attention to what customers want…Know your competition.”</p>
<p class="para">由于被自己的技术蒙蔽了双眼，Star 的设计者几乎完全没有意识到廉价 PC 革命即将来临——与放大版的 Star 不同，廉价 PC 相当于缩小版的 Altos。直到 IBM 宣布推出重磅产品时，他们才意识到这一点。那时已经太晚了。</p><p class="para">Blinded by their own technology, the Star’s designers had been almost entirely unaware of the coming revolution of cheap PCs—the equivalent of scaled-down Altos, as opposed to the scaled-up Star. They did not see it coming until the moment IBM announced its blockbuster. At that point it was too late.</p>
<p class="para">“这是一场难以形容的灾难，”贝尔维尔后来说道，“因为世界已经不同了。”</p><p class="para">“It was a disaster beyond words,” Belleville said later, “because the world was already different.”</p>

<p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">比尔</span></span>·斯宾塞对 PARC 的介绍相当愉快。在他担任集成电路实验室负责人的那天，他的新同事们用一个绿色蛋糕欢迎他：那天是 1981 年的圣帕特里克节。</p><p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">B</span></span>ill Spencer’s introduction to PARC was jolly enough. On the day he assumed leadership of the Integrated Circuits Lab, his new colleagues welcomed him with a green cake: It was St. Patrick’s Day 1981.</p>
<p class="para">但这种魅力很快就消失了。随着他对这个地方的了解越来越多，他对 3333 Coyote Hill Road 的工作氛围感到震惊。几年前，这个实验室曾是全国乃至全世界最令人兴奋的研究场所，但现在似乎正受到某种恶性病毒的控制。整个部门都互相回避，除非是为了争夺资源和贬低彼此的工作。放眼望去，到处都是怀有神秘怨恨和怪异猜疑的人。</p><p class="para">But the charm rapidly paled. As he got to know the place better, he grew appalled at the working atmosphere at 3333 Coyote Hill Road. The lab that a few short years before had been the most exciting research venue in the country, if not the world, now appeared to be in the grip of some malignant virus. Whole departments shunned each other, except to fight over resources and belittle each other’s work. Everywhere you looked you found people harboring mysterious grudges and grotesque suspicions.</p>
<p class="para">最常规的个人交易就像雷区一样。斯宾塞到达后不久，就认为自己应该与“客户”保持联系——即 PARC 中将使用其芯片的其他实验室——他发送了一封电子邮件，邀请几位实验室负责人参加友好会议，讨论想法。每个人都接受了邀请。</p><p class="para">The most routine personal transactions were like minefields. Not long after his arrival Spencer, believing that he ought to be in touch with his “customers”—that is, the other labs at PARC that would be using his chips—sent out an e-mail message inviting several lab chiefs to a friendly meeting to toss around ideas. Everyone accepted.</p>
<p class="para">几天后，鲍勃·泰勒慷慨地提供了计算机科学实验室公共空间作为聚会的场地。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch26.html.page372"></a>斯宾塞又发了一轮消息，通知宾客新地址。接下来的几个小时，宾客纷纷取消预订。</p><p class="para">A few days later Bob Taylor graciously offered the Computer Science Lab commons as a venue for the get-together. A gratified <a></a>Spencer sent out another round of messages informing his guests of the new location. The next few hours brought a cascade of cancellations.</p>
<p class="para">他感到很困惑，于是拿起电话拨通了第一位受理人林恩·康威 (Lynn Conway) 的电话。</p><p class="para">Bewildered, he picked up the phone and dialed Lynn Conway, the first respondent.</p>
<p class="para">“发生什么事了？”他问。“你为什么不来？”</p><p class="para">“What’s going on?” he asked. “Why aren’t you coming?”</p>
<p class="para">“这是 CSL，”她回答道。“如果我进去的话，我会受到人身攻击的。”</p><p class="para">“It’s CSL,” she responded. “I’d be physically assaulted if I went in there.”</p>
<p class="para">“这是荒谬的！”</p><p class="para">“That’s ridiculous!”</p>
<p class="para">“随你便吧，”她简单地回答道。“但我不会踏进那个实验室。”这次会面最终没有举行。</p><p class="para">“Think what you want,” she replied simply. “But I won’t set foot in that lab.” The meeting never took place.</p>
<p class="para">斯宾塞调查得越多，他发现情况越糟糕。帕克将 PARC 一分为二，孤立泰勒的策略加剧了分裂，而不是解决分裂。“在每次员工会议上，权力争夺和资源纠纷占据了讨论的主导地位，”他观察到。“计算机资源、办公空间、预算——你能想到的任何东西，他们都会争吵不休。情况如此激烈和分裂，以至于中心陷入停顿，而人们把所有时间都花在捍卫自己的地盘上。”</p><p class="para">The more Spencer investigated, the grimmer he found the situation. Pake’s strategy of isolating Taylor by sundering PARC in two had exacerbated the schism, not resolved it. “At every staff meeting power grabs and disputes over resources dominated the discussion,” he observed. “Computer resources, office space, budget—you name it, they fought over it. It was so acrimonious and divisive that the center had ground to a halt while people spent all their time defending their turf.”</p>
<p class="para">争论很普遍，但泰勒似乎是争论的焦点。他声称自己拥有 PARC 的资源，因为他认为实验室之外的任何工作几乎都不值得做，这迫使其他人坚决反对任何可能改变权力平衡的改变。有传言称，他正在将计算机科学实验室作为批发包卖给施乐的竞争对手（猜测集中在惠普身上，惠普正在帕洛阿尔托的山坡上建造一个研究中心，就在 Coyote Hill 山脊的对面）。泰勒一直坚决否认这一说法，但怀疑从未完全消退。</p><p class="para">The contention was general, but Taylor appeared to stand at its center. His claims on PARC’s resources, based on his presumption that any work done outside his lab was scarcely worth doing at all, forced the others to dig in against any change that threatened even tangentially to shift the balance of power. Further roiling the atmosphere were rumors that he was shopping the Computer Science Lab as a wholesale package to a Xerox competitor (speculation focused on Hewlett-Packard, which was building a research center on a Palo Alto hillside just over the ridge from Coyote Hill). Taylor always steadfastly denied the story, but the suspicion never entirely waned.</p>
<p class="para">然而，将这种失调的氛围完全归咎于泰勒是不公平的。在一定程度上，内部冲突源于创意机构不可避免的生命周期。自 PARC 成立以来，这种紧张局势就以某种形式存在；在第一个十年的大部分时间里，这种紧张局势只是得到了更富有成效的引导。</p><p class="para">Yet to blame Taylor entirely for the dysfunctional atmosphere would be unjust. To a certain extent the internal conflicts grew out of the ineluctable life cycle of a creative institution. In one form or another the same tension had been present almost since PARC’s founding; for most of the first decade it simply had been channeled more fruitfully.</p>
<p class="para">“直到 1977 年左右，实验室冲突似乎更具活力，实际上在刺激健康的竞争和创新方面富有成效。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch26.html.page373"></a>林恩·康威观察到，“随着项目的成熟，人员不断变动，外部组织承担了将 PARC 的创新推向市场的激动人心的工作，内部争斗的实质内容越来越少。而且，正如所有内部政治的老手所知——无论是在大学校园还是在公司内部——利害关系越小，争斗就越激烈。</p><p class="para">“Up until 1977 or so the lab conflicts seemed more dynamic and actually productive in stimulating healthy competitiveness and innova<a></a>tion,” Lynn Conway observed. As projects matured, people moved on, and outside organizations assumed the exciting work of bringing PARC’s innovations to market, there was less of substance to fight about within the walls. And as is known to veterans of all intramural politics—whether they take place on a university campus or inside a corporation—the less at stake, the more vicious the battle.</p>
<p class="para">在 PARC，兴奋感已经消退，但压力依然存在。内部竞争呈现出一种反射性，好像人们只是在敷衍了事。塞韦罗·奥恩斯坦回忆起 CSL 将其图形程序分拆到查克·格什克和约翰·沃诺克领导的独立实验室后不久发生的一件令人震惊的事。“我们和这些人合作得非常融洽，”奥恩斯坦回忆道。“但不到两周后，我就听到走廊里有人称他们为‘他们’。我笑了，心想，‘战争就是这样开始的。’”</p><p class="para">At PARC the excitement had faded but the pressure cooker remained. The internecine competition took on a reflexive quality, as though people were going through the motions. Severo Ornstein recalled a telling incident soon after CSL spun off its graphics programs into a separate lab under Chuck Geschke and John Warnock. “These were guys we had worked very cohesively with,” Ornstein recalled. “But not two weeks later I heard someone in the hallway refer to them as ‘they.’ Chuckling, I thought, ‘This is how wars start.’”</p>
<p class="para">施乐公司对 PARC 工作的漠不关心也应为这些无益冲突的滋生承担部分责任。《未来日》强调了父母与子女之间的差异。随后出现了更多令人沮丧的失误，例如对《Interpress》的期望冲突。</p><p class="para">Xerox’s indifference to PARC’s work also deserves some of the blame for nursing these unproductive conflicts. Futures Day had underscored how divergent were the vectors between parent and offspring. More depressing miscues followed, such as the clash of expectations over “Interpress.”</p>
<p class="para">Interpress 是一个编程系统，旨在协调计算机屏幕和激光打印机的不同图像分辨率。这种差异通常会导致文档在 Alto 显示器上看起来很完美，但在高分辨率打印机上却显示为乱码 - 这当然是对 Bravo 所见即所得功能的嘲讽。经过多年的艰苦工作和几个中间版本，Geschke、Warnock、Bob Sproull、Lampson 和其他人终于发明了一种所谓的页面描述语言，允许任何类型的打印机输出准确再现其屏幕表示的文档，而不管显示器和激光之间的不兼容性如何。但说服施乐将 Interpress 集成到其激光打印机和其他印刷产品中非常困难，这使得实际发明的过程看起来像是小菜一碟。</p><p class="para">Interpress was a programming system that aimed to reconcile the different image resolutions of computer screens and laser printers. This difference often resulted in documents that looked perfect on an Alto display, but emerged as gibberish on the higher-resolution printers—which of course made a mockery of Bravo’s WYSIWYG feature. After years of painstaking work and several intermediate versions, Geschke, Warnock, Bob Sproull, Lampson, and others had at last invented a so-called page description language allowing printers of any type to output a document that accurately reproduced its on-screen representation, regardless of the incompatibilities between display and laser. But the difficulty of persuading Xerox to integrate Interpress into its laser printers and other typographical products made the process of actual invention look like a cakewalk.</p>
<p class="para">沃诺克回忆说：“我们花了几个月的时间走访施乐公司的各个部门，然后又回到公司内部推销这个想法。”为了满足各部门的反对意见，该计划被大量改写。<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch26.html.page374"></a>最终，在 1982 年，该公司同意将 Interpress 作为其整个程序系列的标准组件 — — 但拒绝宣布或发布，直到每件产品都能重新设计以利用它。结果将是难以忍受的延迟。</p><p class="para">“We spent months traveling around to all the divisions within Xerox and back to corporate selling this idea,” Warnock recalled. The program was extensively rewritten to meet objections by the various divisions. <a></a>Finally, in 1982, the company agreed to make Interpress a standard component of its entire program line—but refused to announce or release it until every product could be reengineered to take advantage of it. The upshot would be an unendurable delay.</p>
<p class="para">“我知道这至少需要五到十年的时间，但实际上这根本不可能发生，”沃诺克回忆道。“查克·格什克和我在他的办公室里进行了一次谈话，他说，‘你知道，我们需要做点别的事情，因为我们已经花了两年的时间试图推销这个东西，而他们却要再蒙混五年。’你看到 PC 和 Apple 的发布，你不停地问自己，‘这些好东西什么时候才能面世？’你会想到施乐的基础设施以及它进入产品所必须经历的过程，这变得有点令人沮丧。”</p><p class="para">“I knew that would take at least five to ten years, and really it was just never going to happen,” Warnock recalled. “Chuck Geschke and I had a conversation in his office and said, ‘You know, we need to go do something else, because we’ve spent two years of our lives trying to sell this thing and they’re going to put it under a black shroud for another five.’ You were seeing PCs get announced, and Apples, and you kept asking yourself, ‘When is all this great stuff going to see the light of day?’ And you’d think about the Xerox infrastructure and the process it would have to go through to get into products, and it became sort of depressing.”</p>
<p class="para">不久之后，他和格什克辞职，创办了自己的公司 Adob​​e Systems。经过几次失败的尝试后，他们确定了一个商业计划，最终将 Adob​​e 打造成一家年收入 10 亿美元的企业：改进和营销一种新的“排版”或页面描述语言，类似于最初在 Interpress 开发的语言。这种语言就是 Postscript，一种最初与 Apple 打印机捆绑在一起的排版系统。Postscript 允许计算机生成的文档打印在激光打印机、莱诺排印机以及几乎所有其他设备上。在其后续版本中，它能够以惊人的保真度处理图形和颜色。短短几年内，它就成为了计算机排版的<span class="italic">事实</span>标准，并成为 Interpress 本身的主要竞争对手——这是另一项摆脱与世隔绝的 PARC 并在外部蓬勃发展的技术。</p><p class="para">A short time later he and Geschke resigned to start their own company, Adobe Systems. After a couple of false starts they settled on a business plan that would ultimately turn Adobe into a $1-billion-a-year enterprise: the refining and marketing of a new “typesetting,” or page description, language, along the lines initially developed in Interpress. This language was Postscript, a typesetting system first bundled with Apple printers. Postscript allowed computer-generated documents to be printed on laser printers, linotype machines, and virtually everything in between. In its later versions it proved able to handle graphics and color with amazing fidelity. Within a few short years it became the <span class="italic">de facto</span> standard of computerized typesetting, and a dominating rival of Interpress itself—yet another technology that broke free from cloistered PARC to flourish on the outside.</p>
<p class="para">因此，原本可以用于帮助新产品进入市场的冲突却转向了内部。但是，斯宾塞在 PARC 取得最令人印象深刻的成就后才加入，他没有经历过这些与企业思维的斗争。他发现很难将内部冲突视为幼稚的争吵以外的任何事。无论如何，到 1982 年底，当乔治·帕克要求他接替霍尔担任半 PARC“科学中心”负责人时，这些争吵都没有得到解决。</p><p class="para">Thus conflicts that might have been channeled into helping a new product reach market got turned inward instead. But Spencer, who arrived at a point when PARC’s most impressive achievements were already behind it, had not lived through these battles with the corporate mindset. He found it difficult to view the internecine tensions as anything other than childish squabbling. In any case, none of the quarreling had been resolved by late 1982, when George Pake asked him to succeed Hall as head of the half-PARC “Science Center.”</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch26.html.page375"></a>
<p class="para">令佩克惊讶的是，斯宾塞拒绝了他。他说，PARC 的分裂是站不住脚的，他不想管理一个内部分裂的机构。不过，他确实提出，如果佩克认为合适的话，他愿意担任 PARC 主任。</p><p class="para">To Pake’s surprise, Spencer turned him down. The bifurcation of PARC was untenable, he said, and he would not be interested in managing one half of a house divided against itself. He did, however, offer to step in as PARC director—if and when Pake saw fit to reunite the two halves.</p>
<p class="para">帕克毫不犹豫地同意了，甚至松了一口气。他发现，即使在分治之后，争吵仍在继续，这让他很痛苦。此外，他不仅钦佩斯宾塞作为技术管理员的技能，还钦佩他与鲍勃·泰勒共存的明显能力。斯宾塞和泰勒每周六都一起打网球，他们的妻子和孩子都很友好，但帕克看不出斯宾塞接受 CSL 正统观念的迹象。他敢于希望，经过十多年的时间，他终于找到了世界上唯一一个可以让泰勒留在原地的人。</p><p class="para">Pake agreed without hesitation, even with relief. He had found it painful to watch the bickering continue even after the partition. Moreover, he admired Spencer not only for his skills as a technical administrator but for his apparent ability to co-exist with Bob Taylor. Spencer and Taylor played tennis together every Saturday, their wives and children were friendly, yet Pake could see no sign that Spencer had bought into the CSL orthodoxy. He dared hope that after more than ten years he had finally found the one man on Earth who could keep Taylor in his place.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">比尔·斯宾塞很敬佩泰勒。在从事研究的这些年里，他很少遇到如此擅长管理小型或中型团队的经理。斯宾塞认为，泰勒建立个人关系和维护自己实验室独裁者角色的方法在大型实验室里会失败。但不可否认的是，这种方法在 CSL 内部效果很好。</p><p class="para">There was much about Taylor that Bill Spencer respected. In all his years in research he had met few managers so adept at running small or medium-sized teams. Taylor’s method of forging personal bonds and keeping up a jealous defense of his own role as laboratory autocrat was one Spencer thought would fail miserably in a large lab. But there was no denying it worked marvelously inside CSL.</p>
<p class="para">“他从不外出，”斯宾塞回忆道。“他每天早上十点上班，每天都把宝马停在同一个地方，从保安那里领取徽章。他会走进办公室，拿出一瓶 Dr Pepper，在接下来的八到十个小时里单独接触实验室的每一位成员。作为一名共识管理者，他非常出色。”</p><p class="para">“He never traveled,” Spencer recalled. “He would come in every day at ten in the morning, park his BMW in the same space every day, and pick up his badge from the security guard. He would go in his office, break out a Dr Pepper, and for the next eight to ten hours individually touch every member of his lab. As a consensus manager he was extraordinary.”</p>
<p class="para">职业问题、个人危机、人际争吵——无论什么问题——泰勒的人都会来找他。“鲍勃的办公室就像一个轮毂。一整天，每个人都会来那里。问题可能是任何事情。‘我可以去洗手间吗？’‘我该去吃午饭了吗？’”</p><p class="para">Professional problems, personal crises, interpersonal spats—whatever the issue—Taylor’s people came to Taylor. “Bob’s office was like the hub of a wheel. Through the day each of them would come in there. The question could be anything. ‘Can I go to the bathroom?’ ‘Is it time for me to go to lunch?”</p>
<p class="para">有一天，斯宾塞目睹了一件似乎可以概括一切的事情。当时他正坐在泰勒的办公室里聊天，一名 CSL 员工探头进来，说他要出去打网球。斯宾塞回忆道：“泰勒说，‘我看你有一个<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch26.html.page376"></a>那儿有一罐新球。你还不够好，不能玩新球。这儿有一罐旧球。用这些吧，它们对你更有用。”</p><p class="para">One day Spencer witnessed an incident that seemed to sum it all up. He was sitting and chatting in Taylor’s office when a member of the CSL staff poked his head in to mention that he was going out for a game of tennis. As Spencer recalled, “Taylor said, ‘I see you’ve got a <a></a>new can of balls there. You’re not good enough yet to play with new balls. Here’s a can of old ones. Use these, they’ll be better for you.’</p>
<p class="para">“现在，这里有一个三十五或四十岁的男人，一个博士，他需要鲍勃泰勒告诉他如何打网球！”</p><p class="para">“Now, here’s a thirty-five or forty-year-old man, a Ph.D., and he needs Bob Taylor to tell him how he’s going to play tennis!”</p>
<p class="para">斯宾塞成为 PARC 主任后，泰勒包罗万象的家长式作风所带来的麻烦后果开始显现。他面临的最严重问题之一是 CSL 无法解决其成员与其他实验室之间的纠纷，无论这些纠纷多么微不足道。在适应新办公室后，斯宾塞开始对自己花在调解本应在之后解决的争吵上的时间感到不满。“每当 CSL 员工与其他人发生矛盾时，他只能向泰勒提出，而泰勒从来不会处理。所以每次有问题都会到我的办公室解决。我说，‘这不是可行的情况。我不会解决那个实验室 50 个人的问题。’”</p><p class="para">After Spencer became PARC director the troublesome consequences of Taylor’s all-encompassing paternalism got driven home. One of the most serious problems he faced was CSL’s inability to resolve its members’ disputes with the other labs, no matter how trivial. As he settled into his new office, Spencer started to bridle at the amount of time he spent mediating quarrels that should have been settled further down the line. “Whenever a CSL guy had a problem with anyone else there was no one he could take it to but Taylor, and Taylor would never deal with it. So every time there was a problem it ended up in my office. And I said, ‘This is not a workable situation. I will not solve the problems of fifty individuals in that lab.’”</p>
<p class="para">他还比以往任何时候都更强烈地认识到泰勒管理风格中的其他缺陷。泰勒引以为豪的“扁平”管理结构，即计算机科学实验室的每位研究人员都向他而不是中级管理层汇报，已经失去了其作用。在过去，它的作用是确保所有研究人员齐心协力追求一致的愿景（除了像舒普和鲍勃罗这样的叛徒）。但它也扼杀了创造力，而且——从 PARC 管理的角度来看更重要的是——阻止了中心在 CSL 员工中发现和培养管理人才。如果任何一位研究人员拥有成为下一个鲍勃·泰勒的技能，没有人会发现。</p><p class="para">He also recognized more strongly than ever the other deficiencies in Taylor’s management style. Taylor’s vaunted “flat” management structure, which meant that every researcher in the Computer Science Lab reported to him rather than to an intermediate level of management, had outlived its usefulness. In the old days it had served the purpose of ensuring that all the researchers pulled together in pursuit of a coherent vision (with the exception of renegades like Shoup and Bobrow). But it had also stifled creativity and—more important from the point of view of PARC management—prevented the center from spotting and nurturing management talent among the CSL staff. If any of the researchers possessed the skills to be the next Bob Taylor, no one would ever find out.</p>
<p class="para">与此同时，泰勒仍将斯宾塞视为潜在盟友，努力将他拉入自己对 PARC 的愿景，即成为一个完全致力于个人计算的研究中心，摆脱物理实验室的束缚。斯宾塞升任 PARC 负责人后不久，泰勒邀请他参加 CSL 在旧金山北部 Bear Hollow 度假村举办的年度 Greybeard 会议。</p><p class="para">Meanwhile Taylor, still viewing Spencer as a potential ally, strived to draw him into his own vision of PARC, which was as a research center devoted entirely to personal computing, free of the dead weight of a physics lab. Shortly after Spencer’s promotion to head of PARC, Taylor asked him along to CSL’s annual Greybeard offsite at the Bear Hollow resort north of San Francisco.</p>
<p class="para">“我们邀请 Spencer 来，是为了告诉他资源分配如何<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch26.html.page377"></a>应该重组，”泰勒说道——换句话说，他重复了自己向命运多舛的鲍勃·斯宾拉德陈述的理由。“在场的每个人都向他抱怨投资不平衡。”然而，谨慎的斯宾塞认为该计划听起来像是一份蓝图，将让泰勒同时控制 CSL 和 SSL，而他可不打算这么做。他不置可否地坐着听完了讨论。后来，他们都回到家后，泰勒说话的口气好像他认为小组已经向新任主任陈述了理由。埃德·麦克雷特立刻打消了他的念头。“斯宾塞听了，”他警告道，“但别以为他同意了。”</p><p class="para">“We invited Spencer so we could tell him how the resource allocation <a></a>should be reorganized,” Taylor said—in other words, to repeat the case he had made to the ill-fated Bob Spinrad. “Everybody there complained to him about the investment imbalance.” The wary Spencer, however, thought the plan sounded like a blueprint for giving Taylor control of both CSL and SSL, something he was not about to do. He sat through the discussion noncommittally. Later, after they had all returned home, Taylor talked as though he thought the group had made its case to the new director. Ed McCreight disabused him of the notion at once. “Spencer listened,” he cautioned, “but don’t get it into your head that he agreed.”</p>
<p class="para">相反，这两个意志坚强的人之间的关系注定会迅速陷入危机。</p><p class="para">On the contrary, relations between these two strong-willed individuals were destined to build rapidly toward a crisis.</p>
<p class="para">二十年的实验室管理经验让斯宾塞坚信研究人员有义务帮助雇主将他们的工作成果转化为产品——工业界称之为“技术转移”。他认为，在这项任务上，PARC 的大部分工作，尤其是 CSL，都应得不及格。他下令，从今以后，实验室负责人的年度评估中有一半将基于他们与“客户”——即施乐的开发和制造部门——的合作情况。</p><p class="para">Twenty years of experience as a laboratory manager had given Spencer very firm ideas about the obligation of researchers to help their employers turn their work into product—“technology transfer,” as it was known in industry. On this task he judged that much of PARC, and particularly CSL, deserved a failing grade. Henceforth, he decreed, fifty percent of the lab bosses’ annual evaluations would be based on how well they worked with their “customers”—i.e., the development and manufacturing units of Xerox.</p>
<p class="para">泰勒的回应是，他反常地要求增加新资源。斯宾塞说，如果想从 CSL 获得这种额外的贡献，他就需要更多的“职位”——换句话说，更多的员工空缺。斯宾塞很惊讶。考虑到施乐公司陷入财务困境，已经导致其 125,000 名员工被裁员，员工和预算问题对施乐来说异常敏感。“研究预算没有被<span class="italic">削减</span>这一事实令人惊叹，”斯宾塞说。“1981 年，施乐陷入困境，到 1982 年，它陷入了严重的困境。那一年，公司历史上第一次没有员工分红。公司正在分崩离析。”</p><p class="para">Taylor’s response was, perversely, to step up his demand for new resources. If Spencer wanted this sort of additional contribution out of CSL, he said, he would need more “billets”—in other words, more staff openings. Spencer was astonished. The issue of staffing and budgets was exceptionally sensitive at Xerox, given that the company’s financially desperate situation had already led to layoffs in its 125,000-strong workforce. “The fact that the research budgets weren’t <span class="italic">cut</span> was amazing,” Spencer said. “In 1981 Xerox hit a wall and by 1982 it was in serious trouble. That year there was no profit-sharing for employees for the first time in company history. The place was being torn apart.”</p>
<p class="para">与帕克不同，斯宾塞对待泰勒的方式主要是回避，而帕克不是那种默默忍受反抗或对侮辱视而不见的人。他喜欢以德报怨：在他离开工作岗位时，他的同事送给他一个巨大的模拟注射器<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch26.html.page378"></a>麦克，证明了他“挑衅”他人的倾向。当泰勒逼迫时，斯宾塞反击得更猛烈，越来越明确地规定他希望泰勒如何管理他的实验室。泰勒是定义自己在等级制度中的角色的老手，终于遇到了一个坚持为他定义角色的人。</p><p class="para">In contrast to Pake, who dealt with Taylor largely through avoidance, Spencer was not one to suffer defiance mutely or let an affront go unremarked. He liked to give as good as he got: Upon his departure from one job his peers had presented him with a giant mock hypoder<a></a>mic, a testament to his penchant for “needling” others. When Taylor pushed, Spencer pushed back harder, dictating more and more explicitly how he expected Taylor to manage his lab. Taylor, the old expert at defining his role in the hierarchy, had finally met someone insistent on defining his role for him.</p>
<p class="para">“泰勒正在失去控制，”6 月 28 日，哈罗德·霍尔在公司职员的安全岗位上写道。CSL 员工们忧心忡忡地看着泰勒和斯宾塞之间最初的友好关系逐渐恶化为彻底的敌意——周六的网球比赛已成为过去。巴特勒·兰普森搬到了费城，成为世界上第一批联网“远程办公者”之一，他的妻子在那里担任免疫学家，他非常重视这一情况，飞到帕洛阿尔托恳求帕克避免即将发生的灾难。但帕克可能因为身边有斯宾塞作为矛兵而变得更加坚强，表现出出人意料的决心。</p><p class="para">“Taylor is spiraling out of control,” Harold Hall observed to his diary on June 28 from the secure perch of a corporate staff job. The CSL staff watched apprehensively as the initial friendliness between Taylor and Spencer deteriorated into outright animosity—the tennis Saturdays were a thing of the past. Butler Lampson, who had become one of the world’s first networked “telecommuters” by moving to Philadelphia, where his wife was working as an immunologist, viewed the situation gravely enough to fly to Palo Alto to beg Pake to avert the impending cataclysm. But Pake, toughened perhaps by having Spencer around as spear carrier, proved unexpectedly determined.</p>
<p class="para">“他的立场归根结底就是泰勒太让人头疼了，”兰普森回忆道。“鲍勃确实让人头疼，这是毫无疑问的。但他实际上并没有给乔治带来太多麻烦。说整个研究中心的运作被打乱了真是太荒谬了。实际上发生的事情是这些家伙只是有点权力泛滥。他们必须控制鲍勃。”</p><p class="para">“His position boiled down to that Taylor was too much a pain in the butt,” Lampson recalled. “And it’s true that Bob was a pain in the butt, absolutely no question about it. But he wasn’t actually causing George that much trouble. It’s ridiculous to say the functioning of the whole research center was being disrupted. What was really happening was these guys just got on some kind of power trip. They had to have control over Bob.”</p>
<p class="para">这种观点太过狭隘。帕克认为泰勒的行为不仅仅是个人的磨难，更是 PARC 实现其企业使命的障碍。尽管激光打印机代表着一项具有商业价值的技术，但帕克认为，只有说服该公司将其与 PARC 的其他数字技术结合起来，实验室才能帮助施乐在数字电子复印的未来中分得一杯羹。</p><p class="para">This is too limited a view. Pake regarded Taylor’s behavior not merely as a personal tribulation, but as a roadblock preventing PARC from fulfilling its corporate destiny. As much as the laser printer represented a commercially valuable technology, Pake thought that only by persuading the company to link it with other PARC digital technologies could the lab help Xerox claim a piece of the future of digital electronic copying.</p>
<p class="para">“这意味着我需要培养 PARC 与复印机部门的开发和工程部门之间的良好关系，”他后来说道。“有一群计算机科学家，包括他们的经理，嘲笑和嘲弄罗切斯特的复印机工程师，这无助于 PARC 发展这种良好的关系。”在伯特·萨瑟兰的领导下，系统科学实验室与复印机部门建立了适当的同事工作联盟。帕克对斯宾拉德五年计划的担忧始于<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch26.html.page379"></a>部分原因是，人们担心如果泰勒被允许接管 SSL，这些友好关系将会迅速瓦解。</p><p class="para">“That meant I needed to foster good relations between PARC and the development and engineering units of the copier division,” he said later. “Having a group of computer scientists, including their manager, who scoffed at and derided the copier engineers in Rochester did not help PARC develop such good relations.” Under Bert Sutherland the System Science Lab had forged a suitably collegial working alliance with the copier division. Pake’s alarm at Spinrad’s five-year plan had sprouted in <a></a>part from the thought of how swiftly those friendly ties would be obliterated if Taylor were allowed to take over SSL.</p>
<p class="para">这并不是否认，帕克也对泰勒对其研究员灵魂的强大个人影响力产生了深深的怀疑。“我认为泰勒与实验室成员的关系类似于吉姆·琼斯和琼斯镇邪教，”这是他非凡的回忆。一位高级研究员解释了他拒绝与泰勒实验室合作的原因，这肯定进一步加深了这种印象，如果不是激发了这种印象的话。“乔治，”这位研究员告诉帕克，“我可不愿意喝酷爱饮料。”</p><p class="para">Which is not to deny that Pake also had become deeply distrustful of Taylor’s powerful personal influence over his researcher’s souls. “I saw Taylor’s relationship to his lab members as analogous to Jim Jones and the Jonestown cult,” was his remarkable recollection. This impression must have been reinforced, if not inspired, by one senior researcher’s explanation for why he had turned down a chance to work with Taylor’s lab. “George,” the researcher told Pake, “I wouldn’t be willing to drink the Kool-Aid.”</p>
<p class="para">“我们非常了解泰勒与实验室成员之间的关系，”帕克后来说。“但我们不知道该怎么做。”</p><p class="para">“We understood very well Taylor’s relationship to his lab members,” Pake said later. “What we did not understand was what to do about it.”</p>
<p class="para">与此同时，斯宾塞肩负着让 Coyote Hill 实验室的所有人能够在相互礼貌的氛围中一起工作的重任。那年 8 月，为了缓解实验室负责人之间的怨恨，他不顾一切地在 Pajaro Dunes 召开了自己的会议。在 Alan Kay 的团队定期讨论数字未来的同一个地方，施乐 PARC 的高级实验室经理们在情绪上互相指责。直到凌晨两三点，他们还在发泄自己的情绪，就像格式塔疗法中的病人一样。“人们放松下来，谈论 PARC 真正的问题所在，”斯宾塞回忆道。这场辩论似乎很真诚。当沙丘上破晓时，他允许自己认为泰勒——他们抱怨最多的对象——终于意识到了自己的错误。</p><p class="para">Meanwhile, it fell to Spencer to get everyone on Coyote Hill working together in an atmosphere of mutual civility. That August, in a desperate attempt to ease the rancor among his lab chiefs, he convened his own offsite at Pajaro Dunes. There, in the same setting where Alan Kay’s group had regularly repaired to contemplate the digital future, the senior lab managers of Xerox PARC flayed each other in an emotional showdown. Until two or three in the morning they vented their feelings like patients in gestalt therapy. “People let their hair down to talk about what really were the problems at PARC,” Spencer recalled. The debate seemed honest and heartfelt. As dawn was breaking over the dunes, he allowed himself to think that Taylor—the target of most of their complaints—had finally realized the error of his ways.</p>
<p class="para">“鲍勃说，‘我以前从未听说过这些，’”斯宾塞说。“‘没有人告诉我我做错了什么。对不起，我不知道自己做了这些事。我会改正，不会再发生这种事了。’每个人都想，‘哇！我们解决了这个问题。现在我们可以回去开始做研究了。’”</p><p class="para">“Bob said, ‘I’ve never heard any of this before,’” Spencer said. “‘Nobody’s ever told me what I did wrong. I’m sorry, I didn’t know that I was doing these things. I’ll change and it will never happen again.’ Everybody thought, ‘Wow! We’ve solved the problem. Now we can go back and start doing research.’”</p>
<p class="para">但泰勒在这次务虚会上并没有带着同样的观点离开。他选择听取的不是对他个人行为的全面谴责，只是重提一些以前从未有人直接向他抱怨过的旧事。在这种情况下，他非常愿意为任何无意的误解道歉，让过去的事过去。</p><p class="para">But Taylor did not come away from the retreat with the same perspective. What he had chosen to hear was not a blanket condemnation of his personal behavior, only a rehashing of a few old incidents about which no one had ever directly complained to him before. On those terms he was perfectly willing to apologize for any inadvertent misunderstandings and let bygones be bygones.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch26.html.page380"></a>
<p class="para">无论如何，这种美好的感觉并没有持续多久。第二天，泰勒就出现在斯宾塞的办公室。斯宾塞回忆起这次会面，泰勒几乎否认了他做出的每一个承诺。“不要相信你昨晚听到的任何话，”他说，让斯宾塞目瞪口呆。“事情不会是这样的。”</p><p class="para">In any case, the era of good feelings did not last long. The very next day Taylor showed up in Spencer’s office. As Spencer recalls this encounter, Taylor all but disavowed every promise he had made. “Don’t believe anything you heard last night,” he said, leaving Spencer dumbfounded. “That isn’t the way it’s going to be.”</p>
<p class="para">泰勒回忆说，他当时的计划完全不同。他说，他只是急于纠正斯宾塞的一些行为，他认为斯宾塞被不公平地塑造成了反派。“我当然没有告诉他，‘嘿，我说这些话只是在胡说八道。’”</p><p class="para">Taylor recalls having a distinctly different agenda. He said he was merely anxious to set Spencer straight on some incidents in which he thought he had been cast unfairly as the villain. “I certainly did not tell him, ‘Hey, I was just bullshitting when I said such and such.’”</p>
<p class="para">无论如何，很明显，帕加罗沙丘的流血事件并没有产生斯宾塞所希望的宣泄。无论泰勒对最近的冲突有何看法，显然他并没有致力于改善他的内部关系。斯宾塞受够了。他决心以书面形式制定法律，并给泰勒一个改变其行为的最后期限。</p><p class="para">Either way, it was obvious that the Pajaro Dunes bloodletting had not produced the catharsis Spencer had hoped for. Whatever Taylor thought of the recent confrontation, clearly he was not committed to improving his intramural relationships. Spencer was fed up. He was determined to lay down the law, in writing, and give Taylor a hard deadline to alter his behavior.</p>
<p class="para">几天后，斯宾塞将泰勒叫到办公室，正式宣读了泰勒涉嫌违反良好企业行为准则的指控。他命令泰勒终止与竞争公司的任何联系；将实验室重组为多个部门，并设立一个中级管理层来监督它们；停止诋毁其他 PARC 实验室及其工作；最令人羞辱的是，每周一上午 9 点到斯宾塞办公室汇报<span class="smallCaps">他</span>实现这些目标的进展情况。</p><p class="para">A few days later he summoned Taylor to his office for a formal reading out of his alleged violations of good corporate conduct. He ordered Taylor to end any contact he had with competing companies; to reorganize his lab into sections and create an intermediate level of management to supervise them; to stop denigrating the other PARC labs and their work; and, most humiliating, to report to Spencer’s office every Monday at 9 <span class="smallCaps">A.M.</span> to discuss his progress toward those goals.</p>
<p class="para">斯宾塞语气生硬地表示，如果不能满足这些条件，泰勒可能会被解雇。然后，他给泰勒发了一份书面备忘录，上面反映了他所说的话，并附上一份禁令，即该文件是机密文件，他不得与任何人讨论其内容。</p><p class="para">Failure to fulfill those terms, Spencer said stiffly, could result in Taylor’s termination. Then he sent Taylor away with a written memo reflecting what he had said, along with the injunction that the document was confidential and he was not to discuss its contents with anyone.</p>
<p class="para">但泰勒让自己的人蒙在鼓里是不可想象的。当天下班前，他把包括萨克、米切尔和奥恩斯坦在内的最亲密的顾问叫到帕洛阿尔托的家中，把斯宾塞的备忘录分发给大家。他显得震惊和沮丧，仿佛意识到他的施乐生涯即将走到尽头。</p><p class="para">But for Taylor to leave his own people in the dark was unthinkable. Before the end of the day he called his closest advisors, including Thacker, Mitchell, and Ornstein, to his house in Palo Alto, where he handed Spencer’s memo around. He appeared stunned and dejected, as though recognizing that the final act in his Xerox career was playing out.</p>
<p class="para">“我不知道会发生什么，但事情已经很明显了，”他告诉他们。他似乎对禁止与其他公司达成交易的禁令特别不满，这是违反<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch26.html.page381"></a>他坚称自己是无辜的。“这就像是在告诉我不要再打我的妻子一样，”他说。</p><p class="para">“I don’t know what’s going to happen, but the handwriting’s on the wall,” he told them. He seemed to take particular umbrage at the injunction to cease seeking a deal with another company, an offense of <a></a>which he insisted he was innocent. “That’s like telling me to stop beating my wife,” he said.</p>
<p class="para">斯宾塞的备忘录促使泰勒的支持者向佩克发起了又一轮上诉，这一次他们明确警告说，迫使泰勒离开的后果将是 CSL 全体成员辞职。“一群知情人士向他们解释了如果他们这样做会发生什么，”兰普森说。“他们不相信我们，尽管很明显我们是这方面消息的来源，因为我们是即将离开的人。他们不相信我们，或者他们不在乎。”</p><p class="para">Spencer’s memo prompted Taylor’s supporters to stage another round of appeals to Pake, this time with explicit warnings that the upshot of forcing Taylor out would be wholesale resignations from CSL. “A whole bunch of people who were in a position to know went to them and very carefully explained what was going to happen if they did this,” Lampson said. “And they didn’t believe us, even though it was perfectly obvious that we were the source of knowledge on this subject because we were the people who were going to leave. They didn’t believe us, or they didn’t care.”</p>
<p class="para">泰勒本人认为只有一条上诉途径：直接向大卫·卡恩斯上诉。斯宾塞已经将即将发生的风波告知了卡恩斯，他当时已是施乐公司的首席执行官，斯宾塞向他发送了一份备忘录副本，并表示他希望卡恩斯支持备忘录中的条件。否则，他们中的一人——斯宾塞或泰勒——将不得不离开，“他可以选择哪一个。”当泰勒要求开会时，卡恩斯派他的首席技术官桑迪·坎贝尔来调解这场争吵。</p><p class="para">Taylor himself figured there was only one avenue of appeal: directly to David Kearns. Spencer had already apprised Kearns, by now the Xerox CEO, of the impending storm by sending him a copy of the memo with the notation that he expected Kearns to back him up on the conditions therein. Otherwise one of them—Spencer or Taylor—would have to go “and he could choose which one.” When Taylor asked for a meeting Kearns deputed his chief technical officer, Sandy Campbell, to mediate the quarrel.</p>
<p class="para">坎贝尔把斯宾塞和泰勒叫到斯坦福，进行了一场马拉松式的谈判，旨在解决这场“基于谁的膀胱更大”的争斗，斯宾塞说。早上八点半，他们聚集在坎贝尔的办公室，一边喝着咖啡和 Dr Pepper，一边滔滔不绝地表达着自己的不满。所有的旧问题都轮到他们了：泰勒的傲慢、他对预算份额过高的要求、他未能培养员工的管理才能。斯宾塞进一步指出，泰勒的顽固实际上阻碍了施乐的技术转让。</p><p class="para">Campbell called Spencer and Taylor to Stamford for a marathon parley aimed at resolving the battle “based on the principle,” as Spencer put it, “of who had the bigger bladder.” Convening in Campbell’s office at eight-thirty in the morning, they aired their grievances without respite, fueled only by coffee and Dr Pepper. All the old issues took their turn on the stage: Taylor’s arrogance, his demand for a disproportionate share of the budget, his failure to develop managerial talent on his staff. Spencer further suggested that Taylor by his intransigence had actually impeded technology transfer at Xerox.</p>
<p class="para">“我的回答是，从 CSL 到 SDD 的技术转移比计算历史上任何时候都要多，”泰勒回忆道，“因为 SDD 使用的每个工具都是从我们这里获得的。”</p><p class="para">“My response was that there was more technology transfer from CSL to SDD than ever in the history of computing,” Taylor recalled, “because every tool SDD used they got from us.”</p>
<p class="para">“但SDD失败了，”斯宾塞说。</p><p class="para">“But SDD failed,” Spencer said.</p>
<p class="para">“那不是我的错，”泰勒反驳道。“我被雇来开发我能做到的最好的技术。如果产品组没能利用我们的技术，那责任应该归咎于很多人，而不是我。”</p><p class="para">“That’s not my fault,” Taylor snapped back. “I was hired to produce the best technology I could. If the product group was not able to take advantage of our technology a lot of people are culpable, not me.”</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch26.html.page382"></a>
<p class="para">最后斯宾塞指责泰勒违反直接命令公开他的备忘录。那时已是下午两点，他们已经为此忙碌了五个多小时。</p><p class="para">Finally Spencer accused Taylor of making his memo public in contravention of a direct order. By then it was two in the afternoon and they had been hard at it for more than five hours.</p>
<p class="para">“你这么做了吗？”坎贝尔问泰勒。</p><p class="para">“Did you do that?” Campbell asked Taylor.</p>
<p class="para">“当然了，”泰勒轻松地回答道。为什么不呢？“难道有人会愚蠢到认为这个家伙会告诉我改变操作方式，而我不会向实验室解释这一点吗？”他后来评论道。“这太愚蠢了。”</p><p class="para">“Sure I did,” Taylor replied breezily. And why not? “Could anyone be foolish enough to think that this guy was going to tell me to change the way I operated and I’m not going to explain that to the lab?” he remarked later. “That’s stupid.”</p>
<p class="para">坎贝尔说完就结束了会面。泰勒和斯宾塞共乘一辆公司专车前往纽约肯尼迪机场，在长达一个多小时的旅途中，两人没有说一句话。当晚回国的商业航班上，两人相隔很远，默默地为最后的对峙做准备。</p><p class="para">On that note, Campbell broke up the meeting. Taylor and Spencer shared a corporate car to New York’s Kennedy Airport without exchanging a single word during the more-than-hour-long trip. On the commercial flight home that evening they sat far apart, silently preparing for the final confrontation.</p>

<p class="para">泰勒在 9 月 19 日星期一早上召集他的实验室成员到豆袋室时，提前向灰胡子透露了他的议程。CSL 的其他人只能猜测泰勒为什么会在如此不寻常的日子和时间打电话给迪勒。他们越来越惊慌地听着，他们中许多人认识的唯一一位老板重述了他职业生涯的巅峰，眼含泪水，情绪激动。他的一些观点他之前在另一份备忘录中提到过，当时斯宾塞也在场。</p><p class="para">Taylor had tipped the Greybeards in advance to his agenda when he summoned his lab the following Monday morning, September 19, to the beanbag room. The rest of CSL could only guess why Taylor had called Dealer for such an unusual day and hour. They listened in mounting consternation as the only boss many of them had ever known recapitulated the high points of his career, teary-eyed and emotional. Several of his points he had earlier made in a separate memo to Spencer, who was present.</p>

<p class="para">在斯宾塞不安的目光下，泰勒继续重提最近的一系列会面和冲突。然后说出了致命的话语。</p><p class="para">Under Spencer’s uneasy gaze, Taylor proceeded to rehash the recent sequence of meetings and confrontations. Then came the fatal words.</p>
<p class="para">“我想让大家知道，我已经递交了辞呈，”说完他就走了出去。</p><p class="para">“I want you all to know I’ve handed in my resignation,” he said, and walked out.</p>
<p class="para">房间里顿时一片寂静。斯宾塞不明智地开始发言，正如一位与会者后来回忆的那样，“他试图继续会议，好像刚才发生的事情只是例行公事，现在是时候开始讨论新问题了。”</p><p class="para">A stunned hush descended on the room. Spencer unwisely took the floor and, as one participant later remembered, “tried to continue the meeting as though what had happened was routine and it was now time to move on to new business.”</p>
<p class="para">相反，房间里爆发出愤怒，所有的怒火都直指他。“我<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch26.html.page383"></a>“我从来没有见过一个成年男子被四十个人同时这样拉屎，”塞韦罗·奥恩斯坦说。“我几乎为他感到难过——只是我对他非常生气。”</p><p class="para">Instead the room exploded in fury, all of it aimed directly at him. “I <a></a>have never watched a grown man be shat upon like that by forty people at once,” said Severo Ornstein. “I almost felt sorry for him—except that I was so angry at him.”</p>
<p class="para">绝望的斯宾塞试图以暴徒般的忍耐力面对听众。他辩称，泰勒的离开并不一定意味着实验室运营方式或工作方式的重大转变，这只是暂时的，很快就会克服。没有人相信他的话。突然，一个洪亮的声音响起。</p><p class="para">The desperate Spencer tried to hold his own against an audience with all the forbearance of a lynch mob. He argued that Taylor’s departure need not represent a major shift in the way the lab was run or a change in their work, that it was a temporary blip soon to be overcome. No one was buying the line. Suddenly a stentorian voice rang out.</p>

<p class="para">所有人的头都转向了爆发的源头。查克·撒克站了起来。他用工程师在那个激动人心的时刻能想到的最精确的措辞告诉斯宾塞，他刚刚犯下了一生中最严重的错误。他环顾四周。他说，他希望他即将做的事不会被当作榜样或暗示给其他人；这是一份个人声明，他希望人们这样看待它。</p><p class="para">All heads swiveled to the source of the outburst. Chuck Thacker had risen to his feet. In the most precise terms an engineer’s engineer could summon to his lips at that fervid moment, he informed Spencer that he had just committed the gravest mistake of his life. His eyes swept the room. He said he hoped what he was about to do would not be taken as a model or a hint to anyone else; it was a personal statement and he wished it to be viewed that way.</p>
<p class="para">然后他说，“我辞职。”并跟着泰勒出了门。</p><p class="para">Then he said, “I resign,” and followed Taylor out the door.</p>
<p class="para">斯宾塞目瞪口呆。泰勒辞职是他早有准备的，而萨克却突然辞职。随着会议中爆发出更多的指责，他失去了仅存的控制力。</p><p class="para">Spencer was dumbfounded. Taylor’s resignation he was prepared for; Thacker’s came out of nowhere. As the meeting erupted in further recriminations he lost what remained of his grip.</p>
<p class="para">“我该怎么做才能纠正这个问题？”他大声问道。</p><p class="para">“What can I do to rectify this?” he asked aloud.</p>
<p class="para">一个声音从房间后面的白板旁传来——他不知道是谁的声音——喊道：“你他妈的可以<span class="italic">辞职</span>！”</p><p class="para">A voice from the back of the room, over by the whiteboards—he never learned whose it was—called out: “You can fucking <span class="italic">resign</span>!”</p>
<p class="para">斯宾塞咬紧牙关回答道：“这是公司的选择，不是我。”他感到震惊和羞辱，于是离开了。</p><p class="para">His jaw set, Spencer replied, “The company made this choice, not me.” Shaken and humiliated, he departed.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">“斯宾塞解雇了泰勒，”巴特勒·兰普森后来说。“泰勒被解雇了，他并没有辞职，不管你认为从技术上讲发生了什么。他们创造了一个他必须辞职的环境。他们告诉他，你必须做以下十二件事。基本上就是每个星期一早上去比尔·斯宾塞的办公室拍他的马屁。”</p><p class="para">“Spencer fired Taylor,” Butler Lampson said later. “Taylor got fired, he didn’t resign, no matter what you think happened technically. They created an environment within which he had to resign. They told him, you must do the following twelve things. Basically what it came down to was going into Bill Spencer’s office every Monday morning to lick his boots.”</p>
<p class="para">值得赞扬的是，卡恩斯同意了灰胡子们随后提出的紧急觐见请求。他大概知道泰勒被赶下台对计算机科学界产生了怎样的影响，因为他<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch26.html.page384"></a>收到了数十位顶尖学术研究人员的电报和信件——仿佛泰勒的整个 ARPA 军队都起来抗议了。然而，作为一家与日本人陷入末日战争的公司指挥官，他对 PARC 自我放纵的知识分子的同情必然是克制的。他更愿意将这场骚乱视为高管下令下属参与该项目的不幸结果。如果泰勒拒绝，他就必须离开。</p><p class="para">Kearns, to his credit, granted the Greybeards’ subsequent request for an emergency audience. Presumably he was aware of how Taylor’s ouster had played in the computer science community, because he had <a></a>been inundated with telegrams and letters from dozens of top academic researchers—as though Taylor’s entire ARPA army had risen in protest. Nevertheless, as the commanding officer of a company locked in apocalyptic battle with the Japanese, his sympathy for the self-indulgent eggheads of PARC was necessarily restrained. He preferred to view the flap as the unfortunate result of an executive’s ordering a subordinate quite properly to get with the program. If Taylor refused, he had to go.</p>
<p class="para">而灰胡子军则并不幻想卡恩斯会推翻斯宾塞的决定。这件事本身就具有不可逆转性；正如奥恩斯坦所反映的那样，恢复泰勒的职位将“完全无法控制”。但他们秉持沉默只会更糟糕的原则飞往东部，因此他们坚持这么做了。</p><p class="para">For their part, the Greybeards were under no great illusion that Kearns would overrule Spencer. The very episode carried within itself its own irrevocability; as Ornstein reflected, a reinstated Taylor would have been “completely unmanageable.” But having flown East on the principle that silence would only be worse, they went through with it.</p>
<p class="para">因此，他们与卡恩斯和麦科洛（当时仍是董事会主席）一起度过了一个毫无意义的早晨。奥恩斯坦发现自己像念咒语一样在卡恩斯耳边重复道：“这个实验室将在六个月内消失。”第三次，卡恩斯转过身，目光冷峻地看着他，简短地说：“我听到了。”</p><p class="para">Thus they spent a futile morning with Kearns and McColough, who was still chairman of the board. Ornstein found himself repeating in Kearns’s ear, like a mantra, “This lab will be gone inside of six months.” The third time, Kearns turned to him with a steely glare and said curtly: “I heard you.”</p>
<p class="para">“我离开时想，他会支持他的队员们，”奥恩斯坦回忆道。</p><p class="para">“I came away thinking, he’ll back his guys,” Ornstein recalled.</p>
<p class="para">员工大批离职确实如他们所料，尽管不是立即发生的。萨克立即离职，去一家初创公司工作，推销他发明的寻呼设备，而其他许多 CSL 员工则推迟辞职，直到年底，届时他们的奖金、退休金、股票期权和其他福利将在 1983 年兑现。</p><p class="para">The exodus did occur as they predicted, although not instantaneously. While Thacker left immediately to work with a startup company marketing a paging device he had invented, many other CSL staff members deferred their resignations until after the end of the year, when their bonuses, retirement credit, stock options, and other perks would vest for 1983.</p>
<p class="para">但随后，人才的闸门打开了。“在 1 月的头几周，每天会有两三人辞职，因为人们已经四处寻找了。”沃伦·泰特曼回忆道。“我们会站在走廊里，不敢看我们的电子邮件，因为邮件上只会说，我们今天失去了两位首席科学家和三位高级科学家。”</p><p class="para">But then the floodgates opened. “During that first couple of weeks in January there were like two or three resignations a day, because people had already done their looking around,” Warren Teitelman remembered. “We would stand out in the halls afraid to read our e-mail, because it would only say, well, we lost two principal scientists and three senior scientists today.”</p>
<p class="para">毫无疑问，鲍勃·泰勒的老板低估了——更关键的是，误解了——他与实验室成员的关系。在行政层面上，他把企业政治工作交给了杰里·艾尔金德；在技术层面上，他在很大程度上<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch26.html.page385"></a>泰勒的光芒被巴特勒·兰普森所掩盖（几乎所有其他人也是如此）。但他的角色总是更微妙，而且注定会因从实验室内部还是外部来看而有所不同。泰勒创造了他的工程师和科学家赖以开展工作的栖息地。他不仅是他们与施乐公司平凡事务之间的缓冲，也是所有关于他们傲慢和精英主义的抱怨中不可或缺的避雷针。</p><p class="para">There can be little doubt that Bob Taylor’s bosses underestimated—and more critically, misunderstood—his relationship with his laboratory members. On an administrative level he had ceded the job of corporate politicking to Jerry Elkind; on a technical level he was vastly <a></a>overshadowed by Butler Lampson (as was almost everyone else). But his role was always more subtle, and bound to seem different depending on whether it was viewed from within the lab or without. Taylor had created the very habitat that his engineers and scientists depended on to pursue their work. He was not only the buffer between them and the mundane concerns of corporate Xerox, but the indispensable lightning rod for all the complaints about their arrogance and elitism.</p>
<p class="para">“泰勒牺牲了他在施乐的职业生涯，这样我们就不会看到这么多废话，”艾伦·凯后来评论道。这种情绪得到了广泛的认同。这在很大程度上解释了他们对泰勒的忠诚（即使是那些与他发生过冲突的人），甚至更解释了他们担心泰勒离开后事情会发生翻天覆地的变化。</p><p class="para">“Taylor sacrificed a lot of his career at Xerox so we wouldn’t see a lot of the bullshit,” Alan Kay remarked later. This sentiment was widely shared. It accounted for much of their loyalty to him (even among those with whom he had clashed), and even more for their fear that things would be immeasurably different once he was gone.</p>
<p class="para">他的辞职标志着 PARC 的一个时代的结束，一些人认为，也许这是正确的，这个时代已经走到了尽头。对于斯宾塞和帕克来说，泰勒不仅仅是 CSL 特权的激烈倡导者；他还是一个僵化政权的捍卫者。</p><p class="para">His resignation marked the passing of an era at PARC that some people believed, perhaps correctly, had run out its string anyway. To Spencer and Pake, Taylor was not merely the strident exponent of CSL privilege; he was the defender of a stultified regime.</p>
<p class="para">“我知道我们失去员工的风险很高，”斯宾塞回忆道。“但到了 1980 年，研究中心真的停滞不前了。所以你曾经有过这种充满想象力的奇妙爆发，巨大的能量爆发，但到那时它已经死了。我有一种感觉，我们正在倒退。绝对的，这个地方需要改变。</p><p class="para">“I knew there was a high risk we would lose people,” Spencer recalled. “But by 1980 the research center had really come dead in the water. So you’d had this wonderful burst of imaginative things, a great burst of energy, and by that time it was dead. I had a feeling we were going backwards. Absolutely, the place needed a change.</p>
<p class="para">“如果我有选择的话，我不会选择失去所有这些计算机科学家。但现在回想起来，这也许是件好事。”</p><p class="para">“If I had had my choice I would not have chosen to lose all of those computer scientists. But in retrospect, it may have been a good thing.”</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">与此同时，泰勒为新实验室找到了赞助商。正如帕克和斯宾塞所怀疑的那样，赞助商不是惠普，而是数字设备公司，该公司是多年前 CSL 与施乐公司第一次发生争执的 PDP-10 小型计算机的制造商。“数字设备公司打电话问我是否愿意提供咨询，”泰勒说。“然后他们的三个房地产人员来了，问我们应该在哪里建实验室？”</p><p class="para">Taylor meanwhile found a sponsor for a new lab. It was not Hewlett-Packard, as Pake and Spencer suspected, but Digital Equipment Corp., the maker of the PDP-10 minicomputer that had caused CSL’s very first flap with Xerox so many long years before. “DEC called to ask if I would consult,” Taylor said. “Then three of their real estate people showed up and asked: Where should we build the lab?”</p>
<p class="para">泰勒选择了帕洛阿尔托市中心附近的一个地点，位于斯坦福校园远离 PARC 的一侧，最终吸引了 15 名 CSL 员工，其中包括 Thacker 和 Lampson，他们来到了 DEC 系统研究中心，由罗伯特·W·泰勒 (Robert W. Taylor) 担任主任。如此多的顶尖科学家移民到一个地方，终于引起了卡恩斯的注意。他和他的得力助手<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch26.html.page386"></a>比尔·格拉文 (Bill Glavin) 飞到波士顿郊外的 DEC 总部，恳求其创始人兼首席执行官肯·奥尔森 (Ken Olson) 停止对 PARC 的突袭。他们甚至发出了一个相当愚蠢的警告，称施乐目前是 DEC 的一个非常大的客户。</p><p class="para">Selecting a site near downtown Palo Alto, on the far side of the Stanford campus from PARC, Taylor ultimately attracted fifteen CSL staff, among them Thacker and Lampson, to the DEC Systems Research Center, Robert W. Taylor, director. The emigration of so many top scientists to one place finally got Kearns’s attention. He and his right-hand man, <a></a>Bill Glavin, flew to DEC headquarters outside Boston to implore Ken Olson, its founder and CEO, to halt the raid on PARC. They even delivered a rather fatuous warning that Xerox was a very large DEC customer…for the moment.</p>
<p class="para">威胁并未成真。但正如卡恩斯后来回忆的那样，几年后，奥尔森在一次公司首席执行官会议上把他拉到一边，抱怨帕洛阿尔托 SRC 的工程师们思想独立。</p><p class="para">Nothing ever came of the threat. But as Kearns later recounted, a few years later Olson pulled him aside at a corporate chief executive’s conference to complain about the Palo Alto SRC’s independent-minded engineers.</p>
<p class="para">他抱怨道：“我们与该集团的合作遇到了一些困难，现在我们正试图将他们与商业战略更直接地联系起来。”</p><p class="para">“We’re having some difficulty with the group,” he griped, “now that we’re trying to tie them more directly to the business strategy.”</p>
<p class="para">卡恩斯笑了。“肯，”他说，“这就是你一开始得到它们的原因。”</p><p class="para">Kearns chuckled. “Ken,” he said, “that’s how you got them in the first place.”</p>
<p class="para">与此同时，斯宾塞的任务是恢复数十名 PARC 工程师的士气，这些工程师对泰勒的离职感到震惊和不安。泰勒离职后不久，斯宾塞加入了学习研究小组，该小组参加了最后一次帕加罗沙丘静修会。</p><p class="para">Spencer, meanwhile, was left with the task of restoring the morale of dozens of PARC engineers shocked and upset at Taylor’s departure. Shortly after the ouster he joined the Learning Research Group at one of its last Pajaro Dunes retreats.</p>
<p class="para">变革的气氛再强烈不过了。凯和他丰富的想象力都消失了。阿黛尔·戈德堡和戴夫·罗布森出版了 Smalltalk 的第一本商业指南，施乐公司已将其正式向公众发布。</p><p class="para">The atmosphere of change could not have been stronger. Kay and his fecund imagination were gone. Adele Goldberg and Dave Robson had published the first commercial guide to Smalltalk, which Xerox had officially released to the public.</p>
<p class="para">PARC 原有的三个实验室分裂为六个，包括约翰·西利·布朗领导的智能系统实验室——从 SSL 中分离出来，改名为戈德堡领导的系统概念实验室。除了光学科学实验室仍由约翰·乌尔巴赫领导外，原 PARC 所有实验室都更换了经理。</p><p class="para">PARC’s original three laboratories had fissioned into six, including the Intelligent Systems Laboratory under John Seely Brown—spun off from SSL, which was recast as the System Concepts Laboratory under Goldberg. With the exception of the Optical Science Laboratory, which was still headed by John Urbach, all of the original PARC labs had new managers.</p>
<p class="para">斯宾塞认为自己有责任向艾伦·凯的旧团队传达世界已经发生了多大的变化。杰克·戈德曼和乔治·帕克的 PARC 已经不复存在，研究人员可以凭直觉进入一个新世界，而丝毫不关心公司的命令。帕克最初的最后期限——施乐公司看到 PARC 成果之前的十年宽限期——已经过去了。在此期间，该中心向该公司提供了激光打印机、以太网和 Star 技术，但还有更多的事情要做。从今以后，研究人员必须扮演一个<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_ch26.html.page387"></a>更直接地帮助公司利用他们的知识。像泰勒这样的人，他的世界观认为科学研究和公司利润是两种相互对立的力量，现在却成了阻碍。</p><p class="para">Spencer took it as his duty to communicate to Alan Kay’s old group how different the world had become. The PARC of Jack Goldman and George Pake, of researchers following their instincts into a new world without the least concern for corporate imperatives, was gone. Pake’s original deadline—the ten-year grace period before Xerox would see results from PARC—had passed. In that time the center had given the company the laser printer, Ethernet, and the technology of the Star, but there was more to do. Henceforth the researchers would have to play a <a></a>more direct role in helping the company exploit their knowledge. People like Taylor, with his worldview of scientific research and corporate profit as two somehow antagonistic forces, were now in the way.</p>
<p class="para">“我仍能想象到自己和斯宾塞坐在台阶上，望着沙丘和水面，”黛安娜·梅里回忆道。“我试图让他向我解释为什么他认为必须把泰勒赶出去。</p><p class="para">“I can still see myself sitting with Spencer on the steps looking out at the dunes, toward the water,” recalled Diana Merry. “I was trying to get him to explain to me why he thought he had to push Taylor out.</p>
<p class="para">“他说，‘嗯，你知道，他就是不愿意在球队里打球。’”</p><p class="para">“He said, ‘Well, you know, he just wouldn’t play on the team.’”</p>

<p class="para">演讲者是史蒂夫·乔布斯，他曾在 1996 年接受过一部关于个人电脑历史的公共电视纪录片的采访。这种严厉批评已是家常便饭。几乎所有了解 PARC 成就的人也都听过这样的推论：施乐公司发明了当今个人电脑的基础技术，却犯下了让这项技术从自己手中溜走的重大错误。</p><p class="para">The speaker is Steve Jobs, interviewed for a 1996 public television documentary on the history of the personal computer. The castigation is familiar fare. Almost everyone aware of PARC’s achievements also has heard the corollary that Xerox, having invented the technology underlying present-day personal computing, committed the monumental blunder of letting it slip through its fingers.</p>
<p class="para">施乐公司在开发新技术方面极其笨拙，这种形象具有好莱坞高概念情节剧的无可争辩的魅力，其中的主角是令人眼花缭乱的创新的发明者，而反派则是企业官僚主义的死对头。记录当然是令人震惊的：施乐公司拥有 Alto；IBM 推出了个人电脑。施乐公司拥有带鼠标、图标和重叠窗口的图形用户界面；苹果和微软推出了 Macintosh 和 Windows。施乐公司发明了所见即所得的文字处理；微软厚颜无耻地将其变成了 Microsoft Word，<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_bm01.html.page390"></a>征服了办公市场。施乐发明了以太网；如今，网络硬件行业的市场份额之争是思科系统和 3Com 之间的较量。即使是激光打印机也是一种有瑕疵的胜利。由于施乐犹豫了五年才将其推向市场，IBM 抢先一步，于 1975 年推出了自己的机型。</p><p class="para">This image of Xerox as a company uniquely maladroit at exploiting a new technology offers the incontestable allure of a high-concept Hollywood melodrama, in which the protagonists are the inventors of dazzling innovations and the villain is the dead hand of corporate bureaucracy. The record is certainly damning: Xerox had the Alto; IBM launched the Personal Computer. Xerox had the graphical user interface with mouse, icons, and overlapping windows; Apple and Microsoft launched the Macintosh and Windows. Xerox invented What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get word processing; Microsoft brazenly turned it into Microsoft Word and <a></a>conquered the office market. Xerox invented the Ethernet; today the battle for market share in the networking hardware industry is between Cisco Systems and 3Com. Even the laser printer is a tainted triumph. Thanks to the five years Xerox dithered in bringing it to market, IBM got there first, introducing its own model in 1975.</p>
<p class="para">这部传奇故事也不乏喜剧元素。鲍勃·波特在成本分析战中击败了约翰·埃伦比，然后又因为一台过时的机器在市场战中落败；哈罗德·霍尔用十名二手员工推出了公司影响最深远的新产品计划；吉姆·奥尼尔否决了将五台打印机出售给劳伦斯利弗莫尔国家实验室，因为这可能会在合同期内花费施乐公司 15 万美元，而当时该公司的年利润超过 3.5 亿美元。</p><p class="para">Nor does the saga lack aspects of comic opera. There is Bob Potter beating John Ellenby in the battle of cost analysis, then losing the battle of the marketplace with an obsolescent machine; Harold Hall launching the company’s most far-reaching new product initiative with a second-hand staff of ten; Jim O’Neill vetoing the sale of five printers to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory because it might cost Xerox $150,000 over the contract term, in a period when the company’s profits ran at more than $350 million a year.</p>
<p class="para">当 PARC 的一项发明在施乐的决策下幸存下来并进入市场时，决定性因素通常是一位执着的拥护者将自己的职业生涯置于危险之中。人们会想到 9700 激光打印机的艰难酝酿：杰克·戈德曼 (Jack Goldman) 让两位高管飞往 PARC，在最后一刻展示其优于基于 CRT 的“超级打印机”，随后杰克·刘易斯 (Jack Lewis) 连续三次无视终止该项目的指令。在公司未来悬而未决的数十个场合中，决定公司决策的因素不是技术和机会，而是个性和政治。</p><p class="para">When a PARC invention survived Xerox decision-making and reached the market, the determining factor was usually a stubborn champion placing his career on the line. One thinks of the difficult gestation of the 9700 laser printer: Jack Goldman flying two executives to PARC for an eleventh-hour demonstration of its superiority over the CRT-based “Superprinter,” followed by Jack Lewis’s ignoring three successive directives to kill the project. The factors governing the corporation’s decision-making on dozens of occasions when its future hung in the balance were not technologies and opportunities, but personalities and politics.</p>
<p class="para">然而，像多年来人们所做的那样，将 PARC 技术的好坏命运完全归咎于施乐的失误，这是误导。它鼓励其他人相信，只要有意愿，先进新技术的商业化很容易；而且一家公司在高科技市场的早期主导地位将使其在未来几十年内获得不可撼动的竞争优势。它预设了一家公司应该能够收回其在所有基础研究上的投资——这种心态注定不会使公司资助的基础研究更有效，而只会减少。它忽视了施乐至今对 PARC 的慷慨资助——尽管 SDS 已经消失，而该研究中心正是为 SDS 服务的。</p><p class="para">Yet to chalk up the mixed fate of PARC’s technologies purely to Xerox’s blundering, as has been done for many years, is misleading. It encourages others to believe that the commercializing of advanced new technologies is easy, provided only that one has the will to do so; and that a company’s early domination of a high-tech market will reward it with an unassailable competitive advantage for decades to follow. It presupposes that a corporation should invariably be able to recoup its investment in all its basic research—a mindset bound to lead not to more effective corporate-funded basic research but simply to less of it. And it overlooks Xerox’s generous funding of PARC to this day—despite the extinction of SDS, which the research center had been created to serve.</p>

<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_bm01.html.page391"></a>
<p class="para">有人认为施乐公司浪费了垄断个人电脑业务的黄金机会，用 1988 年的一份案例研究的标题来说，它“错失了未来”，这种观点基于几个非常值得怀疑的假设。其中之一是，任何公司都可以长期控制如此多样化的行业。事实上，个人电脑技术的商业优势非常反复无常。</p><p class="para">The notion that Xerox squandered a golden opportunity to monopolize the personal computer business—that it “fumbled the future,” to para-phrase the title of a 1988 case study—rests on several very questionable assumptions. One is that any company can control so polymorphous an industry for very long. The fact is, the technologies of personal computing bestow their commercial favors with great capriciousness.</p>
<p class="para">只要看看那些曾经声称在计算领域处于领先地位的公司名单，就能明白这项技术如何坚决地挫败其驯服者。IBM 个人电脑于 1981 年推出后几乎立即成为行业标准；然而，截至撰写本文时，IBM 在台式个人电脑领域的市场份额<span class="italic">微乎其微</span>。苹果电脑的 Macintosh 是 PARC 设计原则最成功的商业体现，于 1983 年推出，到 1985 年成为全球最受欢迎的个人电脑；苹果电脑非但没有利用这一优势打造持久的特许经营权，反而犯了一系列管理失误，如今甚至让人怀疑它的存在。 （当史蒂夫·乔布斯如此自信地批评施乐公司在 PBS 上的表现时，他的老东家的市场份额自 Macintosh 推出以来首次跌至个位数。它很快就突破了这个可疑的里程碑。）AT&amp;T、索尼、甚至埃克森美孚都试图通过在尖端技术的包装上投入营销力量来抢占个人电脑业务的份额，但都遭遇了令人尴尬的失败。</p><p class="para">One need look no further than the roster of companies that at one time or another claimed a lead in computing to see how resolutely the technology foils its tamers. The IBM Personal Computer became the industry standard almost instantly upon its introduction in 1981; yet as of this writing IBM’s market share in desktop personal computers <span class="italic">is</span> infinitesimal. Apple Computer’s Macintosh, the most successful commercial expression of PARC’s design principles, was launched in 1983 and by 1985 ranked as the world’s most popular personal computer; far from parlaying that advantage into a lasting franchise, Apple committed a series of management blunders that today leave its very existence in doubt. (At the very moment Steve Jobs was so self-confidently critiquing Xerox’s performance for PBS, his old company was sinking toward a single-digit market share for the first time since the launch of the Macintosh. It soon breached this dubious milestone.) AT&amp;T, Sony, even Exxon all tried to grab a share of the PC business by throwing their marketing muscle behind the packaging of cutting-edge technology, and all suffered embarrassing flops.</p>
<p class="para">在撰写本文时，微软仍然是计算机行业最强大的力量。它之所以能取得这一地位，并非因为硬件，而是因为（正如巴特勒·兰普森、艾伦·凯和鲍勃·泰勒所预测的那样）软件的力量。然而，微软并非没有挑战，这些挑战可能有一天会让它遭遇与 IBM 相同的命运，后者的市场地位曾被认为无懈可击。这些挑战包括政府的反垄断攻击、新技术平台的出现（微软在这些平台上的主导地位并不绝对）、娱乐“内容”和有线电视服务中令人分心且成本高昂的调情。明天可能会带来新的、意想不到的威胁。微软本身是否会成为“微软”<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_bm01.html.page392"></a>用史蒂夫·乔布斯的话来说，“九十年代的辉煌”要到千禧年之后才能为人所知。</p><p class="para">At this writing Microsoft remains the single most formidable force in the computer industry. This position it achieved thanks not to hardware but (as Butler Lampson, Alan Kay, and Bob Taylor predicted would happen) to the power of software. Yet Microsoft is not without challenges that may someday condemn it to the same fate as IBM, whose market position was once considered every bit as unassailable. These challenges include an antitrust attack by the government, the appearance of new technology platforms in which its dominion is less than absolute, and distracting and costly dalliances in entertainment “content” and cable television services. Tomorrow may bring new, unexpected threats. Whether Microsoft itself will be the “Microsoft of <a></a>the nineties,” in Steve Jobs’s phrase, will not be known until well after the turn of the millennium.</p>
<p class="para">另一个可疑的假设是，施乐公司仅凭其规模和营销头脑，就应该能够满足将 Alto、以太网和数十项其他孤儿 PARC 创新商业化的需求。这一论点通常被表达为一个问题：“如果小苹果公司可以销售个人电脑，为什么大施乐公司不能呢？”</p><p class="para">Another dubious assumption is that Xerox, simply by dint of its size and marketing savvy, should have been well up to the demands of commercializing the Alto, Ethernet, and dozens of other orphaned PARC innovations. This argument is most often expressed as a question: “If little Apple could sell personal computers, why couldn’t big Xerox?”</p>
<p class="para">答案当然是，苹果之所以能够销售这款个人电脑，并不是因为其规模小，而是<span class="italic">因为</span>它规模小。</p><p class="para">The answer, of course, is that Apple was able to market the PC not in spite of its small size, but <span class="italic">because</span> of it.</p>
<p class="para">将一项激进的新技术商业化通常意味着将公司押注于其结果。1981 年，这对施乐和苹果来说有着截然不同的意义。施乐雇用了 125,000 名员工，苹果雇用了 40 名员工。施乐的全体员工几乎都专注于销售一种产品：办公复印机。他们代表了数十年来公司在嵌入式培训、技术和客户服务方面的投资——数亿美元。</p><p class="para">Commercializing a radical new technology often means betting the company on the outcome. In 1981 this had decidedly different meanings for Xerox and Apple. Xerox employed 125,000 workers, Apple forty. Virtually Xerox’s entire workforce was focused on selling one type of product: the office copier. They represented decades of corporate investment—hundreds of millions of dollars—in embedded training, technology, and customer service.</p>
<p class="para">如果复印机和计算机的客户群相同，这也许不是什么障碍。但在很大程度上，它们完全不同。整个 20 世纪 80 年代，复印机通常都是大批量机器，设计用于安装在职员和秘书所在的中央复印室。它们由负责打字机和电话采购的同一批经理订购。但计算机是系统，旨在支持企业专业人员向上一级或两级发展。计算机的采购属于新一类专业信息经理的管辖，而施乐公司工资单上的复印机销售员队伍对这类人完全陌生。</p><p class="para">This might not have been an impediment if the customer bases for copiers and computers were identical. But for the most part they were quite different. Through the 1980s, copiers typically were high-volume machines designed to be installed in central copy rooms inhabited by clerks and secretaries. They were ordered by the same managers who handled the purchases of typewriters and telephones. But computers were systems, designed to support corporate professionals a rung or two further up the ladder. Their purchasing came under the jurisdiction of a new category of professional information manager, a breed entirely unfamiliar to the platoons of copier salesmen on Xerox’s payroll.</p>
<p class="para">显然，苹果没有遇到上述任何问题。苹果年轻而敏捷，完全有能力从头开始建立合适的工厂和以计算机为导向的销售队伍——就像施乐 15 年前选择将另一项创新且可疑的技术商业化时所做的那样。事实上，这两家公司的关系完美地诠释了约瑟夫·熊彼特在 20 世纪 30 年代提出的工业进化“创造性破坏”模型，在这个模型中，企业家机会主义者从不合时宜的前辈手中抢夺市场。</p><p class="para">Apple, obviously, faced none of these issues. Young and agile, it was in a perfect position to build suitable factories and a computer-oriented sales force from the ground up—just as Xerox had been when it chose to commercialize another innovative and suspect technology, fifteen years earlier. In fact, the two companies’ relationship perfectly illustrates the “creative destruction” model of industrial evolution proposed by Joseph Schumpeter in the 1930s, in which entrepreneurial opportunists snatch markets away from their anachronistic precursors.</p>
<p class="para">此外，计算机并不适合定价制度<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_bm01.html.page393"></a>许多人认为这是施乐最重要的发明：租赁复印机并按页向客户收费。当 250 名施乐销售人员在未来日考虑 Alto 并想知道“点击在哪里？”时，他们提出了一个与旧机器和新机器之间的根本区别有关的问题。为了销售计算机，施乐不仅要制造一种新型机器，还要建立一种新的系统来补偿和激励其 100,000 多名销售主管。改造工厂、重新培训工厂工人和销售人员以及适应新客户群体的心态，这些综合任务就像在海洋中调转超级油轮的方向一样。</p><p class="para">Computers, moreover, did not lend themselves to the pricing regime <a></a>that many considered Xerox’s most important invention: leasing the copiers and charging customers by the page. When 250 Xerox salesmen contemplated the Alto on Futures Day and wondered, “Where’s the click?” they were asking a question fundamental to the difference between the old machines and the new. To sell computers, Xerox would not only have to build a new kind of machine, but also a new system of compensating and motivating its more than 100,000 sales executives. The combined task of retooling plants, retraining factory workers and salesmen, and adjusting to the mentality of a new set of customers resembled that of turning a supertanker around in mid-ocean.</p>
<p class="para">历史表明，很少有公司能够像施乐公司试图转型为计算机公司那样彻底地重塑自我。有多少家领先的美国公司在工业技术多次革命中幸存下来，并在商业金字塔的顶端停留了二三十年以上？除了通用电气和惠普等常年领先者外，这样的例子很少。更常见的模式是，一家公司在最终被无法控制的变化击败之前，会经历一两次艰难的尝试——因为企业达尔文主义无情地确保了新创业公司永远存在机会，这些公司将不断涌现并培育出造就每一代人未来的技术。</p><p class="para">History suggests that corporations are seldom able to remake themselves as thoroughly as a Xerox trying to turn into a computer company. How many leading American corporations have survived multiple revolutions in industrial technology to stay atop the business pyramid for more than two or three decades? With the exception of perennial leaders such as General Electric and, possibly, Hewlett-Packard, the examples are scarce. The more usual pattern is that a company is granted one or two runs at the fence before it is finally overmatched by changes beyond its control—as a sort of corporate Darwinism ruthlessly ensures that openings will always exist for fresh entrepreneurial companies to arise and nurture the technologies that make every generation’s future.</p>
<p class="para">即使在最好的情况下，20 世纪 70 和 80 年代的施乐公司也不具备开发新技术的潜力，因为它受到企业文化和商业环境的双重负担所制约。</p><p class="para">Even under the best circumstances, the Xerox of the 1970s and 1980s was not a promising candidate to exploit a new technology, governed as it was by the twin burdens of its culture and its business environment.</p>
<p class="para">施乐公司的文化形成于押注于一个长远目标并见证其成功。对于施乐公司来说，静电复印技术的惊人、瞬间的成功一直是一种祸害。虽然它给公司带来了巨额财富，但它却让管理层忽视了一个事实：有时市场需要时间来吸收新技术。</p><p class="para">Its culture was formed by betting on a long shot and seeing it come up trumps. For Xerox the spectacular, instantaneous success of xerography has always been something of a mixed curse. While it brought the company fabulous wealth, it blinded management to the fact that sometimes the marketplace needs time to absorb new technologies.</p>
<p class="para">施乐公司前首席技术官保罗·斯特拉斯曼 (Paul Strassmann) 认为，施乐公司“从根本上受到了切斯特·卡尔森 (Chester Carlson) 愿景的诅咒”。“这是一种完美的概念，你只需要给我们正确的技术，整个世界就会来到我们身边。不幸的是，当事情发生时，这只是一个侥幸。”</p><p class="para">Xerox “fundamentally was cursed by the Chester Carlson vision,” contends its former chief technology officer, Paul Strassmann. “This is the immaculate conception view that all you have to do is give us the right technology and the whole world will come to us. Unfortunately, when it happens like that it’s a fluke.”</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_bm01.html.page394"></a>
<p class="para">因此，914 年后的第一代高管们坚决不接受像计算机这样增长缓慢的业务，而施乐必须为争夺每一点市场份额而展开激烈竞争。他们认为 Star 是计算机领域最接近神圣的 914 的产品——一款可以从开发流程中完全成熟，准备横扫整个市场并与所有挑战者抗衡的机器。如果计算机市场仍然接受 16,000 美元的系统导向工作站，Star 很可能已经占据主导地位。但当然，市场在眨眼间就变成了完全不同的东西。施乐没有机器可以与售价仅为 2,000 美元的独立台式工作站竞争。</p><p class="para">The first generations of post-914 executives were therefore decidedly unreceptive to a business, like computers, that might grow only slowly and for which Xerox would have to battle ferociously for every point of market share. They viewed the Star as the closest thing in computing to the sainted 914—a machine that could spring fully mature from the development pipeline, poised to sweep up the entire market and hold it against all challengers. Had the computer market remained receptive to $16,000 systems-oriented workstations, the Star might well have dominated. But the market, of course, transformed in the blink of an eye into something entirely different. Xerox had no machine to compete with stand-alone desktop workstations costing only $2,000.</p>
<p class="para">施乐的第二个负担是其在这段时间面临的残酷商业环境，批评其处理 PARC 问题的人士很少承认这一点。就在彼得·麦考洛宣布公司致力于“信息架构”的几个月后，他的公司就被多条战线的战争压垮了——新的国内外竞争对手、联邦政府的反垄断调查和不断恶化的经济。即使是一支在竞争激烈的市场中摸爬滚打多年的管理团队也会发现这些挑战令人生畏；施乐平静的垄断者们就像被困在海上风暴中的周末水手一样迷失了方向。</p><p class="para">Xerox’s second burden, too rarely acknowledged by critics of its handling of PARC, was the merciless business environment confronting it during this period. Only a few months after Peter McColough proclaimed the company’s commitment to the “architecture of information” his company was overwhelmed by war on multiple fronts—new foreign and domestic competitors, an antitrust investigation by the federal government, and a deteriorating economy. Even a management team seasoned by years of scratching and clawing in competitive markets would have found these challenges daunting; the serene monopolists of Xerox were left as disoriented as weekend sailors caught in an ocean squall.</p>
<p class="para">“失去的十年”的干扰让施乐公司被抛在一边，而“信息架构”的战斗口号却被抛在一边：尽管 1975 年日本竞争对手大举出现，但施乐公司直到四年后才推出一款低成本机器来与其竞争。彼得·麦考洛和大卫·卡恩斯卷入了一场殊死搏斗，只是为了保护复印机专营权，他们对 PARC 提出的解决技术转让难题的革命性解决方案几乎没有耐心，这并不奇怪。</p><p class="para">The distractions of the “lost decade” left more by the wayside than the “architecture of information” battle cry: Although Japanese competitors materialized in force in 1975, Xerox did not introduce a low-cost machine to rival theirs until four years later. It is not surprising that Peter McColough and David Kearns, embroiled in the fight of their lives simply to protect the copier franchise, had scarcely any patience for the revolutionary solutions being floated for the tough problems of technology transfer at PARC.</p>
<p class="para">例如，1972 年，杰克·戈德曼向麦科洛提出了一项新奇的计划，即通过分拆一家创业制造企业来加快激光打印机的生产。戈德曼回忆道：“这个想法是在帕洛阿尔托地区创办一家小公司。人们准备跳槽，在车库里创业，假设施乐愿意提供静电复印引擎。他们将获得风险投资<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_bm01.html.page395"></a>融资。三分之一用于资本，三分之一用于雇员，三分之一用于施乐公司提供施乐机器。</p><p class="para">In 1972, for example, Jack Goldman presented McColough with a novel plan to expedite the manufacture of laser printers by spinning off an entrepreneurial manufacturing venture. “The idea was to start a little company in the Palo Alto area,” Goldman recalled. “Guys were ready to jump ship and build in garages, assuming Xerox was willing to make available the xerographic engines. They would get venture <a></a>financing. One-third would go to capital, one-third to the employees, and one-third to Xerox for providing the Xerox machines.</p>
<p class="para">“麦考洛绝对不会听从这些建议。他在 20 世纪 70 年代对此类事情的态度是，我们不能鼓励我们的员工在他们有好主意时就那样离开，否则我们会失去他们的忠诚。当然，他们还是都离开了，像查克·格什克和鲍勃·梅特卡夫这样的人都去创办自己的公司，更不用说查尔斯·西蒙尼去了微软，并带来了 Microsoft Word。”如今，高盛提议的那种分拆在施乐公司已是司空见惯。但该公司花了十年时间——以及管理层的彻底变革——才学到这个教训。</p><p class="para">“McColough would absolutely not hear of it at all. His attitude on such things back in the 1970s was that we could not encourage our people to go off like that when they had a good idea, otherwise we’d lose their loyalty. Of course, they all went off anyway, people like Chuck Geschke and Bob Metcalfe who went to start their own companies, not to speak of Charles Simonyi who went off to Microsoft and brought Microsoft Word with him.” Today the sort of spinoffs Goldman proposed are commonplace at Xerox. But the company needed ten years—and a complete change of management—to learn that lesson.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">在施乐处理 PARC 技术时犯下的众多错误中，有些是事前就能看出来的，有些则是事后才看出来的。批评者不应该将两者混为一谈。前者包括不必要的激光打印机营销延迟和反复拒绝使用 Alto 作为达拉斯制造的非可编程机电文字处理器的替代品等错误。</p><p class="para">Of the many mistakes Xerox committed in handling PARC technology, some were clearly visible in advance, others only in hindsight. Critics should never confuse the two. The former category includes such blunders as the unnecessary delay in marketing the laser printer and the repeated rejection of the Alto as an alternative to the nonprogrammable electromechanical word processors manufactured in Dallas.</p>
<p class="para">然而，在 Star 的营销中，许多现在看来短视或不合理的决定在当时却非常合理。Star 的设计部​​分是为了服务当时许多办公设备专家预计会繁荣数十年的市场：大规模、封闭、完全集成的办公系统（“交钥匙”系统），由供应商（即施乐）独家销售和提供服务。这种架构似乎是不可避免的，这并不奇怪，因为它与 Star 将取代的大规模、封闭、交钥匙的大型机办公数据处理系统完美类似。</p><p class="para">In the marketing of the Star, however, many decisions that appear short-sighted or perverse in retrospect made perfect sense at the time. The Star was designed in part to serve a market many office equipment pundits of the day expected to thrive for decades: for large-scale, closed, fully integrated office systems—“turnkey” systems—that would be sold and serviced exclusively by the vendor (i.e., Xerox). That this architecture seemed inevitable is unsurprising, for it was the perfect analogue to the large-scale, closed, turnkey mainframe office data processing systems the Star would replace.</p>
<p class="para">Star 的软件并非设计为外部软件工程师可以使用——就像 IBM PC 和 Macintosh 那样——原因有二。一是当时没有独立的软件行业。（直到 20 世纪 80 年代中期才出现。）二是当时软件显然被视为不可申请专利；美国专利局甚至不会接受申请。虽然可以对特定屏幕显示和某些代码序列申请版权，但这对于防止盗窃知识创意来说是一种微不足道的保护<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_bm01.html.page396"></a>体现在系统中——正如苹果公司对微软提起的诉讼失败所表明的那样，微软指控 Windows 抄袭了 Macintosh 显示屏的“外观和感觉”。</p><p class="para">The Star’s software was not designed to be accessible to outside software engineers—as would be that of the IBM PC and the Macintosh—for two reasons. One was that no independent software industry existed at the time. (It would not emerge until the mid-1980s.) The other was that software was then quite clearly deemed not to be patentable; the U.S. patent office would not even accept an application. Although it was possible to copyright particular screen displays and certain sequences of code, that was a feeble protection against theft of the intellectual ideas <a></a>embodied in the system—as was shown by Apple’s unsuccessful lawsuit against Microsoft for copying the “look and feel” of the Macintosh display in Windows.</p>
<p class="para">大部分 PARC 早期的计算机科学家和工程师对于该研究中心与施乐公司的关系都心存矛盾。他们还记得自己曾试图向东海岸的高管们传达他们的发明的重要性，而这些高管们却认为这些发明是外星技术，他们为此感到沮丧。但他们无法忘记，施乐公司将他们聚集在一起，给他们丰厚的报酬，并允许他们以相当大的耐心追求他们自己的个人交互式计算机梦想。</p><p class="para">For the most part, the computer scientists and engineers of PARC’s early years are ambivalent about the research center’s relationship with Xerox. They remember the frustrations of trying to communicate the significance of their inventions to East Coast executives who viewed them as alien technologies. Yet they cannot forget that Xerox brought them together, paid them handsomely, and allowed them with considerable forbearance to pursue their own dreams of a personal interactive computer.</p>
<p class="para">一些后来担任自己公司或研究实验室主席的人不敢给予员工他们自己享有的同等自由。Adobe Systems 联合创始人兼董事长 Chuck Geschke 表示：“我们在 PARC 的态度是，从事纯研究是一种更高的使命。但在 Adob​​e，我们的先进技术团队并不只局限于先进技术。如果他们将一个想法的萌芽整合在一起，并开始将其接近原型设计，甚至决定将其转化为产品，我们会鼓励他们一直跟进，直到第一批客户发货。我知道转移技术的唯一方式就是通过人。”</p><p class="para">Some who have gone on to chair their own corporations or research labs would not dare to grant their employees the same latitude they enjoyed themselves. Says Chuck Geschke, co-founder and chairman of Adobe Systems, “Our attitude at PARC was sort of that it was a higher calling to do pure research. But here at Adobe our advanced technology group does not just stay in advanced technology. If they put together the germ of an idea and start to get it close to prototyping and even decide to turn it into a product, we encourage them to follow it all the way through to first customer shipment. The only way I know to transfer technology is with people.”</p>
<p class="para">其他人则对他们问题重重的母公司一直容忍他们表示敬意。“当 SDS 破产时，施乐可能认为这些电子产品并不像宣传的那样好，在这种情况下，整个公司就会解体，”巴特勒·兰普森 (Butler Lampson) 观察道。“但事实上，他们非常顽强地坚持最初的章程。至少在我们看来是这样。”</p><p class="para">Others salute their troubled parent for tolerating them as long as it did. “When SDS crashed and burned Xerox might have decided that all this electronics stuff isn’t what it’s cracked up to be, in which case the whole thing would have disintegrated,” observes Butler Lampson. “But in fact they stuck to their original charter with great tenacity. At least that’s the way it looked to us.”</p>
<p class="para">有些人对创造机会心存感激，而对最终谁能获得利润却漠不关心。还有一些人知道，PARC 的员工很少带头强迫公司老板理解这项技术。</p><p class="para">Some were grateful for the opportunity to create, and rather indifferent to the issue of who eventually booked the profits. Still others are aware that PARC’s staff only rarely took the lead in forcing an understanding of the technology upon their corporate bosses.</p>
<p class="para">“我们所有在那里工作的人都喜欢把错误归咎于施乐公司，”鲍勃·梅特卡夫说。“但施乐公司给了我们这份工作。为什么要责怪他们呢？我们中很少有人愿意承担责任。”</p><p class="para">“All of us who worked there enjoyed blaming Xerox for what went wrong,” observes Bob Metcalfe. “But Xerox gave us the job. Why blame them? So few of us accepted responsibility.”</p>
<p class="para">关于 PARC 的最后一个误解——事实上，关于任何研究<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_bm01.html.page397"></a>中心从事开放式基础研究的共同点在于，公司有义务利用实验室提出的每一个想法。在一个足够广泛的研究项目中，有些想法根本不适合公司的业务。</p><p class="para">One last misconception about PARC—indeed, about any research <a></a>center engaged in open-ended fundamental research—is that the corporation is somehow obligated to exploit every idea the lab throws off. In a sufficiently broad-based research program, some ideas will simply not fit into the corporation’s business.</p>
<p class="para">“帕克的其中一句话是，一个伟大的研究机构会产生很多公司无法利用的想法，”约翰·肖克说。“他说，当商业规划人员拒绝一个想法时，你不应该感到惊讶。”</p><p class="para">“One of Pake’s lines was that a great research organization produces a lot of ideas that its company can’t use,” says John Shoch. “He was saying that you shouldn’t be surprised when the business planners turn down an idea.”</p>
<p class="para">然而，将企业研究中心视为一种公共福利，就像为穷人提供大学奖学金或资助电视歌剧表演一样，施乐公司最常受到嘲笑。</p><p class="para">Yet this notion of the corporate research center as a sort of public benefit, like endowing college scholarships for the needy or underwriting opera performances on television, is the one for which Xerox is most commonly derided.</p>
<p class="para">“我现在有时会想，施乐是否因为未能意识到如此巨大的机遇而遭受了不该有的打击，”加里·斯塔克韦瑟说。“约翰·斯卡利（前苹果董事长，斯塔克韦瑟离开 PARC 后曾就职于苹果）曾对我说，‘我永远不想要 PARC。’我说，‘为什么不呢？’他说，‘所有的技术都泄露了。’我说，‘你只是想要拥有控制这样一个机构的能力，而不是没有这个机构。’”</p><p class="para">“I sometimes wonder now if Xerox isn’t unduly pummeled because they failed to realize such monumental opportunities,” Gary Starkweather says. “John Sculley [the former chairman of Apple, where Starkweather worked after leaving PARC] said to me once, ‘I don’t ever want a PARC.’ I said, ‘Why not?’ He said, ‘All the technology leaked out.’ I said, ‘You just want the ability to control such an institution, not to not have the institution.’”</p>
<p class="para">但斯卡利的观点仍然占主导地位。如今没有哪个企业实验室能与 20 世纪 70 年代和 80 年代的 PARC 相提并论，甚至连 20 世纪 90 年代的 PARC 也不行，而 20 世纪 90 年代的 PARC 在物理学、信息科学和图形技术方面都取得了巨大进步。造成这种情况的原因有很多，其中一些与技术变革的生命周期有关。因为计算科学不再处于 20 世纪 70 年代初的历史转折点，当时在探索道路上的每一步都相当于向新世界迈出了一大步。</p><p class="para">But Sculley’s view remains the prevalent one. No corporate lab exists today that resembles the PARC of the 1970s and 1980s, not even the PARC of the 1990s, where great advances are being made in physics, information science, and graphic technologies. There are several reasons for this, some having to do with the life cycle of technological change. For the science of computing is no longer at the historic inflection point it occupied at the start of the 1970s, when every step on the road of discovery was the equivalent of a giant leap into a new world.</p>
<p class="para">然而，更重要的原因是，企业格局已经发生了变化，而且这种变化或许是不可改变的。没有一家公司，无论多么富有，敢于像施乐公司那样，将哪怕是一小部分财富投入到可能不会产生利润回报的知识探索中。如今，科学家可以在 Ideaspace 自由漫游的企业实验室的乌托邦理想只会招致嘲笑。以微软为例，这家公司最接近 1970 年的施乐公司，至少在现金流方面是如此。微软研究院如今聘请巴特勒并非巧合<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_bm01.html.page398"></a>兰普森、查克·萨克、查尔斯·西蒙尼、加里·斯塔克韦瑟和阿尔维·雷·史密斯。它正在试图复制施乐 PARC，这是近年来任何一家公司都尝试过的。然而，就连微软董事长比尔·盖茨也喜欢用 PARC 不是的东西来定义微软研究院：“我们不希望出现像施乐那样的情况，将研究与产品设计脱钩。[我们希望] 人才超级聪明，但也希望看到自己的工作得到应用。”</p><p class="para">A more important reason, however, is that the corporate landscape has changed, perhaps inalterably. No company, no matter how wealthy, dares devote even a fraction of its wealth to a search for knowledge that may not produce a return to the bottom line, as Xerox did. The utopian ideal of a corporate laboratory whose scientists are free to roam through Ideaspace draws only ridicule today. Consider Microsoft, the company that comes closest to the Xerox of 1970, at least in terms of its torrential cash flow. It is no coincidence that Microsoft Research today employs Butler <a></a>Lampson, Chuck Thacker, Charles Simonyi, Gary Starkweather, and Alvy Ray Smith. It is engaged in as explicit an attempt to replicate Xerox PARC as any company has attempted in recent years. Yet even Bill Gates, Microsoft’s chairman, prefers to define Microsoft Research in terms of what PARC was not: “We didn’t want a situation like Xerox, where the research was decoupled from product design. [We want] people who are supersmart but also have a desire to see their work in use.”</p>
<p class="para">这并不意味着在公司工作的研究人员不会做出伟大的发现，甚至是令人惊讶的发现。这仅仅意味着 PARC 在其非凡的早期所拥有的某种品质似乎已经远离了科学和技术领域，或许是永远的了。我们可以称之为魔法。</p><p class="para">This does not mean that great discoveries, even surprising ones, will not be made here and there by researchers working for corporations. It simply means that a certain quality once possessed by PARC in its extraordinary early years seems to have departed from the world of science and technology, perhaps forever. Call it magic.</p>

<div class="chapterBody">
<p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">ARPA：</span>美国国防部高级研究计划局，成立于 1957 年苏联发射人造卫星之后，旨在调动美国的科研资源进行研究反击。到 20 世纪 60 年代中期，它已成为美国学术界计算机科学的主要资金来源。</p><p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">ARPA:</span> The Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense, established after the Soviet Sputnik launch of 1957 to marshal America’s scientific resources in a research counterattack. By the mid-1960s the principal source of funding for computer science in U.S. academia.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">ARPANET：</span>五角大楼资助的系统，将全国各地研究中心和大学的不兼容大型计算机连接起来；随着时间的推移，演变成互联网。</p><p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">ARPANET:</span> The Pentagon-financed system interconnecting incompatible mainframe computers at research centers and universities across the country; in time evolved into the Internet.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">ASCII：</span>即“美国信息交换标准代码”，是一张包含 128 个简单字母、数字和其他字符的表，每个字符都可以用七个二进制数字或位进行编码；在所见即所得 (WYSIWYG) 显示器出现之前，ASCII 文本一直是计算机显示和打印的标准、毫无魅力的格式。</p><p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">ASCII:</span> The “American Standard Code for Information Interchange,” a table of 128 simple letters, numerals, and other characters, each of which can be encoded in seven binary digits, or bits; until the emergence of WYSIWYG displays, ASCII text was the standard, charmless format of computer display and printing.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">位：</span>来自“二进制数字”，数字计算机可以读取或使用的最小信息单位。位可以设置为两个值之一，通常用 0 或 1、真或假或是或否表示。</p><p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">Bit:</span> From “binary digit,” the smallest unit of information that can be read or used by a digital computer. A bit can be set to one of two values, often signified by 0 or 1, true or false, or yes or no.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">位图：</span>屏幕上每个点或像素对应于计算机内存中的一个或多个位的显示。因此，打开内存中的位模式可以在屏幕上创建相应的图像<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_bm04.html.page416"></a>屏幕。由于位图显示可以快速改变，因此它是 PARC 开发的图形用户界面的基本元素。</p><p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">Bitmap:</span> A display in which each dot, or pixel, on the screen corresponds to one or more bits in computer memory. Thus turning on a pattern of bits in memory can create a corresponding image on the <a></a>screen. Because of the speed at which it can be altered, the bitmapped display is the essential element of graphical user interfaces like those developed at PARC.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">布尔函数：</span>数字计算的核心数学和逻辑元素。布尔函数基于两个值，通常表示为真和假。例如，计算机电路中的 AND 函数或 AND 门仅在其两个输入都为“真”时才返回“真”值，在其他所有情况下都返回“假”值。NOT 函数返回其输入的反面——如果输入为“假”，则返回“真”，反之亦然。利用这些简单的函数及其同类，可以构建能够执行加、减、乘、除等操作的机器。</p><p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">Boolean functions:</span> The mathematical and logical elements at the heart of digital computing. Boolean functions are based on two values, usually represented as true and false. An AND function, or AND gate in a computer’s circuitry, for example, will return a “true” value only if both of its inputs are “true,” and a “false” value in all other cases. The NOT function returns the converse of its input—“true” if the input is “false,” and vice versa. From such trivial functions and their cousins machines can be built that add, subtract, multiply, divide, and do much more.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">字节：</span>按照当前约定，一个八位字符串，足够大以编码要输入到计算机或输出到其显示器的单个字符或符号。</p><p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">Byte:</span> A string of eight bits (by current convention) large enough to encode a single character or symbol to be input to a computer or output to its display.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">中央处理器：</span>计算机的大脑，负责监督磁盘驱动器和打印机等其他部件（或“外围设备”）并控制它们对内存和显示器的访问。</p><p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">Central processing unit:</span> The brains of a computer, which supervises such other parts (or “peripherals”) as the disk drives and printers and controls their access to memory and display.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">互联网：</span>大写，由 ARPANET 发展而来的全球研究和商业计算机站点网络。小写，任何离散本地网络的互连。</p><p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">Internet:</span> Capitalized, the worldwide network of research and commercial computer sites that grew out of the ARPANET. Lower case, any interconnection of discrete local networks.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">Killer app：</span> “Killer application”的缩写。任何能够完美利用硬件从而大幅加速硬件采用速度的程序。例如运行在 Alto 上的 Bravo 文字处理程序和使 Apple II 电脑成为令人垂涎的商业工具的数字电子表格 VisiCalc。</p><p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">Killer app:</span> Abridgment of “killer application.” Any program that so perfectly exploits its hardware that it radically speeds the hardware’s adoption. Examples include the Bravo word processing program, which ran on the Alto, and VisiCalc, the digital spreadsheet that made the Apple II computer a coveted business tool.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">Kludge</span>（发音为“klooge”）：一种过于复杂且经常不稳定的设备或系统，通常是经过长期设计或建造的，用于实现逐渐扩大或不一致的目标。想想鲁布·戈德堡。</p><p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">Kludge</span> (pronounced “klooge”.): An overelaborate and frequently temperamental device or system, often one designed or built over time to serve incrementally broadened or inconsistent goals. Think Rube Goldberg.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">LAN：</span> “局域网”。相邻且通常兼容的计算机组成的网络，通常位于同一栋建筑或一公里半径范围内。20 世纪 70 年代出现了许多相互竞争的 LAN 设计，通常由个别计算机公司推广，以锁定客户<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_bm04.html.page417"></a>鼓励用户使用他们的专有机器（如 IBM 和“令牌环”）。1980 年以后，以太网的标准化使其成为最常见的。</p><p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">LAN:</span> “Local Area Network.” A network of adjacent and usually compatible computers, often within a single building or a one-kilometer radius. Numerous rival LAN designs emerged during the 1970s, often promoted by individual computer companies to lock cus<a></a>tomers into using their proprietary machines (as with IBM and the “token ring”). Ethernet’s standardization after 1980 made it the most common.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">摩尔定律：</span>戈登·摩尔于 1965 年提出的原理，即计算能力的性能将沿着可预测的曲线呈指数级增长，而成本将随着时间的推移而降低，因此 1965 年售价 50 万美元的数字存储器到 1998 年将降至几百美元。这是技术对现代生活产生前所未有的影响背后的力量。</p><p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">Moore’s Law:</span> The principle articulated by Gordon Moore in 1965 that computing power would exponentially increase in performance and diminish in cost over the years along a predictable curve, so that digital memory costing $500,000 in 1965 would come all the way down to a few hundred dollars by 1998. This is the force behind the unprecedented influence technology exerts over modern life.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">第二系统：</span>出自弗雷德里克·布鲁克斯的<span class="italic">《人月神话》</span>。成功的第一个项目往往以失败告终，无论是机器、程序、小说还是建筑。正如布鲁克斯所指出的，第二系统往往会包含创意团队由于贫困或仓促而被迫放弃的第一个系统中的所有额外内容。结果是产品过于复杂、过于昂贵且交付时间较晚。</p><p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">Second system:</span> From Frederick Brooks’s <span class="italic">The Mythical Man-Month</span>. The often-unsuccessful sequel to a successful first project, whether this is a machine, program, novel, or building. As Brooks noted, second systems tend to incorporate all the extras that a creative team was forced by penury or haste to leave out of their first. The result is a product that is overly complicated, overly expensive, and late.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">TCP/IP：</span> “Internet 协议上的传输控制协议”。一组标准化的规则，用于通过网络传输数据，使不同的计算机系统保持足够的同步，从而可靠地相互通信。“IP”元素源自 PARC 开发的 PUP，即“PARC 通用数据包”，它使拥有不兼容计算机的施乐办公室能够相互通信。</p><p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">TCP/IP:</span> “Transmission Control Protocol over Internet Protocol.” The set of standardized rules for the transmission of data over networks that allows disparate computer systems to remain synchronized enough to communicate reliably with each other. The “IP” element grew out of PARC’s development of the PUP, or “PARC Universal Packet,” which allowed Xerox offices with incompatible computers to communicate with each other.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">分时：</span>一种允许多个用户在一台计算机上同时运行程序而不会互相干扰的系统。当计算机还是昂贵的集中式机器时，这是访问计算机资源的标准方式。个人计算机等技术使分时成为过时的技术。</p><p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">Time-sharing:</span> A system allowing several users to run programs simultaneously on one computer without interfering with each other. When computers were costly and centralized machines, this was the standard means of accessing computer resources. Technologies such as the personal computer made time-sharing obsolete.</p>
<p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">VLSI：</span> “超大规模集成”。将数百万个晶体管整合到单个集成电路或芯片中，使计算能力大大超越以前。VLSI 的后代包括奔腾系列芯片，如今许多个人电脑和笔记本电脑都使用这种芯片。PARC 和加州理工学院的研究人员率先提出了 VLSI 的设计原则。</p><p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">VLSI:</span> “Very Large Scale Integration.” The incorporation of millions of transistors in a single integrated circuit, or chip, to provide computing power a quantum leap beyond that previously available. VLSI’s offspring include the Pentium family of chips powering many of today’s personal computers and laptops. The design principles of VLSI were pioneered by researchers working at PARC and the California Institute of Technology.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_bm04.html.page418"></a>
<p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">所见即所得：</span> “所见即所得”。描述计算机用户通过屏幕显示器与机器进行视觉交互的系统，该屏幕显示器对鼠标点击和键盘输入等提供即时反馈。也指屏幕图像（例如文档页面）可由打印机精确复制的程序。</p><p class="bibliographyEntry1"><span class="bold">WYSIWYG:</span> “What you see is what you get.” Describes a system in which the computer user interacts with the machine visually through a screen display that offers instant feedback to inputs such as mouse clicks and keystrokes. Also refers to programs whose screen images—a document page, for example—can be exactly duplicated by a printer.</p>

<div class="chapterBody">
<p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">从</span></span>某种意义上说，这本书诞生于 1996 年 9 月的一天，那天史蒂夫·乔布斯来到《<span class="italic">洛杉矶时报》</span>共进午餐。作为该报的一名科技记者，我被邀请加入这家精选公司。我清楚地记得乔布斯穿着优雅的黑色高领衫，鹰钩鼻上架着一副简单的金属框眼镜。我记得他一边吃着素食午餐，一边由皮克斯工作室的两位高级副手陪同，当时皮克斯工作室刚刚凭借电影《<span class="italic">玩具总动员》</span>获得了巨大成功，此外，他坚决回避所有关于当时高科技行业热点问题的问题 - 微软与网景公司的纠纷，苹果电脑的长期衰落<span class="italic">，等等</span>。</p><p class="chapterOpenerText"><span class="chapterOpenerFirstLetters"><span class="bold">I</span></span>n a very real sense this book was born one day in September 1996, when Steve Jobs came to lunch at the <span class="italic">Los Angeles Times</span>. As a technology reporter for the newspaper I was invited to join the select company. I vividly remember Jobs attired in an elegant black turtleneck, a pair of simple wire-rim glasses perched on his aquiline nose. I remember that he picked at his vegetarian lunch while flanked by two of his top lieutenants at Pixar Studios, which had recently scored a resounding success with the release of the movie <span class="italic">Toy Story</span> and, further, that he steadfastly turned away all questions about the burning high-tech industry issues of the day—Microsoft v. Netscape, the long decline of Apple Computer, <span class="italic">et cetera, et cetera</span>.</p>
<p class="para">“那是我以前的生活，”当我再次问他有关陷入困境的苹果公司的问题时，他回答道（这发生在他重返公司担任临时首席执行官之前）。“参与皮克斯的一大好处是，我不用考虑这些事情。”他满意地笑着张开双臂，右边是《玩具总动员》的才华横溢的导演约翰·拉塞特<span class="italic">，</span>左边是皮克斯的首席技术官埃德温·卡特穆尔。</p><p class="para">“That’s my former life,” he said when I tested him with one more query about the ailing Apple (this was well before his return to the company as interim chief executive). “The great thing about being involved with Pixar is that I don’t have to think about any of that.” With a satisfied grin he spread his arms to take in John Lasseter, the talented director of <span class="italic">Toy Story</span>, on his right, and Edwin Catmull, Pixar’s chief technical officer, on his left.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_bm06.html.page424"></a>
<p class="para">乔布斯几乎在用餐结束前都坚持着自己的决心。讨论转到了计算机历史上的一个奇怪现象：计算机图形学实际上诞生于犹他大学。卡特穆尔是这个鲜为人知的课程的校友，他一口气列举了名人堂成员：硅谷图形公司创始人吉姆·克拉克、Adobe Systems 联合创始人约翰·沃诺克、个人电脑的著名倡导者艾伦·凯（当时在苹果公司任职）。五角大楼资助互联网诞生的鲍勃·泰勒曾在犹他大学待过一年。他补充说，其中几位后来在施乐 PARC 继续完善他们的工作。</p><p class="para">Jobs hewed to his resolve almost to the very end of the meal. The discussion had drifted onto an oddity of computing history: that the science of computer graphics had virtually been born at the University of Utah. Catmull was an alumnus of this little-known program, as were—he rattled off a hall-of-fame roster: Jim Clark, the founder of Silicon Graphics; John Warnock, co-founder of Adobe Systems; Alan Kay, the renowned proselytizer of personal computing (then at Apple). Bob Taylor, the Pentagon grantmaker who financed the birth of the Internet, had spent a year there. Several of them, he added, went on to refine their work at Xerox PARC.</p>
<p class="para">这给了我最后一个机会。作为一名科技作家，我注意到报纸和杂志文章中反复出现对 PARC 的提及，通常将其描述为微软和苹果所利用的技术的来源。我无法找到足够多的关于 PARC 的文章来完全满足我对这个地方的好奇心。但我至少知道了一个著名的故事——关于史蒂夫·乔布斯和他的传奇演示的故事。</p><p class="para">That gave me one last opening. As a technology writer I could not but have noticed the glancing references to PARC that cropped up repeatedly in newspaper and magazine articles, usually describing it as the source of technology exploited by Microsoft and Apple. I had been unable to find enough written about PARC to fully satisfy my curiosity about the place. But I had learned enough to know at least one famous story—the one about Steve Jobs and his legendary demo.</p>
<p class="para">“告诉我，”我说，“你看到了 PARC 发生的事情。你认为施乐为什么一直无法充分利用这项技术？”</p><p class="para">“Tell me,” I said. “You saw what was happening at PARC. Why do you think Xerox never was able to exploit the technology fully?”</p>
<p class="para">突然之间， <span class="italic">《玩具总动员》</span>和皮克斯被遗忘了。接下来的二十分钟里，乔布斯滔滔不绝地谈论着 PARC 的理论和猜测。当他讲完时，我清楚地意识到一件事：这个故事还有许多内容有待揭晓。</p><p class="para">Suddenly <span class="italic">Toy Story</span> and Pixar were forgotten. For the next twenty minutes Jobs was an unstoppable fount of theory and speculation on the subject of PARC. When he was through one thing was clear to me: that much about this story was still waiting to be told.</p>
<p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p><p class="spaceBreak">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="para">在接下来的几个月里，我不断进行调查和自我学习，我发现，任何这种规模的项目都必然需要合作。我最亲密的合作者是数十位科学家、工程师和高管，他们现在或以前都在施乐帕洛阿尔托研究中心工作，他们慷慨地为上述记录贡献了自己的时间和回忆。这些忙碌的男男女女敞开心扉，帮助陌生人重建他们自己珍贵的过去，这种热情一次又一次让我感到惊讶和欣慰。帕洛阿尔托研究中心专家对我们这个世界的神秘感甚至比它对在那里工作的人的灵魂所产生的神秘感更强。</p><p class="para">As I learned over the many months of inquiry and self-education that followed, any project of this scope is necessarily a collaborative effort. My closest collaborators were the scores of scientists, engineers, and executives now or previously associated with Xerox PARC who graciously contributed their time and memories to the foregoing chronicle. Time and again I was astonished and gratified at the enthusiasm with which these busy men and women opened their minds and hearts to help a stranger reconstruct a cherished part of their own pasts. Even stronger than the mystique PARC experts on our own world is the one it exerts on the souls of those who worked there.</p>
<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_bm06.html.page425"></a>
<p class="para">他们热情地接待我到他们的办公室和家里，从繁忙的工作中抽出时间，为我提供宝贵的研究资料。他们接受我经常毫无根据的提问，有时每次提问持续数小时，之后通过电子邮件或电话进一步询问。最后，有几个人同意阅读本书部分内容的草稿，以纠正其中的错误、误解和不公正之处。剩下的都是我自己的。</p><p class="para">They welcomed me into their offices and homes, took time out from pressing business, provided me with invaluable research materials. They submitted to my often uninformed questioning, sometimes over multiple sessions lasting several hours each, followed by further queries by e-mail or telephone. Finally several consented to read drafts of portions of this book to correct stray errors, misconceptions, and injustices. Any that remain are my own.</p>

<p class="para">在我确定这个项目之前，纽约 Elaine Markson 文学代理公司的代理人 Geri Thoma 就对这个项目充满信心。我在 HarperBusiness 的编辑 Laureen Connelly Rowland 用她的热情坚定了我的决心，并用她睿智而优雅的笔法对手稿进行了无限的润色。我的朋友和《<span class="italic">洛杉矶时报》</span>的编辑们值得我感谢，他们在漫长的时间内忍耐了下来，才使这项工作得以完成。</p><p class="para">Geri Thoma, my agent at Elaine Markson Literary Agency in New York, contributed her confidence in this project before I was sure a project existed.

<p class="para">我的妻子 Deborah 自始至终都是这个项目中一个充满爱心和坚定的合作伙伴，无论是否需要繁重的劳动<a id="OEBPS/dealersoflightning_bm06.html.page426"></a>记录采访，或者寻找明确而清晰的见解，只有这些见解才能将一章无可救药的混乱章节从疲惫的作家困惑的地狱中拯救出来。最后，我对我出色的儿子安德鲁和大卫的感激之情无以言表，他们将继承 PARC 创造的世界。</p><p class="para">My wife, Deborah, was a loving and steadfast partner in this project from beginning to end, whether the demand was for the heavy labor <a></a>of transcribing interviews or for the definitive and lucid insights that alone can rescue a hopelessly snarled chapter from the hell of a weary writer’s bewilderment. Lastly, I owe more than I can express to my wonderful sons, Andrew and David, who will inherit the world PARC made.</p>

<p class="reviewPageText">一位普利策奖获奖记者讲述了一个引人入胜的真实故事，讲述了一群非凡的发明家如何引发了一场改变世界的技术革命。</p><p class="reviewPageText">From a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist comes this riveting, true story of an extraordinary group of inventors who brought about a technological revolution that would change the world.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="italic">秉承畅销书《新机器的灵魂》</span>和<span class="italic">《偶然的帝国》</span>的传统，《闪电经销商》讲述了一段迷人的智力创造之旅。20 世纪 70 年代和 80 年代，施乐公司召集了一群工程天才，一群计算机怪人，被称为 PARC。这个才华横溢的团队创造了几项具有里程碑意义的创新，包括第一台个人电脑、激光打印机和图形界面（互联网的主要前身之一），但这些突破却被公司拒绝了。然而，这些坚定的发明家并没有放弃，而是将他们的想法变成了帝国，从根本上改变了当代生活和世界。这部引人入胜的编年史基于对亲历者的广泛采访，详细描述了 PARC 作为创意温室的起步和成功，并展示了施乐为何从未能够掌握并最终利用 PARC 提供的尖端创新。</p><p class="para">In the bestselling tradition of <span class="italic">The Soul Of A New Machine</span> and <span class="italic">Accidental Empires, Dealers of Lightning</span> is a fascinating journey of intellectual creation. In the 1970s and ’80s, Xerox Corporation brought together a braintrust of engineering geniuses, a group of computer eccentrics dubbed PARC. This brilliant group would create several monumental innovations including the first personal computer, the laser printer, and the graphical interface (one of the main precursors to the Internet) only to see these breakthroughs rejected by the corporation. Yet instead of giving up, these determined inventors turned their ideas into empires that would radically alter contemporary life and change the world. Based on extensive interviews with the people who lived the story, this riveting chronicle details PARC’s beginnings through its triumph as a hothouse for ideas, and shows why Xerox was never able to grasp and ultimately exploit the cutting-edge innovations PARC delivered.</p>
