PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION
</h3>

<p>
去年12月初，随着圣诞节的临近，“小提琴手”开始萌芽。我原本打算在新年之前准备好，但是可惜，它比计划晚了，直到一月份才完成。有些地方仍然是冬天——正是吃这些食物的季节——所以不要让这件作品在架子上再搁置一年……
</p><p>
"Violists" began to germinate early in December last, as Christmas
approached.  I originally intended that it be ready before the new
year, but alas, it came in behind schedule, and was not completed until
January.  It is still winter in some places—the right season for such
morsels—so rather than let the work languish upon the shelf for
another year...
</p>

<p>
在网络的某个地方，我希望有一个孤独的读者舒适地坐在温暖的书房里，喝着一杯好茶。也许灯已经灭了，航站楼的琥珀色光芒在房间里散发出淡淡的温暖；也许是这样。塞得满满的书架在黑暗中若隐若现。如果傍晚的空气清新，窗外飘着细软的雪，那就更好了——看到冰柱会是一种神奇的感觉。
</p><p>
Somewhere out there on The Net, I hope there is a solitary reader
settled comfortably in a warm study with a nice cup of tea.  Perhaps
the lights are out, and the amber glow of the terminal spreads faint
warmth through the room; overstuffed bookshelves loom behind in the
darkness.  If the evening air is crisp and a soft snow is falling
outside the window, so much the better—a view of icicles would be a
magical touch.

格雷琴在图书馆
</h3><h3 align="center">
GRETCHEN IN THE LIBRARY
</h3>

<br>

<p>
冬天，大学图书馆的内部并不比外面暖和，而且通风非常厉害。格雷琴经常对自己说，内部和外部之间的唯一区别是后者偶尔会下雪。图书馆至少是干燥的。在大多数日子里，在人迹罕至的地方——二楼和三楼封闭的书库——人们在下午就能看到自己的呼吸声。格雷琴认为，她不会为自己的书选择这种氛围。但如此巨大的建筑的供暖费用——好吧，她认为她很难想象这么一笔巨款。最冷的日子里，她常常穿两件衬裙。不过，她发现保暖的最佳方法就是尽快忙碌起来。她的主要工作是在书架上工作，为图书馆的顾客提取书籍，并将归还的书籍重新上架，并保持书架井然有序。
</p><p>
In winter the interior of the university library was hardly warmer than
the outside, and it was terribly drafty.  The sole difference between
the interior and exterior, Gretchen often remarked to herself, was that
the latter received an occasional snow.  The library at least was dry.
On most days in the unfrequented areas—the closed stacks on the second
and third floors—one could see one's breath in the middle of the
afternoon.  Gretchen thought it hardly the sort of climate she would
have chosen for her own books.  But the cost of heating such an
enormous building—well, she decided she could hardly imagine so
extravagant a sum.  On the coldest days, she often wore two petticoats.
She found the best method of staying warm, though, was to bustle as
quickly as she could.  Primarily, she worked in the stacks, extracting
books for the library's patrons and reshelving books that had
returned—and keeping the shelves in good order.
</p>

<p>
前一天，格蕾琴的二十九岁生日到来了——来得太快了，她忙得不可开交，想把自己从几天来的沉思中解脱出来。她独自度过了这个晚上，尽管她知道寻求独处对她没有任何好处。接受自己已经过了人生的黄金时期也许比为无法改变的事情而烦恼更简单，也能减少更少的痛苦。不过，她已经快三十了——她知道几年后等待着她的是什么。她只需看看助理参考图书馆员萨迪小姐，就能知道再过几年她自己会是什么样子。这个想法几乎让她不寒而栗，如果她让自己对这件事思考得太深，可能会让她流泪。值得庆幸的是，格雷琴告诉自己，她可以在书中变老，至少她有伟大思想的陪伴——或者他们的遗产——而不是在工厂里度过紧张的一生——或者在一个守旧的男人的枷锁下。
</p><p>
Gretchen's twenty-ninth birthday had arrived—quite too quickly—the
day before, and she bustled with an excess of alacrity to relieve her
mind from the brooding that had occupied her for several days.  She had
spent the evening alone, though she knew it did her no good to seek
solitude.  To accept being past her prime of life would be simpler
perhaps, and productive of less anguish, than fretting over what could
not be changed.  She was nearly thirty, though—and she knew what lay
in store for her a few years hence.  She had only to look at the
assistant reference librarian, Miss Sadie, to see how she herself would
be in but a few more years.  The thought nearly made her shudder, and
if she allowed herself to think too deeply upon the matter, might have
brought her to tears.  Thankfully, Gretchen told herself, she could
grow old among the books, where at least she had the company of great
minds—or their legacy—rather than spend a life straining in a
factory—or under the yoke of an old-fashioned man.
</p>

<p>
她已经与家人疏远了六年，自从逃离康涅狄格州以来，她很少认真考虑过他们。这场争论本来就很简单——大学毕业后她应该做什么？当然，她的父亲建议结婚并适应家庭生活——像她这样漂亮的女孩。他和他过时的理想——厨房里的漂亮女孩，确实如此！二十三岁时，她终于醒悟过来，拒绝嫁给她已订婚的年轻人，无论她父亲认为他们多么般配。
</p><p>
She had been estranged from her family for six years and rarely given
them serious thought since fleeing Connecticut.  A simple enough row it
had been to start—what should she do now that she had finished
university?  Of course her father recommended marriage and settling
into the domestic life—a pretty girl like her.  Him and his antiquated
ideals—a pretty girl in the kitchen, indeed!  At twenty-three she had
finally come to her senses and refused to marry the young man to whom
she had been betrothed, no matter how well matched her father thought
they were.
</p>

<p>
她的母亲经常向格蕾琴吐露她对婚姻中固有的各种快乐和考验的看法，承认随着时间的流逝，她发现这些快乐也许不值得其他的艰辛——她自己感情的外在征服和她对婚姻的持续尊重。被要求在婚姻的范围内表现出来，好像她没有独立的思想。格雷琴早就认定这不会是她的命运。她开始相信找不到合适的男人，但她仍然不满意。她对摆脱家庭关系唯一真正的遗憾是她让母亲失望了。事实上，是她的母亲辛辛苦苦工作，才让格雷琴接受了教育。在所有劝阻无效的情况下，她的父亲只是为了家庭安宁才勉强同意了。
</p><p>
Her mother had frequently confided to Gretchen her views on the varied
pleasures—and trials—inherent in marriage, admitting that as the
years passed she found the pleasures perhaps not worth the other
hardships—the outward subjugation of her own feelings and the constant
deference she was required to display within the confines of that
marriage, as if she had no independent mind.  Gretchen had long since
determined that would not be her fate.  She had come to believe that no
suitable man could be found, yet she remained unsatisfied.  The only
true regret she had about casting off her family ties was that she had
disappointed her mother.  It was her mother who had worked so hard,
really, to see that Gretchen had an education; her father only
begrudgingly went along for the sake of domestic tranquility when all
efforts to dissuade her had failed.
</p>

<p>
在大学里，格雷琴越来越热衷于吸收稀有的知识氛围，并发现自己不可抗拒地被帕纳塞斯山的山坡所吸引。她一直打算在大学毕业后工作——她也确实做了工作，尽管她很难找到工作。即使是她在六年里学到的最高级的教育，也买不到某种权利或合理的工资。她希望她能看到一个她称之为开明时代的盛期。如果她有更高的物质追求，她可能会感到痛苦，但她对物质上的舒适几乎不满足。为什么几乎所有时间都在图书馆度过的特权几乎值得任何牺牲——她需要工资吗！
</p><p>
At university Gretchen had imbibed the rarefied intellectual atmosphere
with increasing eagerness and found herself drawn irresistibly up the
slopes of Parnassus.  She had always intended to work after completing
university—and work she did, though she had difficulty making due with
what employment she could find.  Even a superlative education, she had
learned in six years, did not buy one certain rights or reasonable
wages.  She hoped that she would yet see the flowering of an age that
she could call an enlightened one.  She might have been bitter had she
higher material aspirations, but she was content with little in the way
of physical comforts.  Why the privilege of spending nearly all her
days in the library would have been worth almost any sacrifice—what
need had she of wages!
</p>

<p>
她认为，如果她想保持自己的个性，她就必须放弃婚姻伴侣，这是可悲的——因为她的自由的代价是一种巨大的孤独，只有最严格的精神纪律才能克服。她见过很多同学都深陷不幸婚姻的泥潭，在丈夫的脚后跟下疲惫不堪——几乎像门垫一样。说实话，婚姻中似乎很幸福的人是有的，但她认为这样的人很少。然而，她仍然有一种持久的恐惧，担心自己会独自变老——很快就会变得像萨迪小姐一样顽固——一个可怜的老处女，没有留下任何美好的情感。格雷琴想知道，是否没有一个男人可以与她分享她的生活和兴趣——一个具有进步思想的男人？她不是一个像小月亮一样永远围绕着轨道运行的男人，而是一个可以与她找到一种共同轨道状态的男人。好吧，她想，反正就是这种性质的东西。她的天文学知识不足以找到更好的类比，她决心尽快解决这个问题。她在她认为自己真正必须阅读的书籍清单中添加了另一本书——她称之为“关于天堂的东西”。
</p><p>
It was lamentable, she decided, that she should have to forgo marital
companionship if she were to retain her individuality—for the price of
her freedom was a monumental sort of loneliness that only the severest
mental discipline could overcome.  She had seen so many of her school
friends smothered in the clutches of bad marriages, worn out beneath
their husbands' heels—almost like doormats.  To be truthful there were
those who seemed to prosper in the state of matrimony, but she thought
them few.  Yet, she still had an abiding fear that she would grow old
alone—and soon enough become as obdurate as Miss Sadie—a pitiable
spinster with none of the finer sensibilities left to her.  Was there
no man, Gretchen wondered, with whom she could share her life and
interests—a man with progressive ideas?  Not a man that she, like a
tiny moon, would orbit eternally, but one with whom she could find a
state of mutual orbit.  Well, she thought, something of that nature
anyway.  Her knowledge of astronomy was not up to the task of finding a
better analogy, and she resolved to remedy that as soon as she was
able.  She added another volume—'something concerning the heavens' she
called it—to the list of books she thought she really must read.
</p>

<p>
格雷琴忙忙碌碌，想着这些想法，为她的下一个生日感到恐惧。她轻轻地吹了吹一缕赤褐色的头发，那头发不知何故从她早上绑在头发上的绿色丝带中逃脱了。有几缕不知怎的进入了她的嘴里，但她的怀里塞满了书——全是厚重的书——她无法用手指把它们拉开。她正要放下包袱，整理一下头发，这时，当她转过街角进入下一排时，一道阴影落在了她怀里最上面的一本书上。她惊讶地抬头看了一眼。一个男人站在她面前仅几英寸的地方——抬头发现她满头热气地朝他走来——甚至当他向她走去时。
</p><p>
Gretchen bustled, thinking these thoughts, dreading her next birthday.
She blew softly on a wisp of auburn hair that had somehow escaped from
the green ribbon with which she tied it back that morning.  Several
strands had somehow got into her mouth but her arms were too full of
books—heavy tomes, all—to pull them away with her fingers.  She was
on the verge of setting down the burden and tending to her hair for a
moment when, as she turned a corner into the next row, a shadow fell
across the topmost book in her arms.  She glanced up in surprise.  A
man stood mere inches in front of her—and looked up to find her
bearing down upon him with a full head of steam—even as he stepped
toward her.
</p>

<p>
“哦！” 她哭了起来，试图阻止自己。书从她手中滑落，无法挽回，书页随着颤动飞开。
</p><p>
"Oh!" she cried, attempting to stop herself.  The books slid
irretrievably from her grasp, their pages flying open with a flutter.
</p>

<p>
男人的双臂猛地伸出。“图书！” 当他们在他周围翻滚时，他发出了惊讶的叫声。他试图抓住一些，先左后右，但可惜的是，除了一个之外，它们全都掉到了地板上，发出沉闷的咔哒声。
</p><p>
The man's arms shot out.  "The books!" came his cry of astonishment as
they tumbled about him.  He tried to catch a few, left and then right,
but alas they fell—all but one—to the floor with a dull clatter.
</p>

<p>
“哦天哪，”格雷琴低声说道。她担心自己已​​经弯了几页纸，于是她把手放在嘴边，立即跪下来把它们全部收起来。“非常抱歉，先生。”她一边忙着继续说，一边把书一本又一本地堆起来。“我的笨拙……”
</p><p>
"Oh dear," Gretchen whispered, looking down.  She feared she had bent a
few pages, and putting a hand to her mouth knelt immediately to gather
them all.  "I'm terribly sorry, sir," she continued in a rush as she
piled books one after the other.  "My clumsiness..."
</p>

<p>
“小姐，别想了。”男人淡淡的答道。“这是我的错。我真希望你没有因为我的笨拙而受到伤害……”然后他跪下，开始把书放在她的书堆上，从他从掉落中救下来的那本书开始。这本幸运的书是已故达尔文先生的一本，当他瞥了一眼书脊时，她不由自主地脸红了——因为那天她已经读完了它，正要把它放回原来的地方。她知道他看到了她脸颊的颜色。
</p><p>
"Think nothing of it, Miss," the man replied lightly.  "It's my fault.
I do hope _you_ were not harmed by _my_ clumsiness..." He knelt then,
and began to place books upon her stack, starting with the volume he
had saved from falling.  The lucky book was one of the late Mr.
Darwin's, and when he glanced momentarily at the spine she blushed
deeply despite herself—for she had that day finished reading it, and
was returning it to its rightful place.  She knew that he had seen her
cheeks color.
</p>

<p>
格蕾琴环顾四周，发现已经没有杂书了，准备重新捡起那堆书。她站起来喘口气，抚平羊毛裙子，肩膀向后拱起。低头看着男人，她终于想起来吹掉脸上的一缕头发。他抬头看着她，脸上洋溢着笑容——她注意到，他的胡子刮得干干净净，面容光洁——但笑容几乎立刻就消失了，变成了唇角微弱的卷曲。
</p><p>
Gretchen looked around, and seeing there were no more stray books,
prepared to pick up the stack again.  She stood up to catch her breath
and smooth her wool skirt, arching back her shoulders.  Looking down at
the man, she finally remembered to blow the wisp of hair from her face.
He was looking up at her and positively beaming—clean-shaven and light
complected, she noted—but the smile faded almost instantly to a faint
curling about the corners of his lips.
</p>

<p>
“请接受我的歉意，”他说道，仍然跪在地板上。“我必须更加小心。” 他的头发蓬乱——乌黑的大卷发，当他把头发从眼前拂开时，他紧张地笑了。他用黑色的眼睛看着她，却又那么慈祥，格蕾琴发现自己又脸红了，把手放在胸前。男人停下来整理了下衬衫和外套，然后缓缓站起身来，微微一鞠躬，从她身边掠过而去。莫名其妙地，她突然感到头晕，坐到了书本旁的地板上。他的眼睛！她气喘吁吁地对自己喊道。她感觉他们一瞬间就把她吞没了；了解她的一切。她不记得曾经见过如此生动而聪明的眼睛——如此深邃和黑色，就像打开了星空的窗户。还有他的手！当他把最后一本书放在书堆上时——指甲是如此修剪。他的手几乎是女性化的，而且非常精致。格蕾琴逐渐平静下来，然后拿起书本继续工作。
</p><p>
"Please accept my apologies," he stated, still kneeling upon the floor.
"I will have to be more careful."  His hair was dishevelled—great
curly locks of jet black, and he laughed nervously as he brushed it
from his eyes.  He peered at her with eyes so black, yet so kindly,
that Gretchen found herself blushing again and put a hand to her chest.
The man stopped for a moment to adjust his shirt and coat, then stood
slowly, and with the hint of a bow, swept past her and away.
Unaccountably, she felt suddenly light-headed and sat down upon the
floor by her books.  His eyes! she exclaimed to herself with an outrush
of breath.  She felt that in an instant they had devoured her; had
known all about her.  She could not recall ever having seen such lively
and intelligent eyes—so deep and black they seemed like windows
opening onto a starlit sky.  And his hand! when he placed the last book
upon the stack—the nails so trim.  His hands were almost feminine, and
finely wrought.  Gretchen gradually composed herself, then picked up
her books and continued about her work.
</p>

<p>
此后的两周内，格雷琴在图书馆里多次见到同一个年轻人，他们结识了，从开始到结束都愉快地点头并互相祝愿“美好的一天”。她认为他是她在图书馆见过的最有趣的赞助人……她不知道多久了——也许在她来图书馆的两年里从未见过。格雷琴断定，他确实很浮夸，但他并没有像他看上去那样聪明的穿衣者经常出现的那种放荡或傲慢。有时她的想法偶然会想到他，两周之内，她就决定他一定要加入大学。也许是一名教授——当然不是正式教授，他太年轻了，还没有成长为长期任职所带来的那种阳刚的古板——而且他的体格很苗条。不，她断定，他很可能是一位老教授的年轻助理。
</p><p>
Several times thereafter in the course of a fortnight Gretchen saw the
same young man about the library, and they developed an acquaintance
that began and ended with nodding pleasantly and wishing each other
"good day".  She thought him quite the most interesting patron she had
seen in the library for... she knew not how long—perhaps never in the
two years she had been there.  He was flamboyant, certainly, Gretchen
decided, but he had not that rakishness or arrogance that so often
accompanies one who is as smart a dresser as he seemed.  Her thoughts
chanced to light upon him sometimes, and within the fortnight, she
decided he must be attached to the university.  Perhaps a
professor—well certainly not a full professor, he was far too young
and had not grown into that masculine stuffiness that comes with long
tenure—and his physique was trim.  No, she decided, he was probably a
fresh young assistant to an elder professor.
</p>

<p>
“格雷琴，亲爱的。” 萨迪小姐的声音以一种非常奇怪的方式在她身后响起，格雷琴环顾四周。“亲爱的，我确实担心我会被传染，”赛迪小姐低声继续说道，“你能在服务台打烊之前帮我照管一下吗？”
</p><p>
"Gretchen, dear."  Miss Sadie's voice crackled behind her in a very
strange manner and Gretchen looked around.  "I do fear I'm catching
some contagion, dear," Miss Sadie continued in a whisper, "can you
possibly mind the desk until closing?"
</p>

<p>
格雷琴犹豫了一会儿。她在图书馆工作了足够长的时间，感到很安心，圣诞节假期课程已经放假，顾客很少。“当然，赛迪小姐，”她回答道。“我真希望你明天感觉好一些。”
</p><p>
Gretchen hesitated for a moment.  She had worked long enough in the
library to feel at ease, and with classes already in recess for the
Christmas holidays, there were few patrons.  "Of course, Miss Sadie,"
she answered.  "I do hope you're feeling better tomorrow."
</p>

<p>
“如果没有，我就不会参加。”赛迪小姐用非常微弱的语气回答道。“我会——我会试着传话。”
</p><p>
"If not, I shan't be in," Miss Sadie replied in a very weak tone.
"I'll—I'll try to send word."
</p>

<p>
“我会照顾好一切的，赛迪小姐——你要照顾好自己。” 她停了下来。“我会通知约翰逊先生——一点也不麻烦。” 她微笑着，怜悯地摇摇头，补充道：“照顾好自己。”
</p><p>
"I'll see to everything, Miss Sadie—just take care of yourself." She
paused.  "And I'll inform Mr. Johnson—it's no trouble at all." With a
smile and a pitying wag of her head, she added, "Take good care of
yourself."
</p>

<p>
赛迪小姐向她道谢后就告辞了。格雷琴终于独自一人，作为咨询台的临时女王，哪怕只有一个晚上。好吧，是时候让她除了拿书之外做点别的事了，她轻快地想，然后在赛迪小姐的办公桌前坐下。赛迪小姐对于图书管理员来说不太整洁，她一边想，一边用一根手指在桌子上擦拭，于是她开始整理一些东西。她放下新的吸墨纸，把文件整理得更有秩序，然后打开抽屉寻找抹布。说实话，赛迪小姐就是混乱无序的典型，看到一片混乱，她嘀咕道。像她这样的女人，能保住这样的职位，真是奇迹。
</p><p>
Miss Sadie thanked her, and took her leave.  Gretchen was alone, at
last, if only for an evening, as temporary queen of the reference desk.
Well, it was about time she was asked to do something besides fetch
books, she thought airily, and took a seat at Miss Sadie's desk.  Miss
Sadie was not very neat for a librarian, she thought, wiping a finger
across the desk, so she began to tidy a few things up.  She put down a
fresh blotter and arranged the papers in a more orderly manner, then
opened a drawer in search of a cloth.  Really, Miss Sadie is the
epitome of disorganization, she muttered, seeing the jumble.  It's a
wonder that a woman like her can retain such a position.
</p>

<p>
冰冰！当柜台上的铃声响起时，格雷琴突然抬起头来。年轻人站在那里，手放在钟上。
</p><p>
Bing-bing!  Gretchen looked up suddenly when the bell upon the front
counter sounded.  Standing there with his hand poised above the bell
was the young man.
</p>

<p>
“我可以帮忙吗？” 格雷琴用她最像图书管理员的语气问道。
</p><p>
"May I be of assistance?"  Gretchen asked, in her most librarian-like
tone.
</p>

<p>
年轻人笑了。“我真诚地希望你能做到。不知道你能不能帮我找到这本书？” 他用两根手指夹住一张小纸条。“它似乎不在开放的书架中。”
</p><p>
The young man smiled.  "I sincerely hope you can.  I wonder if you
might be able to help me find this book?"  He held out a small slip of
paper between two fingers.  "It doesn't appear to be in the open
stacks."
</p>

<p>
格雷琴滑到办公桌前，从他手中接过纸条。看一眼这个数字就足够了。“你是对的，”她告诉他，把纸还给他。“它在特别收藏之一中。”
</p><p>
Gretchen glided to the desk and took the slip of paper from him.  A
glance at the number was sufficient.  "You're correct," she told him,
handing the paper back.  "It's in one of the special collections."
</p>

<p>
“那么，我想知道，小姐……”他停了下来，沉默地吐出这个词，直到格雷琴觉得有必要填补这个听得见的空白。
</p><p>
"I wonder, then, Miss..."  He paused, drawing out the word into a
silence, until Gretchen felt obliged to fill the audible gap.
</p>

<p>
“哈维兰，”她低声说道。
</p><p>
"Haviland," she offered in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
“哈维兰小姐。你能帮我找到它吗？” 他微笑着，嘴角一如既往地微微卷曲。她断定，这不是居高临下的态度——也许是觉得好笑，甚至是调情。
</p><p>
"Miss Haviland.  Could you help me locate it?"  He smiled with the
slightly curling lips he always wore.  Not condescending, she
decided—perhaps amused, or even flirtatious.
</p>

<p>
格雷琴站在那里，一时间心慌意乱。顾客不得进入特别藏品——它们被锁了起来。当她为他取资料时，她是否应该让咨询台无人看管？在此期间，如果另一个顾客有紧急事务怎么办？格雷琴然后告诉自己，这是一个荒谬的困境。“当然，教授。”她干脆地回答道。“我把钥匙拿来吧。”
</p><p>
Gretchen stood flustered for a moment.  Patrons were not allowed into
the special collections—they were under lock and key.  Should she
leave the reference desk unattended while she fetched it for him? In
the interim, what if another patron had pressing business?  A
preposterous quandary, Gretchen then told herself.  "Of course,
Professor," she replied crisply.  "Let me bring the key."
</p>

<p>
年轻人笑了起来，他的头一仰，黑色的卷发垂到了眼睛里。他突然叹了口气，一副夸张的失败表情，把头发往后梳。“我看起来像个教授吗，哈维兰小姐？你怎么知道的？”
</p><p>
The young man laughed then, with a toss of his head so that his black
curls flopped into his eyes.  He suddenly sighed, with an exaggerated
look of defeat, brushing back his hair.  "Do I appear so like a
professor, Miss Haviland?  How did you know?"
</p>

<p>
轮到格雷琴被逗乐了，她微笑着去萨迪小姐的办公桌抽屉里拿钥匙。“你没有学生的气质，教授……”她模仿他之前的询问方式拖长了这个词，直到他不得不绽放出奇妙的微笑。
</p><p>
It was Gretchen's turn to be amused, and she smiled as she went to Miss
Sadie's desk drawer to bring the key.  "You have not the air of a
student, Professor..."  she drew out the word in a manner imitative of
his previous query, until he had to break into a wondrous smile.
</p>

<p>
“布里德韦尔！” 他大叫一声，用四个指甲在桌子上敲了一下。“今年才受聘——在英语系。”
</p><p>
"Bridwell!" he exclaimed, and rapped four fingernails once upon the
desk.  "Employed only this year—in the English department."
</p>

<p>
“布里德韦尔教授，”她继续说道，话语中带着某种卖弄的气氛，“坦率地说，对于一个学生来说，你的着装实在是太讲究了；如果我可以这么不圆滑的话，你看起来……更先进了，我们可以说。”
</p><p>
"Professor Bridwell," she continued, imparting a certain air of
coquetry to her words, "your dress is frankly too punctilious for a
student; and if I might be so tactless, you seem... more evolved, shall
we say."
</p>

<p>
拿出钥匙后，她示意他跟上。他们走上后楼梯——这对顾客来说也是禁忌。格雷琴一直在思考，如果她独自一人带领一名赞助人进入内部密室，被上级抓住，该如何为自己开脱。她认为最好的方法是以无知为借口——“哦，”她可以说，“我不知道教授被视为普通赞助人。” 这是足够的借口吗？
</p><p>
Having drawn out the key, she beckoned him to follow.  They ascended
the back staircase—likewise taboo for patrons.  All the while Gretchen
thought how to exonerate herself should she be caught by one of her
superiors while leading a patron—alone—into the inner sanctum.  She
decided the best approach would be to plead ignorance—"Oh," she could
say, "I had no idea that professors were considered ordinary patrons."
Would that be sufficient excuse?
</p>

<p>
这本书很容易找到，格雷琴也没有给自己带来什么特别的困难——但尽管如此，布里德韦尔教授还是非常感谢。他查阅了这本书——这本书不能离开图书馆——一个小时或更长时间。离开时，他把书还给柜台。他歪着头，卷发像现在一样随意垂落，说道：“哈维兰小姐，我确实希望能再次享受这种乐趣。”
</p><p>
The book was easy to find, and Gretchen put herself to no particular
difficulty—but nevertheless, Professor Bridwell's thanks were profuse.
He consulted the book—which could not leave the library—for an hour
or more.  On departing he returned the book to the counter.  He
inclined his head, with the now-familiar flop of his curly hair, and
said, "I do hope to have the pleasure again, Miss Haviland."
</p>

<p>
格雷琴在萨迪小姐的办公桌上看着他穿过门厅，走下通向外面的台阶。他离开后，她闭上了眼睛，静静地坐着，享受着这一刻。身后还残留着一股淡淡的香味，是一种独特的古龙水味道，给她留下了相当不错的印象。
</p><p>
Gretchen watched from Miss Sadie's desk as he departed through the
foyer and down the steps leading out.  She closed her eyes for a moment
and sat quietly after he had left—simply savoring the moment.  A faint
scent lingered behind him:  a distinctive cologne that left quite a
favorable impression on her.
</p>

<hr align="center" width="60%">

<p>
格雷琴参加了校园里一场简短的下午音乐会。这是本季最后一场学生独奏会，她也听说了这个节目：下午以肖邦的玛祖卡舞曲和李斯特的经典《超验练习曲》选段开场——她不能离开。肖邦是一道开胃酒，随后是学生们弹奏的几首稍稍有趣的钢琴作品。然后，她气喘吁吁地坐着，沉浸在李斯特的练习曲中——彻底的感动，在云床上流下了眼泪。尤其是她从未听过如此美妙地渲染的《Harmonies du Soir》。
</p><p>
Gretchen attended a short afternoon concert on campus.  It was the last
student recital of the season, and she had heard tell of the program:
the afternoon was to open with mazurkas by Chopin and a selection of
those divine "Transcendental Etudes" by Liszt—she could not stay away.
Chopin was an aperitif, followed by a few mildly diverting piano works
by students.  Then, she sat breathless and transported—utterly
transported, halfway to tears upon a bed of clouds—through the etudes
of Liszt.  In particular she had never heard the "Harmonies du Soir"
more beautifully rendered.
</p>

<p>
中场休息后，她只是静静地坐着，思考李斯特钢琴作品的精致细腻，音乐会的第二部分以维瓦尔第的《四个季节》拉开帷幕，由一个亲密的合奏团演奏，而不是由全套弦乐演奏。当然，表演者都是学生，但她仍然觉得很愉快。当“秋”季开始的时候，她甚至感觉到空气中突然有一丝凉意——表演的效果太棒了——她把披肩拉得更紧了。然后她偶然看了一眼观众席，发现在她前面几排，她看到了布里德韦尔教授。她不知道他喜欢音乐会；她不知道他喜欢音乐会。事实上，她意识到自己对他一无所知。她确信那是教授——即使从后面看，也不会认错他的卷发。她立刻意识到他很像赫克托·柏辽兹的肖像。他坐直了身子，身体几乎前倾，一副随时要站起来的姿势。她幻想着只要看到他英俊的脸庞，他就会闭上眼睛，被维瓦尔第的秋风吹拂着的音乐所陶醉。她真的不知道为什么她看着观众而不是管弦乐队——她强迫自己的目光从教授的背上移开，试图再次将注意力集中在音乐上。但她的努力没有成功。
</p><p>
After an intermission, which she spent simply sitting quietly,
pondering the exquisite delicacies of Liszt's piano writing, the second
part of the concert opened with Vivaldi's "The Four Seasons", performed
by an intimate ensemble rather than with the full complement of
strings.  The performers were students, to be sure, but she found it
delightful nonetheless.  When the "Autumn" season opened, she even felt
a sudden chill in the air—the performance was so wonderfully
effective—and she pulled her shawl more tightly around her shoulders.
She chanced then to look across the audience, and thought that several
rows down, in front of her, she saw Professor Bridwell.  She had no
idea he liked concerts; in fact, she realized that she knew nothing
whatever about him.  She was positive it was the professor—even from
the back, there was no mistaking his curly hair.  At once she realized
that he rather resembled portraits of Hector Berlioz.  He sat upright,
almost leaning forward in a posture that seemed ready to rise in an
instant.  She fancied that could she but see his handsome face, his
eyes would be closed, as he was carried away by the music, blown upon
Vivaldi's autumn wind.  Why she was looking at the audience rather than
at the orchestra she really did not know—she forced her gaze away from
the professor's back and tried to concentrate again upon the music.
But her effort was unsuccessful.
</p>

<p>
音乐会结束后，格雷琴跑到了出口，站在门口，回头望着礼堂的另一边。是的，是他，她终于看到了。他正沿着过道走来，她在人群中瞥见了他的脸。他看上去孤身一人。他没有跟任何人说话。她让开一条路，目光不断地扫过观众席，仿佛在寻找别人。他很快就到了，当他走过时，她转头看着他，仿佛是第一次注意到他。
</p><p>
When the concert was ended, Gretchen fairly ran to the exit, and stood
there at the door, looking back across the auditorium.  Yes, it was he,
she saw finally.  He was coming up the aisle and she glimpsed his face
among the swarm of bodies.  He appeared to be alone; he spoke to
nobody.  She stepped out of the way and kept looking across the
audience, as if seeking someone else.  He soon arrived, and when he
walked past, she turned and looked at him, as if suddenly noticing him
for the first time.
</p>

<p>
他的笑容一如既往地令人愉快。“晚上好，哈维兰小姐，”他语气温暖地说。
</p><p>
His smile was as delightful as always.  "Good evening, Miss Haviland,"
he said, with a tone of warmth.
</p>

<p>
“晚上好，教授。” 格蕾琴以为他放慢了一两秒，但她因太近距离地观察他而感到非常尴尬，于是又把目光转向人群。他继续走。
</p><p>
"Good evening, Professor."  Gretchen thought that he slowed for a
second or two, but she felt acutely embarrassed to be observing him too
closely, and looked away toward the crowd again.  He continued walking.
</p>

<p>
教授走后，格雷琴缓缓地出了一口气。她冲进人群中，穿过大厅走出去。夜幕降临了，外面天色已经黑了。大批人群从礼堂涌出，散布在广场上。当她步入寒冷刺骨的空气中，准备走下楼梯时，背后传来了一个声音。
</p><p>
When the professor had passed, Gretchen let out her breath slowly.
Into the thick of the crowd she plunged, and went out through the
lobby.  Evening had come on and it was dark outside.  Vast hordes were
dispersing across the plaza, pouring from the auditorium.  As she
stepped into the bitterly chill air and started down the stairs, a
voice hailed her from behind.
</p>

<p>
“那么，哈维兰小姐，你一个人吗？”
</p><p>
"Are you alone, then, Miss Haviland?"
</p>

<p>
格雷琴听到教授的声音猛地转过身，正好看到他短暂地笑了一声。他站在门外，脸朝外，大衣紧紧裹住自己。
</p><p>
Gretchen whirled around at the sound of the professor's voice, in time
to see him laugh briefly.  He was standing just outside the doors,
facing outward, his greatcoat pulled tightly around himself.
</p>

<p>
格雷琴走到下面的台阶上站了起来。“事实上，是的，”她抬起头回答道。“我一个人，我是一时兴起，自己来的。”
</p><p>
Gretchen went to stand on the step below.  "Actually, yes," she
replied, looking up.  "I am alone.  I came by myself on a whim."
</p>

<p>
“今天晚上很冷，”他一边说着，一边下台。他们并肩走下楼梯。“在回家之前，你想顺便喝杯咖啡吗？”
</p><p>
"It's quite chilly this evening," he said, stepping down once.  They
started down the stairs beside each other.  "Would you fancy a cup of
coffee, by chance, before making your way home?"
</p>

<p>
格雷琴笑了。他的举止确实很前卫。但她发现这令人耳目一新，而且——毕竟，她真的一直在寻找他，不是吗？“哎呀，这听起来像是一种令人愉快的消遣，教授。我相信我会的。”
</p><p>
Gretchen smiled.  He certainly had a forward manner; but she found it
refreshing, and—after all, she had really been seeking him, had she
not?  "Why, that sounds like a delightful diversion, Professor.  I
believe I shall."
</p>

<p>
说完，他们一起出发穿过广场。格雷琴立即开始谈论一个可能的话题：他们刚刚参加的音乐会。显而易见，布里德韦尔教授发现李斯特练习曲和她一样令人惊叹。在维瓦尔第音乐会期间，他也同意，他和她同时感到了突然的寒意。
</p><p>
With that, they set off together across the plaza.  Gretchen started
immediately upon a likely topic of conversation:  the concert they had
just attended.  It was instantly evident that Professor Bridwell had
found the Liszt etudes as breathtaking as she had.  And during the
Vivaldi, as well, he agreed that he had felt a sudden chill at
precisely the same time as she.
</p>

<p>
“乐团表现得很好，”她总结道。“我想这也是维瓦尔第聆听这部作品的方式——这些大型现代管弦乐团与音乐的精致不成比例。”
</p><p>
"The ensemble did well," she concluded.  "I suppose that is the way
Vivaldi would have heard the work too—none of these large, modern
orchestras quite out of proportion to the delicacy of the music."
</p>

<p>
“现代管弦乐队，”教授说，“足够适合现代作品，但实际上，演奏早期作品（例如维瓦尔第）所需的亲密感在一大群弦乐中确实消失了。”
</p><p>
"The modern orchestra," stated the professor, "is well enough suited
for modern works, but really, the intimacy required for performing
earlier works—as Vivaldi for instance—is really lost in the great
crowd of strings."
</p>

<p>
“同意。”
</p><p>
"Agreed."
</p>

<p>
不一会儿，他们来到了校园门口，找到了一家小咖啡馆。他们坐在一张小小的大理石桌子旁，进行了一次愉快的交谈，并在表演和音乐主题上发现了很多共识。尽管他没有她对李斯特的疯狂，但他同意格雷琴对《超验练习曲》的评价——受到神圣启发，并且像李斯特的许多作品一样，几乎超出了凡人的能力范围。
</p><p>
Presently they came to the campus gates and found their way to a small
café.  Seated at a tiny marble table, they had a delightful
tête-à-tête, and found much to agree upon regarding both the
performance, and the subject of music in general.  Though he had not
quite her madness for Liszt, he agreed with Gretchen's assessment of
the "Transcendental Etudes"—divinely inspired, and, like much of
Liszt's work, nearly beyond the reach of mortals.
</p>

<p>
格雷琴喝了第二杯咖啡，感觉有点头晕。她几乎拿不住杯子，最终笑着放下了。
</p><p>
Gretchen was on her second coffee and feeling rather giddy.  She could
hardly hold her cup steady, and she finally set it down with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
“教授，你会演奏乐器吗？” 她一边问​​道，一边用一只手推开杯子。
</p><p>
"Do you play an instrument, Professor?" she asked, pushing her cup away
with one hand.
</p>

<p>
“嗯，与其说我称之为演奏乐器，”他回答说，“不如说是演奏乐器。”
</p><p>
"Well, I would not so much call it playing the instrument," he
answered, "as playing _at_ the instrument."
</p>

<p>
“我明白了，”她笑道。“就像我拉小提琴的方式一样——尽管我敢说你在谈论李斯特的作品时就好像你对此有一些经验一样。”
</p><p>
"I see," she laughed.  "Rather the way I play _at_ the viola—though I
daresay you speak of Liszt's writing as if you have some experience
with it."
</p>

<p>
教授一时显得有些不知所措。他越过格雷琴的肩膀看了一眼，但很快就回想起自己，并将杯子举到唇边，再次与她的目光相遇。“我承认我已经_尝试过_。” 他放下杯子，把手伸进背心口袋，似乎在寻找什么。“但说实话，”他继续说道，“我没有技巧。哈维兰小姐，你自己呢？我认为你自己在小提琴方面做得相当不错。”
</p><p>
The professor seemed rather at a loss for an instant.  He glanced away
over Gretchen's shoulder, but recalled himself quickly and lifted his
cup to his lips, meeting her eyes again.  "I do admit I have _tried_."
He set his cup down while reaching into his vest pocket, as if
searching for something.  "But really," he continued, "I haven't the
technique.  How about yourself, Miss Haviland?  I take it you do rather
well yourself, upon the viola."
</p>

<p>
格蕾琴脸红了，意识到自己刚才的口气一定是在自吹自擂。教授似乎并没有泰然处之——她意识到这一定是他暂时失语的原因。“好吧，”她说着，在椅子上坐了下来。“有一次——当我还很年轻的时候，你明白——我幻想我会用乐器演奏。但是……”
</p><p>
Gretchen blushed, realizing that she must have sounded boastful just
then.  The professor seemed not to have taken it in stride—she
realized that this must have accounted for his momentary loss for
words.  "Well," she said then, settling herself forward upon her chair.
"At one time—when I was quite young, you understand—I fancied I would
perform upon the instrument.  But..."
</p>

<p>
“啊。” 布里德韦尔教授微笑着。“然后，毫无疑问，其他兴趣把你带走了。但你还在玩吗？” 他从背心口袋里掏出一个银色烟盒，在手指间翻来覆去。
</p><p>
"Ah."  Professor Bridwell smiled.  "Then, other interests swept you
away, no doubt.  But still you play?"  He had pulled a silver cigarette
case from his vest pocket, and he turned it over in his fingers.
</p>

<p>
“哦，确实如此。” 格雷琴深深地叹了口气。“我想，抛开所有的谦虚，我对乐器的掌握是足够的——但对于一个演奏者来说，足够的能力是很难容忍的……”在他回答之前，她冲上前去，感觉自己的脸涨得通红。“我最近确实没有规律地练习了！”
</p><p>
"Oh, indeed."  Gretchen sighed deeply.  "I suppose, with all modesty
set aside, I was adequate on the instrument—but adequacy in a
performer is hardly to be tolerated..."  Before he could reply, she
rushed onward, feeling her face flush.  "I certainly do not practice
with any regularity of late!"
</p>

<p>
布里德韦尔教授笑了。“我敢说——在我们这个年纪——休闲时光似乎是很难获得的……”他看着自己的烟盒，用拇指擦亮它。不过，他此时似乎觉得还是不要再抽烟了，于是他把烟盒放回背心口袋里。
</p><p>
Professor Bridwell laughed.  "I daresay—at our time of life—leisure
hours seem so unobtainable..."  He looked at his cigarette case,
polishing it with a thumb.  Seeming to think better of smoking just
then, however, he returned the case to his vest pocket.
</p>

<p>
格雷琴的笑容很淡。她点点头，承认他说的是实话——他们确实是一个年纪的。当然，她认为他不会超过三十三岁左右。“那么，音乐虽然是一种引人入胜的消遣，也是许多快乐的源泉，但最好还是与人分享，你不是说教授吗？” 他微微点头，格蕾琴澄清了她的说法。“也就是说——练习固然很好，但是……音乐的乐趣在于与朋友分享——音乐晚会和在客厅里熊熊燃烧的篝火的夜晚。老朋友们聚集在钢琴周围——还有香槟！ ——”
</p><p>
Gretchen's smile was thin.  She inclined her head, acknowledging the
truth of what he said—they were indeed probably of an age.  Certainly,
she thought he could be no more than thirty-three or thereabouts.
"Then, too, music, while an engaging diversion, and the source of much
happiness, is better shared, wouldn't you say Professor?"  He nodded
slightly, and Gretchen clarified her statement.  "That is to
say—practicing is all very well, but...the joy of music is in sharing
it with one's friends—musical soirées and evenings in the parlor with
a roaring fire.  Old friends gathered around the piano—and
champagne!—"
</p>

<p>
布里德韦尔教授对她的话感到很温暖，他搓着手，就像在她提到的那堆火之前一样。“你击中了，”他热情地回答。“为什么——难怪像我一样独自生活在一所我担心的房子里太大了……”
</p><p>
Professor Bridwell warmed to her words, and rubbed his hands together
as if before the very fire she had mentioned.  "You have hit it
precisely," he replied with enthusiasm.  "Why—it's no wonder that
living, as I do, alone in a house that I fear is far too large for..."
</p>

<p>
格蕾琴觉得她就在这时发现了教授的支吾，他的演讲中出现了轻微的停顿。
</p><p>
Gretchen thought she detected the professor falter just then, and there
was the slightest of pauses in his speech.
</p>

<p>
“……你看，只是为了我自己，”他最后说道。他自嘲地笑了笑，把黑色的头发甩到一边。“但当我到达这里时，我立即需要一个地方。大约一年左右，当我更深入地了解这座城市时，我可能会找到更小的住所。”
</p><p>
"... For myself alone, you see," he finished.  He laughed at himself,
tossing the black mop of hair to one side.  "But I needed some place
instantly when I arrived here.  I will probably find smaller digs in a
year or so, when I've come to know the city more intimately."
</p>

<p>
“确实如此，”格雷琴回答道，脸上也露出了笑容。“我很理解一个人如何需要永久的住所——在一个陌生的城市越快找到它们，为什么，一个人就能越快地适应生活，在外国港口找到自己的方位。”
</p><p>
"Indeed," Gretchen answered, returning his smile.  "I quite understand
how one needs permanent lodgings—the more quickly one can find them in
a strange city, why, the quicker one is able to settle into life, get
one's bearings in a foreign port."
</p>

<p>
“确实如此，”他坚定地点点头回答道。
</p><p>
"So true," he replied with a firm nod.
</p>

<p>
过了一会儿，他们的谈话似乎已经到了一个紧要关头。他们的咖啡已经喝完了，两人似乎已经很久没有碰过自己的杯子了，他们的谈话是如此投入。
</p><p>
A few moments later, a juncture seemed to have been reached in their
conversation.  Their coffees were at an end, and neither of them had
touched their cups for what seemed ages, so engaged had they become in
their conversation.
</p>

<p>
“但是现在，”布里德韦尔教授看了一眼怀表，大声说道，“我不应该再让你远离你的晚餐或者——或者你的其他职责了。请允许我护送你回家，哈维兰小姐——或者去哪里你可能要走了。”
</p><p>
"But now," Professor Bridwell exclaimed, with a glance to his pocket
watch, "I should not be keeping you away from your supper or—or your
other duties any longer.  Please allow me to escort you home, Miss
Haviland—or where you may be going."
</p>

<p>
“谢谢您，教授——但实际上没有必要，”她宣称。她觉得这听起来太坚决了，于是她轻松地笑了笑，以表明她只是字面意思，而不是拒绝。“我的房间就在附近，晚上的空气对我有好处，你看。我快步走不会超过十分钟。”
</p><p>
"Thank you, Professor—but really there is no need," she declared.  She
thought that sounded too firm, and she smiled easily, to show that she
meant it only literally, not as a rebuff.  "My rooms are close by, and
the evening air will do me good, you see.  It shan't take me more than
ten minutes at a brisk pace."
</p>

<p>
“是的，”他同意。“我相信我会自己走路。只要步伐轻快，空气就有利于血液循环。”
</p><p>
"Yes," he agreed.  "I believe I shall walk myself.  The air is good for
the circulation, as long as one's pace is brisk."
</p>

<p>
格雷琴站起来，行了屈膝礼。教授拿着她的外套，专心致志地站着，她戴上手套。“布里德韦尔教授，我衷心感谢您度过了这个迷人的夜晚。这——太棒了。”
</p><p>
Gretchen rose, and took a curtsey.  The Professor held her coat and
stood attentively while she donned her gloves.  "I do thank you most
kindly for the enchanting evening, Professor Bridwell.  It—it has been
marvelous."
</p>

<p>
“同样，哈维兰小姐。我真诚地希望我们很快就能再次享受到这样的快乐。”
</p><p>
"Likewise, Miss Haviland.  I sincerely hope we shall have the pleasure
again soon."
</p>

<p>
又说了几句告别的话，格雷琴就走到了街上，布里德韦尔教授跟在后面，他们就分道扬镳了。她想象着他站在街上注视着她，直到她转过下一个街角，却不敢回头。夜晚虽不是阴天，却格外寒冷，羊毛大衣里即使裹着披肩，也挡不住寒意渗入骨髓。她很少戴帽子，但那天晚上她希望有一顶——一顶在俄罗斯很受欢迎的大毛皮帽子，她想——那是最合适的，因为她可以把它拉下来戴在耳朵上。几分钟后，当她到达自己的宿舍时，她已经浑身发抖了。她脱掉衣服，直接上床睡觉，盖着一层层羽绒被，胸前贴着一个热水袋。她没有胃口吃晚饭，决定早起吃一顿丰盛的早餐来弥补。
</p><p>
With a few more words of parting, Gretchen stepped into the street,
followed by Professor Bridwell, and they went their separate ways.  She
fancied that he stood in the street and gazed at her until she turned
the next corner, but she dared not glance back.  The evening was
extremely cold, though not overcast, and her wool coat, even with a
shawl wrapped beneath, did not keep the chill from seeping into her
bones.  She rarely wore hats, but that evening she wished she had
one—one of those large fur hats so favored in Russia, she
thought—that would be most appropriate, since she could pull it down
around her ears.  By the time she arrived at her rooming house a few
minutes later, she was shivering.  She undressed and went straight to
bed beneath layers of feather comforters with a hot water bottle
pressed against her chest.  She had no appetite for supper, and
resolved to arise early and eat a hearty breakfast to compensate.
</p>

<p>
睡眠是极其难以捉摸的，但格雷琴发现自己奇怪地高兴，因为她无法入睡，因为她有闲暇详细思考那天发生的一切。尤其是，她有时间思考与布里德韦尔教授的插曲。他是一个最有趣的人。他是一位英国文学教授——嗯，这几乎可以意味着任何事情，她猜想——但他却没有那样的特质。她见过的几乎每一位英语教授——还有很多文学系的学生——都在不断地滔滔不绝地滔滔不绝地滔滔不绝地从无名作家的作品中收集到巧妙的引语，无论这些作者是在世的还是已故的——他们对此并不挑剔。在她看来，这句话越是晦涩难懂，他们的亲朋好友就越是钦佩它。她一直觉得这种做法令人反感。但布里德韦尔教授根本不是那样的。整个晚上——事实上他们坐在温咖啡旁已经两个小时了——他从来没有引用过任何一位作家，无论是名人还是其他人。然而，他的用词、他的举止、他口音中暗示的外国影响——他谈论李斯特的方式——都表明他与最有文化的英语形式的亲密关系。通过清晰的思想和细致的表达——而不是随意引用其他人的话——他散发出她认为是真正的教授气质，建立在坚实的基础上，不做作。她发现他具有令人耳目一新的吸引力，这既是为了他本身，也是因为她与她在图书馆经常遇到的那些傲慢的教授有所不同。当她进入梦乡时，热水袋压在身上，她希望能有机会与布里德韦尔教授再次进行这样的谈话。
</p><p>
Sleep was elusive in the extreme, but Gretchen found herself strangely
delighted that she could not sleep, for she had the leisure to think
over in detail all that had happened that day.  And especially, she had
time to ponder her interlude with Professor Bridwell.  He was a most
intriguing man.  He was a professor of English Literature—well, that
could mean almost anything, she supposed—yet he did not have that
_way_ about him.  Nearly every professor of English she had ever
met—and a good many students of literature as well—were continually
spouting clever quotes gleaned from the works of obscure authors,
living and dead—they were not particular about that.  It often seemed
to her that the more obscure the quotation, the more it was admired
amongst their cronies.  She had always found such practices revolting.
But Professor Bridwell was not at all like that.  Why, the entire
evening—and it had been two hours in fact that they had sat over cups
lukewarm coffee—he had never quoted an author, famous or otherwise.
Yet, his choice of words, his demeanor, the hint of some foreign
influence in his accent—the way he talked of Liszt—all pointed to an
intimacy with the most literate form of the English language.  Through
clear thoughts and meticulous expression—rather than through
haphazardly quoting other men—he exuded what she believed was a real
professorial air, built upon a solid foundation without pretense.  She
found him refreshingly attractive, both for his own sake and as a
change from the pompous professors she encountered so often in the
library.  As she drifted into sleep, the hot water bottle pressed
against herself, she hoped she would have the opportunity for another
such conversation with Professor Bridwell.
</p>

<hr align="center" width="60%">

<p>
格雷琴的车里装满了书。当她把书重新上架时，她没有把车慢慢地推到书架之间，而是把车停在每一排的末尾，一次将几本书搬到适当的位置。图书馆比平常安静，尽管那天她要更换的书太多了，但她的工作速度相当缓慢。她陷入了沉思，自言自语地哼着歌，声音虽小到附近的顾客都能听到，但足够让她自己开心了。她刚刚回到推车旁，将它推到了下一排。她又抱起一抱书，选了那些家在这一排的书，然后转身慢慢地走，看着数字。当她把每一本书放在书架上时，她都会扫一眼，感叹自己那天的时间太少了——不可能有偷读的时刻，哪怕是短暂的。她踮起脚尖，走到上层架子前，暂时停止了哼唱。就在这时，一阵脚步声传到了她的耳边，她猛地推了一下书本。
</p><p>
Gretchen's cart of books was extraordinarily loaded.  Rather than push
it slowly between the stacks as she reshelved books, she stopped the
cart at the end of each row and carried a few books at a time to their
proper places.  The library was more quiet than usual, and despite the
overwhelming number of books she had to replace that day she worked
rather slowly.  Lost in thought, she hummed to herself, not so loudly
that any patron who happened to be about could hear, but loud enough
for her own amusement.  She had just returned to the cart and pushed it
to the next row.  She lifted another armful of books, choosing those
whose home was in that particular row, and turned to walk slowly,
watching the numbers.  She glanced at each book when she shelved it,
lamenting that she had too little time that day—there could be no
stolen moments of reading, even briefly.  She stood on her toes to
reach an upper shelf and stopped humming for a moment.  The sound of a
footfall reached her at that instant, and she gave the book a quick
shove.
</p>

<p>
“美好的一天，哈维兰小姐。”
</p><p>
"Good day, Miss Haviland."
</p>

<p>
格雷琴环顾四周，看到了一条精美的羊毛裤，她把体重完全放回了脚上。视线向上望去，她感到一阵宜人的红晕。“布里德韦尔教授，你吓到我了！” 她惊呼道。
</p><p>
Gretchen looked around to see a fine pair of wool trousers, as she
returned her weight fully to her feet.  Following upward with her eyes,
she felt a pleasant blush. "Professor Bridwell, you startled me!" she
exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
“小心点，”他回答道，把手伸到她头顶上方。格雷琴抬起头，看到他把书推到了书架上。她让它在边缘摇摇欲坠。“你差点就失去了一个，哈维兰小姐。”
</p><p>
"Careful," he returned, reaching his hand above her head.  Gretchen
looked up to see that he pushed the book further onto the shelf; she
had left it precariously tottering on the edge.  "You almost lost one,
Miss Haviland."
</p>

<p>
“哦，天哪，”她笑了，把剩下的书更牢固地抓在胸前。她继续轻松地沿着这一排走下去，羊毛裙子在脚踝处摆动。“有什么书我可以帮你找吗？” 她问道，像个女学生一样转过身来向他走来。
</p><p>
"Oh dear," she laughed, and grasped the rest of the books more securely
to her chest.  She continued to walk easily down the row, with her wool
skirt swinging about her ankles.  "Is there a book I can help you
find?" she asked, whirling toward him like a schoolgirl.
</p>

<p>
“事实上，”教授紧张地说。“我今天根本不是以——专业身份来的。”
</p><p>
"Actually," the professor said, nervously drawing out the word.  "I've
not come in a—a professional capacity at all today."
</p>

<p>
“哦？” 格雷琴转身看着他，但继续走着。她用空着的手从嘴里拔出了一缕头发。
</p><p>
"Oh?"  Gretchen turned to look at him, but kept walking.  With her free
hand, she extracted a strand of hair from her mouth.
</p>

<p>
“那天晚上——喝咖啡的时候，”他一边说，一边加快了在她身边的步伐。“嗯，真的，我发现这次谈话非常愉快，而且……”
</p><p>
"The other evening—at coffee," he said, taking up the pace beside her.
"Well, really, I found the conversation most delightful and..."
</p>

<p>
“是的？” 格雷琴停了下来，然后跪下来把另一本书架在下面。
</p><p>
"Yes?"  Gretchen stopped, then knelt to shelve another book, lower down.
</p>

<p>
“我想知道，”他很快地继续说道，似乎不敢说出来，“你是否同意今晚和我一起吃饭。”
</p><p>
"And I was wondering," he continued rather quickly, as if he dare not
speak of it, "whether you might consent to dine with me this evening."
</p>

<p>
格雷琴慢慢地站了起来。“我——呃……”
</p><p>
Gretchen stood up, rather slowly.  "I—well..."
</p>

<p>
“是的，”教授结结巴巴地说，“当然——这么短的通知。我明白。这不太合适，而且我确信你很忙。也许下次吧。” 他向后退了一步，似乎要告辞。
</p><p>
"Yes," the professor stammered, "of course—such short notice.  I
understand.  It's hardly proper, and I'm sure you're quite busy.
Perhaps another time."  He stepped backward as if to take his leave.
</p>

<p>
“一点也不，”格蕾琴淡淡一笑说道。她把怀里厚重的书本抓得更紧。“我应该感到高兴，真的。” 然后她注视着他的眼睛，看到它在闪烁。看到他的笑容，她不由得回以全力。“那天晚上，似乎确实有很多话要说。” 她继续沿着这一排走下去，布里德韦尔教授在她旁边。
</p><p>
"Not at all," Gretchen said with a faint smile.  She clutched the heavy
books more tightly in her arms.  "I should be delighted, really."  She
caught his eye then, and saw it twinkle.  The sight of his smile could
not but make her return it fully.  "The other evening, it did seem
there was ever so much more to say."  She continued down the row, with
Professor Bridwell beside her.
</p>

<p>
“这就是接受吗？”
</p><p>
"Is that an acceptance?"
</p>

<p>
她笑了，停下来正视着他，似乎很惊讶。“嗯，我相信是这样，教授。” 她眨了眨眼睛。他的脸颊突然涨得通红，她强忍着没笑出来。
</p><p>
She laughed and stopped to face him squarely, as if astonished.  "Why,
I believe it is, Professor."  She blinked her eyes.  The sudden blush
in his cheeks was profound, and she composed herself to keep from
laughing.
</p>

<p>
“六点会不会太晚？或者太早？”
</p><p>
"Would six o'clock be too late?  Or too early?"
</p>

<p>
“都不是，教授。” 格雷琴觉得他看起来就像有人递给他一只圣诞鹅。“我会在正门等你。”
</p><p>
"Neither, Professor."  Gretchen thought he looked as if he had been
handed a Christmas goose.  "I'll meet you at the main entrance."
</p>

<p>
“太棒了！我会……”他听起来仍然难以置信，似乎快要崩溃了。他把黑发从眼前拨开，扭动一根手指上的发绺。“那我六点见？”
</p><p>
"Stupendous!  I'll..."  He still sounded incredulous, and seemed near
to bursting.  He pushed his black locks from his eye, and twisted a
lock on one finger.  "I'll meet you at six then?"
</p>

<p>
他们互相离开，格雷琴觉得她听到主楼梯间里传来微弱的口哨声，他的靴子踩在石阶上的声音渐渐远去。当声音消失在远处时，她立即飞奔到她的购物车上。如果她要在六点前读完书，就需要她坚持不懈的注意力——她还有七车车的书，还有不到五个小时的时间要把它们全部重新上架。直到五点四十五分，她才停下来休息，向赛迪小姐道晚安，然后朝正门走去。她站在巨大的橡木门内，石拱门下，当教授走近时，她可以透过玻璃看到他。在等待的过程中，她沉思了一会儿，喘了口气，突然一阵心悸充满了她的胸膛。天哪，她心里想——他没有认为我太前卫了，真是个奇迹。她感到脸颊微微刺痛，好像开始变色了。什么样的女人会在提前五小时通知的情况下与陌生人一起共进晚餐？她的一部分甚至不敢回答自己的问题，但她的另一部分回答说，他无论如何都不是一个完全陌生的人——她见过他很多次——并且在没有任何通知的情况下和他一起喝咖啡。现在还不是开始担心礼节问题的时候。她把发带从头发上拉下来，梳理了一下，然后小心地重新系好发带，把头发甩到背后。她想，我至少能做的就是让自己稍微得体一些，可惜我没有时间换外套。一顶帽子可能因其保暖性（晚上肯定很冷）而受到欢迎，而且还因为时尚。但她想，如果我不时尚，那么看起来时尚又有什么用呢？
</p><p>
They took their leaves of each other, and Gretchen thought she heard a
faint whistling in the main stairwell as the sound of his boots on the
stone steps receded.  She flew to her cart immediately the sound died
away in the distance.  Her unflagging concentration would be required
if she were to be finished by six—she had seven more cartloads of
books, and less than five hours in which to reshelve them all.  She did
not stop or rest until five forty-five, when she bid Miss Sadie good
evening, and made her way to the main entrance.  She stood inside the
great oak doors, under stone arches where she could see the professor
through the glass when he approached.  With a few moments to ponder and
catch her breath while she waited, a sudden flutter filled her bosom.
Good Lord, she thought to herself—it's a wonder he did not think me
scandalously forward.  She felt a faint tingling in her cheeks as if
she had begun to color.  What sort of woman would join a stranger for
dinner with five hours notice?  Part of her dared not even answer her
own question, but another part of her replied that he was not a perfect
stranger by any means—she had met him any number of times—and had
joined him for coffee with no notice at all.  It was hardly the time to
start worrying about propriety.  She pulled the ribbon from her hair
and brushed it before retying the ribbon carefully and flinging her
hair behind her back.  The least I can do, she thought, is to make
myself halfway presentable, though it's a pity I haven't time to change
my coat.  A hat might have been welcome for its warmth—the evening was
sure to be cold—and for fashion as well.  But then what is the use of
seeming fashionable, she thought, if fashionable I am not?
</p>

<p>
布里德韦尔教授用双臂紧紧搂着自己，没戴手套的双手夹在腋下，小跑着上了楼梯。格雷琴看到他，推开门走了出去。
</p><p>
With his arms wrapped closely around him and his ungloved hands tucked
beneath his arms, Professor Bridwell trotted up the stairs.  Upon
seeing him, Gretchen pushed open the doors and stepped outside.
</p>

<p>
“为什么它比我想象的要酷，”她评论道。
</p><p>
"Why it's cooler than I had thought," she remarked.
</p>

<p>
教授的笑容相当温暖她的心。“那我们快点走吧，”他咬牙切齿地说，“我知道今晚的地点。他们甚至会生火，如果我们动作快的话，我们可能会找到一张足够近的桌子来感受它的温暖。” ”。
</p><p>
The professor's smile fairly warmed her heart.  "Let's hurry along
then," he said between chattering teeth, "I know just the place this
evening.  They'll even have a fire, and if we're quick about it, we
might find a table close enough to feel its warmth."
</p>

<p>
两人并肩走出广场。云层落下，掩盖了远处城市的声音。他们继续穿过校园大门，进入附近的街道。小区里并不拥挤，因为放假的学生太多了，虽然有几群穿得暖和的人来来往往，但偶尔有马车嘎嘎驶过。布里德韦尔教授带路走进一条小巷，迎接他们的是一家灯火通明的咖啡馆。
</p><p>
Side by side, they walked out through the plaza.  The clouds had
descended, muffling the sounds of the city beyond.  They continued
through the campus gates into the nearby streets.  The neighborhood was
uncrowded, since so many students had left for their holidays, and
though there were a few groups of people walking to and fro, dressed
warmly against the weather, only the occasional carriage rattled by.
Professor Bridwell led the way into a side street, where they were
greeted by a brightly lit café.
</p>

<p>
“我不知道……”格雷琴开始说道。
</p><p>
"I had no idea...," Gretchen began.
</p>

<p>
“校园附近有一家法国咖啡馆吗？” 教授为她完成了。“这很新。” 他打开门，熙熙攘攘的人群和欢快的声音迎接他们。“我说，”他继续说道，“这个地方似乎已经被发现了。” 当他扶着门时，格雷琴跟着他进去，当他与领班交谈时，格雷琴站在一边脱下手套。当她折叠手套时，她抬起头，及时看到那个男人将一张钞票塞进围裙口袋里。
</p><p>
"Of a French café so near campus?" the professor finished for her.
"It's quite new."  He pulled open the door and the sounds of bustling
crowds and gay voices greeted them.  "I say," he continued, "the place
appears to have been discovered." Gretchen followed him in while he
held the door, and stood by removing her gloves while he conferred with
the head waiter.  She glanced up as she folded her gloves in time to
see the man wisk a bill into his apron pocket.
</p>

<p>
“跟我来，先生。”
</p><p>
"Follow me, monsieur."
</p>

<p>
教授挽着格雷琴的手臂，领着她走。他们的桌子在后面，正如布里德韦尔教授所希望的那样，桌子旁边有一个开放式的砖砌壁炉，里面堆满了噼啪作响的橡木原木，熊熊燃烧。她静静地坐着，侍者用浓重的口音英语背诵着关于这家餐厅的特色菜的看似没完没了的演讲。
</p><p>
The professor took Gretchen's arm and led her along.  Their table was
in the back and, as Professor Bridwell had hoped, it was close by an
open brick fireplace filled with a roaring blaze of crackling oak logs.
She sat in silent attendance while their waiter recited, in heavily
accented English, a seemingly unending speech upon the specialities of
the house.
</p>

<p>
格雷琴中途忘记了细节，她的目光从他身上移到了火上。“我简直不知所措，”当他说完并站在他们面前时，她惊呼道。“请——做你认为最好的事情，教授。”
</p><p>
Gretchen lost the particulars mid-way, and her eyes strayed beyond him
to the fire.  "I'm quite overwhelmed," she exclaimed when he had
finished and stood poised before them.  "Please—do what you think
best, Professor."
</p>

<p>
布里德韦尔教授当时让她感到惊讶的是，他向后靠了靠，一副知道自己在做什么的随意神态，并用格雷琴听来似乎完美的法语讲着。
</p><p>
Professor Bridwell surprised her then, by leaning back with the casual
air of one who knows what he is about, and held forth in what seemed,
to Gretchen's ear, flawless French.
</p>

<p>
“太棒了，教授。”他说完后，她附和道。“你的法语很漂亮。”
</p><p>
"Bravo, Professor," she chimed when he had finished.  "Your French is
beautiful."
</p>

<p>
教授此时显得有些尴尬，顺利地将话题转到了装潢上。这间房间与格蕾琴想象中的法国咖啡馆完全不同——它是纯白色的，有高高的木雕椽子，但墙上挂着做工华丽的波斯地毯，拉低了天花板，给房间带来了亲密感。 ; 并消除众多客人交谈的声音。他们的主菜如期而至——美味的水煮白鱼，配上精致的酱汁，他们几乎默默地吃着，只是偶尔对食物发表评论。他询问了她的健康状况，听了当天的闲聊，然后饶有兴趣地听了她对生活的简短叙述，只是偶尔插话来澄清某些要点。她没有透露与家人的疏远，而是详述了自己在大学的岁月。
</p><p>
The professor seemed somewhat embarrassed then, and smoothly turned the
conversation to the decor.  The room was hardly what Gretchen should
have expected of a French café—it was done in stark white, with high
rafters of carved wood, but upon the walls hung gorgeously worked
Persian carpets which served to bring the ceiling down and lend
intimacy to the room; and to muffle the sound of so many conversing
guests.  Their entrees arrived in due course—a delightful poached
white fish in delicate sauce, which they ate practically in silence,
but for the occasional comment upon the food.  He asked after her
health, and heard the small-talk of the day, then listened with
interest to an abridged account of her life, interjecting only
occasional questions to clarify certain points.  She stopped short of
revealing the estrangement of her family, but dwelt upon her years at
university.
</p>

<p>
格雷琴终于注意到她的盘子空了，并宣称鱼在嘴里完全融化了。布里德韦尔教授回答说他会向厨师致意。说到这里，他的笑容逐渐加深，似乎还想补充什么，但又停了下来。
</p><p>
Gretchen at length noticed the emptiness of her plate and declared that
the fish positively melted in one's mouth.  Professor Bridwell replied
that he would send compliments to the chef.  His smile grew gradually
as he said this, with a hint of something further he wished to add, but
he stopped.
</p>

<p>
“还有别的事吗？” 她一边问​​道，一边小心翼翼地将银器放在空盘子上。
</p><p>
"Was there something else?" she asked, setting her silver carefully
atop her empty plate.
</p>

<p>
“不，没什么，”他笑道，放下了自己的银器。
</p><p>
"No, nothing," he laughed, putting down his own silver.
</p>

<p>
不久，他们的盘子就被清理干净了，教授点了一杯利口酒和咖啡。格雷琴拒绝了一杯利口酒，因为她已经喝了足够多的酒，让她的脸色稍微红了一些——她选择了咖啡和一小杯蛋糕。
</p><p>
Presently, their plates were cleared away and the professor ordered a
liqueur with coffee.  Gretchen declined a liqueur, having drunk enough
wine already to raise her color slightly—she settled for coffee and a
small gateau.
</p>

<p>
“你提到你拉小提琴，”他说，用一只手拿起他的利口酒。“玩很久了吗？”
</p><p>
"You mentioned that you play the viola," he said, taking up his liqueur
with one hand.  "Have you been playing long?"
</p>

<p>
“从我十六岁起，”她一边回答，一边在咖啡里搅拌奶油。“我小时候开始接触小提琴——我真的记不清是几岁了。十六岁时，我出去度了一个夏天，然后……”她停下来看了他一眼，敲了敲她的蛋糕用她的叉子。“嗯，我遇到了一个拉小提琴的年轻人，我对他的乐器非常非常着迷。它似乎真的很适合我。”
</p><p>
"Since I was sixteen," she replied, stirring cream into her coffee.  "I
began with the violin as a child—I really can't recall at what age.
When I was sixteen I went away for a summer, and..." she stopped to
look at him for an instant, tapping upon her gateau with her fork.
"Well, I met a young man who played the viola, and I was quite—quite
taken with his instrument.  It seemed to suit me, really."
</p>

<p>
“我想说确实如此，”教授同意道。“不寻常，尤其是对于一个女人来说——甚至有点异国情调……而且很有趣……”
</p><p>
"I would say it does," the professor agreed.  "Unusual, especially for
a woman—mildly exotic even...and intriguing..."
</p>

<p>
他们继续谈论小提琴和钢琴，互相谈论他们最喜欢的作品，比较作曲家。格雷琴自己从来没有认真弹过钢琴——她觉得这很令人沮丧，并惊讶于任何人都能掌握这样的乐器。
</p><p>
They continued conversing about the viola and the piano, telling each
other about their favorite pieces, comparing composers.  Gretchen had
never played the piano seriously herself—she found it frustrating and
was amazed that anyone could master such an instrument.
</p>

<p>
“这需要双手的独立性，”她说。“我试过了，但我永远无法演奏任何值得一提的东西。哦，管风琴是另一种我根本无法理解的东西。听起来很美，看起来很滑稽，但演奏起来却很尴尬。”
</p><p>
"It requires such independence of the hands," she said.  "I've tried,
but I could never play anything worth mentioning.  Oh, the organ is
another one that I simply cannot fathom.  Beautiful to hear, it's quite
comical to watch—and seems so awkward to play."
</p>

<p>
“我认为，两者都不比小提琴更复杂，”教授回答道。他已经转动杯子有一段时间了，但他停下来，把手从桌子上移开。“想想控制弓所需的灵巧性，以及在保持正确音调的同时发出颤音的能力。这同样令人惊叹。”
</p><p>
"Neither is really any more complicated than the viola, I should
think," the professor replied.  He had been twirling his glass for some
time, but he stopped and removed his hand from the table.  "Think of
the dexterity required to control your bow, and the simultaneous
imparting of vibrato while retaining correct intonation.  It's quite as
remarkable."
</p>

<p>
“我当然明白你的意思。经过长期练习，这一切似乎都很容易。”
</p><p>
"I see what you mean, certainly.  It all seems easy with long practice."
</p>

<p>
“你也唱女低音吗？”
</p><p>
"Do you sing alto as well?"
</p>

<p>
她笑了。“非常可怜的女低音，教授。”
</p><p>
She laughed.  "Very poor alto, Professor."
</p>

<p>
“不过还是女低音。我确信你会唱女低音。” 他又喝了一口利口酒，慢慢地转动着酒杯。“歌剧呢？我自己也鄙视瓦格纳。”
</p><p>
"But alto nonetheless.  I was certain you would sing alto." He sipped
his liqueur again and twirled the glass slowly.  "What about opera?  I
despise Wagner myself."
</p>

<p>
“真的吗？” 格雷琴回答道，伸手去拿咖啡。“我不能说我真的很喜欢瓦格纳的作品，就我所听到的而言，但威尔第的作品很甜美。”
</p><p>
"Really?" Gretchen replied, reaching for her coffee.  "I can't say I
truly enjoy Wagner's work, the little I have heard.  But Verdi—is
luscious."
</p>

<p>
“是的，威尔第。我非常同意你的评价。当然，莫扎特是无可非议的。”
</p><p>
"Yes, Verdi.  I quite agree with your assessment.  And Mozart, of
course, is beyond reproach."
</p>

<p>
“当然。但我自己一般更喜欢歌曲的亲密感。”
</p><p>
"Positively.  But I generally prefer the intimacy of lieder myself."
</p>

<p>
“德语？”
</p><p>
"German?"
</p>

<p>
她笑着用叉子指着他。“不仅是德语——还有香颂。”
</p><p>
She laughed and pointed her fork at him.  "Not only German—chansons as
well."
</p>

<p>
“听了我就放心了。” 布里德韦尔教授随后将一只手伸进口袋，取出银色烟盒。“哈维兰小姐，我抽烟你介意吗？”
</p><p>
"I'm relieved to hear it."  Professor Bridwell then put one hand into
his pocket, and withdrew his silver cigarette case.  "Would you mind,
Miss Haviland, if I smoke?"
</p>

<p>
“当然不是，”她回答道。
</p><p>
"Of course not," she replied.
</p>

<p>
“有些女士觉得这很冒犯，”他慢慢地打开箱子说道，“但我发现它是一顿愉快的晚餐的完美收尾。”
</p><p>
"Some ladies find it offensive," he said, opening the case slowly, "but
I find it the perfect finish to a delightful meal."
</p>

<p>
“我完全同意。” 格雷琴推开盘子——蛋糕虽然很小，但实在是太丰盛了——然后坐回椅子上。香烟一直对她有吸引力，她自己有时也会在私下里沉迷其中。然而，她无法忍受雪茄，因为它们让她想起了她父亲那些令人厌恶的熟人——在她童年时期，这些人每周都来打牌。“我可以问一下，”她双手撑在桌子上，轻声说道，“教授，您对女性吸烟有何看法？”
</p><p>
"I couldn't agree more."  Gretchen pushed away her plate—the gateau
though small, was simply too rich—and sat back upon her chair.
Cigarettes had always appealed to her, and she indulged on occasion
herself—in private.  Cigars she could not abide, however, for they
reminded her too much of her father's odious acquaintances—men who
came to play cards each week throughout her childhood.  "If I might
ask," she said quietly, folding her hands the table, "how do you feel
about women smoking, Professor?"
</p>

<p>
他停了下来，打开的盒子放在他面前的桌子上，定定地看着她的眼睛。“哈维兰小姐，”他回答道，“我们生活在一个开明的时代，不是吗？妇女的选举权——坦率地说，我相信这很快就会实现。大学教育——就像你自己的那样。”
</p><p>
He paused, with the open case upon the table before him and looked
steadily into her eyes.  "Miss Haviland," he answered, "we are living
in an enlightened age, are we not?  Women's suffrage—and frankly, it
will happen soon, I'm sure.  University educations—such as your own."
</p>

<p>
她点点头，但让他继续说下去。他仔细地研究了烟盒的顶部。旁边一名侍者在旁边盘旋，拿出一个浅浅的白色瓷器烟灰缸，放在他的肘部附近。
</p><p>
She nodded, but let him continue.  He studied the top of the cigarette
case with some care.  From the side, a hovering waiter produced a
shallow ashtray of white china and set it near his elbow.
</p>

<p>
“我不反对，”他继续说道，“女人追求自己喜欢的一切，只要她达到了多数。就像任何男人一样。” 他用手指抚摸烟盒，合上又打开。“坚强而独立的思想是任何人的资产，无论男性还是女性。” 他犹豫地抬起头。“你似乎有这样的想法。我相信你读过达尔文先生的书——而且我怀疑其他进步思想家也是如此。”
</p><p>
"I have no objection," he continued, "to a woman pursuing whatever
takes her fancy, provided she's reached majority.  The same as any
man."  He fingered the cigarette case, closing and then opening it
again.  "A strong and independent mind is an asset in anyone, male or
female."  He looked up hesitantly.  "You seem to have such a mind.
You've read Mr. Darwin, I believe—and I suspect other progressive
thinkers as well."
</p>

<p>
格蕾琴对他微笑，但又有些疑惑地歪着头。
</p><p>
Gretchen smiled at him, but tilted her head with some puzzlement.
</p>

<p>
“你曾经称我更加进化，”他回答道，回答了她未说出口的问题。“这可不是一个没读过书的女人会用的词。我猜你读过达尔文先生等人的书。” 见她笑意，他撇了撇嘴，继续说道。“我相信，真正将人与低等动物区分开来的是思想——如果有宗教倾向的话，那就是灵魂。女性与男性一样——我们都拥有最人性化的特征。”
</p><p>
"You once called me more evolved," he replied answering her unspoken
question.  "That's hardly the sort of phrase an unread woman would use.
I presumed you have read Mr. Darwin, among others." He curled his lips
upon seeing her amusement and continued speaking.  "It is the mind, I
believe—and the soul, if one is religiously inclined—that really
distinguishes man from the lesser animals.  Female no less than
male—we all possess that most human of traits."
</p>

<p>
他的详细答复比她想象的更加有利和尖锐。这让她很高兴，并在很大程度上证实了她对他的感觉。“那你根本不介意我加入吗？”
</p><p>
His extensive reply was more favorable and pointed than she would have
thought possible.  It pleased her, and confirmed a great deal that she
had sensed about him.  "Then you won't mind at all if I join you?"
</p>

<p>
“无论如何，”他毫不犹豫地回答，把银盒举到她面前。她熟练地取出一根烟，在指甲上敲了两下，递给他点燃。当他点燃自己的香烟时，她向后弯曲手腕，让它在她修长的手指之间晃来晃去。
</p><p>
"By all means," he returned without hesitation, holding the silver case
toward her.  She deftly removed a cigarette, and tamping it upon her
fingernail twice, held it out for him to light.  She bent back her
wrist and let it dangle between her long fingers while he lit his own
cigarette.
</p>

<p>
“现在我们已经了解了关于我的一切，”她说，吹散了一股细烟，“也许你可以告诉我一些关于你自己的事情，教授。”
</p><p>
"Now that we've learned all about me," she said, blowing a thin stream
of smoke away, "perhaps you'll tell me about yourself, Professor."
</p>

<p>
“拜托，”他把烟灰缸放在桌子中间，“请叫我安托万。我想我们不需要这么正式。”
</p><p>
"Please," he said, setting the ashtray in the middle of the table, "do
call me Antoine.  We needn't be so formal, I think."
</p>

<p>
她静静地笑了。“安托万。”
</p><p>
She laughed quietly.  "Antoine."
</p>

<p>
“我的母亲是法国人，”他平静地说。
</p><p>
"My mother was French," he stated quietly.
</p>

<p>
格雷琴注意到他使用了过去时，但没有进一步询问。“毫无疑问，她是你们优秀法语的源泉。”
</p><p>
Gretchen caught his use of the past tense, but did not inquire further.
"No doubt she is the source of your excellent French."
</p>

<p>
“小时候，妈妈确实对我说法语，但我的法语很差，除了家庭对话之外，什么都不懂。”
</p><p>
"Maman did speak French to me as a child—but my French is quite poor
for anything but domestic conversation."
</p>

<p>
“据我所知，”她吸着香烟回答道，“你听起来很流利。” 她让烟雾在唇上停留，然后轻轻地吹散。
</p><p>
"From what little I speak," she replied, drawing on her cigarette, "you
sounded quite fluent."  She let the smoke linger on her lips, then blew
it away softly.
</p>

<p>
“为什么要谢谢你的夸奖……哈维兰小姐。”
</p><p>
"Why thank you for the compliment...Miss Haviland."
</p>

<p>
“噢，亲爱的，”她说道，意识到自己忽略了什么。“我的教名是格雷琴。”
</p><p>
"Oh, dear," she said, realizing what she had neglected.  "My Christian
name is Gretchen."
</p>

<p>
“格雷琴·哈维兰，”他缓慢地重复道。“这听起来相当令人满意。”
</p><p>
"Gretchen Haviland," he repeated slowly.  "That has quite a
satisfactory ring to it."
</p>

<p>
当他们抽完烟后，她称赞他烟草的质量。时间已经九点多了，他们离开咖啡馆，走到街上。雾气已经降下来，比之前更低、更浓。偶尔有马车出现，静静地行驶着。碎片般的雾气缓慢地吹过煤气灯。
</p><p>
She complimented him on the quality of the tobacco when they were
finished smoking.  The hour was past nine o'clock, so they left the
café and walked into the street.  The fog had descended, lower and
thicker than before.  Occasional carriages appeared, rumbling quietly
along.  Tatters of mist blew sluggishly past the gaslights.
</p>

<p>
“我希望你能让我今晚有幸护送你回家？” 他们边走边问道。
</p><p>
"I hope you shall allow me the pleasure of escorting you home this
evening?" he asked as they walked.
</p>

<p>
“我应该感到荣幸。”
</p><p>
"I should be honored."
</p>

<p>
他伸出手肘，她戴着手套的手滑过他的前臂。两人默默地朝她的宿舍走去，享受着夜晚的宁静。天气似乎比以前暖和多了，格雷琴以为要下雪了。空气中弥漫着即将下雪的清香。
</p><p>
He held out his elbow, and she slipped her gloved hand over his
forearm.  They walked in silence toward her rooming house, both
enjoying the quiet of the evening.  It seemed much warmer than before,
and Gretchen thought a snow was about to fall.  The air had the crisp
scent of impending snow.
</p>

<p>
“我很高兴，”布里德韦尔教授过了一会儿说道，“你今晚不忙。你肯定有这么多朋友。还有其他的约会。”
</p><p>
"I am delighted," Professor Bridwell said after a while, "that you were
not busy this evening.  Surely you must have so many friends.  Other
engagements."
</p>

<p>
“不，”她回答道，“我的朋友很少。但是，安托万，肯定有很多女士可以成为更好的陪伴……”
</p><p>
"No," she answered, "I have very few friends.  But
surely—Antoine—there must be any number of ladies who would be far
better company..."
</p>

<p>
“我担心我太专注于我的书本了。一直在学习；准备讲座——而女士们则和年轻的浪子们一起逃跑。” 他带着戏谑的半微笑看了她一眼。“到二月份我就三十五岁了。”
</p><p>
"I'm too involved with my books, I fear.  Studying all the time;
preparing lectures—while the ladies run off with younger rakes." He
glanced at her with a teasing half-smile.  "I'll be thirty-five come
February."
</p>

<p>
格蕾琴听他这么说，笑了。但她很高兴自己如此接近地猜出了他的年龄。
</p><p>
Gretchen laughed to hear him say such things.  But she was pleased that
she had guessed his age so nearly.
</p>

<p>
“我担心，”他继续说道，“我的命运就是独自去听音乐会，并且终生未婚。”
</p><p>
"I fear," he continued, "it is my fate to attend concerts alone, and
remain unwed all my life."
</p>

<p>
“嗯，”格蕾琴回答道，“那么，这里面有一些令人悲伤的事情，不是吗？两个好学的人差不多年纪了，没有其他的依恋。” 她斜眼看着他。“圣诞节这么近了……”
</p><p>
"Well," Gretchen replied, "there's something sad in that then, is there
not?   Two studious people nearly of an age, with no other
attachments."  She looked sidelong at him.  "And with Christmas so
near..."
</p>

<p>
“是的，”他同意道，“这里面有一点悲伤。格雷琴，你附近没有家人吗？”
</p><p>
"Yes," he agreed, "there is a bit of sadness in that.  Have you no
family nearby, Gretchen?"
</p>

<p>
“不，他们都在康涅狄格州——今年去太远了，而且我的宿舍也不太适合邀请他们来拜访我。”
</p><p>
"No, they're ALL in Connecticut—too far to visit this year, and my
rooming house would hardly be suitable for inviting them to visit me."
</p>

<p>
说到这里，他愉快地笑了。但她没有告诉他，她与父母关系疏远。
</p><p>
He laughed pleasantly at this.  Yet she did not tell him that she was
estranged from her parents.
</p>

<p>
“除了我的家人在很远的地方——二十九岁了，一个人不可能永远跑回家见父母，不是吗？” 她问。
</p><p>
"Besides my family being far away—at twenty-nine, one cannot be
forever running home to one's parents, can one?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
“我确实理解这一点，”他说。“想象一下我们两个人单独过圣诞节——这似乎很遗憾。”
</p><p>
"I do understand that," he said.  "Fancy the two of us then, alone for
Christmas—it seems rather a shame."
</p>

<p>
“确实如此，”格雷琴回答道，目光移开。雪开始飘落，悄无声息，犹豫不决。雪花飘落在大道两旁的空树枝间，看起来有核桃那么大。像羽绒一样蓬松。
</p><p>
"It does indeed," Gretchen answered looking away.  Snow had begun to
fall, silently and hesitantly.  The flakes, drifting between the empty
branches of trees along the avenue, seemed as large as walnuts; as
fluffy as eider down.
</p>

<p>
教授把手放在格蕾琴戴着手套的手上，​​突然将她的手指轻轻地放在他的手下。她对他微笑，看着他的眼睛；他一头乌黑的头发，现在缀满了白色的雪花。他们的脚步停了下来，她看见他张开嘴唇时，一缕缕雾气从他嘴边袅袅升起。街上一片寂静。他向她迈出了一步，她意识到自己并没有抬头看他的眼睛——他并不像她想象的那样比自己高多少。她想——突然意识到自己的心在跳动——她发现自己希望他能吻她。她相信他会吻她，就在这时，她呼出热气。微风徐徐，薄雾从她充满期待的嘴唇中逸出。
</p><p>
The professor laid his hand across Gretchen's gloved hand, suddenly
holding her fingers delicately beneath his.  She smiled at him, looking
at his eyes; his mop of black hair, now bedecked with great white
snowflakes.  They stopped walking for an instant, and she could see the
wisps of mist curling away from his mouth as he opened his lips.  The
street was silent.  He took a step toward her and she realized that she
was not looking far up into his eyes—he was not so much taller than
herself as she had imagined.  She thought—suddenly aware of the
palpitation of her heart—she found herself hoping he would kiss her.
She believed he would kiss her, just then, and she let out her hot
breath.  Mist escaped her expectant lips on the faintest of breezes.
</p>

<p>
他们面对面站了很长一段时间，直到他慢慢转身向前走去。格雷琴继续走在他身边，手搭在他的胳膊上。他们穿过街道，终于来到了她的宿舍附近。她抬头看着灰色天空下飘落的雪花。他们上方缠结的树枝；煤气灯下朦胧的光池。她看了一眼他平静的脸，转身继续​​走。
</p><p>
They stood for a long moment, facing each other until he turned slowly
and stepped forward.  Gretchen continued walking beside him with her
hand upon his arm.  They crossed the street and at last were near her
rooming house.  She looked up at the falling snow against a gray sky;
the tangle of branches above them; the misty pools of light beneath the
gaslights.  She glanced at his serene face, turning, though she
continued to walk.
</p>

<p>
“我相信你差点就吻了我，不是教授吗？”
</p><p>
"I believe you almost kissed me back there, did you not Professor?"
</p>

<p>
“这么说，又是‘教授’了，是吗？” 他露出最浅淡的微笑，然后把目光移向街道。“哈维兰小姐，你并没有要求被吻——在那儿。” 她猛地转过身来，迎上他的目光，让他不得不停了下来。“不是用那么多话来说，”他补充道，“我的意思是——你和我一样犹豫。”
</p><p>
"So, it's 'Professor' again, is it?"  He smiled the faintest of smiles
and looked away down the street.  "Miss Haviland, you did not ask to be
kissed—back there."  She turned quickly in front of him to catch his
gaze, so that he had to stop.  "Not in so many words," he added, "I
mean—you hesitated as much as I."
</p>

<p>
“你喜欢吗？”她笑着回答，然后又开始走路，快乐地摆动双腿，让裙子随风飘扬。
</p><p>
"Fancy that," she replied with a laugh, and began walking again,
swinging her legs gaily, letting her skirt billow.
</p>

<p>
他触碰了她搭在他前臂上的手，她透过手套感受到了他手指的温暖。他们在光秃秃的树枝和静静飘落的雪花下行走。对于下雪来说，天气似乎太温暖了——几乎是热带的，就好像煤气灯正在温暖整个场景——整个世界。冬天即将融化——​​太阳甚至可能下一瞬间就会升起，春天就会带着金色和绿色的火焰回来，伴随着细雨和花香。
</p><p>
He touched her hand, draped over his forearm, and she felt the warmth
of his fingers through her glove.  They walked on beneath bare branches
and quietly falling snow.  It seemed far too warm for snow—tropical
almost, as if the gaslights were warming the whole scene—the whole
world.  Winter was about to melt—the sun might even rise the next
instant and spring would return in a blaze of gold and green with soft
rain, the scent of flowers.
</p>

<p>
“将来，也许我会问，教授。” 她倾身将他的手臂抓得更紧，低声说道。“也许我会的。”
</p><p>
"In future, perhaps I _shall_ ask, Professor."  She leaned to grip his
arm more tightly and whispered.  "Perhaps I shall."
</p>

当交响乐团在多年的漂浮之后崩溃成废墟，半死不活地濒临破产时，所有的音乐家都失业了。那时几乎每个人都失业了——他们中的许多人发现了施粥厨房，很快就找到了从事卑微工作的工作。少数人——幸运者或有才华的人，但大多数是那些既有运气又有才华的人——发现其他音乐作品的工资远低于装卸工的工资。
</p><p>
When the symphony orchestra collapsed in ruin after years spent
floating, half-dead near bankruptcy, all the musicians were thrown out
of work.  At that time nearly everyone was out of work anyway—many of
them discovered soup-kitchens and soon found employment at menial
tasks.  A few—the lucky or the talented, but mostly those with both
luck and talent—found other musical work well below stevedore's wages.
</p>

<p>
于尔根拥有巨大的天赋，但缺乏运气，但他无法想象除了成为一名小提琴手之外的任何其他生活。他不会寻找非音乐的工作——一切都不合适，而且肯定没有吸引力。他带着仅有的一点积蓄前往西部，想着寻找一个不那么拥挤饥饿音乐家的地方。他没有把钱花在交通上，而是选择了一场浪漫的冒险：他在货场周围结识了朋友，并乘坐铁路向西，直到到达一个舒适的大城市的郊区，看起来很干净——他决定在那里安家。作为一名职业音乐家，这座城市对他来说很熟悉：它拥有一支优秀的管弦乐队，其指挥劳伦斯·拉蒙特经常在小报上发现有关他华丽生活的令人震惊的私密细节。
</p><p>
Jurgen had tremendous talent but no luck, yet he could not imagine any
other life than being a violist.  He would not look for non-musical
work—everything was unsuitable, and certainly unattractive.  He took
the little savings he had and went West thinking to find a place less
crowded with hungry musicians.  Rather than spend his money on
transportation he settled on a romantic adventure:  he made friends
around the freight yards and rode the rails west until he arrived on
the outskirts of a comfortably large city with a clean look—and there
he decided to make his home.  The city was familiar to him, as a
professional musician:  it boasted a fine orchestra whose conductor,
one Laurence Lamonte, frequently found shockingly intimate details of
his flamboyant life splashed across the pages of the tabloids.
</p>

<p>
在河街，在铁轨的反面，花了几个小时从时尚区逐渐走下经济阶梯，进入肮脏破旧的社区后，尤尔根找到了查尔斯顿住宅酒店。它是一座四层楼高的褐砂石建筑，三楼的两扇窗户用木板封住，明显的火灾留下的黑色痕迹从未被清理干净。窗户上有一个牌子，广告着每周的费用，他认为他可以管理——如果这个牌子没有过时的话。它是黄色的，边缘卷曲，在布满多年积累的蜘蛛网的污迹斑斑的窗户后面几乎看不清。这看起来不像是一个卫生的地方——但价格合适，所以他走进了狭小的大厅。
</p><p>
In River Street, on the wrong side of the tracks, after hours spent
walking from the fashionable districts gradually down the economic
ladder into a grimy, dilapidated neighborhood, Jurgen found the
Charleston Residence Hotel.  Brownstone, four stories tall, it had two
windows boarded up on the third floor and unmistakable blackened marks
from a conflagration that had never been cleaned away.  There was a
sign in the window advertising a weekly fee he thought he could
manage—if the sign was not out of date.  It was yellow, curling at the
edges, and could hardly be read behind a smudged window laced with
years of accumulated cobwebs.  It did not seem like a wholesome
place—but the price was right so he walked into the tiny lobby.
</p>

<p>
“你们有房间吗？” 他问。他把小提琴盒夹在腋下，另一只手上挂着破损的皮提包。
</p><p>
"Have you any rooms?" he asked.  He had his viola case tucked under one
arm and his cracked leather valise dangling from the other hand.
</p>

<p>
前台站着一个矮个子、留着胡须、秃顶的男人，穿着一套可能曾经是新的棕色细条纹西装。一根不到两英寸长的陈旧雪茄烟头塞在他的嘴唇之间。他用一只毛茸茸的手捂住耳朵。
</p><p>
A short, bearded and balding man in a brown, pinstriped suit that might
once have been new, stood at the front desk.  The stub of a stale cigar
not two inches long was stuffed between his lips.  He cupped a hairy
hand to his ear.
</p>

<p>
“我问，”尤尔根用更大的声音说道，“你是否有房间出租。”
</p><p>
"I asked," Jurgen stated in a much louder voice, "whether you have a
room to let."
</p>

<p>
“是的，我们有很多房间。” 男人咧嘴一笑。“你想要多少？”
</p><p>
"Yeah, we got a lot of rooms."  The man grinned.  "How many you want?"
</p>

<p>
“一个就够了，谢谢。” 于尔根小心翼翼地将一周的租金放在柜台上。“这已经提前一周了。” 那人把手放在耳边，尤尔根不得不大声重复一遍。
</p><p>
"One will be sufficient, thank you."  Jurgen carefully laid out one
week's rent on the counter.  "This is a week in advance." The man
cupped his hand to his ear, and Jurgen was compelled to repeat himself
loudly.
</p>

<p>
这名男子把钱一扫而空——放进背心口袋里——然后递给他的新住户一把系着一根绳子的生锈钥匙。绳子上的纸质标签上潦草地写着数字：三，与数字十三之间用破折号隔开。
</p><p>
The man swept the money away—into a vest pocket—and handed his new
resident a rusty key attached to a length of twine.  Scrawled on a
paper tag attached to the twine were numbers: a three, separated by a
dash from the number thirteen.
</p>

<p>
“顺便说一句，”于尔根身体前倾，大声问道，“你不介意我白天练习小提琴吗？”
</p><p>
"By the way," Jurgen inquired loudly, leaning forward, "you don't mind
if I PRACTICE the VIOLA during the DAY?"
</p>

<p>
“小提琴？” 那人回喊道，挥挥手表示不予理睬。“为了不让我抱怨，你就做你想做的事吧。”
</p><p>
"Violin?" the man yelled back, with a dismissing wave.  "Just so I
don't get no complaints, you do what you want."
</p>

<p>
尤尔根终于在某个住处松了口气——他最后几个晚上都是在潮湿的货车里度过的，与一群或另一群穷人一起蜷缩着——静静地登上楼梯到三楼。十三号房间是大楼正面右侧的最后一扇门。他摸索了一下钥匙后打开了门。事实证明，他的房间就是窗户上贴着木板的房间。只有左边的一扇窗户没有登上。里面刚粉刷过，用的是白色油漆。地板漆成深灰色，部分覆盖着破旧的地毯，地毯的图案大多为棕色。
</p><p>
Relieved at last to be in some lodging—his last few nights had been
spent in damp freight cars, cowering with one or another group of
indigents—Jurgen ascended the stairs quietly to the third floor.  Room
thirteen was the last door on the right at the front of the building.
He opened the door after some fumbling with the key.  His room proved
to be the one with boards on the windows.  Only one window, on the
left, was not boarded.  The inside had been freshly painted, with white
paint.  The floor was painted a deep gray and partly covered with a
threadbare carpet patterned mostly in shades of brown.
</p>

<p>
尤尔根摸索着找到电灯开关，按下去，发出一声响亮的咔哒声。房间中央的一根长电线上悬挂着一个灯泡，发出微弱的光芒。他认为这是理所当然的。按照这样的速度，他不可能期望更多。放下手提箱，他想一旦找到工作，他就会在住宅区找到更好的住所。他将小提琴琴盒虔诚地放在房间单人椅子的粗糙木扶手上。最左边的角落里有一张单人床。里面没有床单，只有几条破旧的毯子整齐地折叠在床垫脚下。对面的墙上有一个水槽，上面挂着一面破裂的镜子，一个冲水马桶，陶瓷把手坏了，还有一个壁橱门——把手也坏了。没有毛巾。尤尔根把他的手提箱放在床上，走下楼梯查看床单和毛巾。
</p><p>
Jurgen fumbled for the light switch and pushed it with a loud click.  A
single bulb glowed dimly, suspended from a long wire in the center of
the room.  He thought that was par for the course.  At these rates, he
could not have expected much more.  Setting down his valise, he thought
he would be in better lodgings uptown, as soon as he found work.  He
laid his viola case reverently across the raw, wooden arms of the
room's single chair.  In the far left corner was a single bed.  It had
no sheets, but a few worn blankets folded neatly at the foot of the
mattress.  Along the opposite wall stood a sink with a cracked mirror
hanging above it, a flush toilet with a broken ceramic handle, and a
closet door—again with a broken handle.  No towels.  Putting his
valise upon the bed, Jurgen went back down the stairs to see about
sheets and towels.
</p>

<p>
“这是一家住宿酒店。”老板一边用一只手拨开他头上的几根头发，一边告诉他。“床单在尽头的大厅壁橱里——还有毛巾。女仆每周来一次。周二早上把你的床单和毛巾扔进斜槽。不要用太多。”
</p><p>
"This is a residence hotel," the proprietor told him, pushing back the
few hairs on his head with one hand.  "Sheets in the hall closet at the
far end—towels too.  Maid comes once a week.  Toss your sheets and
towels down the chute on Tuesday morning.  Don't use too many."
</p>

<p>
“谢谢，”尤尔根回答道，真诚地表现出礼貌。他回去拿了一套床单和一条毛巾，然后铺好床。
</p><p>
"Thank you," Jurgen replied, making a sincere effort at politeness.  He
went back up and got a set of sheets and a towel, then made his bed.
</p>

<p>
随后，他坐在床边，打开了自己的行李箱。里面有内衣、一套用过的黑色燕尾服、一件丝质衬衫、一顶丝质帽子、肥皂和剃须用品，还有一捆又一捆印刷的音乐。其他所有东西他都根据需要卖掉了。他的现金被安全地系在腰间的钱带里。他想知道附近是否有一家值得信赖的银行。明天，他决定，他必须去看看。
</p><p>
Afterwards, he sat on the edge of the bed and opened his valise.  It
contained underwear, a well-used black suit with tails, a silk shirt, a
silk hat, soap and shaving kit, and sheaf after sheaf of printed music.
Everything else he had sold as necessary; his cash was securely
fastened around his waist in a money-belt.  He wondered if there were a
trustworthy bank in the neighborhood.  Tomorrow, he decided, he would
have to go look.
</p>

<p>
尤尔根在进去之前仔细地审视了房间。门的背面贴着一份相对较新的日历，上面有两个图钉。它的主角是一位拥有精致长腿和风骚微笑的金发女郎——为某知名品牌的嚼烟做广告。他指出，那是十一月十四日。五十七年前的今天，他的祖母拖着两个年幼的孩子从匈牙利抵达纽约港，而她口袋里的钱比他还少。他思考了一会儿她的记忆——她是他的第一位音乐导师——然后去关灯。他躺在床上，盖着新鲜的棉床单，听着远处城市的声音——主要是汽车和火车的声音——直到睡着。
</p><p>
Jurgen surveyed the room carefully before turning in.  On the back of
the door a relatively new calendar was posted with two thumb tacks.  It
featured a blonde woman with exquisite, long legs and a coquettish
smile—advertising a well-known brand of chewing tobacco.  It was the
fourteenth of November, he noted.  Fifty-seven years ago to the day,
his grandmother had arrived in New York harbor from Hungary, dragging
two young children behind her—with less money in her pocket than he
had.  He pondered her memory for a moment—she had been his first
musical mentor—then went to switch off the light.  He laid down on the
bed beneath fresh cotton sheets and listened to the far-off sounds of
the city—automobiles and trains, mostly—until he fell asleep.
</p>

<p>
清晨，日出之后，于尔根静静地练习了一个多小时的小提琴。他没有时钟，但当他根据街上的声音判断时间已过十点时，他腋下夹着小提琴盒离开了旅馆。他花了一天时间在附近的河滨商业区的一个街角闲逛，到下午晚些时候，他就赚到了足够吃两顿饭的钱。他主要演奏斯蒂芬·福斯特的歌曲——每个人都知道它们，而且它们总是能给人带来微笑。偶尔，一位和善的老太太会停下来，红着脸问他是否知道上一季最喜欢的歌曲。通常，他从未听说过这首曲子，但当他知道时，他就会用力地演奏乐器，以至于他们总是在他打开的琴盒里留下一大把硬币。
</p><p>
Early in the morning, just after sunrise, Jurgen practiced the viola
quietly for an hour or so.  He had no clock, but when he judged, by the
sounds in the street that the time was past ten, he left the hotel with
his viola case under his arm.  He spent the day wandering from
street-corner to street-corner in a nearby business district along the
river-front and by late afternoon had earned enough money for two full
meals.  He played mostly Stephen Foster songs—everyone knew them and
they never failed to bring smiles.  Occasionally a nice old lady would
stop, and blushing, ask whether he knew one or another of the favorite
tunes of some prior season.  As often as not, he had never heard of the
tune, but when he did know it, he laid into the instrument with such
vigor that they always left a good fistful of coins in his open case.
</p>

<p>
尤尔根在附近一家卖杂烩的咖啡馆里吃早餐，那里的厨师双臂上都纹有船锚。女服务员穿着丝袜，里面穿着一件带有粉红色和白色条纹的脏制服，耳朵后面各放一支铅笔，两只铅笔的末端都被咬得暗淡无光。尤尔根有些好笑地想到，他的描述不仅适合铅笔，还适合人物。
</p><p>
At a nearby hash-slinging café where the cook had anchors tattooed on
both arms, Jurgen ate breakfast.  The waitress wore silk stockings
beneath a soiled uniform with pink and white stripes—and kept a pencil
behind each ear, both of them dull with their ends chewed.  Jurgen
reflected with some amusement that his description could fit the people
as well as the pencils.
</p>

<p>
接下来的几天也以同样的方式过去。每天晚上，尤尔根都不会匆忙成为任何一家咖啡馆的常客，而是更愿意尝试附近的所有咖啡馆，希望找到最舒适的一家。周四晚上，他看到了一个他以前从未注意到的小标志，尽管他已经在同一条街上走过好几次了。白底上用蓝色工整地写着字母——简单地写着“加尔各答”，还有一个向下的箭头。尤尔根走下黑暗的楼梯间，经过一扇用挂锁紧闭的钢门，发现隔壁的门没有锁。与视线齐平的门上也画着同样的名字。他推开门走了进去，心想自己可能发现了一家比附近典型的咖啡馆更具异国情调的餐厅。灯光昏暗，装饰昏暗而简陋。这个地方靠近门的地方排列着摊位，但通​​向一个被棋盘格瓷砖地板占据的空间。
</p><p>
The next several days passed in much the same manner.  Each evening,
rather than hastily becoming a regular at any one café, Jurgen
preferred to try all of the nearby places in the hope of finding the
most comfortable of the lot.  On Thursday evening he saw a small sign
he had never noticed before, though he had walked down the same street
several times.  Neatly lettered by hand in blue upon a white ground—it
said simply "Calcutta", with a downward pointing arrow.  Jurgen
descended the dark stairwell, passed one steel door tightly closed with
a padlock, and found the next door unlocked.  The same name was painted
on the door at eye level.  He pushed it open and walked in, thinking he
might have found a restaurant a bit more exotic than the typical run of
cafés in the neighborhood.  The lighting was dim, the decor dark and
spare.  The place was lined with booths near the door, but opened into
a space taken over by a checkerboard tiled floor.
</p>

<p>
他看到店里的顾客寥寥无几，总共不超过五六个人。他慢慢地环顾四周，一只手臂夹着小提琴盒，另一只手放在盒顶上。他是该机构中唯一的白人。
</p><p>
He could see there were only a few customers—not more than five or six
people, all told.  He looked around slowly, holding his viola case
under one arm, the other hand laid across the top of it.  He was the
only white person in the establishment.
</p>

<p>
没有人回头看他，只是继续做自己正在做的事情——喝酒、抽烟、小声说话。看起来很舒服——而且他在房间的另一端看到了一些有趣的东西。那一端有四张桌子，在昏暗的聚光灯下。
</p><p>
Nobody turned to look at him, but kept right on with what they were
doing—drinking and smoking, talking quietly.  It seemed comfortable
enough—and he saw some things of interest at the far end of the room.
There were four tables at that end, under dim spotlights.
</p>

<p>
尤尔根慢慢地走过展位，走向聚光灯。一只低音提琴靠墙侧放，仿佛是聚光灯照射的对象——它随时可能跳起来唱歌。左边立着一架立式钢琴，小心翼翼地潜伏在阴影中，它的顶部像张开的下巴一样张开。尤尔根知道这一切都意味着音乐，他走到桌子之间，坐在离乐器最近的一张桌子旁。它有部分被阴影覆盖；圆桌中央立着一根未点燃的蜡烛——一块白色和红色格子的方形桌布随意地披在蜡烛上。尤尔根慢慢地坐在最近的木椅上，面对着音乐。当他把体重放在上面时，它吱吱作响。他将小提琴盒放在桌子上，然后将其滑过来，这样他就可以将左肘放在上面。
</p><p>
Jurgen walked slowly past the booths toward the spotlights.  A double
bass sat on its side near the wall as if it were the subject of the
spotlights' illumination—it might jump up and break into song any
moment.  An upright piano stood on the left, lurking warily in the
shadows, its top opened like a gaping jaw.  Jurgen knew this all meant
music, and he made his way between the tables to sit at the one nearest
the instruments.  It was partially shadowed; an unlit candle stood in
the middle of the round table—a square table-cloth in white and red
checks draped haphazardly, held in place by the candle.  Jurgen sat
slowly on the nearest wooden chair, facing the music; it creaked when
he put his weight on it.  He set his viola case on the table and slid
it over so he could rest his left elbow on it.
</p>

<p>
他感觉到有什么东西在动，回头看了一眼。一名身穿天蓝色无袖连衣裙的年轻女子从阴影中走来。她的头发紧紧地扎在脑后，洁白的牙齿在她黝黑的脸上闪闪发光。她把一只手放在最近的摊位后面，靠在上面对他说话。
</p><p>
He felt something stir, and looked behind him.  A young woman in a
sleeveless sky-blue dress approached out of the shadows.  Her hair was
pulled back tightly against her head, white teeth gleamed in her dark
face.  She put one hand on the back of the nearest booth, and leaning
upon it, spoke to him.
</p>

<p>
“会是什么？” 她平静而自信地问道。说完，她扬起下巴，将头偏向一侧，微笑着。
</p><p>
"What'll it be?" she asked with quiet confidence.  Her chin rose when
she finished asking, and she tilted her head to one side, smiling.
</p>

<p>
于尔根凝视着她——她有一张漂亮的脸，下巴窄，颧骨高得惊人；她的黑眼睛在聚光灯下闪闪发光。他实在不想喝任何令人陶醉的东西。“柔软的东西，”他回答道。“非常柔软、最好是凉的东西。”
</p><p>
Jurgen gazed at her—she had a pretty face with a narrow chin and
strikingly high cheekbones; her black eyes sparkled in the spotlight.
He did not really feel like drinking anything intoxicating.  "Something
soft," he answered.  "Something quite soft and preferably cool."
</p>

<p>
她点点头，优雅地推开自己，拖着一只手。于尔根盯着后墙，默默地等待着。过了一会儿，音乐家们——三个穿着宽松工装的黑人——回到舞台，悄悄地从一扇门爬到一侧。他们一言不发地坐下来，拿起了乐器。贝斯手将低音提琴竖起，然后坐在高脚凳上，弹奏了几个音符。第三个人拿着一支单簧管，站在中间，用手指敲击着几个音阶，没有发出任何声音。他们互相看了几眼，然后同时开始演奏热火朝天的爵士乐，热得像一座高炉。尤尔根慢慢地坐回椅子上。炽热的曲调噼啪作响，火花四溅，然后化为一团长长的、燃烧的余烬。他能感觉到煤炭周围积聚着一层薄薄的灰烬，直到它逐渐沉淀成缓慢加热的温暖土堆。
</p><p>
She nodded and shoved herself off gracefully, trailing one hand.
Jurgen waited in silence, staring at the back wall.  In a few moments,
the musicians—three black men in baggy workmen's clothing—returned to
the stage, gliding in stealthily, creeping from a door to one side.
Without a word, they sat down and took up their instruments.  The bass
player heaved his double bass upright, then sat upon a high stool and
plucked a few notes.  The third man carried a clarinet, and standing in
the center, whipped his fingers through a few scales without making any
sound.  They stole a few glances at each other—then broke
simultaneously into a molten jazz number, hot as a blast furnace.
Jurgen sat back slowly in his chair.  The blazing tune crackled and
sparked, then settled into a long, burning ember; he could feel the
thin layer of ash building up around the coals until it gradually
settled into a warm mound of slow heat.
</p>

<p>
年轻女子端着高脚玻璃杯里的可口可乐出现了——当她把可口可乐放下时，尤尔根只看了她一眼，然后又把注意力转向了音乐家们。她滑过他的桌子，大步走到中心聚光灯下——单簧管演奏家没有错过任何一个音符，向她点了点头。她转过身，打了个响指，跟上缓慢的节拍，然后开始唱歌，一开始是如此轻柔，他不确定她是在唱歌。
</p><p>
The young woman appeared with a Coca-Cola in a tall glass—Jurgen only
glanced at her when she set it down, and returned his attention to the
musicians.  She slid past his table and strode under the center
spotlight—the clarinetist moved to one side without missing a note,
nodding at her.  She whirled around, snapped her fingers to pick up the
slow beat—and launched into song, so softly at first, he was not sure
she was singing.
</p>

<p>
她的声音很快就以独奏的形式出现，在单簧管的旋律中穿插穿插。火焰冲上来迎接她的声音——尤尔根感到脖子后面和头皮上的汗毛都竖起来了。她无言地歌唱；低沉的音调带着英国号的所有哀伤，融入到合奏中；有时，她的声音像低语的笛子一样升起，融入秋叶，在微风中翻滚——火在她身后噼啪作响。
</p><p>
Her voice soon rose in a solo, weaving in and out of the clarinet's
melody.  Flames rushed up to greet her voice—Jurgen felt the hairs
rising on the back of his neck and across his scalp.  She sang without
words; low tones with all the plaintiveness of an English horn,
blending into the ensemble; and at times her voice rose like a
whispering flute and broke into autumn leaves, tumbling in a light
breeze—the fire crackled behind her.
</p>

<p>
它的辉煌让尤尔根着迷，他忘记了喝酒，把双肘放在桌子上看女人唱歌。她的声音是那么浑厚、训练有素、柔美——他简直可以想象她在歌剧舞台上唱女中音的样子。
</p><p>
The splendor of it entranced Jurgen and he forgot his drink, putting
both elbows on the table to watch the woman sing.  Her voice was so
rich, so well-trained and supple—he could have imagined her on the
opera stage, singing mezzo-soprano.
</p>

<p>
整个乐团达到了高潮，就像玻璃撞在石头上一样碎裂，然后一片寂静。后面黑暗的咖啡馆里响起了掌声。尤尔根可以辨认出观众中的每个人——可怜的顾客很少能听到这样的歌手的声音！他坚定地、充满权威地鼓掌，直到最后一次鼓掌在他身后消失。又果断地拍了三声，他停了下来。
</p><p>
The ensemble rushed to a climax that shattered like a glass against
stone, and was silent.  There were applause from the dark café behind.
Jurgen could make out each individual in the audience—pitifully few
customers to hear such a singer!  He applauded firmly, with authority,
and continued until the last clap had died behind him; three more
decisive claps and he stopped.
</p>

<p>
乐队又演奏了一些曲目，标准的布鲁斯音乐和一两首流行的表演曲调——年轻女子唱歌，闭着眼睛一动不动地站在聚光灯下。她最后鞠了一躬，张开双臂，脸上带着美丽的微笑，大步走进了后面。乐师们跟着她出去休息一下。
</p><p>
The band played a few more numbers, standard blues fare and a popular
show-tune or two—the young woman sang, standing perfectly still with
her eyes closed, alone beneath a spotlight.  She bowed at last, arms
outstretched with a beautiful smile, and strode into the back.  The
musicians followed her out to take another break.
</p>

<p>
钢琴家落在后面，跟着其他人走到门口，然后转身在尤尔根的桌子旁坐下，拉近椅子。那人的胡子已经留了几天了。他完全秃了——尤尔根断定，也许是剃光了——他的笑容露出了一颗缺失的牙齿和两颗银牙。他说话的时候，声音低沉而充满气泡，就像一锅慢炖的汤。“这里不要有太多同类，”他开始说道。
</p><p>
The pianist lagged behind, following the others to the door, then
turned around and sat down at Jurgen's table, pulling his chair close.
The man had a few days' growth of beard.  He was completely
bald—perhaps shaved, Jurgen decided—and his smile revealed one
missing tooth and two silver teeth.  When he spoke, his voice was deep
and bubbly, like a slow pot of soup, simmering.  "Don't get many o' yer
kind here," he began.
</p>

<p>
尤尔根突然涨红了脸，咽了口口水，感觉到一种即将来临的恐慌。他一时间愣住了，一时间想不出答案。撤回可能是谨慎的做法吗？
</p><p>
Jurgen flushed suddenly and swallowed, feeling a sense of impending
panic.  He gaped momentarily, unable to think of a reply.  Might it be
prudent to withdraw?
</p>

<p>
那人往后一靠，大笑起来，把拇指插进腰带里。他突然把头向前探出，咧嘴一笑。“我的意思是——你拉小提琴还是我用你的肘部敲击它？”
</p><p>
The man sat back and laughed loudly, thrusting his thumbs into his
belt.  He thrust his head forward suddenly, grinning.  "I mean—you
play that fiddle or jes set yer elbow on it?"
</p>

<p>
于尔根顿时松了口气，恢复了平静。“我当然会玩，”他说，有些犹豫地回应了那个男人的微笑。
</p><p>
Jurgen felt instantly relieved, and regained his composure.  "Certainly
I play it," he said, returning the man's smile with some hesitation.
</p>

<p>
“也许你会为我演奏一些东西？也许我也会给你买饮料。”
</p><p>
"Maybe you'll play somethin' for me?  Maybe I'll buy yer drink, too."
</p>

<p>
“嗯——我——我从来没有演奏过太多——任何——爵士乐，”尤尔根慢慢地说。“民谣、表演曲——在极少数情况下。我的职业是交响乐小提琴家。”
</p><p>
"Well—I—I've never played much—any—jazz," Jurgen said slowly.
"Folk tunes, show-tunes—on rare occasions.  I'm a symphony violist, by
profession."
</p>

<p>
“哦。”男人皱着眉头应道。“我明白了。好吧，它不一定是蓝色的——我想看看你得到了什么……如果不麻烦的话？”
</p><p>
"Oh," the man answered, wrinkling his brow.  "I see.  Well, it don'
have to be blue—jes wanna see what you got... If it ain't much
trouble?"
</p>

<p>
“好吧。” 尤尔根把他的小提琴盒拉向自己，然后将椅子向后推，给自己腾出一些空间。他打开琴盒，拨动琴弦一次，检查乐器的调音——他认为已经足够接近了。当他涂上松香的弓时，他试图决定从哪里开始。他选择了祖母曾经为他演奏的匈牙利民谣。它有一种温馨、亲密的品质。相当简单且易于操作。他做好了准备，然后全身心地投入到演奏这首曲子中——他反复练习，挥舞了几次，尝试了一些变化，发烧了，并以快速的插奏变奏结束了。
</p><p>
"Alright." Jurgen pulled his viola case toward himself, and scooted his
chair back to give himself some room.  He opened the case, strummed the
strings once to check the instrument's tuning—close enough, he
decided.  While he rosined his bow he tried to decide where he should
start.  He settled on a Hungarian folk tune his grandmother used to
play for him.  It had a homey, intimate quality; rather simple and
easily manipulated.  He readied himself and then poured his heart into
playing that tune—he worked it around, swished it a few times, tried
some variations, caught the fever, and finished off with a fast
spiccato variation.
</p>

<p>
“听起来像吉普赛音乐，”那人说完后说道。“热血。”
</p><p>
"Sounds like gypsy music," the man said when he had finished.  "Hot
blood."
</p>

<p>
尤尔根笑了。“我的祖母——是匈牙利人。”
</p><p>
Jurgen smiled.  "My grandmother—was Hungarian."
</p>

<p>
“喂，”那人把手放在小提琴盒上说道，“你为什么不加入我们一会儿呢？弹奏你喜欢的任何曲子——我的名字。我们什么都知道。” 他站起来，伸出手。“我叫阿尔，”他总结道。
</p><p>
"Say," the man said, laying his hand atop the viola case, "why don' you
join us awhile?  Play anything you like—jes name it.  We know 'bout
most anything."  He stood up and thrust out his hand.  "My name's Al,"
he concluded.
</p>

<p>
于尔根紧握他的手。“于尔根。很高兴见到你，阿尔先生。”
</p><p>
Jurgen clasped his hand. "Jurgen.  A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Al."
</p>

<p>
阿尔咯咯笑起来。“不，我是普莱恩·艾尔。过来这边……”
</p><p>
Al chuckled.  "Nah, jes Plain Al.  Come on over here..."
</p>

<p>
当其他音乐家回来时，这位年轻女子——艾尔介绍她为梅布尔——坐在尤尔根腾出的桌子旁。他坐在一把椅子上，在聚光灯下加入了单簧管演奏者的行列。
</p><p>
When the other musicians returned, the young woman—Al introduced her
as Mabel—sat at the table Jurgen had vacated.  He took one chair and
joined the clarinetist under the spotlight.
</p>

<p>
“你知道吗——呃……”于尔根停顿了一下。“‘干得好，如果你能得到’怎么样？”
</p><p>
"Do you know—uh..." Jurgen paused.  "How about 'Nice Work if You Can
Get It'?"
</p>

<p>
“嗯。乔治和艾拉……”单簧管演奏家满脸笑容地虔诚地吟诵着。“每个人都知道那个……”
</p><p>
"Mmm.  George &amp; Ira...," the clarinetist intoned reverently with a wide
grin.  "Ever'body knows that one..."
</p>

<p>
他们演奏了一段激动人心的表演，很快梅布尔就站了起来，与尤尔根一起即兴表演。她面向他站着，弯下身子凝视他的眼睛，双眸模仿着对位跑动，就像小溪里的两条鱼从山坡上流下来。钢琴和单簧管停下来，他们自己弹起曲子，把它翻过来，窥视所有隐藏的动机，每一个动机在音乐上相互交织在一起。当他们结束时，梅布尔气喘吁吁，让普兰·艾尔独奏，然后带领他们回到旋律中——梅布尔插入了最后一节，并把它带过房间。可怜的是，很少有顾客鼓掌。
</p><p>
They played a seething rendition that soon had Mabel on her feet,
improvising alongside Jurgen.  She stood facing him, doubling over to
peer into his eyes, undulating while they ran on in imitative
counterpoint, two fish in a creek spilling down a mountainside.  The
piano and clarinet stopped while they took the tune up on their own,
turning it over, peeking into all the hidden motives, each musically
entwined in the other.  Mabel was breathless when they finished, and
let Plain Al take a solo before leading them all back into the
melody—Mabel broke into the last verse and belted it through the room.
There were pitifully few customers to applaud.
</p>

<p>
这个地方快关门了，阿尔和尤尔根以及其他音乐家围坐在一张桌子旁。他们各自捧着一大杯加了波本威士忌的可口可乐，聊啊聊，互相回答和提问，就像在玩烫手山芋一样。他们都是半职业球员——没有人因为在加尔各答打球而获得报酬。梅布尔和她的兄弟在一位善良的房东的注视下经营着这个地方，而房东从不打扰他们。他每个月来一两次，听完几首歌就离开。梅布尔和她的兄弟为晚上想玩的人提供免费食物。在当时的情况下，他们雇不起任何人来玩，也没有其他东西可以吸引客户。音乐家们都有固定的工作，时断时续——他们承认，大部分都是休息的——而加尔各答就像他们自己的私人天堂，在那里他们是真正的音乐家，人们来这里听他们演奏。他们是一群舒适的人，用音乐打发夜晚，吃饱回家。
</p><p>
The place was closing up, and Al sat with Jurgen and the other
musicians around a table.  They each coddled a tall Coca-Cola mixed
with bourbon, and talked and talked, shooting answers and questions at
each other like they were playing hot-potato.  They were all
semi-professional—none of them were paid for playing at Calcutta.
Mabel and her brother ran the place, under the eye of a kindly landlord
who never bothered them; he came in once or twice a month, sat through
a few songs, and left.  Mabel and her brother provided free food for
anyone who wanted to play for the evening.  Times being what they were,
they could not afford to hire anyone to play—and had nothing else to
draw any clientele.  The musicians all held regular jobs, off and
on—mostly off, they admitted—and Calcutta was like their own private
paradise, where they were real musicians, where people came to hear
them play.  They were a comfortable bunch, wiling away their evenings
with music, going home with full stomachs.
</p>

<p>
尤尔根感到筋疲力尽——他从天亮就起床了——喝完酒后，他请求离开。他用一只胳膊夹着小提琴盒。“我想知道，阿尔，”他站起来说道。“这个地方怎么会被称为‘加尔各答’？”
</p><p>
Jurgen felt exhausted—he had been up since dawn—and when he had
finished his drink, begged to take his leave.  He cradled his viola
case under one arm.  "I'm wondering, Al," he said as he stood up.  "How
this place came to be called 'Calcutta'?"
</p>

<p>
艾尔笑了。“我猜这就是梅布尔开的玩笑。梅布尔，她读了很多书——也受过良好的教育。” 于尔根没有立即明白。艾尔露出银色的牙齿，身体前倾，睁着大眼睛，笑意盈盈。“加尔各答黑洞？”
</p><p>
Al laughed.  "That's Mabel's idea of jokin' I guess.  Mabel, she reads
a lot—got some fine schoolin' too."  Jurgen did not comprehend
immediately.  Al flashed his silver teeth and leaned forward with wide,
laughing eyes.  "Black Hole o' Calcutta?"
</p>

<p>
尤尔根咯咯笑起来。“我想我明白了。晚安，艾尔。”
</p><p>
Jurgen chuckled.  "I think I understand.  Good night, Al."
</p>

<p>
“快回来吧，约金，”阿尔回答道。“再陪我们玩一会儿吧。”
</p><p>
"Come on back soon, Yoorgin," Al replied.  "Play some more with us."
</p>

<p>
“我会去做。” 尤尔根把手放在头上，然后想起自己没有帽子。他微笑着走了出去。
</p><p>
"I'll do that."  Jurgen put his hand to his head, then remembered he
had no hat.  He smiled and walked out.
</p>

<p>
午夜过后很久，尤尔根才回到自己的房间，打开唯一的灯，坐在床上翻阅他的一叠乐谱。几分钟后，他把音乐扔到一边，躺下来回想当晚的事情。他已经很久没有像那天晚上和普莱恩·艾尔和梅布尔在一起那样享受那么多的乐趣了——纯粹的享受。她很出色——成熟而优雅——他们一起玩耍，就好像彼此很熟悉一样。
</p><p>
Jurgen returned to his room long after midnight, turned on the single
light, and sat upon the bed to look through his sheaf of music.  He
tossed the music aside after a few minutes and laid down to think back
over the evening.  It had been a long time since he had had as much
fun—sheer enjoyment—as that evening with Plain Al and Mabel.  She was
remarkable—sophisticated and graceful—they had played together as if
they knew each other intimately.
</p>

<p>
有什么东西在他的眼睑上颤动着——他睁开眼睛，抬起头来。不知怎的，一只飞蛾钻进了房间，在灯泡周围飞来飞去，投下一闪一闪的影子。他恼怒地从沉思中醒来，拿起毛巾，开始拍打飞蛾，飞蛾不停地转啊转啊。这时，灯泡的某些东西引起了他的注意——它的形状很不寻常。他把椅子拉到下面，小心翼翼地站在椅子上，看着缓慢摆动的灯泡，然后伸手抓住插座。灯泡末端用粗糙、污迹斑斑的字母刻着三个字：匈牙利制造。他一瞬间差点失去平衡，扑通一声跳到了地板上。楼下的房间里立即传来一声回应，尤尔根在心里向楼下的邻居道歉。
</p><p>
Something fluttered and fluttered against his eyelids—he opened his
eyes and looked up.  A moth had somehow got into the room, and
fluttered around and around the lightbulb, casting shadows that
flitted.  Annoyed to be cast from his reverie, he took his towel and
began flicking at the moth as it circled and circled.  Something about
the lightbulb caught his attention then—it was unusually shaped.  He
pulled the chair over beneath it and standing carefully on the chair,
looked at the slowly swinging bulb before reaching out to grab the
socket.  Stamped upon the end of the bulb in rough, smeared letters
were three words:  Made in Hungary.  He almost lost his balance for an
instant, and jumped to the floor with a thump.  There was an immediate
answering thump from the room below, and Jurgen mentally apologized to
his lower neighbor.
</p>

<p>
      ** ** ** **<br>
</p><p>
      *      *      *      *      *<br>
</p>

<p>
两天后，一个星期六的晚上，在他习惯了每天在街角玩耍之后，尤尔根发现自己再次走下楼梯进入加尔各答。这个地方比以前更吵闹。里面大概有三十个人。他在最靠近聚光灯的摊位找到了座位——开放的桌子已经满了。一位身穿白色紧身连衣裙的年轻女服务员走过来为他服务。他决定在那里吃晚饭——作为对梅布尔的回报。上次，他只点了一杯饮料，当他回想起那天晚上的情况时，他发现自己实际上从未付过钱，也没有付过他与阿尔和其他人喝的任何饮料的钱。至少他可以通过订晚饭给她带来一些生意。
</p><p>
Two days later, on a Saturday evening, after what had become his
accustomed daily rounds of playing on street-corners—Jurgen found
himself again descending the stairs into Calcutta.  The place was
noisier than it had been before.  There might have been thirty people
inside.  He found a seat at the booth closest to the spotlights—the
open tables were full.  A young waitress in a slinky white dress came
over to serve him.  He decided to have dinner there—a repayment to
Mabel.  The last time, he had only ordered one drink, and when he
thought back over the evening, decided that he had in fact never paid
for it or any of the drinks he had with Al and the others.  At least he
could give her some business by ordering dinner.
</p>

<p>
“梅布尔今天晚上在哪里？” 他问。
</p><p>
"Where's Mabel this evening?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
“嗯？” 女服务员似乎很困惑。她弯曲一个膝盖，一只手快速地抚过裙子的带子。
</p><p>
"Huh?"  The waitress seemed confused.  She let one knee bend, and ran a
hand quickly along the strap of her dress.
</p>

<p>
“哦，”他结结巴巴地说，“我以为梅布尔会在这里。”
</p><p>
"Oh," he stammered, "I thought Mabel would be here."
</p>

<p>
“噢，她来了。”女服务员疑惑地说。“不过她不工作。” 她一只手靠在桌子上。“我可以先给你拿点喝的吗？”
</p><p>
"Oh, she's here," the waitress said, puzzled.  "She don' work tables
though."  She leaned on the table with one hand.  "Can I get you
something to drink first?"
</p>

<p>
“我要一杯可口可乐。”
</p><p>
"I'll have a Coca-Cola."
</p>

<p>
女服务员离开了，端着饮料回来了。她轻轻地把它放在桌子上，下面放着一个破旧的软木杯垫，然后把它滑到他面前。他点了几样配菜——一边扫视着菜单，一边随心所欲地从嘴里吐出几个字。他不确定自己应该点多少，最后点了太多的食物，根本无法一个人吃——但他觉得自己确实欠梅布尔一些东西。普莱恩·艾尔后来出现了。尤尔根走过去打招呼，并感谢他好心地允许他那天晚上参加比赛。他记得自己还有几盘未动过的食物，于是邀请阿尔到他的餐桌旁。他们一起吃饭，谈论已故的乔治·格什温。
</p><p>
The waitress left and came back with his drink.  She set it lightly on
the table, with a battered cork coaster beneath, and slid it in front
of him.  He ordered a few side dishes—words spilling willy-nilly from
his mouth while he glanced over the menu.  He was uncertain how much he
should order and ended up ordering far too much food to eat alone—but
he felt that he really owed Mabel something.  Plain Al showed up later;
Jurgen walked over to say hello, and to thank him for so kindly
allowing him to play the other evening.  Remembering that he had plates
of untouched food, he invited Al over to his table.  They ate together
and talked about the late George Gershwin.
</p>

<p>
“可惜他突然去世了，不是吗？” 艾尔静静地观察着。
</p><p>
"Pity how he passed away so suddenly, ain't it?" Al observed quietly.
</p>

<p>
“我确信他会被视为最伟大的球员之一，”尤尔根回答道。
</p><p>
"I'm sure he'll be counted among the greatest," Jurgen replied.
</p>

<p>
尤尔根加入了乐队，他们整个晚上都在练习他们都熟悉的曲子。梅布尔出来和他们一起唱歌，他们用几首长歌结束了整个晚上，只是为了享受彼此聆听的乐趣。人群似乎比以前更加欣赏——尤尔根相信任何事情都会有所改善。只是在场的人更多了，所以他觉得他们更加感激，但他猜测这都是他们每个周六晚上在加尔各答听到的同一件事的一部分。还有其他几个音乐家——一个性感的年轻萨克斯演奏家，大肚子和一条低垂的腰带，几乎只能支撑一条膝盖磨损的羊毛裤。有一个满脸皱纹、半盲的老人，用他那把破旧的吉他演奏布鲁斯——他的一只鞋子上有一个银元大小的洞，而且他没有穿袜子。虽然距离交响乐很远，但尤尔根非常享受在加尔各答的第二个晚上。
</p><p>
Jurgen joined the band and they spent the rest of the evening working
over tunes they all knew.  Mabel came out and sang with them, and they
rounded out the evening with a few long numbers just for the enjoyment
of listening to each other.  The crowd seemed more appreciative than it
had been before—Jurgen believed that anything would have been an
improvement.  There were simply more people present, so he felt they
were more appreciative, but he guessed it was all part of the same
thing they heard every Saturday night in Calcutta.  There were a couple
of other musicians—a hot young sax player with a large belly and a
low-hung belt that barely held up a pair of wool pants with worn knees.
There was a wrinkled old man, half blind, who played blues with his
beat-up guitar—he had a hole the size of a silver dollar in one shoe
and he wore no socks.  It was far from the symphony, but Jurgen
thoroughly enjoyed his second evening in Calcutta.
</p>

</p>

<p>
在接下来的几周里，晚上去加尔各答打球很快就成了一种愉快的习惯。尤尔根开始认为他的前世没有听过一些他听过的最好的自制音乐，他认为在这里有很多东西需要学习。无论是在工厂、餐馆工作，还是在附近经营商店，聚集在梅布尔周围的人似乎都有一个共同点：集中的音乐天赋。他们都是爵士乐旋律大师。他期待着定期来访——在寒冷中演奏一整天、在就业队伍中徘徊寻找交响乐工作之后，这是一种特别受欢迎的消遣。他白天赚到的钱大部分都进​​了梅布尔的金库——尤尔根认为它们应该在这个地方。他自己的积蓄开始减少。他增加了寻找好工作的时间。
</p><p>
Dropping into the Calcutta to play the evening away quickly became a
pleasant habit over the next few weeks.  Jurgen came to consider his
previous life as having been sheltered from some of the finest
home-spun music he had ever heard, and he decided there was much to be
learned here.  Whether they worked in factories or restaurants, or
tended stores in the neighborhood, the people who congregated around
Mabel all seemed to have one thing in common:  concentrated musical
talent.  They were all masters of jazz melody.  He looked forward to
his regular visits—an especially welcome diversion after playing all
day in the cold, hanging around employment lines looking for symphony
work.  The pennies he earned during the day mostly ended up in Mabel's
coffers—where Jurgen thought they should be.  His own savings began to
dwindle.  He increased the hours he spent searching for good employment.
</p>

<p>
在尤尔根看来，每次他走下通往加尔各答的黑暗楼梯间并打开门时，顾客都比上次多。圣诞节前的最后一个星期六晚上——实际上是平安夜——尤尔根到达了，他想在那里吃晚饭。他推开门，发现整个咖啡馆都挤满了人，远远超出了容纳人数。每个摊位都挤满了人，离聚光灯最近的角落里放着两张新桌子。每张桌子上都多挤了一两个人。这个地方就像一趟早班火车，但庆祝的气氛在蓝色的香烟烟雾中弥漫在房间里。尤尔根慢慢地朝灯光走去——但到处都找不到座位。音乐家们出去休息了，所以顾客们都互相交谈，欢声笑语。他正想问其中一张桌子上的人是否介意他挤进去观看，但艾尔从后门口发现了他。
</p><p>
It seemed to Jurgen that every time he descended the dark stairwell to
Calcutta and opened the door, there were more customers than had been
there the last time.  On the last Saturday night before Christmas—it
was Christmas Eve, in fact—Jurgen arrived, thinking he would have
dinner there.  He threw open the door and found the whole café crowded
far beyond capacity.  Every booth was full, and there were two new
tables plunked down in the corner nearest the spotlights.  Every table
had an extra person or two squeezed in.  The place was like a morning
train, but the atmosphere of celebration swirled through the room with
the blue haze of cigarette smoke.  Jurgen went slowly forward toward
the lights—but could not find a seat anywhere.  The musicians were out
on a break, so the customers all talked among themselves, laughing and
cheering.  He was about to ask someone at one of the tables if they
would mind him crowding in to watch, but Al spotted him from the back
doorway.
</p>

<p>
“约金！回来一会儿，”他挥舞着手臂喊道。
</p><p>
"Yoorgin!  Come in back a while," he yelled, flailing his arm.
</p>

<p>
尤尔根也挥挥手，从桌子之间挤过去。“对不起，我很抱歉。”他一边说着，一边用双手将小提琴盒举过头顶。他走到门口，阿尔把他拉到后面。
</p><p>
Jurgen waved back and pushed his way between the tables.  "Excuse me.
I'm very sorry," he said as he squeezed through, carrying his viola
case over his head with both hands.  He made it to the door, and Al
pulled him into the back.
</p>

<p>
“来，喝杯波本威士忌，”阿尔露出银牙笑着说。“平安夜是时候庆祝一下了！”
</p><p>
"Here, have a glass of bourbon," Al said with his silver-toothed grin.
"Christmas Eve's time for a little celebratin'!"
</p>

<p>
艾尔搬了另一把摇摇晃晃的木椅到音乐家们聚集的一张小桌子旁。坐在一侧的是梅布尔，她穿着一件精美的长袍，上面闪闪发光的红色亮片，她的头发绑在一条亮绿色的头巾上；长垂下的耳环。她就像圣诞节的照片，带着醉意的微笑。一名厨师和两名穿着脏围裙的年轻人在厨房的炉灶和烤箱里工作，房间另一端的平底锅和搅拌碗叮当作响。灯光很亮。
</p><p>
Al brought another rickety wooden chair over to a small table where the
musicians were gathered.  Seated on one side was Mabel, dressed in a
fine long gown that sparkled with red sequins, her hair tied up in a
bright green turban; long dangling earrings.  She was the picture of
Christmas, with a tipsy smile.  A chef and two young men in soiled
aprons worked the kitchen stove and oven, clanking pans and mixing
bowls at the far end of the room; the lights were bright.
</p>

<p>
“尤尔根，”梅布尔坐下时说道，“我本来希望你今晚能在这儿。我有东西给你。” 她把手伸进低胸礼服的怀里，在音乐家中引起一阵笑声。“这是一份圣诞礼物，”她低声说道，越钓越深——她的肩膀开心地摆动着。“如果我能找到的话……”她把手伸得更深，让大家都笑起来。
</p><p>
"Jurgen," Mabel said as he sat down, "I was hoping you'd be here this
evening.  I have something for you."  She slid her hand into the bosom
of her low-cut gown, sending a ripple of laughter among the musicians.
"It's a Christmas present," she whispered, fishing deeper and
deeper—her shoulders wiggled in mirth.  "If I can find it..."  She
drove her hand deeper to keep them all laughing.
</p>

<p>
尤尔根将椅子拉近，将小提琴盒竖直夹在两腿之间。艾尔将一杯波本威士忌推到他面前，梅布尔用双手将五美元拍到桌子上。“现在你继续接受这个，”她坚持道。“自从你出现在这里，生意就越来越好。我想让你知道，我们是多么感激你。”
</p><p>
Jurgen pulled his chair closer and held his viola case upright between
his legs.  Al pushed a tumbler of bourbon in front of him—and Mabel
slapped five dollars onto the table with both hands.  "Now you go on
and take this," she insisted.  "Ever since you showed up here, business
has been getting better and better.  I want you to know how much we
appreciate it."
</p>

<p>
尤尔根看了看钞票——这是一张崭新的五美元纸币，只被折叠过一次，四折。“谢谢你，梅布尔，”尤尔根说，然后停下来摸索他的杯子。他没有碰那张钞票，而是把它放在他面前的桌子上。“我无语了。” 大家都笑了。
</p><p>
Jurgen looked at the bill—it was a crisp, fresh five-dollar note that
had been folded, only once, in quarters.  "Thank you, Mabel," Jurgen
said, then paused to fumble with his glass.  He did not touch the bill,
but left it sitting on the table in front of him.  "I'm speechless."
Everyone laughed.
</p>

<p>
“现在你就在这儿陪我坐一会儿吧，”她继续说道。“你们其他人出去玩一会儿吧。我想和于尔根先生私下谈谈。” 一阵低沉的呢喃声扫过他们，他们纷纷后退。当尤尔根和梅布尔单独在一起时，她举起了酒杯。“祝生意兴隆，”她说。
</p><p>
"Now you just sit here a while with me," she continued.  "The rest of
you go on out and play for a while.  I want to talk to Mr. Jurgen in
private."  A low murmuring sound swept them, and they backed away.
When Jurgen and Mabel were alone, she raised her glass.  "Here's to
good business," she said.
</p>

<p>
“干得好。”于尔根回答道，举起自己的酒杯，轻轻地碰了碰她的酒杯。“祝大家圣诞快乐……”
</p><p>
"To good business," Jurgen replied, raising his own glass and clinking
it delicately against hers.  "And a Merry Christmas to all..."
</p>

<p>
“现在，”梅布尔说，“这就是我想谈的。” 她语速很快、清晰——就好像她已经记住了一篇演讲，并且正在向观众发表演讲。她用长指甲的手指轻轻地动作来打断自己的句子。“我一直在想，你到底是一个什么样的人。我得出的结论是，你是一个非常穷的人。” 当尤尔根的笑容突然消失时，她停了下来，戏剧性地闭上了眼睛。“哦，这真是不幸的措辞。我的意思是……你不是一个有钱人。”
</p><p>
"Now that," Mabel said, "is what I wanted to talk about." She spoke
quickly, with clarity—as if she had a speech memorized, and was
delivering it for an audience.  She punctuated her sentences with wispy
motions of her long-nailed fingers.  "I've been wondering to myself
just what kind of man you are.  And I've concluded that you're a pretty
poor man."  When Jurgen's smile suddenly dripped away she stopped and
closed her eyes theatrically.  "Oh, that was unfortunately phrased.  I
mean... you're not a wealthy man."
</p>

<p>
尤尔根坐直了身子，梅布尔笑了——然后把杯子放在桌子上。“不需要夏洛克·福尔摩斯，”她继续说道，“就能看出这一点。哎呀，六个星期以来，你几乎每天晚上都来这儿——而在这段时间里，我不相信我在任何地方都见过你。” “除了衣服，还有你现在穿的破布。你必须洗它们，因为你闻起来不像我爷爷的谷仓——但我猜你没有其他衣服了。”
</p><p>
Jurgen sat up straight, and Mabel laughed—then set her glass down on
the table.  "It takes no Sherlock Holmes," she continued, "to see that.
Why, you've been in here nearly every evening coming on six weeks—and
in all that time, I don't believe I've seen you in any clothes but the
rags you have on now.  You must wash 'em, cause you don't smell like my
grandpa's barnyard—but I'd guess you don't have any other clothes."
</p>

<p>
尤尔根感到自己脸红了，他低下头，旋转着杯子里的波本威士忌，直到它沿着边缘向上流动，几乎流过边缘。他应该收拾一个更大的衣柜，并留下他的大部分音乐。
</p><p>
Jurgen felt himself redden, and looked down, swirling the bourbon in
his glass until it ran up along the edge, almost flowing over the rim.
He should have packed a much larger wardrobe, and left most of his
music behind.
</p>

<p>
“我是对的，不是吗？”
</p><p>
"I'm right, aren't I?"
</p>

<p>
“阿尔曾经告诉我你读书如饥似渴。”
</p><p>
"Al once told me you read voraciously."
</p>

<p>
梅布尔摇头大笑。“我想不是用那些话。但他是对的。夏洛克·福尔摩斯是我最喜欢的人之一。”
</p><p>
Mabel tossed her head and laughed.  "Not in those words, I expect.  But
he's right.  And Sherlock Holmes is one of my favorites."
</p>

<p>
“嗯，”他慢慢地回答，“我必须承认，我现在正处于全职工作之间……而且我的衣柜目前很少……我确实有一套西装，还有一顶高顶帽子…… ”。
</p><p>
"Well," he answered slowly, "I must admit I'm rather between full-time
engagements at this time...and my wardrobe is minimal at the moment...
I do own a suit, and a top hat..."
</p>

<p>
“所以我一直在问自己，”她打断道，“你过着怎样的生活，住在哪里。我也曾在街角见过你几次。也许这就是你所做的一切——拉小提琴——我知道好吧，这不仅仅是一个‘小提琴’。那么，你现在住在哪里？” 她无力地垂下手腕。“你在街上吗？”
</p><p>
"So I've been asking myself," she interrupted, "how you live, and where
you live.  I've seen you on street-corners a few times, too.  Maybe
that's all you do—play your viola—I know well enough it's not just a
'fiddle'.  So, where are you living now?"  She hung her wrist limply.
"Are you on the street?"
</p>

<p>
“我现在住在查尔斯顿酒店。”
</p><p>
"I'm presently lodging at the Charleston."
</p>

<p>
“槎！” 她挥舞着手指喊道。“那个地方？没有任何有价值的人住在查尔斯顿。那里到处都是酒鬼和妓女。”
</p><p>
"Hew!" she exclaimed, waving her fingers.  "That place?  Nobody of any
worth lives at the Charleston.  It's full of winos and whores."
</p>

<p>
“它很便宜，”尤尔根回答道。“装修还有很多不足之处。但恐怕到了新年我就得搬到更便宜的住所了。”
</p><p>
"It's inexpensive," Jurgen replied.  "The decor leaves much to be
desired.  But I'm afraid that I'll have to be moving along to even
cheaper lodgings by the new year."
</p>

<p>
“那么不好？”
</p><p>
"That bad?"
</p>

<p>
于尔根点点头。他可能还能再坚持一两个月，但到那时，他将不得不关闭他的新银行账户。
</p><p>
Jurgen nodded.  He could probably hold out for another month or two,
but by then, he would have to close his new bank account.
</p>

<p>
“好吧，”她继续说道，“查尔斯顿已经够糟糕了。我只是不能容忍我的一个朋友把他的帽子挂在这样的地方，或者更糟。你需要一个地方住吗？”
</p><p>
"Well," she continued, "the Charleston is bad enough.  I just won't
stand for one of my friends hanging his hat in a place like that, or
worse.  Do you need a place to stay?"
</p>

<p>
他知道她是真诚的，但这种情况让人感觉不舒服，接近施舍。他的祖母总是警告人们不要表现出需要施舍的样子，更不用说实际上需要帮助了。“说实话，梅布尔，我不敢让你增加负担……”
</p><p>
He knew she was sincere, but the situation felt uncomfortably close to
charity.  His grandmother had always warned against even seeming to be
in need of charity—let alone actually needing help. "Really, Mabel, I
couldn't presume to burden you with..."
</p>

<p>
“现在，停下吧，尤尔根，”她摇摇头说道。她向前倾着臀部，双手小心地捧着波本威士忌，仿佛准备开始一场严肃的谈话。“这里的生意从来没有这么好过——我认为这与你有很大关系。你带来了一种新的声音，人们付钱来听它，喝一些，他们也吃食物。 .. 我的朋友多蒂，就在前几天对我说……”梅布尔把手放在胸前，强迫自己提高声音，“梅布尔，亲爱的，我听到加尔各答有一个奇怪的男孩在演奏——小提琴爵士乐。”
</p><p>
"Now, stop it Jurgen," she said with a shake of her head.  She scooted
her hips forward, cupping both hands around her bourbon carefully as if
she were settling in for a serious talk.  "Business here has never been
better—and I think you've had a lot to do with that.  You bring a new
sound, and people are paying to hear it, and drink a few, and they're
eating food, too...  My friend Dotty, just the other day said to me..."
Mabel pressed her hand to her breast and forced her voice to a higher
pitch, "Mabel, honey, I hear deyz a strange waat boy down at
Calcutta—plays jazz on de fiddle."
</p>

<p>
尤尔根嘲笑她假装的口音。
</p><p>
Jurgen laughed at her feigned accent.
</p>

<p>
梅布尔让她的声音降到正常的音调。“你在找固定的工作吗？”
</p><p>
Mabel let her voice drop to its normal pitch.  "Are you looking for
regular work?"
</p>

<p>
“我的行里似乎没有什么可用的。”
</p><p>
"Nothing seems to be available in my line."
</p>

<p>
“听着。首先，我们必须把你带出查尔斯顿。现在，我哥哥有一个额外的房间——他已经说过他会安置你，因为我已经问过他了——他妹妹的任何朋友总是欢迎。这样就剩下工作了。”
</p><p>
"Listen.  First thing, we have to get you out of the Charleston.  Now,
my brother's got an extra room—and he's already said he'll put you up,
cause I've asked him—any friend of his sister is always welcome.  So
that leaves work."
</p>

<p>
“我真的不能允许你这么做……”
</p><p>
"I really could not allow you to do that..."
</p>

<p>
“好吧，在你这么说之前，先听我说完，”她回答道。“我还没有完成一半。”
</p><p>
"Well, hear me out, first, before you say that," she answered.  "I'm
not half finished."
</p>

<p>
于尔根举手表示默许。“我会听你说完。”
</p><p>
Jurgen put up a hand to acquiesce.  "I'll hear you out."
</p>

<p>
“我的老朋友多蒂，”她开始说道。“我们一起上学，你明白的——至少在我们还是孩子的时候。现在，多蒂为埃德娜小姐工作。埃德娜小姐认为她的世界是因为她是如此整洁和有条理。埃德娜小姐本身就是一个轻浮的东西——她几乎不能用双手画她自己的嘴唇。”
</p><p>
"My old friend Dotty," she began.  "We went to school together you
understand—when we were children, anyway.  Now, Dotty works for Miss
Edna.  And Miss Edna thinks the world of her because she's so neat and
organized.  Miss Edna herself is a flighty thing—she can hardly paint
her own lips with both hands."
</p>

<p>
尤尔根大笑起来，然后向前倾身，像梅布尔那样捧起自己的杯子，在手掌间滚动。梅布尔有这样一种表达自己的方式。
</p><p>
Jurgen laughed, then bent forward and cupped his glass the way Mabel
cupped hers, rolling it between his palms.  Mabel had such a way of
expressing herself.
</p>

<p>
“现在埃德娜的情人是一个名叫拉蒙特的男人。我不知道他在埃德娜身上看到了什么——看着她，你不会认为她能做任何正确的事情。” 她眨了眨眼睛。“埃德娜小姐有一种比大脑更柔软的东西；而且它不在她的脑子里。”
</p><p>
"Now Edna's lover-boy is a man named Lamonte.  I don't know what he
sees in Edna—to look at her you wouldn't think she can do anything
right."  She winked.  "Miss Edna's got something softer than brains;
and it's not in her head."
</p>

<p>
只有她所说的第一部分真正引起了他的注意。“你说的是指挥劳伦斯·拉蒙特吗？” 他快速地喝了一口波本威士忌，然后再次在手掌之间滚动玻璃杯，想知道她在带什么去。几乎看到了。
</p><p>
Only the first part of what she said really caught his attention.
"You're speaking of Laurence Lamonte, the conductor?" He took a quick
sip of bourbon and rolled the glass again between his palms, wondering
where she was leading; almost seeing it.
</p>

<p>
“就是这个人。”梅布尔坚定地点点头回答道。“有了埃德娜的一点帮助——让拉蒙特进来听你演奏——你很快就会得到一些像样的东西。” 她慢慢地喝着波本威士忌，看着他。“这不会很困难。”
</p><p>
"That's the man," Mabel replied with a firm nod of her head.  "With a
little help from Edna—getting Lamonte in to hear you play—you'll have
something decent in no time."  She sipped her bourbon slowly, regarding
him.  "It won't be difficult."
</p>

<p>
“为什么不？”
</p><p>
"Why not?"
</p>

<p>
“哦，”她回答道，眯起眼睛靠得更近。“我知道他的秘密——多蒂告诉我的。我们的拉蒙特先生喜欢偶尔悄悄地溜出去听听……爵士乐……”她把双手放在桌子上，低声说道。“我有时会滑下来唱歌……舒伯特。”
</p><p>
"Oh," she replied, moving closer with narrowed eyes.  "I know his
secret—Dotty told me.  Our Mr. Lamonte enjoys slipping off discretely
on occasion to hear some... jazz..."  Putting both palms on the table,
she whispered.  "The way I sometimes slip off to sing... Schubert."
</p>

<p>
尤尔根笑了，坐回椅子上。“舒伯特。” 他并没有感到特别惊讶。她可能把舒伯特的所有艺术歌曲都唱得非常优美。她坐在那儿，似笑非笑地看着他，似乎已经说完了。他若有所思地敲了几下玻璃杯，凝视着自己的手指，仔细考虑着这个提议。终于，他抬起头，与她对视。“你知道该说什么。”
</p><p>
Jurgen laughed and sat back in his chair.  "Schubert." He did not feel
particularly surprised; she probably sang all of Schubert's lieder
beautifully.  She sat regarding him with a half-smile, and appeared to
be finished with her speech.  He thoughtfully tapped on his glass a few
times, mulling over the proposal, gazing at his fingers.  Finally, he
looked up to meet her eyes.  "You know just what to say."
</p>

<p>
梅布尔微笑着伸出手来拍拍他的手。“明天，”她回答道，“带着你的行李，我带你去见我哥哥。” 她举起酒杯，轻轻地敲了一下桌子中间的酒杯，与他的酒杯相遇。
</p><p>
Mabel smiled and reached out to pat his hand.  "Be here tomorrow," she
replied, "with your luggage, and I'll take you to meet my brother."
She raised her glass, and met his in the middle of the table with the
lightest of taps.
</p>

<p>
他抿了一口。“我无法要求一个更美好的圣诞节。”
</p><p>
He sipped.  "I couldn't have asked for a nicer Christmas."
</p>

<p>
“我也可以对你说同样的话。” 她喝了一口，然后拍下杯子，站起来，调整了一下臀部的亮片礼服，然后自信地靠过去。“我很快就会让你也加入我的秘密音乐晚会。” 她指着桌子。“现在，别忘了你的五美元。我们去创作一些圣诞音乐吧。” 尤尔根把钞票塞进衬衫口袋，然后跟着她走出门，进入聚光灯下。
</p><p>
"I could say the same about you."  She sipped once, then slapped her
glass down and stood up, adjusting her sequined gown around her hips,
then leaned over confidently.  "I'll soon have you joining my secret
musical soirées, too."  She pointed at the table.  "Now, don't forget
your five dollars.  Let's go make some Christmas music."  Jurgen
slipped the bill into his shirt pocket, then followed her out the door
and into the spotlights.
</p>

圣诞节那天十一点，尤尔根从查尔斯顿公寓酒店退房。收拾行李只花了几分钟，因为他几乎没有什么东西。收拾完行李后，他关掉灯，将手提箱和小提琴箱放在门外。他把门开着，回到房间，手里拿着一块手帕，站在椅子上，小心翼翼地把灯泡从插座上拧下来。他关上身后的门，然后蹲在走廊里，把匈牙利灯泡放进提包里，小心翼翼地裹在丝绸衬衫里。
</p><p>
On Christmas Day at eleven, Jurgen checked out of the Charleston
Residence Hotel.  Packing took only a few minutes, as he had little in
the way of possessions.  When he finished packing, he switched off the
light and set his valise and viola case down outside the door.  Leaving
the door open, he went back into the room and, holding a hand kerchief
in his palm, stood on the chair to carefully unscrew the hot bulb from
its socket.  He closed the door behind him, then crouched in the
hallway and put the Hungarian lightbulb into his valise, carefully
wrapped inside his silk shirt.

圣诞节前的几个晚上，高速公路上汽车排成一排，就像一大群被牵着去宰杀的红鼻子驯鹿。我把目光从视线上移开，伸手关掉收音机。自感恩节以来，我对弥赛亚的了解太多了。你可能会认为一个受人尊敬的古典电台可以想出一些更原创的东西来让广播充满活力。但我知道，即使我换了台，我也会收到白色圣诞节、蓝色圣诞节、迪克西圣诞节，或者其他形式的音乐亵渎。车流缓慢地行驶，缓慢地爬上一座又长又弯曲的山坡。天下着倾盆大雨——一场突如其来的热带风暴，只不过是发生在冰箱里。我把挡风玻璃雨刷器开到最大，但我仍然几乎看不到前面的车辆。
</p><p>
It was several nights before Christmas, and all along the freeway, cars
were lined up like a vast herd of red-nosed reindeer being led off to
slaughter.  I glanced away from the sight and reached out to snap off
the radio.  I'd had far too much of the Messiah since Thanksgiving.
You'd think a respectable classical station could think of something
more original to saturate the airwaves with.  But I knew that even if I
changed the station, I'd get White Christmas, or Blue Christmas, or
Dixie Christmas, or some other form of musical blasphemy.  Traffic
moved along sluggishly, inching up a long, curving hill.  It was
raining heavily—one of those sudden tropical storms, only it was
happening in a refrigerator.  I had the windshield wipers on full, but
still I could hardly see the vehicle in front of me.
</p>

<p>
和其他因约会迟到而愤怒的父亲、叔叔、兄弟和儿子一样，我也走在快车道上。我当时正赶上最后一刻的销售会议，如果我前面的白痴不快点的话，我女儿的音乐会就要迟到了。这辆惹事的车是一辆吉普车，四肢着地，轮胎大得足以让平路机相形见绌，并且有支柱和减震器，还有什么东西不伸出整个底盘——一个真正有用的机器，可以在危险的环境中行驶。硅谷高速公路：当你看到一辆你不喜欢的车时，你就直接从它上面滚过去。吉普车有一个典型的加州车牌，由黄铜框架固定，如果我能够在黑暗中阅读它，我会说“我的另一辆卡车是麦克”。司机不断地踩刹车，无疑是为了跟上一些乡村圣诞经典歌曲的节奏。在这座西方汽车工程的顶峰之上，有一棵圣诞树，用几根细绳绑着——可能正在前往客厅，客厅上挂着黑色天鹅绒上的裸体画，很快就会散落着俗气的乡村装饰品和爆米花串。这棵树向一侧倾斜，随着刹车灯的闪烁，树在吉普车车顶边缘上下摆动。司机的女朋友在前座上向他亲吻——我可以透过后窗看到她的轮廓，几乎坐在他的腿上……也许她_就_在他的腿上。我开始想他们可能应该失去整棵树。当他们没有它回家时，他们会得到一个真正的惊喜。
</p><p>
Along with every other irate father, uncle, brother, and son who was
late for some engagement or another, I was in the fast lane.  I had
gotten caught in a last-minute sales meeting, and I was going to be
late for my daughter's concert if the idiot in front of me didn't hurry
up.  The offending car was a Jeep, jacked up on all fours with tires
big enough to dwarf a road-grader, and had struts and shock absorbers
and what-not sticking out all over the undercarriage—a real useful
piece of machinery for navigating the treacherous Silicon Valley
freeways: when you see a car you don't like, you just roll right over
it.  The Jeep had one of those typical California vanity plates, held
in place by a brass frame which, had I been able to read it in the
dark, would have said "My other truck is a Mack."  The driver was
pumping on his brakes continually, no doubt keeping time to some
Country Christmas Hit Classic.  Lounging on top of this pinnacle of
western automotive engineering was a Christmas tree, lashed with a
couple pieces of thin twine—probably on its way to a living room hung
with paintings of nudes on black velvet, and soon to be littered with
tacky country decorations and strings of popcorn.  The tree listed to
one side, bobbing over the edge of the Jeep's roof in time with the
blinking brake lights.  The driver's girlfriend was smooching up to him
in the front seat—I could see her outline through the back window,
practically sitting in his lap... maybe she _was_ in his lap.  I
started thinking they probably deserved to lose the whole tree.  They'd
have a real nice surprise when they got home without it.
</p>

<p>
我再次伸手打开收音机，心想《弥赛亚》每小时的摘录可能已经结束了。我应该从家里带一盘磁带来，但我几乎没有时间换衣服。就在我的目光暂时移开时，我前面那辆装饰着圣诞树的汽车决定放下货物。在我抬头之前，我就感觉到我的车在颠簸、颠簸，然后猛踩刹车。我身后的汽车打滑并转向一侧，然后靠在喇叭上，就像撞上了冰山一样。我只是打开了应急灯，然后靠着自己的喇叭。前面的那个人，也许是听到了身后的鸣叫声，就在路边停了下来，像个白痴一样，把他的吉普车挂到了倒车档，朝我飞驰过来。他停下来并打开了应急灯。
</p><p>
I reached over to turn on the radio again, thinking the hourly excerpt
from the Messiah might be over by then.  I should have brought a tape
from home, but I'd barely had time to change my suit.  Just when my
eyes were averted for an instant, the Christmas-tree bedecked vehicle
in front of me decided to drop its load.  I felt my car go bump, bump,
and slammed on my brakes before I even looked up.  The car behind me
skidded and swerved to one side, then leaned on his horn as if he'd run
into an iceberg.  I just hit the emergency lights and leaned on my own
horn.  The guy in front, perhaps hearing the tooting chorus behind him,
stopped just down the road, and like an idiot, put his Jeep into
reverse and came hurtling back toward me.  He skidded to a stop and put
on his emergency lights.
</p>

<p>
是什么样的混蛋把一棵圣诞树绑得这么松，以至于它在高速公路中间掉了下来？我们的时速只有二十英里——在雨中，也同样如此。我想我必须出去检查损坏的程度，而且我不喜欢穿着正装鞋在雨中艰难行走。哈利路亚，无论如何，那个混蛋停下来了，所以我至少可以知道他的保险公司的名字——我已经记住了他的个人驾照号码（不值得重复——我一直认为DMV有正派标准） 。
</p><p>
What kind of jerk ties down a Christmas tree so loosely that it flops
off in the middle of a freeway?  We were only doing twenty miles an
hour—in the rain, no less.  I thought I would have to get out and
check the extent of the damage, and I wasn't happy about slogging in
the rain with my dress shoes on.  Hallelujah, the jerk stopped, anyway,
so I could at least get the name of his insurance company—I'd already
memorized his personal license number (which doesn't bear
repeating—I'd always thought the DMV had standards of decency).
</p>

<p>
我跳下车，试图拉起大衣的领子，尽管它不能完全遮住我的头，然后开始向前走去，在这辆豪华的汽车里与乡村先生大谈特谈。当然，CJ（我当时对司机的称呼）从吉普车上跳下来，朝我走来，边走边把衬衫塞进裤子里。我一看他，就差点转身离开——CJ 可能是保罗·班扬的双胞胎兄弟。他的衬衫也能证明这一点：红黑伐木工风格的格子，上面的三颗纽扣解开，胸毛比我的胡子还粗。他还穿着牛仔靴和红色宽背带。
</p><p>
I hopped out, trying to pull up the collar of my overcoat even though
it wouldn't quite cover my head, and started walking forward to have a
few choice words with Mister Country Jamboree in the over-endowed
automobile.  Of course, CJ (as I then dubbed the driver) bounded out of
the Jeep and headed my way, tucking in his shirt as he walked.  One
look at him, and I almost turned around and left—CJ could have been
Paul Bunyan's twin brother.  He had the shirt to prove it, too:  red
and black lumberjack style checks, with the top three buttons undone,
and chest hair that was thicker than my beard.  He also wore cowboy
boots and wide red suspenders.
</p>

<p>
“天哪，先生！” 他用真正关心的语气喊道。“你还好吗？”
</p><p>
"Holy moley, mister!" he yelled with a tone of real concern.  "You
alright?"
</p>

<p>
我正要撞上他，这时他嚼口香糖的女朋友从后面出现，把自己塞进他的腋窝里。“哦！” 她尖叫道：“啊，太抱歉了！看来我们的树撞坏了你的新车！”
</p><p>
I was about to lay into him when his gum-chewing girlfriend appeared
from behind, tucking herself into his armpit.  "Oh!" she squealed,
"Ah'm so sorry!  Looks like our tree smashed up your brand new car!"
</p>

<p>
我的车并不是全新的，但我环顾四周，朝她指的地方看去。果然，前格栅弯了，一盏大灯熄灭了，玻璃完全碎了。这棵树舒适地坐落在汽车下方，紧贴着油盘。
</p><p>
My car wasn't exactly brand new, but I looked around to where she
pointed.  Sure enough, the front grill was bent in and one headlight
had gone out, the glass completely smashed.  The tree itself was
nestled cozily under the car, nuzzling up against the oil pan.
</p>

<p>
他们俩脸上都流露出幼稚无助的表情——坦白说，我认为这可能是一种中等程度的迟钝机智——不知何故，我当时就被触动了，我无法让自己咒骂他们。此外，最快的办法就是满脸幸福地耸耸肩，从我的车底下拔出破烂的灌木丛，然后上路。我决定愚蠢会占上风。“圣诞节快乐！” 我呼喊着，伸出双臂。“对不起你的树！” 两人都绽放出笑容。
</p><p>
The look of childish helplessness on both their faces—and frankly what
I considered might be a moderate dose of dull wittedness—somehow got
to me just then, and I couldn't quite bring myself to swear at them.
Besides, the fastest thing to do would be to shrug it off with a happy
face, extract their battered shrubbery from beneath my car, and be on
my way.  I decided that silliness would carry the day.  "Merry
Christmas!" I called, throwing out my arms.  "Sorry about your tree!"
Both of them lit up in grins.
</p>

<p>
“看——他甚至没有生气，”那家伙对他的女朋友说。
</p><p>
"Look—he ain't even mad," the guy said to his girlfriend.
</p>

<p>
她惊讶地眨动着睫毛。“我们对此感到非常抱歉，”她摇着头说道。
</p><p>
She batted her lashes in astonishment.  "We're awfully sorry about
this," she chimed, wagging her head.
</p>

<p>
只花了一分钟，树就从车底下被取出来了。我一直在思考如何向毫无疑问会出现的巡警解释这件事：警官，这只是又一起马路杀戮事件，没什么好担心的；我确信这种事经常发生，所有这些树木都向毫无戒心的节日狂欢者俯冲而下。
</p><p>
It only took a minute to get the tree out from under the car.  All the
while, I was thinking of how to explain it to the patrolman who would
undoubtedly appear in a moment:  it's just another roadkill, officer,
nothing to be alarmed about; I'm sure it happens all the time, what
with all these trees swooping down on unsuspecting holiday merrymakers.
</p>

<p>
这棵树的下部树枝被严重损坏，但它确实足以为某人的假期带来欢乐——如果有人从底部几英尺处砍掉，并将坏的一面转向墙壁，这样就看不到它了。反正你只装饰了一半树，对吧？我开始试图向我的乡村熟人解释这一点，但他们不肯解释。
</p><p>
The tree was pretty battered up around the lower branches, but it
really could have sufficed to cheer someone's holiday—if one cut off a
couple feet from the bottom and turned the bad side toward the wall so
it couldn't be seen.  You only decorate half the tree anyway, right?  I
started trying to explain this to my countrified acquaintances, but
they would have none of it.
</p>

<p>
“看，先生，”CJ 慢吞吞地说，用一只手支撑着树。“我们把你的头灯弄坏了。见鬼，我至少能做的就是把树还给你。”
</p><p>
"Look, mister," CJ drawled, propping up the tree with one hand.  "We
busted out yer headlight.  Hell, the least I can do is give ya the
tree."
</p>

<p>
女人歪着头，伸出一只手去触碰我的手臂。她睁大的眼睛里有一种惊恐的表情，即使透过她滴着的睫毛膏我也能看到。“你还没有得到一个吗，先生？”
</p><p>
The woman tilted her head and shot out a hand to touch my arm.  She had
a horrified look in her wide eyes that I could see even through her
dripping mascara.  "You ain't already got one do ya, mister?"
</p>

<p>
我看了一眼手表，试图躲开它。我已经放弃了圣诞树的想法——告诉我的家人（指我的女儿珍妮）那一年我们不会拥有一棵圣诞树，这是最终决定。它们只是掉在地毯上，必须在一月份的正确时间被扔掉，否则城市垃圾处理人员不会捡起它们。有一年，我们有一棵树一直闲置到二月，因为我们错过了神奇的采摘日期。我最终把它切成小块，并在接下来的六周内一次把它扔掉。我对圣诞树没有任何用处。
</p><p>
I glanced at my watch and tried to weasel out of it.  I'd already nixed
the idea of a Christmas tree—told my family (meaning my daughter,
Jenny) we weren't having one that year, and that was final.  They just
shed all over the carpets and had to be tossed out at precisely the
right moment in January or the city garbage folks wouldn't pick them
up.  We'd had a tree one year that sat around well into February
because we missed the magic pick-up date.  I finally chopped it into
little bits and threw it out a piece at a time over the next six weeks.
I had no use whatever for a Christmas tree.
</p>

<p>
最后，我不想和他们争论——天气又冷又湿，我的音乐会就要迟到了。于是CJ帮我把那棵受了致命伤的针叶树装进我的行李箱里。我们四处寻找麻线，但找不到，所以他用女友的皮带把盖子压住。她把它高高地拖回吉普车里等他躲雨。他一边收紧腰带，一边在我耳边低语。“她真的不需要腰带，”他说。“无论如何，我会在几英里后把它从她身上拿下来。” 他向我眨了眨眼，祝我圣诞快乐。
</p><p>
In the end, I didn't want to argue with them—it was cold, exceedingly
wet, and I was already going to be late for the concert.  So CJ helped
me load the mortally wounded conifer into my trunk.  We groped around
for the twine, but couldn't find it, so he battened down the lid with
his girlfriend's belt.  She had high-tailed it back into the Jeep to
wait for him out of the rain.  He whispered into my ear while he
cinched up the belt.  "She don't really need her belt," he said.  "I'd
have it off her in another couple o' miles anyways."  He gave me a wink
and wished me a Merry Christmas.
</p>

<p>
当我到达大厅时，音乐会早已开始，也快到中场休息了。我讨厌为这些事情迟到，我不得不在大厅里等待，直到第一部分结束。我庆幸自己没有迟到。如果我错过了珍妮的首次亮相，她会非常失望：从我到达大厅大约二十分钟后，她就计划开始她作为特色独奏者的第一次公开表演——演奏“哈罗德在意大利”。如果你不知道的话，这是一首很好的音乐，但它并不在经常演奏的曲目中，因为它有点像一部不成熟的小提琴协奏曲。不是小提琴或大提琴，而是小提琴：所有管弦乐器中的弱者。
</p><p>
By the time I arrived at the hall, the concert had long since begun and
it was almost intermission.  I detest arriving late for these things,
and I had to wait around the lobby until the first part was over.  I
was thankful I'd not been any later.  Jenny would have been sorely
disappointed if I'd missed her big debut:  about twenty minutes from
the time I arrived in the lobby, she was scheduled to begin her first
public performance as a featured soloist—playing "Harold in Italy".
If you don't know it, it's a fine piece of music, but it's not in the
frequently-performed repertoire, because it's sort of a half-fledged
concerto for viola.  Not the violin or the cello—the viola:  underdog
of all orchestral instruments.
</p>

<p>
我的女儿珍妮并不总是一名小提琴手。我们让她开始学习小提琴——我认为对于年轻女士来说这是一种值得尊敬的乐器。我和我的前妻都怀有微弱的希望，希望有一天她能成为一名音乐会小提琴家——珍妮从她拿起第一把四分之一大小的小提琴起，就表现得非常出色。我们花了一大笔钱请了昂贵的老师，一旦她准备好了，我们就开始让她走上漫长的道路：青春交响曲。但就在她十四岁生日之后，她的大脑发生了一些变化。我的意思不是过早中风或某种病变。有一天，她回到家，眼神里充满了可怕的梦幻般的神情，她在厨房里走来走去，紧张地帮我做饭。她话不多。
</p><p>
My daughter Jenny wasn't always a violist.  We started her out right on
the violin—something I considered a respectable instrument for a young
lady.  My ex-wife and I had faint hopes that someday she'd be a concert
violinist—Jenny was that good from the time she picked up her first
quarter-sized fiddle.  We spent a fortune on expensive teachers, and as
soon as she was ready, we started her on the long track:  youth
symphony.  But just after her fourteenth birthday, something happened
to her brain.  I don't mean a pre-mature stroke or some kind of lesion.
She came home one day with this hideous dreamy look in her eyes, and
she puttered around the kitchen nervously helping me cook.  She wasn't
talking very much.
</p>

<p>
我不想探究，以为她准备好后会告诉我她的想法。“我下个月要去米兰，”我说，努力让自己高兴起来。
</p><p>
I didn't want to probe, figuring she'd tell me what was on her mind
when she was ready.  "I have to go to Milan next month," I said, trying
to be cheerful.
</p>

<p>
她正在把生菜叶撕成微小的碎片，然后她抬起头来。“你要见奶奶吗？”
</p><p>
She was tearing lettuce leaves into microscopic fragments, and she
looked up.  "Will you see Grandma?"
</p>

<p>
珍妮指的是我的母亲——所有家庭怪癖的源头。作为一个十七岁的意大利女孩，她与她的美国甜心结婚并来到了美国。事实证明，这是一场糟糕的婚姻，几年后，在尽职尽责地抚养四个孩子后，她以美国式的方式与我父亲离婚，回到了故乡的家。珍妮只见过她几次，但当他们真正见面时，你却无法将他们分开。
</p><p>
Jenny meant my mother—fountainhead of all family quirks.  As a
bright-eyed Italian girl of seventeen she married her American
sweetheart and came to the States.  It turned out to be a terrible
marriage, and years later, after dutifully raising four kids, she
divorced my father, American style, and went home to the Old Country.
Jenny had only met her a few times, but when they did meet you couldn't
pry them apart.
</p>

<p>
“呃哈。我想我可以带你一起去，如果你能忍受的话，”我开玩笑道。我把沙拉碗从她身边拿开，把切好的西红柿扔进去。“我们在春假前一天出发。”
</p><p>
"Uh-huh.  I thought I might take you along, if you can stand it,"  I
teased.  I pulled the salad bowl away from her and tossed in the tomato
I had been cutting.  "We'll leave the day before spring-break."
</p>

<p>
她听了这话，心情轻松了一些，手腕非常无力，把一整片生菜叶放在切碎的番茄上。“我们可以在维也纳停留吗？”
</p><p>
She brightened a bit at that, and with a very limp wrist, laid a whole
leaf of lettuce on top of the chopped tomato.  "Can we stop in Vienna?"
</p>

<p>
“哦，我不知道，珍妮……也许一两天。”
</p><p>
"Oh, I don't know, Jenny...  Maybe for a day or two."
</p>

<p>
她露出虚弱的笑容。“我们可以去看歌剧吗？” 她轻声问道。珍妮对歌剧的热情是惊人的。她肯定也从我母亲那里继承了这一点——我一直认为她回到米兰的一半原因是因为他们在旧金山演出了太多德国歌剧。
</p><p>
She put on a weak smile.  "Can we go to the opera?" she asked softly.
Jenny's enthusiasm for opera was phenomenal.  She must have inherited
that from my mother, too—I always thought half the reason she went
back to Milan was because they did too many German operas in San
Francisco.
</p>

<p>
“只要你能拉着奶奶一起走就可以了。” 我拿起沙拉和两个碗，然后轻快地走向餐厅。
</p><p>
"Only if you can drag Grandma along."  I picked up the salad and two
bowls, then waltzed away toward the dining room.
</p>

<p>
晚餐时，她宣布了这一重大消息。我刚刚把一大块牛排放进嘴里，若有所思地咀嚼着。我什至记得我们正在听普罗科菲耶夫的作品。
</p><p>
Over dinner she made her momentous announcement.  I had just put a big
bite of steak into my mouth and was chewing thoughtfully.  I even
recall we were listening to something by Prokofiev.
</p>

<p>
“爸爸，我要换了。”她漫不经心地快速说道。
</p><p>
"Daddy, I'm going to switch," she said quickly with an air of
non-chalance.
</p>

<p>
我顿了顿，嚼完，就直接掉进坑里了。“没关系，亲爱的……”又停顿了一下。她没有直视我，我倾身试图吸引她的目光。“你要换什么？”
</p><p>
I paused, finished chewing, and then fell right into the pit.  "That's
fine, honey..."  Another pause.  She wasn't looking right at me, and I
leaned over to try to catch her eye.  "You're going to switch what?"
</p>

<p>
她叉着牛排，左手小心地握着叉子，就像我们从小就教她的那样。“献给小提琴。” 她把一小块牛排放进嘴里，开始咀嚼。
</p><p>
She stabbed at her steak, fork delicately held in her left hand just
like we'd taught her all her life.  "To viola."  She slid a small piece
of steak into her mouth and started chewing.
</p>

<p>
我作呕，放下叉子，但她嘴里塞满了东西，继续喋喋不休，试图在我开始反对之前说服我。最后她满足了我的幻想。“你希望我成为一名伟大的音乐家，对吧爸爸？”
</p><p>
I gagged, and put down my fork, but she kept on chattering with her
mouth full, trying to convince me before I could even voice the
beginning of an objection.  Finally she appealed to my conceit.  "You
want me to be a great musician, right Daddy?"
</p>

<p>
我试图同意这是我们的希望，但我仍在努力喘口气。
</p><p>
I tried to agree that had been our hope, but I was still trying to
catch my breath.
</p>

<p>
“嗯，我现在坐在第三桌。你知道那是什么意思吗？” 她抱怨道。“我在音乐会生涯中永远不会有任何进展。你必须坐在第一席，或者成为音乐会女主人。”
</p><p>
"Well, I'm sitting third-desk right now.  Do you know what that
_means_?" she whined.  "I'll never get anywhere in a concert career.
You have to sit first-desk—or be the concert mistress."
</p>

<p>
我又咳嗽了几声。“但你做得很好，”我坚持道。“你是最好的。”
</p><p>
I coughed a couple more times.  "But you're doing fine," I insisted.
"You're the best."
</p>

<p>
她像往常一样皱起眉头，拉下一侧嘴角，眯起眼睛，然后将它们翻向天花板。“爸爸，”她说，“我不是最好的。玛丽是最好的。” 她把另一块牛排放到了叉子上。“我和面无表情的王坐在第三桌。” 她又露出了那种梦幻般的表情，用两根手指平衡着叉子。“但如果我改学小提琴——你知道，小提琴的需求量总是更大，因为演奏小提琴的人越来越少，爸爸——我可能会坐在第一张桌子上。”
</p><p>
She gave me her old half-frown, pulling down one side of her mouth and
screwing up her eyes, then rolling them away toward the ceiling.
"Daddy," she said, "I'm not the best.  Mary is the best."  She pushed
another piece of steak onto her fork.  "I'm sitting third desk with
Deadpan Wang."  She got that dreamy look again, and balanced her fork
on two fingers.  "But if I switch to viola—they're always in greater
demand you know, because fewer people play viola, Daddy—I could be
sitting first desk."
</p>

<p>
“听着，”我告诉她，“你已经赢得了几场比赛，你打算放弃所有的努力，拿起……小提琴吗？” 我真的咽了口口水。
</p><p>
"Look," I told her, "you've already won a couple of competitions, are
you going to throw all that effort away, and take up... the _viola_?"
I actually gulped.
</p>

<p>
“_你_可能会称之为胜利，”她反驳道，“但我从来没有获得过比第二名更好的成绩。”
</p><p>
"_You_ might call it winning," she shot back, "but I've never taken
better than second place."
</p>

<p>
“那大提琴呢？”
</p><p>
"What about the cello?"
</p>

<p>
“爸爸，”她再次哀嚎，放下刀，拿起牛奶。“技术太不一样了——你十年前就应该让我开始学大提琴。”
</p><p>
"Daddy," she whined again, putting down her knife and picking up her
milk.  "The technique is too different—you should have started me on
cello ten years ago."
</p>

<p>
“你妈妈知道这件事吗？”
</p><p>
"Does your mother know about this?"
</p>

<p>
她把叉子在青豆中转动，没有看我的眼睛。“不。” 她抬起头，眉毛打结。“她不在乎。”
</p><p>
She twirled her fork among her green beans and wouldn't meet my eyes.
"No."  She looked up with knotted eyebrows.  "She doesn't care."
</p>

<p>
“珍妮，她也是……”我无力地说下去，我们默默地吃了一会儿。
</p><p>
"Jenny, she does too..."  I let that trail off lamely and we ate in
silence for a while.
</p>

<p>
现在，我对小提琴作为一种乐器并没有什么特别的厌恶。坦白说，我认识几位小提琴演奏家，关系非常亲密，而且我一直发现小提琴演奏家都是热情而温柔的人。可以这么说，他们比小提琴家更不那么紧张。不像大提琴手那么热情。但我几乎不会认为小提琴是一种享有盛誉的独奏乐器。你能说出多少位著名的小提琴家的名字？有多少部伟大的小提琴协奏曲？“曲目太有限了，”我说，说出了我的想法。这个事实并没有动摇她的决心。
</p><p>
Now, I had nothing particular against the viola, as an instrument.
Frankly speaking, I've known a couple of violists pretty
intimately—and I've always found violists to be warm and tender
people.  Much less high-strung, so to speak, than violinists.  Not
quite as passionate as cellists.  But I would hardly have considered
the viola to be a prestigious solo instrument.  How many famous
violists can you name?  How many great viola concertos?  "The
repertoire is too limited," I said, speaking what was on my mind.  This
fact did not deter her determination.
</p>

<p>
“罗西先生认为我会成为一名伟大的小提琴手，”她回答道。那眼神又出现了，就在她浅棕色的眼睛里。就像她的母亲一样。
</p><p>
"Mr. Rossi thinks I'd make a great violist," she replied.  There was
that look again, right in her light brown eyes.  Just like her mother.
</p>

<p>
我突然灵光一现：我十几岁的女儿迷恋上了售票员。他需要一名小提琴手，而且显然他足够精明，能够利用一个年轻女孩的迷恋来得到一名小提琴手。也许我可以和罗西先生谈谈关于抢劫摇篮的事情。好吧，不，这有点太多了，我决定。珍妮会沉默地对待我一个星期。我必须保持冷静。我告诉她考虑一下，几周后，如果她仍然想成为一名小提琴手，我们会看看。
</p><p>
I had a sudden insight:  my teenage daughter had a crush on the
conductor.  He needed a violist, and apparently he was astute enough to
take advantage of a young girl's infatuation to get one.  Maybe I'd
have a word about cradle robbing with Mr. Rossi.  Well, no that was a
bit much, I decided.  Jenny would have given me the silent treatment
for a week.  I'd have to stay calm.  I told her to think about it for a
while, and after a couple weeks, if she still wanted to descend to
being a violist, we'd see.
</p>

<p>
半小时后，当我洗碗时，她正在给某人打电话，并拖着电话在客厅里到处闲逛，和她的朋友们聊了几个小时。我再次决定，我必须融入现代，买一部无绳电话。她可能已经准备好使用自己的私人线路了。我想也许我也应该让她付出代价。
</p><p>
Half an hour later, while I did the dishes, she was on the phone to
someone, and jabbered away for a couple of hours to her friends while
she dragged the phone all over the living room.  I decided again I'd
have to join the modern age and get a cordless phone.  She probably was
about ready for her own private line.  I thought maybe I ought to make
her pay for it, too.

珍妮在拿起她心爱的小提琴后一年内就晋升为第一任办公桌，尽管我自己，但我开始为她感到有点自豪。她确实受到了更高的要求，而且经常参与室内乐团、青年交响乐，到处跳来跳去，以至于她的很多功课都受到了明显的影响。她的平均成绩下降到勉强维持“B”。我们对此进行了一些讨论，并共同决定（或者至少我认为这是共同的）她需要停止它，否则我会停止她所有的课外活动。
</p><p>
Jenny worked her way up to first desk within a year of taking up her
beloved viola, and despite myself I was beginning to be slightly proud
of her.  She really was in higher demand, and was constantly so
involved with chamber ensembles, youth symphony, flitting here and
there, that a lot of her schoolwork was suffering noticeably.  Her
grade-point average dropped until she was barely maintaining a "B".  We
had a little talk about that, and decided mutually (or at least I like
to think it was mutual) that she needed to pull it up, or I'd pull the
plug on all her extra-curricular activities.
</p>

<p>
三年后，我就在那里，在大厅里踱步，等待着。我听到礼堂里响起了掌声，于是我偷偷溜进了门。大厅里挤满了人。至少有那么一刻，它看起来很坚固。我在后面发现了一个相当糟糕的座位，然后扑通一声坐下，同时环顾四周寻找更近的东西。我发现靠近中间有一个靠过道的座位，所以我向下移动并坐了进去。我不必着急——现在是中场休息，所以我坐在那里沉思了十分钟。很快，管弦乐队又鱼贯而入，观众们忙着重新找回座位。指挥家、臭名昭著的罗西先生重新出现在舞台上，乐团代表他。我等待着菜单上的下一个折磨人的工作，希望它能快点结束。结束时，我鼓掌了几次，希望其他观众不要发疯。
</p><p>
So there I was, three years later, pacing the lobby, waiting.  I heard
applause in the auditorium, so I snuck in the door.  The hall was
packed solid.  At least it seemed packed solid for a moment.  I found a
pretty lousy seat near the back and plopped myself down while I looked
around for something closer.  I spotted an aisle seat near the middle,
so I moved down and slid into it.  I need not have rushed—it was
intermission, so I sat there for ten minutes contemplating.  Soon, the
orchestra filed back in and the audience bustled around to reclaim
their seats.  The conductor, the notorious Mr. Rossi, re-appeared on
stage, and the orchestra stood for him.  I waited through the next
torturous work on the menu, hoping it would be over quickly.  When it
ended, I clapped a couple of times and hoped the rest of the audience
didn't go wild.
</p>

<p>
当掌声消失时，我发现自己屏住了呼吸。然后，珍妮出现在侧翼，向前走去，她的乐器轻松地悬挂在一只手上。我可以看到她扫视人群并微笑——她真的只是在找我。我想挥手，但那样就显得粗俗了，所以我把手放在一边。她就在那儿，她的黑色裙子从腰部和臀部飘扬起来，每次我注意到它时，她就更加像她母亲华丽的身材。她那件浆过的白衬衫几乎裂开了。她花了半个小时用熨斗熨烫它，然后又花了半个小时清除丝绸裙子上的每一粒绒毛。我注意到她的鞋带像往常一样解开了，不禁笑了起来。就在那一刻，她被乐谱架脚绊倒了——当我看到她一头栽倒在地板上时，一种强烈的不祥的预感穿过我的脊椎，并沿着我身体的每一根神经闪过。人群中一阵倒吸一口冷气，掌声立刻停了下来。
</p><p>
When the applause died out, I found I was holding my breath.  Then,
Jenny appeared in the wings, and strolled forward, her instrument
dangling easily from one hand.  I could see her scan the crowd and
smile—she was really just looking for me.  I felt like waving, but
that would have been gauche, so I kept my hands to myself.  There she
was, her black skirt billowing from a waist and hips that resembled her
mother's gorgeous figure more each time I noticed it.  Her starched
white blouse almost crackled.  She had spent half an hour fussing over
it with the iron, then spent another half an hour getting every speck
of lint off her silk skirt.  I noticed that her shoe-laces were untied,
as usual, and broke out in a smile.  At that instant, she tripped over
the foot of a music stand—an intense foreboding chill shot through my
spine and flashed along every nerve in my body when I saw her sailing
headlong toward the floor.  A gasp went up from the crowd, and the
applause stopped immediately.
</p>

<p>
我必须承认，她的反应就像一只有教养的猫，她的自我保护本能一定比这更强烈：她的小提琴从来没有掉到地板上。售票员听到咔哒声，转过身来，从讲台上走下来，扶她重新站起来。其中一名小提琴手的乐谱架放置不当造成了损坏，他放下小提琴去捡起碎片。售票员和珍妮说了几句话，然后送她下了舞台。她一瘸一拐，一条腿无法承受任何重量。罗西的手臂几乎抚摸着她的胸口，我感到一股慈父般的愤怒涌上心头。他们出发时我已经站起来，沿着过道小跑到礼堂前面。
</p><p>
Her reflexes, I must admit, were those of a well-bred cat, and her
instinct for self-preservation must never have been stronger:  her
viola never hit the floor.  The conductor, wheeling around when he
heard the clattering sound, stepped from his podium to assist her in
standing again.  One of the violinists, whose improperly placed music
stand had done the damage, put down his violin to pick up the debris.
The conductor had a few words with Jenny, and then he escorted her off
the stage.  She limped, and would put no weight on one leg.  Rossi's
arm seemed to be practically fondling her chest and I felt a surge of
fatherly irritation.  I was already on my feet when they started off,
and was trotting down the aisle toward the front of the auditorium.
</p>

<p>
“我是她的父亲，”我对那些试图阻止我登上侧楼梯的老太太们喊道。这时，机翼上出现了一个傻瓜，宣布比赛稍有延迟，请观众稍等片刻。“给他们讲几个笑话吧。”我冲过去时建议道。我没等听他接下来说什么，就跑到后面，寻找绿色的房间。我确信她会去那里。我希望他们有一个方便的医生。
</p><p>
"I'm her father," I shouted at the old ladies who tried to stop me from
ascending the side stairs.  By then, some numbskull appeared from the
wings to make an announcement that there would be a slight delay, and
ask the audience to please wait a few moments.  "Tell 'em a few jokes,"
I suggested as I dashed past.  I didn't wait to hear what he said next,
but ran into the back, looking for the green room.  I was certain
that's where she would have gone.  I hoped they had a doctor handy.
</p>

<p>
再过一两分钟，我就和珍妮和臭名昭著的罗西先生在一起了，他用手臂搂着她的腰，用油腻的低语安慰她。她坐着，腿上放着一把无价的小提琴——好吧，这对我来说已经足够无价了，因为即使我卖掉我的两辆车，我也买不起另一把类似的东西。她的弓被折成两半，挂在小提琴上，两块碎木片挂在白色的马毛上。她捂着一只手哭泣。
</p><p>
In another minute or two, I was with Jenny and the infamous Mr. Rossi,
who had his arm around her waist and was consoling her in oily
whispers.  She sat with her priceless viola set across her lap—well,
it was priceless enough to me, as I couldn't afford to buy another one
like it even if I sold both of my cars.  Her bow had been snapped in
two and was draped across the viola, two pieces of splintered wood
dangling from white horsehair.  She wept into the palm of one hand.
</p>

<p>
“亲爱的，你还好吗？” 我冲到她身边问道。罗西先生明智地收回了游走的手，退后了几步。
</p><p>
"Darling, are you OK?" I asked, rushing up to her.  Mr. Rossi wisely
removed his roaming hand and stood back a few steps.
</p>

<p>
“我想我只是扭伤了脚踝，”她回答道，但这并不是她最关心的事情。“哦，爸爸——看看我的弓！”
</p><p>
"I think I just sprained my ankle," she replied, but that was not the
uppermost thing on her mind.  "Oh, Daddy—look at my bow!"
</p>

<p>
“嘿，我们可以买一个新的，”我一边告诉她，一边把它举起来。“我看到了你拯救小提琴的方式，”我说，努力让自己的声音听起来很高兴。“这是一次很棒的机动！”
</p><p>
"Hey, we can get a new one," I told her, lifting it up.  "I saw the way
you saved your viola," I said, trying to sound cheerful.  "It was a
great maneuver!"
</p>

<p>
她没有笑。“但是……我要怎么玩呢？”
</p><p>
She didn't smile.  "But... how am I going to _play_?"
</p>

<p>
我转向罗西先生。“你看，我带她去看医生，然后……”
</p><p>
I turned to Mr. Rossi.  "Look, I'll take her to see a doctor, and..."
</p>

<p>
“不！” 珍妮尖叫起来。“我得走了！外面还有人等着呢！”
</p><p>
"NO!" Jenny screamed.  "I have to go on!  There are people waiting out
there!"
</p>

<p>
“亲爱的，”我回答道，“你必须马上去看医生。”
</p><p>
"Honey," I replied, "you have to see a doctor right away."
</p>

<p>
“爸爸——人们付_钱_来看我今晚打球……”她又开始哭了。“如果我再不坚持下去，我会永远受辱！”
</p><p>
"Daddy—people paid _money_ to see me play tonight..." She started
crying again.  "If I don't go on I'll be humiliated forever!"
</p>

<p>
罗西低声用浓重、难以形容的欧洲口音发出欣喜若狂的声音。他听起来就像是一款贴着法国标签的劣质意大利葡萄酒——在奥地利装瓶，通过西伯利亚大铁路运往阿拉斯加，然后通过一艘加拿大轮船走私南方。“她是一位真正的艺术家……”
</p><p>
Under his breath, Rossi was making ecstatic noises in a thick, and
quite ineffable, European accent.  He sounded like a bad Italian wine
with a French label—bottled in Austria and shipped via the
Trans-Siberian Railway to Alaska where it was smuggled south on a
Canadian ship.  "She eez a true artiste..."
</p>

<p>
尽管我尽了最大的努力，我还是无法说服她跟我一起走。她就是那样固执——比她母亲更固执。罗西先生在这件事上也帮不了什么忙：他似乎同意她的观点！
</p><p>
Try as I might, I could not convince her to come away with me.  She was
stubborn in that way—more stubborn than her mother had ever been.  Mr.
Rossi was no help at all in the matter either: he seemed to agree with
her!
</p>

<p>
“但你不能站起来，”我补充道，仍然试图说服她。
</p><p>
"But you can't stand up," I added, still trying to convince her.
</p>

<p>
“我坐吧。”她简短地回答。这时她的眼泪已经全部流干了。
</p><p>
"I'll sit," she replied curtly.  Her tears had all dried up by then.
</p>

<p>
“哦，是的，没问题，”罗西先生插话道，“我们看起来会很开心。” 我看了他一眼，他立刻闭嘴了。
</p><p>
"Oh yais, eets no problaim," Mr. Rossi interjected, "we'll seemply yoos
ainuther baow."  I shot him a look that shut him up immediately.
</p>

<p>
珍妮坚持要表演。她总是带着另一张弓，现在证明了这种做法的智慧。不幸的是，这已经足够了，尽管她一再谴责它对于演奏任何严肃的东西来说都是“相当低劣的棍子”。她的精英主义也遗传自她的母亲。
</p><p>
Jenny insisted on performing.  She always carried another bow, and now
the wisdom of that practice was proven.  Unfortunately, it would have
to suffice, though she had repeatedly decried it as being "quite an
inferior stick" for playing anything serious.  She got her elitism from
her mother, too.
</p>

<p>
罗西先生拍了拍手，彻底松了口气。“啊，但是ZEES awdiense weel nevair 听到了如此微妙的deefferense！” 我也明白他的意思——礼堂里挤满了数百名目光呆滞的父母、兄弟姐妹和小孩子；其中一半人可能甚至不会拼写“小提琴”。罗西先生几乎是一蹦一跳地走开——去看那个麻木头骨，并宣布另一件事：独奏者没有受伤；他没有受伤。演出还会继续。
</p><p>
Mr. Rossi clapped his hands, entirely relieved.  "Ah, but ZEES awdiense
weel nevair hear souch subtle deefferense!"  I knew what he meant
too—the auditorium was filled with hundreds of glassy eyed parents,
siblings, and tiny tots; half of them probably could not even spell
"viola".  Mr. Rossi practically pranced away—off to see the numbskull
and make another announcement: the soloist was unharmed; the show would
go on.
</p>

<p>
珍妮只有一个进一步的想法：她有足够的时间停止颤抖，但她对这次经历感到如此不安，以至于她决定永远不能相信自己能够凭记忆演奏。“我真的必须得到分数，爸爸。我应该得到。”
</p><p>
Jenny had only one further thought:  she'd had enough time to stop
shaking, but she was so unnerved by the experience that she decided she
could never trust herself to play from memory.  "I really must have the
score, Daddy.  I should."
</p>

<p>
绿色房间里的女士们忙忙碌碌，试图讨好她，但又与她的父亲保持着尊重的距离，她们正确地认为她的父亲是一只情绪敏感的猩猩。哦，是的，他们都全心全意地同意，这根本不是什么丢脸的事。很多独奏家以前都曾在他们面前演奏过音乐。考虑到她的神经状态，如果她能演奏，观众会感到非常欣慰和荣幸，他们会原谅音乐演奏中的微小不规则之处。无论如何，她必须有分数。
</p><p>
The ladies of the green room were bustling around, trying to fawn over
her, but keeping a respectful distance from her father, whom they
correctly perceived to be an ape in a touchy mood.  Oh, yes, they all
agreed whole-heartedly that it would be no disgrace at all.  Plenty of
soloists had played before with the music in front of them.  And
considering the state of her nerves, the audience would be so
relieved—and honored—to have her play at all, that they would forgive
the minor irregularity of playing from the music.  By all means, she
must have the score.
</p>

<p>
无奈之下，我终于屈服了，跪下给她系鞋带。她无法在没有帮助的情况下站立——我们尝试了一些实验步骤，她立即因自身重量而倒塌。其中一位女士拿出了一条王牌绷带，所以我们把她的脚踝绑了起来，她的脚踝肿得像烤山药一样。台上搬了一把椅子让她坐下。当然，由于她要根据乐谱进行演奏，所以她需要一个引人入胜的书。
</p><p>
Reluctantly, I finally gave in and knelt down to tie her shoe-laces.
She could not stand unassisted—we tried a few experimental steps and
she collapsed immediately under her own weight.  One of the ladies
produced an ace bandage, so we tied up her ankle, which had swollen so
much it looked like a baked yam.  A chair was taken onto the stage for
her to sit.  And of course, since she would be playing from the score,
she needed a page turner.
</p>

<p>
这是命运之手：我熟悉音乐，而且我穿着黑色西装。“亲爱的——我来翻页。”我在其他人自愿之前大胆地说道。“就像我们以前那样。”
</p><p>
It was the hand of fate: I knew the music, and I was wearing a black
suit.  "Honey—I'll turn the pages," I offered boldly before anyone
else could volunteer.  "Just like we used to do."
</p>

<p>
她给了我那种小女孩般的微笑——我已经十年没见过这样的笑容了，但这让我再次感觉自己像个真正的父亲了。“噢，爸爸，你愿意吗？”
</p><p>
She gave me that little-girl smile—I'd hardly seen it in ten years,
but it made me feel like a real father again.  "Oh, Daddy, would you?"
</p>

<p>
“来吧，”我说，用手臂搂住她。“我会护送我的公主登上王位的。” 她笑了，我们离开了休息室，她在我身边一瘸一拐地走着。
</p><p>
"Come on," I said, putting my arm around her.  "I'll escort my princess
to her throne."  She laughed, and we left the green room with her
limping along beside me.
</p>

<p>
现在，我不太喜欢戏剧。我从不看戏剧，上次上台是在三年级。当我们到达机翼时，我知道我的脸已经变成熟番茄的颜色，而且我出汗了。我应该让一位忙碌的女士为她翻页。我不知道如何面对观众。我集中精力减轻女儿扭伤的脚踝的重量。
</p><p>
Now, I'm not much of a theatre person.  I never attend plays, and the
last time I was on stage I was in the third grade.  By the time we
reached the wings, I knew my face had already turned the color of a
ripe tomato and I was sweating.  I should have let one of the bustling
ladies turn pages for her.  How I could face an audience, I had no
idea.  I concentrated on keeping my daughter's weight off her sprained
ankle.
</p>

<p>
当我们坐下来时，我有短暂的时间向外看，感到害怕。礼堂里很黑，所以我只能看到前几排。我能感觉到灯光之外的呼吸团，满怀期待地在阴影中盘旋，准备将我撕成碎片。一阵热风从前面摇晃的头顶吹过。它们的分叉舌头缓慢地盘绕着，愤怒地摇晃着。我几乎可以看到沙子扫过沙丘。不过，因为那是一个雨夜，所以沙丘非常潮湿。我能感觉到微风中强烈的湿度。指挥点点头，朝我们的方向露出灿烂的笑容，管弦乐队开始轻柔地介绍。
</p><p>
As we sat down, I had a brief moment to look out and feel terrified.
The auditorium was dark, so I could only see the first few rows.  And I
could sense the breathing masses beyond the lights, hovering
expectantly in the shadows, ready to slash me to ribbons.  A hot wind
was blowing in over the bobbing heads in the front; their forked
tongues wagged angrily as they coiled slowly.  I could almost see the
sand whipping across the dunes.  They were pretty damp dunes, though,
since it was a rainy night.  I could feel the intense humidity in the
breeze.  The conductor gave a nod, with a broad smile in our direction,
and the orchestra struck up with the soft introduction.
</p>

<p>
一开始我很惊慌，眼睛扫过乐谱，试图回忆起我应该做什么。第一页翻到哪里了？我什至不记得如何阅读那些小黑点。这一页看上去就像乐谱架上摊开的一份晦涩的外国文件，上面充满了难以理解的墨迹。这是针对无法治愈的疯子的罗夏墨迹测试。整个场景背后都是观众不安、凝视的面孔。我短暂地闭上了眼睛，试图让自己平静下来。然而，我立即把它们打开。如果我闭上眼睛，我就会错过珍妮的信号。如果发生这种情况，我知道一切都肯定会失败。我会被嘲笑下台，而她还没开始就被毁了。
</p><p>
I panicked at first, shooting my eyes across the page of music, trying
to remember what I was supposed to be doing.  Where was the first page
turn?  I couldn't even remember how to read the little black dots.  The
page took on the look of an obscure foreign document splayed out across
the music stand, filled with incomprehensible ink blots.  It was a
Rorschach test for the incurably insane.  The whole scene was backed by
the restless, peering faces of the audience.  I closed my eyes briefly,
trying to calm myself.  I snapped them open immediately, however.  If I
had my eyes closed, I would miss Jenny's signal.  If that happened, I
knew all would be lost for certain.  I'd be laughed off the stage, and
she would be ruined before she had even begun.
</p>

<p>
只有像罗西雷帝这样古怪的疯子才会选择《哈罗德在意大利》作为圣诞音乐会的压轴曲。这根本不是季节性的——不需要小提琴独奏的季节性音乐有什么问题呢？但我想，管弦乐队已经准备好了，珍妮也准备好了——也许在他那蓬乱的、有点欧洲风格的头发下，他认为在圣诞节而不是等到春天表演这将是一种精致而古怪的感觉。
</p><p>
Only an eccentric maniac like Rossi the Terrible would have picked
"Harold in Italy" for the finale of a Christmas concert.  It's not
seasonal in the least—what was wrong with something seasonal that
didn't require a viola solo?  But I guess, the orchestra was ready,
Jenny was ready—maybe under his mop of stringy and vaguely European
hair he thought it would be an exquisitely quirky touch to perform it
for Christmas instead of waiting until spring.
</p>

<p>
前几页顺利地过去了，我的心率逐渐下降到正常水平。她在恰当的时机点了点头，我成功地翻了几页，没有把所有东西洒在地板上，也没有发出一声原始的尖叫。之后，每翻一页都变得容易了，我发现当我们完全进入乐曲时，我又开始呼吸了，我可以跟上乐谱了。我也开始得意起来，用眼角的余光看了观众几眼。我能感觉到那种狂喜，就像一缕凉风一样从某个地方开始。她演奏得很优美，充满激情。罗西先生的表演非常出色——至少他的手势看起来很热情。我已经听过这首曲子很多次了——不管怎样，都是独奏段落——我已经把它熟记在心了。但当时听到它从珍妮的小提琴中倾泻而出，伴着柏辽兹闪闪发光的管弦乐，它呈现出一种我完全忘记的崇高品质。我已经很久没有真正听过《意大利的哈罗德》了，所有的旧记忆都开始回来了。
</p><p>
The first few page turns passed without incident, and my heart-rate
steadily decreased toward normal.  She nodded knowingly at just the
right instants, and I managed to turn the pages without spilling
everything all over the floor or uttering a primal scream.  After that,
each page turn became easier, and I found that by the time we were well
into the piece, I was breathing again, and I could follow the score.  I
began to get cocky too, and took a few glances at the audience out of
the corner of my eye.  I could feel the rapture, starting up out there
somewhere like a wisp of cool air.  She was playing beautifully,
passionately.  Mr. Rossi was conducting as brilliantly as he could—at
least his expansive gesticulations looked fervent.  I had heard the
piece so many times—the solo passages anyway—that I knew it by heart.
But hearing it then, pouring from Jenny's viola backed by the
shimmering of Berlioz' orchestration, it took on a sublime quality that
I had completely forgotten.  It had been a long time since I had really
listened to "Harold in Italy", and all the old memories started to come
back.
</p>

<p>
第二乐章的质感就像用宽阔、多彩的笔触描绘的大篷车。声音一开始非常轻柔，随着商队的接近、经过听众而逐渐增强，最后消退到远处。这是一个引人注目的部分，我个人认为这是整个作品中最好的部分。那时，我再次警觉起来，并试图衡量观众的反应。我开始认出每个人的面孔，并记住他们在哪里——我已经翻页超过十五分钟了。我记录了人们在看哪里，他们是否双手合十，以及他们在某些时候如何倾斜头部。我也没有听到太多咳嗽声和拖着脚步的声音。当我的眼睛习惯了看着它们时，我能看得更远，超越了前几行。他们真的——我想维多利亚时代的人可能会说——被音乐“感动”了。在珍妮的点头下，我又翻了一页。
</p><p>
The second movement has a quality like a caravan painted in broad,
colorful strokes.  It starts out very softly, and builds up as the
caravan approaches, passes by the listener, and then eventually recedes
into the distance.  It's a striking section, and personally I think
it's the best part of the whole work.  By that time, I was alert again,
and was trying to gauge the audience reaction.  I had started to
recognize individual faces, and remember where they were—I had been
turning pages for more than fifteen minutes.  I kept track of where
people were looking, whether they folded their hands, how they tilted
their heads at certain points.  I didn't hear a lot of coughing and
shuffling either.  As my eyes grew accustomed to looking at them, I
could see further, beyond the first few rows.  They really were—I
suppose a Victorian might have said "transported"—by the music.  I
flipped the page again at Jenny's nod.
</p>

<p>
我之前注意到前排附近有一位身材魁梧的女士。她穿着几串长长的珍珠串，穿着一条中等金棕色的高领长裙，上面有白色的花边褶边。她皮肤苍白，深色的头发扎成一个丑陋的发髻，头上戴着一朵白花。整套服装让她看起来就像是一场盛装打扮的火鸡大餐，上面有各种装饰，鸡腿上还戴着白色的小帽子。有很长一段时间，她似乎比任何人都更加“激动”。我可以看到她脸颊上的胭脂；她的嘴唇张开，身体向前倾。当第二乐章接近尾声时，我再次朝她的方向看去时，她捂着手帕哭泣。
</p><p>
I had noticed previously one rather large woman near the front row.
She was all dressed up with several long strings of pearls and a long
dress of medium golden-brown shades with lacy white frills and a high
collar.  She had pale, white skin, and her brunette hair was tied up in
a hideous bun and topped with a white flower.  The whole outfit made
her look like an overdressed turkey dinner with all the trimmings and
those little white caps on the drumsticks.  She seemed for a long while
to be even more "transported" than anyone else.  I could see the rouge
on her cheeks; her lips were parted and she bent forward.  The next
time I chanced to look her way, near the end of the second movement,
she was crying into her handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
那一刻，随着商队渐渐远去，我有了一种永远不会忘记的启示。这就是事情的全部，真的，我告诉自己。这就是珍妮的生活，她能唤起观众的情感是她特殊的天赋。也许我从来没有真正接受过她选择的方向。我开始感到刺痛和眼睛模糊。如果她的演奏能让一位身材高大的女性在比平均水平差的观众中流下眼泪，那么她也一定给另一个人带来了欢乐，至少给其他人带来了某种感觉；也许其他人。如果她真的想用小提琴而不是小提琴来做到这一点——为这种受人尊敬的独奏乐器带来新的生命——我觉得我终于可以接受了。不知何故，在过去的三年里，我对她学习小提琴的反对让我完全看不到她实际上正在成功的事实。感觉她的命运开始展开。我和我十七岁的女儿坐在舞台上，实际上是作为独奏者参加她的首演。我想知道有多少父亲有这样的机会。参加这次活动我感到越来越荣幸，当第三乐章结束时我感到很高兴。当然，珍妮会飞离我而去，进入某种音乐会事业，攀登得更高——这是一个孩子成长为独立女性、向世界释放伟大艺术的必然结果。我当时想，无论她是否成为著名的独奏家，都无关紧要。这确实是她赖以生存的氛围。不仅是表演的短暂时刻，还有她周围的人——和她一起演奏、打发时间的朋友、练习和奉献；甚至罗西先生，无论我是否真的喜欢他。我几乎无法忍住泪水，无法长时间地翻过第四乐章的结尾。
</p><p>
At that moment, as the caravan was fading into the distance, I had a
kind of revelation that I'll never forget.  This is what it's all
about, really, I told myself.  This is Jenny's life, and the kind of
emotions she can evoke in an audience are her special gift.  Maybe I
had never really come to terms with the direction she had chosen.  I
started to feel tingly and blurry eyed.  If she, with her playing,
could bring tears to even one large woman in a worse-than-average
audience, she must also be bringing joy to another, and at least some
feeling to someone else; maybe everyone else.  If she really wanted to
do that with a viola instead of a violin—bringing a new kind of life
to a little regarded solo instrument—I felt I could finally accept it.
Somehow, over the past three years, my opposition to her taking up the
viola had completely blinded me to the fact that she was actually
succeeding.  It felt like her destiny beginning to unfold.  I was
sitting on stage with my seventeen year-old daughter, actually
participating in her debut as a soloist.  How many fathers have that
opportunity, I wondered.  I felt a growing sense of privilege attending
the event, and I was elated by the time the third movement was over.
Jenny would fly away from me, of course, into some concert career,
climbing ever higher—the inevitable result of a child growing into an
independent woman with a great art to unleash on the world.  Whether
she ever became a famous soloist or not, I thought at that moment, was
irrelevant.  It was really the ambience that she lived for; not only
the brief moments of performing, but also the people around her—the
friends with whom she played and passed her time, the practicing, the
dedication; even Mr. Rossi, whether I really liked him or not.  I could
hardly keep tears out of my eyes long enough to turn pages through the
end of the fourth movement.
</p>

<p>
当音乐结束，最后的爆炸声消失在墙壁中时，礼堂里出现了整整十秒的绝对寂静。所有的小孩子都怎么了？我几乎想知道观众是否已经睡着了！掌声从前面开始，身材魁梧的女人用两只粗大的手指夹着帕子，狂喜地鼓掌，带领着人群。我从未见过观众如此热情。她前后摇着头——我可以看到她脸颊上闪闪发光的泪水——她不断地亲吻。刹那间，掌声变成了巨大的轰鸣声，冲击着舞台的前方……然后观众们全部站了起来。我几乎不敢相信——为“哈罗德在意大利”起立鼓掌？不，这一切都是为了珍妮。
</p><p>
When the music finished and the last blast faded into the walls, there
was fully ten seconds of absolute silence in the auditorium.  What
happened to all the tiny tots?  I almost wondered if the audience had
gone to sleep!  The applause began from the front—the large woman held
her handkerchief between two fat fingers, and was applauding wildly,
ecstatically, leading the crowd.  I had never seen such fervor in a
spectator.  She was shaking her head, back and forth—I could see the
tears glistening on her cheeks—she threw kisses.  In an instant, the
applause grew to a tremendous roar that crashed against the front of
the stage... and then the audience, en masse, were on their feet.  I
could almost not believe it—a standing ovation for "Harold in Italy"?
No, it was all for Jenny.

随后的招待会非常华丽。我往后退了一步，仍然在珍妮身边徘徊，而她则接受了她的朋友们和随意的观众的问候，其中包括那个拿着手帕的大块头女人。我喝了一杯太年轻、太时髦的加州白葡萄酒，让她晒了近一个小时。当然，她还是站不起来，所以他们不知从哪里给她带来了一把软垫椅子，她像一位小君主一样笔直地坐着，一臂弯里抱着一大束粉红玫瑰，微笑着点头。 。另一只手不断地伸出来接受其他人的手——有几次还接受某个好色的老家伙的亲吻。
</p><p>
The reception afterwards was gorgeous.  I stood back, still hovering
close to Jenny while she took the greetings of her friends and random
members of the audience, including the large woman with the
handkerchief.  I sipped a California white wine that was far too young
and sassy, and let her bask for nearly an hour.  She still could not
stand up, of course, so they had brought her a padded chair from
somewhere, and she sat straight-backed like a little monarch, with a
big bouquet of pink roses nestled in the crook of one arm, nodding and
smiling.  The other hand was perpetually extended to receive other
hands—and on a few occasions to receive a kiss from some lecherous
old geezer.
</p>

<p>
我看得出来，对珍妮来说，一切结束得太早了。但当最后一个掉队者离开房间时，当我瞥见她的脸时，我可以看出她已经累得要命了。脚踝处的疼痛也无法再掩饰。当我走近时，她皱起眉头并伸出双腿。
</p><p>
It ended all too soon for Jenny, I could see.  But when I glanced at
her face as the last of the stragglers were leaving the room, I could
tell she was dead tired.  The pain in her ankle could not be masked any
longer either.  She winced and stretched out her legs when I approached.
</p>

<p>
“爸爸，我们回家路上顺便去一下医院，好吗？只是为了确保它没有坏掉或者什么的。”
</p><p>
"Daddy, let's stop by the hospital on the way home, OK?  Just to make
sure it's not broken or anything."
</p>

<p>
我笑了。“当然可以，珍妮。” 她一直都很小，就像她的母亲一样，而且从来没有长得太大而无法携带。我把她抱起来，一手拿着她的小提琴盒，把她抱到了停车场。雨停了，云彩散去一半。月亮像远处山上的大银勺一样照亮了剩余的云层，几颗星星在寒冷的空气中闪烁。
</p><p>
I laughed.  "Sure thing, Jenny."  She had always been small, like her
mother, and had never grown too big to carry.  I lifted her up, and
holding her viola case in one hand, carried her out to the parking lot.
The rain had stopped, and half the clouds had dispersed.  The moon lit
up the remaining clouds like big silver scoops over the far hills—and
a few stars twinkled overhead in the cold air.
</p>

<p>
我旋转着，边走边旋转。“让我们看看，”我不断地说，“是这样吗？” 我会以一种方式旋转她。“或者本来就是这样吗？” 她咯咯地笑着，双臂抱在我的脖子后面。
</p><p>
I whirled around, and around as I walked.  "Let's see," I kept saying,
"was it this way?" And I would whirl her one way.  "Or was it that
way?"  She was in giggles, with her arms clasped behind my neck.
</p>

<p>
我们找到了那辆车——我一直都知道它在哪里，但我玩得很开心。当我们到达车旁时，我让她站起来一会儿，然后从口袋里掏出钥匙。与此同时，我把小提琴盒递给她，她心不在焉地接过。她转过身来，第一次看到车头时，突然尖叫了一声。“你的车到底怎么了？” 她一瘸一拐地跟着我到门口。
</p><p>
We found the car—I knew where it was all along, but I was having fun.
When we reached the car, I set her down on her feet for a moment to
fish my keys out of my pocket.  Meanwhile, I handed her the viola case,
and she took it absently.  She turned around then, and seeing the front
of the car for the first time, burst out in a squeal.  "What the hell
happened to your car?" She limped to follow me to the door.
</p>

<p>
“高速公路上的小事故。”我一边回答，一边打开乘客车门。她的目光从前格栅转向车侧。当她的目光停在箱子上时，我忍不住笑了。门是半开着的，到处都是大片的枞树枝条。
</p><p>
"Little mishap on the freeway," I replied, unlocking the passenger
door.  Her eyes went from the front grill back along the side of the
car.  I couldn't help smiling when her eyes stopped at the trunk.  It
was half open, with big sprigs of fir tree bulging out all over.
</p>

<p>
“哦，爸爸……”她抓着我的肩膀低声说道。我听到她的声音又恢复了温暖的语气，她拥抱了我。“你说今年我们不会有一棵树……”
</p><p>
"Oh, Daddy..." she whispered, clutching my shoulder.  I heard that warm
tone come back into her voice and she embraced me.  "You said we
weren't going to have a tree this year..."
</p>

<p>
“我改变主意了，亲爱的，”我回答道。“而且——它太便宜了，不容错过。” 我从她手中夺走了她的小提琴盒。“从我的朋友 CJ 那里得到的，”我慢​​吞吞地说。
</p><p>
"Changed my mind, honey," I replied.  "Besides—it was too cheap to
pass up."  I grabbed her viola case out of her hand.  "Got it from mah
ol' frenn CJ," I drawled.
</p>

<p>
她看着我，就像我是用山羊奶酪做的一样。“什么？”
</p><p>
She looked at me like I was made of goat cheese. "What?"
</p>

<p>
“进来吧，路上我会告诉你。”我一边回答，一边为她把门。“可怜的东西在高速公路上出了事故，但并不是什么小截肢都解决不了的。”
</p><p>
"Get in, I'll tell you about it on the way," I answered, holding the
door for her.  "Poor thing had an accident on the freeway, but it ain't
nothin' a little amputation won't fix."
