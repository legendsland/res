      第一批这种思维放大机器将是现在被称为个人电脑的设备的后代，但它们与当今信息处理技术的相似性，就如同电视与 15 世纪印刷机的相似性一样。它们目前还未面世，但很快就会面世。在今天的一年级学生高中毕业之前，全世界数亿人将联合起来，利用上</font><font style="vertical-align:inherit">个世纪少数思想家和修补匠梦想的工具，创建新型

      </font></font><a href="#vc/book">人类社区。</a><p>没有人知道这最终会成为人类为自己做的最好或最坏的事情，因为这种赋权的结果在很大程度上取决于我们如何应对以及我们选择如何利用它。人类的思想不会被机器取代，至少在可预见的未来不会，但<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">毫无疑问，幻想放大器、智力工具包和交互式电子社区在世界范围内的普及将改变人们的思考、学习和交流方式。</font></p><p>Nobody knows whether this will turn out to be the best or the worst thing the human race has done for itself, because the outcome of this empowerment will depend in large part on how we react to it and what we choose to do with it. The human mind is not going to be replaced by a machine, at least not in the foreseeable future, but <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">there is little doubt that the worldwide availability of fantasy amplifiers, intellectual toolkits, and interactive electronic communities will change the way people think, learn, and communicate.</font></p>

      <p>看起来，这项最新技术引发的社会变革可能比上一次人类思维增强（五百年前，西方世界开始学习阅读）的影响更为深远。活字印刷术发明后不到一个世纪，欧洲的识字群体就从少数特权阶层发展成为人口的很大一部分。人们的生活发生了根本性、迅速的变化，不是因为印刷机，而是因为这项发明让人们能够了解事物。书籍只是思想从精英私人图书馆中逃脱并在民众中传播的载体。</p><p>It looks as if this latest technology-triggered transformation of society could have even more intense impact than the last time human thought was augmented, five hundred years ago, when the Western world learned to read. Less than a century after the invention of movable type, the literate community in Europe had grown from a privileged minority to a substantial portion of the population. People's lives changed radically and rapidly, not because of printing machinery, but because of what that invention made it possible for people to know. Books were just the vehicles by which the ideas escaped from the private libraries of the elite and circulated among the population.</p>

      <p>书籍的真正价值源自它们所促成的社区，即一个至今仍在世界各地活跃的知识社区。印刷品已成为传播化学和诗歌、进化和革命、民主和心理学、技术和工业等思想的媒介，以及许多超出了发明活字印刷术和开始大量印刷圣经的人的理解范围的概念。</p><p>The true value of books emerged from the community they made possible, an intellectual community that is still alive all over the world. The printed page has been a medium for the propagation of ideas about chemistry and poetry, evolution and revolution, democracy and psychology, technology and industry, and many other notions beyond the ken of the people who invented movable type and started cranking out Bibles.</p>

      <p>由于复杂电子设备的大规模生产可能比研究原型的先进水平落后十年甚至更久，自 1960 年以来计算机科学的惊人成就的最初影响才刚刚开始进入我们的生活。文字处理器、视频游戏、教育软件和计算机图形学在十年前对大多数人来说都是未知的，但今天它们已成为价值数十亿美元的产业的名称。专家们一致认为，最令人吃惊的发展尚未到来。</p><p>Because mass production of sophisticated electronic devices can lag ten years or more behind the state of the art in research prototypes, the first effects of the astonishing achievements in computer science since 1960 have only begun to enter our lives. Word processors, video games, educational software, and computer graphics were unknown terms to most people only ten years ago, but today they are the names for billion-dollar industries. And the experts agree that the most startling developments are yet to come.</p>

      <p>一些个人计算的先驱者至今仍在计算机行业工作，他们还记得个人计算的诞生和梦想，当时个人计算的概念在计算机界还只是一种模糊的异端邪说。三十年前，设计、制造、编程和使用计算机的绝大多数人都认同一个关于计算机在社会中正确（和可能）地位的观点：<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">“计算机是用于数学计算的神秘设备。”</font>就是这样。人们认为计算机技术对于非专业人士来说太脆弱、太有价值、太复杂了。</p><p>A few of the pioneers of personal computing who still work in the computer industry can remember the birth and the dream, when the notion of personal computing was an obscure heresy in the ranks of the computing priesthood. Thirty years ago, the overwhelming majority of the people who designed, manufactured, programmed, and used computers subscribed to a single idea about the proper (and possible) place of computers in society: <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"computers are mysterious devices meant to be used in mathematical calculations."</font> Period. Computer technology was believed to be too fragile, valuable, and complicated for nonspecialists.</p>

      <p>1950 年，反对这一教条的人屈指可数。少数人持有不同观点，他们对于计算机的使用方式有不同的看法。持不同意见的人都对个人<i>计算</i>抱有共同的愿景，即计算机将用于增强人类智力最具创造性的方面——让每个人都能实现这一目标，而不仅仅是技术专家。</p><p>In 1950 you could count the people who took exception to this dogma on the fingers of one hand. The dissenting point of view shared by those few people involved in a different way of thinking about how computers might be used. The dissenters shared a vision of <i>personal</i> computing in which computers would be used to enhance the most creative aspects of human intelligence--for everybody, not just the technocognoscenti.</p>

      <p>那些质疑数据处理教条的人同意计算机可以帮助我们计算，但他们也怀疑，如果这些设备可以更具交互性，这些工具可能会帮助我们推测、建立和研究模型、在各种选择之间进行选择，并在信息集合中寻找有意义的模式。他们想知道这种新生设备是否可能成为一种通信媒介以及一台计算机。</p><p>Those who questioned the dogma of data processing agreed that computers can help us calculate, but they also suspected that if the devices could be made more interactive, these tools might help us to speculate, build and study models, choose between alternatives, and search for meaningful patterns in collections of information. They wondered whether this newborn device might become a communication medium as well as a calculating machine.</p>

      <p>这些异端计算机理论家提出，如果人类知识确实是力量，那么能够帮助我们将信息转化为知识的设备应该成为非常强大的技术的基础。虽然大多数科学家和工程师仍然对巨型加法机心存敬畏，但这一少数人坚持思考如何利用计算机以非数学的方式协助人类思维运作。</p><p>These heretical computer theorists proposed that if human knowledge is indeed power, then a device that can help us transform information into knowledge should be the basis for a very powerful technology. While most scientists and engineers remained in awe of the giant adding machines, this minority insisted on thinking about how computers might be used to assist the operation of human minds in nonmathematical ways.</p>

      <p><i>《思维工具》</i>关注的是一些在创造昨天、今天和明天的人机交互技术方面发挥了重要作用的人的思想。计算史上的几位关键人物在几个世纪或几十年前就去世了。我把这些在科学界享有盛誉但鲜为人知的人称为“元老” <font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>。</i></font>其他个人计算机技术的共同创造者今天仍在工作，继续探索心机交互的前沿。我称他们为“先驱<font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>”</i></font>。</p><p><i>Tools for Thought</i> focuses on the ideas of a few of the people who have been instrumental in creating yesterday's, today's, and tomorrow's human-computer technology. Several key figures in the history of computation lived and died centuries or decades ago. I call these people, renowned in scientific circles but less known to the public, the <font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>patriarchs</i></font>. Other co-creators of personal computer technology are still at work today, continuing to explore the frontiers of mind-machine interaction. I call them the <font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>pioneers</i></font>.</p>

      <p>最年轻的一代，即那些正在探索我们即将经历的认知领域的人，我称他们为<font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>信息航天员</i></font>。现在判断历史将如何看待这些新想法还为时过早，但我们将看看最新的内部空间探索者正在思考的一些事情，希望能从中得到一些线索，了解不久的将来每个人会思考什么（以及如何思考）。</p><p>The youngest generation, the ones who are exploring the cognitive domains we will all soon experience, I call the <font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>Infonauts</i></font>. It is too early to tell what history will think of the newer ideas, but we're going to take a look at some of the things the latest inner-space explorers are thinking, in hopes of catching some clues to what (and how) everybody will be thinking in the near future.</p>

      <p>我们将会看到，这项技术未来的极限并不在于硬件，而在于我们的思维。数字计算机基于一种被称为<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">“通用机器”的理论发现，</font>它实际上不是一种有形的设备，而是一种能够模拟任何其他机器动作的机器的数学描述。一旦你创造了一种可以模仿任何其他机器的通用机器，该工具的未来发展就只取决于你能用它做什么任务。就眼前而言，机器能否变得智能的问题并不比学习如何处理一种可以变成我们清楚地想象的任何东西的设备更重要。</p><p>As we shall see, the future limits of this technology are not in the hardware but in our minds. The digital computer is based upon a theoretical discovery known as <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"the universal machine,"</font> which is not actually a tangible device but a mathematical description of a machine capable of simulating the actions of any other machine. Once you have created a general-purpose machine that can imitate any other machine, the future development of the tool depends only on what tasks you can think to do with it. For the immediate future, the issue of whether machines can become intelligent is less important than learning to deal with a device that can become whatever we clearly imagine it to be.</p>

      <p>当今的个人计算机与未来的智能设备之间的关键区别将不在于硬件，而在于软件<i>——</i>人们为控制计算机操作而编写的指令。程序就是指示通用机器模仿特定类型的机器。正如计算的硬件基础从继电器发展到真空管、晶体管、集成电路一样，程序也在不断发展。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">当信息处理发展到知识处理时，真正的个人计算机将超越硬件，与比电子微电路更强大的电源相连——人类大脑协同工作的力量。</font></p><p>The pivotal difference between today's personal computers and tomorrow's intelligent devices will have less to do with their hardware than their <i>software</i>-- the instructions people create to control the operations of the computing machinery. A program is what tells the general-purpose machine to imitate a specific kind of machine. Just as the hardware basis for computing has evolved from relays to vacuum tubes to transistors to integrated circuits, the programs have evolved as well. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">When information processing grows into knowledge processing, the true personal computer will reach beyond hardware and connect with a vaster source of power than that of electronic microcircuitry--the power of human minds working in concert.</font></p>

      <p>我们对这种新型工具的态度将在很大程度上决定我们在二十世纪末创造的世界的性质。我们中许多在前计算机时代接受教育的人将学习新技能。1999 年的大学毕业生已经踏上征程。重要的是，我们今天要认识到，未来的技能与如何操作计算机关系不大，而与如何使用增强的智力、增强的通信和丰富的想象力关系很大。</p><p>The nature of the world we create in the closing years of the twentieth century will be determined to a significant degree by our attitudes toward this new category of tool. Many of us who were educated in the pre-computer era shall be learning new skills. The college class of 1999 is already on its way. It is important that we realize today that those skills of tomorrow will have little to do with how to operate computers and a great deal to do with how to use augmented intellects, enhanced communications, and amplified imaginations.</p>

      <p>忘掉“计算机素养”或令人费解的技术术语吧，因为当机器及其程序变得更加智能时，这些异常现象就会消失。制造个人计算机的最初目的是让人们能够使用机器做机器最擅长的事情，从而做人们最擅长的事情。许多人害怕今天的计算机，因为他们被告知这些机器比他们实际更聪明——新手为了使用计算机而被迫经历的仪式进一步强化了这种欺骗。事实上，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">沟通的负担应该落在机器身上。一台难以使用的计算机是一台太笨而无法理解你想要什么的计算机。</font></p><p>Forget about "computer literacy" or obfuscating technical jargon, for these aberrations will disappear when the machines and their programs grow more intelligent. The reason for building a personal computer in the first place was to enable people to do what people do best by using machines to do what machines do best. Many people are afraid of today's computers because they have been told that these machines are smarter than they are--a deception that is reinforced by the rituals that novices have been forced to undergo in order to use computers. In fact, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">the burden of communication should be on the machine. A computer that is difficult to use is a computer that's too dumb to understand what you want.</font></p>

      <p>如果本书中某些人的预言继续准确，那么从现在到世纪之交的某个时候，我们的整个环境将突然呈现出一种自己的智能。十五年后，你的电话听筒中将有一个微芯片，其计算能力将超过国防部今天可以购买的所有技术。世界上所有书面知识都将成为每个学童口袋里的物品之一。</p><p>If the predictions of some of the people in this book continue to be accurate, our whole environment will suddenly take on a kind of intelligence of its own sometime between now and the turn of the century. Fifteen years from now, there will be a microchip in your telephone receiver with more computing power than all the technology the Defense Department can buy today. All the written knowledge in the world will be one of the items to be found in every schoolchild's pocket.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">不管好坏，二十一世纪的计算机将无处不在，</font>而比奥威尔更适合预言这一事件的人很可能是马歇尔·麦克卢汉。如果麦克卢汉关于媒介即信息的说法是正确的，那么当整个环境成为媒介时，这意味着什么？如果这种发展确实如预期的那样发生，那么它的结果可能与最近最疯狂的“计算机化家庭”场景不同。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The computer of the twenty-first century will be everywhere,</font> for better or for worse, and a more appropriate prophet than Orwell for this eventuality might well be Marshall McLuhan. If McLuhan was right about the medium being the message, what will it mean when the entire environment becomes the medium?

In the 1990s it might be possible for people to "think as no human being has ever thought" and for computers to "process data in a way not approached by the information-handling machines we know today," as <a href="#OEBPS/Text/7.html">J.C.R.

      <p>关于计算机影响的最早预测出现在 1960 年之前。第一台电子计算机是在第二次世界大战期间由少数人发明的，他们通常是独自工作。在 1940 年代的实际发明者之前是 19 世纪 40 年代的软件元老。在他们之前，数千年前，来自不同文化的思想家们努力寻找更好的方法来使用符号作为工具，导致了数学和逻辑的发明。正是这些操纵符号的形式系统最终导致了计算。我们现在看到的连续思想链中的环节是由一系列希腊哲学家、英国逻辑学家、匈牙利数学家和美国发明家创建的。</p><p>The earliest predictions about the impact of computing machinery occurred quite a bit earlier than 1960. The first electronic computers were invented by a few individuals, who often worked alone, during World War II. Before the actual inventors of the 1940s were the software patriarchs of the 1840s. And before them, thousands of years ago, the efforts of thinkers from many different cultures to find better ways to use symbols as tools led to the invention of mathematics and logic. It was these formal systems for manipulating symbols that eventually led to computation. Links in what we can now see as a continuous chain of thought were created by a series of Greek philosophers, British logicians, Hungarian mathematicians, and American inventors.</p>

      <p>大多数族长在社交或智力方面都没有什么共同点，但在某些方面他们非常相似。他们非常聪明并不奇怪，但不同寻常的是，他们似乎都专注于自己头脑的力量。为了纯粹的智力冒险，许多聪明人追寻星空的秘密、生命的奥秘、利用知识实现实际目标的无数方法。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">但软件祖先寻求创造的是放大他们自己大脑力量的工具——机器来接管他们认为是思维中更机械的方面。</font></p><p>Most of the patriarchs had little in common with each other, socially or intellectually, but in some ways they were very much alike.

      <p>尽管外表千差万别，一百年前的计算机元老和二战时期的控制论专家似乎至少有一个共同点，而且与近代的软件先驱和信息航海家也存在共同点。近年来，公众越来越意识到一种亚文化，这种亚文化在剑桥和帕洛阿尔托萌芽，并在过去二十年里通过全国性的荧光灯校园计算机中心网络悄然传播开来——这些亚文化大多年轻、男性居多，往往才华横溢，有时甚至有些怪异，他们自认是强迫性程序员。20 世纪 80 年代的社会学家和心理学家才刚刚开始推测这种痴迷的深层动机，但<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">任何后来的黑客都会承认，他自己生活中最迷人的东西就是他自己的思想，并告诉你，他认为与计算机程序进行长时间的密切互动是一种特别令人满意的与自己思想的对话。</font></p><p>Despite their outward diversity, the computer patriarchs of a hundred years ago and the cyberneticians if the World War II era appear to have shared at least one characteristic with each other and with software pioneers and infonauts of more recent vintage.

      <p>计算的历史从元老到先驱者的发展过程变得越来越复杂。一开始，许多最早的计算机科学家并不知道他们的想法最终会变成某种机器。他们几乎都是孤立地工作。由于彼此孤立，现代计算机的共同智力祖先在回顾时相对容易辨别。但自 20 世纪 50 年代以来，随着学术、工业和军事机构中研究人员和研究团队的激增，历史的分支变得错综复杂，难以详尽描述。自<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">20 世纪 50 年代以来，将计算机突破的功劳归于个人发明者变得越来越困难。</font></p><p>The history of computation became increasingly complex as it progressed from the patriarchs to the pioneers. At the beginning, many of the earliest computer scientists didn't know that their ideas would end up in a kind of machine. Almost all of them worked in isolation. Because of their isolation from one another, the common intellectual ancestors of the modern computer are relatively easy to discern in retrospect. But since the 1950s, with the proliferation of researchers and teams of researchers in academic, industrial, and military institutions, the branches of the history have become tangled and too numerous to describe exhaustively. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Since the 1950s, it has become increasingly difficult to assign credit for computer breakthroughs to individual inventors.</font></p>

      </font></font><p>巴贝奇的其中一本传记名为<i>《易怒的天才》。</i>从他计划实现的目标和他实现的目标来看，他确实是一个天才。他的易怒是出了名的。巴贝奇是一个地地道道的英国人，固执而古怪，坚定而有远见，有时头脑混乱，而且非常富有，直到他把自己的财富投入到制造计算引擎的梦想中。</p><p>One of Babbage's biographies is entitled <i>Irascible Genius.</i>. He was indeed a genius, to judge by what he planned to achieve as well as what he did achieve. His irascibility was notorious. Babbage was thoroughly British, stubbornly eccentric, tenaciously visionary, sometimes scatterbrained, and quite wealthy until he sank his fortune into his dream of building a calculating engine.</p>

      <p>巴贝奇发明了排障器——蒸汽机车前部的金属装置，用于扫除走失的牛群。他还发明了一种分析整个行业的方法，一种研究复杂系统的方法，一百年后成为<i>运筹学</i>领域的基础。当他将这种新的分析方法应用于印刷业研究时，他的出版商非常生气，拒绝再接受他的任何书籍。</p><p>Babbage invented the cowcatcher--that metal device on the front of steam locomotives that sweeps errant cattle out of the way. He also devised a means of analyzing entire industries, a method for studying complex systems that became the foundation of the field of <i>operational research</i> a hundred years later. When he applied his new method of analysis to a study of the printing trade, his publishers were so offended that they refused to accept any more of his books.</p>

      <p>他毫不气馁，将自己的新方法应用于当时的邮政系统的分析，并证明接收邮件并根据邮件的运输距离为其分配价值的成本远高于运输成本。英国邮政局通过收取与每件邮件的运输距离无关的统一费率，立即提高了其能力并节省了成本——这种“便士邮政”至今仍在世界各地使用。</p><p>Undaunted, he applied his new method to the analysis of the postal system of his day, and proved that the cost of accepting and assigning a value to every piece of mail according to the distance it had to travel was far more expensive than the cost of transporting it. The British Post Office boosted its capabilities instantly and economically by charging a flat rate, independent of the distance each piece had to travel--the "penny post" that persists around the world to this day.</p>

      <p>巴贝奇发明了第一台铁路测速仪，并发表了第一篇综合性的保险精算理论论文（从而帮助创立了保险业）。他发明并破解了密码，还制作了“无法破解的锁”的万能钥匙——他对密码分析的兴趣与后来的计算机制造者相同。他是第一个提出可以通过观察树木年轮的周期来了解过去年份的天气的人。他对一些荒诞的想法充满热情，而历史后来证明这些想法不过是荒诞的想法而已。</p><p>Babbage devised the first speedometer for railroads, and he published the first comprehensive treatise on actuarial theory (thus helping to create the insurance industry). He invented and solved ciphers and made skeleton keys for "unpickable locks"--an interest in cryptanalysis that he shared with later computer builders. He was the first to propose that the weather of past years could be discovered by observing cycles of tree rings. And he was passionate about more than a few crackpot ideas that history has since proved to be nothing more than crackpot ideas.</p>

      <p>从巴贝奇一生参与的众多公开争执可以看出，他的人际关系和他的智力冒险一样不稳定。除了与皇家学会的持续斗争之外，巴贝奇还与街头音乐家进行了长期的辩论。巴贝奇会写信给编辑们，抱怨街头噪音，伦敦一半的街头音乐家在喝醉后都会在巴贝奇的窗下唱小夜曲。一位传记作家 BV Bowden 指出：“这个人的悲剧在于，尽管他的想象力和视野无限，但他的判断力却与之不相称，他的急躁使他无法容忍那些不支持他的项目的人。”<a href="#OEBPS/Text/footnotes.b1" id="OEBPS/Text/2.html.tex2html19"></a></p><p>His human relationships were as erratic as his intellectual adventures, to judge from the number of lifelong public feuds Babbage was known to have engaged in. Along with his running battles with the Royal Societies, Babbage carried on a long polemic against organ-grinders and street musicians. Babbage would write letters to editors about street noise, and half the organ-grinders in London took to serenading under Babbage's window when they were in their cups. One biographer, B. V. Bowden, noted that "It was the tragedy of the man that, although his imagination and vision were unbounded, his judgment by no means matched them, and his impatience made him intolerant of those who failed to sympathize with his projects." <a href="#OEBPS/Text/footnotes.b1"></a></p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">巴贝奇涉猎了六门科学，并随身携带了便携式实验室。</font>他还是个极端的吹毛求疵者，目光敏锐，脾气暴躁，他曾给数学表的出版商写过愤怒的信，指责他们在他自己计算时发现了一些模糊的错误。毕竟，航海表中的错误对海员来说是生死攸关的问题。对数表中的错误可能会严重阻碍像他这样的伟大人物的工作。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Babbage dabbled in half a dozen sciences and traveled with a portable laboratory.</font> He was also a supreme nit-picker, sharp-eyed and cranky, known to write outraged letters to publishers of mathematical tables, upbraiding them for obscure inaccuracies he had uncovered in the pursuit of his own calculations. A mistake in navigational table, after all, was a matter of life and death for a seafarer. And a mistake in a table of logarithms could seriously impede the work of a great mind such as his own.</p>

      <p>他的吹毛求疵间接导致巴贝奇发明了当今计算机的祖先。作为一名享有盛誉的数学家和天文学家，他讨厌花时间研究对数表，剔除所有他知道的错误，这些错误都是“康沃尔郡的年长牧师们造成的，他们靠七位数的对数生活，手工完成所有工作，而且很容易犯错误。”</p><p>His nit-picking indirectly led Babbage to invent the ancestor of today's computers. As a mathematician and astronomer of no small repute, he resented the time he had to spend poring over logarithm tables, culling all the errors he knew were being perpetuated upon him by "elderly Cornish Clergymen, who lived on seven figure logarithms, did all their work by hand, and were only too apt to make mistakes."</p>

      <p>巴贝奇留下了一本名为<i>《哲学家生平》的</i>古怪回忆录——计算机先驱赫尔曼·戈德斯坦将这本书描述为“一系列论文，从崇高到荒谬，从深奥到荒谬，从低俗到无稽之谈。事实上，巴贝奇的大部分职业生涯都是这样的。当他的行为如此古怪时，他竟然有这么多好朋友，真是令人惊讶。”</p><p>Babbage left a cranky memoir entitled <i>Passages from the Life of a Philosopher</i>--a work described by computer pioneer Herman Goldstine as "a set of papers ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous, from profundities to nonsense in plain bad taste. Indeed much of Babbage's career is of this sort. It is a wonder that he had as many good and loyal friends when his behavior was so peculiar."</p>

      <p>在<i>《段落》</i>中，巴贝奇这样描述他设计计算机的最初灵感：</p><p>In <i>Passages</i>, Babbage noted this about the original inspiration for his computing machines:</p>

      
        <p><font size="-1">我自己脑海中最早出现的用机器计算算术表的想法是这样产生的：一天晚上，我坐在剑桥分析学会的房间里，头向前靠在桌子上，心情有些恍惚，面前摊开着一张对数表。另一个成员走进房间，看到我半睡半醒，就喊道：“嗯，巴贝奇，你在梦到什么？”我回答道：“我在想，所有这些表格（指着对数）都可以用机器计算。”</font></p><p><font size="-1">The earliest idea that I can trace in my own mind of calculating arithmetical tables by machinery rose in this manner: One evening I was sitting in the rooms of the Analytical society at Cambridge, my head leaning forward on the table in a kind of dreamy mood, with a Table of logarithms lying open before me. Another member, coming into the room, and seeing me half asleep, called out, "Well, Babbage, what are you dreaming about?" To which I replied, "I am thinking that all these Tables (pointing to the logarithms) might be calculated by machinery."</font></p>
      

      <p>1822 年，巴贝奇在皇家天文学会上成功演示了一台小型机器的工作模型，该模型由齿轮、轮子和轴组成。该装置能够通过计算数字集之间的连续差来执行多项式方程。他因演示论文而获得了该学会的第一枚金牌。</p><p>In 1822, Babbage triumphantly demonstrated at the Royal Astronomical Society a small working model of a machine, consisting of cogs and wheels and shafts. The device was capable of performing polynomial equations by calculating successive differences between sets of numbers. He was awarded the society's first gold medal for the paper that accompanied the presentation.</p>

      <p>在那篇论文中，巴贝奇描述了他更为雄心勃勃的“差分机”计划。1823 年，英国政府首次授予他多项资助，这些资助在之后的几年中断断续续地持续发放，并引发了争议。巴贝奇聘请了一位机械师傅，在他的庄园里开了一家商店，并开始亲身体验他的梦想远远领先于那个时代的技术能力。</p><p>In that paper, Babbage described his plans for a much more ambitious "Difference Engine." In 1823, the British government awarded him the first of many grants that were to continue sporadically and controversially for years to come. Babbage hired a master machinist, set up shop on his estate, and began to learn at first hand how far ahead of his epoch's technological capabilities his dreams were running.</p>

      <p>英国政府委托制造的差分机比皇家天文学会展示的模型要大得多，也复杂得多。但当时的工具制造技术还达不到巴贝奇设计所要求的精度水平。工作持续了数年，却没有成功。事业开始时的胜利演示似乎就是巴贝奇职业生涯的巅峰，随后便是顽固而漫长的衰落。英国政府最终放弃了对该计划的资助。</p><p>The Difference Engine commissioned by the British government was quite a bit larger and more complex than the model demonstrated before the Royal Astronomical Society. But the toolmaking art of the time was not yet up to the level of precision demanded by Babbage's design. Work continued for years, unsuccessfully. The triumphal demonstration at the beginning of his enterprise looked as if it had been the high point of Babbage's career, followed by stubborn and prolonged decline. The British government finally gave up financing the scheme.</p>

      <p>巴贝奇从来不会因为自己珍视的理念而与不信者发生冲突，他曾与政府和同时代人就差分机问题发生争执，其中许多人开始嘲笑老疯子查理·巴贝奇。当他努力证明他们都错了时，他又想出了一个更雄心勃勃的发明。巴贝奇已经深陷于一个富有远见的开发项目中，他开始构思另一个项目。1833 年，他想出了一个比他多年来花费巨资却未能制造出来的设备复杂得多的东西。</p><p>Babbage, never one to shy away from conflict with unbelievers over one of his cherished ideas, feuded over the Difference Engine with the government and with his contemporaries, many of whom began to make sport of mad old Charley Babbage. While he was struggling to prove them all wrong, he conceived an idea for an even more ambitious invention. Babbage, already ridiculously deep in one visionary development project, began to dream up another one. In 1833 he came up with something far more complex than the device he had failed to build in years of expensive effort.</p>

      <p>巴贝奇推测，如果能制造一台机器来执行一种计算，那么是否能制造一台能执行<i>任何</i>计算的机器呢？与其制造许多台小型机器来执行不同类型的计算，是否能通过改变各部件相互作用的顺序，让<i>一台</i>大型机器的各部件在不同时间执行不同的任务呢？</p><p>If one could construct a machine for performing one kind of calculation, Babbage reasoned, would it be possible to construct a machine capable of performing <i>any</i> kind of calculation? Instead of building many small machines to perform different kinds of calculation, would it be possible to make the parts of <i>one</i> large machine perform different tasks at different times, by changing the order in which the parts interact?</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">巴贝奇偶然想到了通用计算机的想法，</font>这个想法在 20 世纪 30 年代产生了重大影响，当时艾伦·图灵——另一位才华横溢、性格古怪、可悲地超越时代的英国数学家——再次考虑了这个想法。巴贝奇将他假想的计算器大师称为“分析引擎”。通过使用不同的“动作模式”重新配置零件在每次计算中的移动顺序，相同的内部零件将用于执行不同的计算。他们制定了一份详细的计划，然后重新绘制，又重新绘制。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Babbage had stumbled upon the idea of a universal calculating machine,</font> an idea that was to have momentous consequences when Alan Turing--another brilliant, eccentric British mathematician who was tragically ahead of his time--considered it again in the 1930s. Babbage called his hypothetical master calculator the "Analytical Engine." The same internal parts were to be made to perform different calculations, through the use of different "patterns of action" to reconfigure the order in which the parts were to move for each calculation. A detailed plan was made, and redrawn, and redrawn once again.</p>

      <p>中央单元是“mill”，这是一种能够将数字相加到精确到小数点后 50 位的计算引擎，其速度和可靠性足以让康沃尔牧师的计算器无可匹敌。巴贝奇称之为“store”的存储单元最多可以存储一千个不同的 50 位数字以供日后参考。为了显示结果，巴贝奇设计了第一台自动排字机。</p><p>The central unit was the "mill," a calculating engine capable of adding numbers to an accuracy of 50 decimal places, with speed and reliability guaranteed to lay the Cornish clergymen calculators to rest. Up to one thousand different 50-digit numbers could be stored for later reference in the memory unit Babbage called the "store." To display the result, Babbage designed the first automated typesetter.</p>

      <p>数字可以从工厂输入，也可以从 Babbage 从法国织布机改造而来的穿孔卡片输入系统中输入。此外，卡片还可用于将数字输入工厂，并指定要对数字执行的计算。通过正确使用卡片，可以指示工厂将结果暂时存放在存储器中，然后将存储的数字返回工厂以供后续程序使用。分析引擎的最后一个组件是卡片读取设备，它实际上是一个控制和决策单元。</p><p>Numbers could be put into the store from the mill or from the punched-card input system Babbage adapted from French weaving machines. In addition, cards could be used to enter numbers into the mill and specify the calculations to be performed on the numbers as well. By using the cards properly, the mill could be instructed to temporarily place the results in the store, then return the stored numbers to the mill for later procedures. The final component of the Analytical Engine was a card-reading device that was, in effect, a control and decision-making unit.</p>

      <p>巴贝奇的儿子最终建造了一个工作模型。巴贝奇本人在世时从未见过分析机。在他生命的最后阶段，一位访客发现，巴贝奇几乎把他那座大房子里的所有房间都堆满了他废弃的分析机模型。一旦发现有一种构建设备的方法可能真的可行，巴贝奇就想到了一种新的更好的方法。</p><p>A working model was eventually built by Babbage's son. Babbage himself never lived to see the Analytical Engine. Toward the end of his life, a visitor found that Babbage had filled nearly all the rooms of his large house with abandoned models of his engine. As soon as it looked as if one means of constructing his device might actually work--Babbage thought of a new and better way of doing it.</p>

      <p>分析机的四个组件的功能与现代计算机中的类似单元非常相似。铣床是数字计算机中央处理器的模拟，而存储器是存储设备。二十世纪的程序员会将打印机视为标准输出设备。然而，正是输入设备和控制单元使得超越计算走向真正的计算成为可能。</p><p>The four subassemblies of the Analytical Engine functioned very much like analogous units in modern computing machinery. The mill was the analog of the central processing unit of a digital computer and the store was the memory device. Twentieth-century programmers would recognize the printer as a standard output device. It was the input device and the control unit, however, that made it possible to move beyond calculation toward true computation.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">分析机的输入部分是编程历史上的一个重要里程碑。</font>巴贝奇从法国发明家雅卡尔那里借用了打孔卡编程的理念，雅卡尔发明了一种在布料上编织图案的机械方法，引发了纺织业的一场革命。织布机使用金属棒阵列自动将线拉到位。为了制作图案，雅卡尔的装置在金属棒和线之间插入了一张硬卡片，卡片上打有孔。卡片的设计目的是在每次穿过时阻止一些金属棒接触线；卡片上的孔只允许某些金属棒将线带入织机。每次抛出梭子时，金属棒的路径上都会出现一张新卡片。因此，一旦将特定编织图案的方向转换成打孔卡片的图案，并将卡片按正确顺序排列以呈现给读卡器，就可以预先编程布料图案，整个编织过程就可以自动化。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The input portion of the Analytical Engine was an important milestone in the history of programming.</font> Babbage borrowed the idea of punched-card programming from the French inventor Jacquard, who had triggered a revolution on the textile industry by inventing a mechanical method of weaving patterns in cloth. The weaving machines used arrays of metal rods to automatically pull threads into position. To create patterns, Jacquard's device interposed a stiff card, with holes punched in it, between the rods and the threads. The card was designed to block some of the rods from reaching the thread on each pass; the holes in the card allowed only certain rods to carry threads into the loom. Each time the shuttle was thrown, a new card would appear in the path of the rods. Thus, once the directions for specific woven patterns were translated into patterns of holes punched into cards, and the cards were arranged in the proper order to present to the card reading device, the cloth patterns could be preprogrammed and the entire weaving process could be automated.</p>

      <p>这些卡片让巴贝奇认为是实现自动计算的关键。这是一种控制那些令人沮丧的抽象“行为模式”的切实可行的方法：巴贝奇将复杂计算的分步说明放入打在卡片上的一系列编码孔中，这些孔会改变机器在每个步骤中的工作方式。以正确的方式排列正确编码的卡片，你就取代了一排康沃尔郡的老年绅士。更换卡片，你就取代了一整支军队。</p><p>These cards struck Babbage as the key to automated calculation. Here was a tangible means of controlling those frustratingly abstract "patterns of action": Babbage put the step-by-step instructions for complicated calculations into a coded series of holes punched into the sets of cards that would change the way the mill worked at each step. Arrange the correctly coded cards in the right way, and you've replaced a platoon of elderly Cornish gentlemen. Change the cards, and you replace an entire army of them.</p>

      <p>在巴贝奇努力制造他想象中的设备，但不知何故从未用木头和黄铜制成时，巴贝奇遇到了一位女士，她后来成为他的同伴、同事、同谋和辩护人。她立刻明白了巴贝奇打算用他的分析机做什么，并帮助他为它构建软件。她与巴贝奇的合作以及她撰写的关于引擎可能性的论文使洛夫莱斯伯爵夫人奥古斯塔·艾达·拜伦成为编程艺术和科学的守护神，甚至是创始人。</p><p>During his crusade to build the devices that he saw in his mind's eye but was somehow never able to materialize in wood and brass, Babbage met a woman who was to become his companion, colleague, conspirator, and defender. She saw immediately what Babbage intended to do with his Analytical Engine, and she helped him construct the software for it. Her work with Babbage and the essays she wrote about the possibilities of the engine established Augusta Ada Byron, Countess of Lovelace, as a patron saint if not a founding parent of the art and science of programming.</p>

      <p>艾达的父亲正是<a href="http://library.utoronto.ca/www/utel/rp/authors/byron.html">拜伦勋爵</a>，他那个时代最出名的人物。他与艾达母亲的分离是那个时代报道最广的家庭事件之一，艾达在一个月大之后就再也没有见过她的父亲。拜伦在他的一些诗歌中写下了关于艾达的凄美段落，她要求被葬在他旁边——可能是为了报复比她活得更久的母亲。艾达的母亲被传记作者描绘成一个虚荣而傲慢的维多利亚时代人物，她认为每天服用一剂含鸦片酊的“补药”可以完美治愈她美丽、直言不讳的女儿不守规矩的行为，因此强迫她上瘾！</p><p>Ada's father was none other than <a href="http://library.utoronto.ca/www/utel/rp/authors/byron.html">Lord Byron</a>, the most scandalous character of his day. His separation from Ada's mother was one of the most widely reported domestic episodes of the era, and Ada never saw her father after she was one month old. Byron wrote poignant passages about Ada in some of his poetry, and she asked to be buried next to him--probably to spite her mother, who outlived her. Ada's mother, portrayed by biographers as a vain and overbearing Victorian figure, thought a daily dose of a laudanum-laced "tonic" would be the perfect cure for her beautiful, outspoken daughter's nonconforming behavior, and thus forced an addiction on her!</p>

      <p>艾达从小就展现了数学天赋。她家最亲密的朋友之一是英国著名逻辑学家<a href="http://www.shu.edu/projects/reals/history/demorgan.html">奥古斯都·德·摩根</a>。她受过良好的教育，但似乎总是渴望获得比老师所能提供的更多的知识。艾达积极寻找完美的导师，她认为她找到了与她母亲同时代的查尔斯·巴贝奇。</p><p>Ada exhibited her mathematical talents early in life. One of her family's closest friends was <a href="http://www.shu.edu/projects/reals/history/demorgan.html">Augustus De Morgan</a>, the famous British Logician. She was well tutored, but always seemed to thirst for more knowledge than her tutors could provide. Ada actively sought the perfect mentor, whom she thought she found in a contemporary of her mother's--Charles Babbage.</p>

      <p>德·摩根夫人亲眼见证了这一历史性时刻，当时年轻的艾达·拜伦第一次看到了差分机的工作模型，当时巴贝奇正在为拜伦夫人的朋友们进行演示。在回忆录中，德·摩根夫人回忆了这台机器对奥古斯塔·艾达的影响：“当其他人注视着这个美丽的发明时，他们的表情和感觉就像一些野蛮人第一次看到镜子或听到枪声时一样，而拜伦小姐虽然还很年轻，却理解了它的工作原理，看到了这项发明的伟大之美。”</p><p>Mrs. De Morgan was present at the historic occasion when the young Ada Byron was first shown a working model of the Difference Engine, during a demonstration Babbage held for Lady Byron's friends. In her memoirs, Mrs. De Morgan remembered the effect the contraption had on Augusta Ada: "While the rest of the party gazed at this beautiful invention with the same sort of expression and feeling that some savages are said to have shown on first seeing a looking glass or hearing a gun, Miss Byron, young as she was, understood its working and saw the great beauty of the invention."</p>

      <p>工业革命期间，这种在客厅里展示机械装置的活动在英国上流社会十分流行。当她的长辈们窃笑、议论纷纷，无法理解这台计算器和他们在其他演示中看到的各种水泵之间的区别时，年轻的艾达开始熟练地拨弄和探索这台机器的各个部件，从而成为第一位计算机神童。</p><p>Such parlor demonstrations of mechanical devices were in vogue among the British upper classes during the Industrial Revolution. While her elders tittered and gossiped and failed to understand the difference between this calculator and the various water pumps they had observed at other demonstrations, young Ada began to knowledgeably poke and probe various parts of the mechanism, thus becoming the first computer whiz kid.</p>

      <p>艾达是少数几个认识到差分机是一种与过去的机械计算器完全不同的设备的人之一。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">以前的设备是<i>模拟的</i>（通过<i>测量</i>进行计算），而巴贝奇的设计是<i>数字的</i>（通过<i>计数</i>进行计算）。</font>更重要的是，巴贝奇的设计结合了算术和逻辑功能。（巴贝奇最终发现了德·摩根的朋友乔治·布尔关于“逻辑代数”的新成果——但那时对艾达来说已经太晚了。）</p><p>Ada was one of the few to recognize that the Difference Engine was altogether a different sort of device than the mechanical calculators of the past. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Whereas previous devices were <i>analog</i> (performing calculation by means of <i>measurement</i>), Babbage's was <i>digital</i> (performing calculation by means of <i>counting</i>).</font> More importantly, Babbage's design combined arithmetic and logical functions. (Babbage eventually discovered the new work on the "algebra of Logic" by De Morgan's friend George Boole--but, by then, it was too late for Ada.)</p>

      <p>艾达曾师从当时最杰出的逻辑学家德·摩根，她对这种装置的应用潜力有着自己的想法。巴贝奇本人曾评论艾达在这种新型半数学半逻辑练习方面的天赋：“她似乎比我更了解它，而且解释起来也好得多。”</p><p>Ada, who had been tutored by De Morgan, the foremost logician of his time, had ideas of her own about the possibilities of what one might do with such devices. Of Ada's gift for this new type of partially mathematical, partially logical exercise, Babbage himself noted: "She seems to understand it better than I do, and is far, far better at explaining it."</p>

      <p>19 岁时，艾达嫁给了洛夫莱斯男爵金勋爵。她的丈夫也是一位数学家，尽管他的才能远不如妻子。年轻的洛夫莱斯伯爵夫人继续与巴贝奇在数学和计算方面合作，坚定地支持她认为可行的想法，而当时缺乏远见的英国权威人士认为巴贝奇是个怪人。</p><p>At the age of nineteen, Ada married Lord King, Baron of Lovelace. Her husband was also something of a mathematician, although his talents were far inferior to those of his wife. The young countess Lovelace continued her mathematical and computational partnership with Babbage, resolutely supporting what she knew to be a solid idea, at a time when less-foresighted members of the British establishment dismissed Babbage as a crank.</p>

      <p>1840 年，巴贝奇游历欧洲大陆，就他从未成功制造的装置发表演讲。在意大利，一位名叫梅纳布雷亚的伯爵在一次演讲中做了大量笔记，并在巴黎出版。艾达将笔记从法语翻译成英语，并撰写了一份附录，其篇幅是她翻译文本的两倍多。当巴贝奇阅读这些材料时，他敦促艾达将她的笔记全部出版。</p><p>Babbage toured the Continent in 1840, lecturing on the subject of the device he never succeeded in building. In Italy, a certain Count Menabrea in Italy took extensive notes at one of the lectures and published them in Paris. Ada translated the notes from French to English and composed an addendum which was more than twice as long as the text she had translated. When Babbage read the material, he urged Ada to publish her notes in their entirety.</p>

      <p>洛夫莱斯夫人发表的笔记至今仍能理解，对程序员来说尤其有意义，他们可以看到分析工程师确实远远领先于他们的同时代人。BH Newman 教授在《<i>数学公报》</i>上写道，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">她的观察“表明她比当时的时代早一个世纪就完全理解了编程计算机的原理。”</font></p><p>Lady Lovelace's published notes are still understandable today and are particularly meaningful to programmers, who can see how truly far ahead of their contemporaries were the Analytical Engineers. Professor B. H. Newman in the <i>Mathematical Gazette</i> has written that <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">her observations "show her to have fully understood the principles of a programmed computer a century before its time."</font></p>

      <p>艾达对用来向巴贝奇的设备输入数据和方程式的穿孔纸板卡片的数学含义特别感兴趣。艾达的论文题为《对巴贝奇先生的分析机的观察》，其中包含了不止一段预言性的段落，她的大多数同时代人都没有注意到，但随着一个世纪的流逝，这些段落的重要性日益增加：</p><p>Ada was especially intrigued by the mathematical implications of the punched pasteboard cards that were to be used to feed data and equations to Babbage's devices. Ada's Essay, entitled "Observations on Mr. Babbage's Analytical Engine," includes more than one prophetic passage, unheeded by most of her contemporaries, but which have grown in significance with the passage of a century:</p>

      
        <p><font size="-1">分析机的显著特点，以及使机器具有如此广泛的功能，使它成为代数的强大助手的原因，是它引入了雅卡尔发明的原理，该原理通过穿孔卡片来调节织锦织物制造中最复杂的图案。这两台机器的区别就在于此。差分机中不存在这种东西。我们可以最恰当地说，分析机<i>编织代数图案</i>就像雅卡尔织机编织花朵和叶子一样。……</font></p><p><font size="-1">The distinctive characteristic of the Analytical Engine, and that which has rendered it possible to endow mechanism with such extensive faculties as bid fair to make this engine the extensive right hand of algebra, is the introduction into it of the principle which Jacquard devised for regulating, by means of punched cards, the most complicated patters in the fabrication of brocaded stuffs. It is in this that the distinction between the two engines lies. Nothing of the sort exists in the Difference Engine. We may say most aptly that the Analytical Engine <i>weaves algebraical patterns</i> just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves. . . .</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1"><i>然而，当使用纸牌的思想出现时，算术</i>的界限就被超越了；分析机与单纯的“计算机器”并不相同。它占据着完全属于自己的地位；它所提出的考虑在本质上是最有趣的。在使机制能够将<i>一般</i>符号以无限种类和范围的连续方式组合在一起时，物质的运作和数学科学<i>最抽象</i>分支的抽象心理过程之间建立了统一的联系。一种新的、广泛的和强大的语言被开发出来，供将来用于分析，在其中运用它的真理，以便这些真理能够比我们迄今为止掌握的手段更迅速、更准确地应用于人类的目的。因此，不仅精神和物质，而且数学世界中的理论和实践都紧密联系在一起。我们不知道是否有记录表明，迄今为止有任何具有<i>分析</i>机性质的东西被提出或甚至被认为是一种实际可能性，就像思考或推理机器的概念一样。</font></p><p><font size="-1">The bounds of <i>arithmetic</i> were, however, outstepped the moment the idea of applying cards had occurred; and the Analytical Engine does not occupy common ground with mere "calculating machines." It holds a position wholly its own; and the considerations it suggests are most interesting in their nature. In enabling mechanism to combine together <i>general</i> symbols, in successions of unlimited variety and extent, a uniting link is established between the operations of matter and the abstract mental processes of the <i>most abstract</i> branch of mathematical science. A new, a vast and a powerful language is developed for the future use of analysis, in which to wield its truths so that these may become of more speedy and accurate practical application for the purposes of mankind than the means hitherto in our possession have rendered possible. Thus not only the mental and the material, but the theoretical and the practical in the mathematical world, are brought into intimate connexion with each other. We are not aware of its being on record that anything partaking of the nature of what is so well designated the <i>Analytical</i> Engine has been hitherto proposed, or even thought of, as a practical possibility, any more than the idea of a thinking or a reasoning machine.</font></p>
      

      <p>作为一名数学家，艾达对自动化繁琐计算的可能性感到兴奋。但她对这些设备编程背后的原理更感兴趣。如果她不是那么年轻就去世了，艾达有可能将 19 世纪的先进技术推进到真正的计算的门槛。</p><p>As a Mathematician, Ada was excited about the possibility of automating laborious calculations. But she was far more interested in the principles underlying the programming of these devices. Had she not died so young, it is possible that Ada could have advanced the nineteenth-century state of the art to the threshold of true computation.</p>

      <p>尽管引擎尚未建成，但艾达还是尝试编写指令序列。她注意到这种新艺术中几个特殊技巧的价值，这些技巧对于现代计算机语言来说仍然是必不可少的——<i>子程序、循环</i>和<i>跳转</i>。如果你的目标是用子计算来编织一个复杂的计算，其中一些计算可能会重复多次，那么一遍又一遍地重写十几个或一百个指令的序列是很乏味的。为什么不把经常使用的计算或子程序的副本存储在程序“库”中以供以后使用呢？这样，当你的计算需要时，你的程序就可以自动从库中“调用”子程序。这种子程序库现在几乎是每种高级编程语言的一部分。</p><p>Even thought the Engine was yet to be built, Ada experimented with writing sequences of instructions. She noted the value of several particular tricks in this new art, tricks that are still essential to modern computer languages--<i>subroutines, loops</i> and <i>jumps</i>. If your object is to weave a complex calculation out of subcalculations, some of which may be repeated many times, it is tedious to rewrite a sequence of a dozen or a hundred instructions over and over, Why not just store copies of often-used calculations, or subroutines, in a "library" of procedures for later use? Then your program can "call" for the subroutine from the library automatically, when your calculation requires it. Such libraries of subprocedures are now a part of virtually every high-level programming language.</p>

      <p>分析引擎和数字计算机非常擅长反复、快速地执行任务。通过发明一种指令，将读卡设备备份到指定的前一张卡，以便可以多次执行指令序列，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Ada 创造了循环——也许是所有当代编程语言中最基本的程序。</font></p><p>Analytical Engines and digital computers are very good at doing things over and over many times, very quickly. By inventing an instruction that backs up the card-reading device to a specified previous card, so that the sequence of instructions can be executed a number of times, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Ada created the loop--perhaps the most fundamental procedure in every contemporary programming language.</font></p>

      <p>正是条件跳转让艾达的逻辑天赋得以充分发挥。她想出了另一条操纵读卡器的指令，但这条指令不是回退和重复一串卡片，而是允许读卡器在满足特定<font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>条件的情况下</i></font>跳转到序列中任何部分的另一张卡片。在以前纯粹算术的操作列表中添加了这个小小的“如果”，意味着程序可以做的不仅仅是计算。以一种原始但可能有意义的方式，引擎现在可以做出<i>决策了</i>。</p><p>It was the conditional jump that brought Ada's gifts as a logician into play. She came up with yet another instruction for manipulating the card-reader, but instead of backing up and repeating a sequence of cards, this instruction enabled the card-reader to jump to another card in any part of the sequence, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>if</i></font> a specific condition was satisfied. The addition of that little "if" to the formerly purely arithmetic list of operations meant that the program could do more than calculate. In a primitive but potentially meaningful way, the Engine could now make <i>decisions</i>.</p>

      <p>她还指出，未来机器的能力可能会远远超过维多利亚时代的技术，并推测这种机器是否能够实现智能。她在《观察》中提出了反对人工智能的论点，近一个世纪后，另一位软件先知艾伦·图灵将她的论点永垂不朽，图灵将她的论点称为“洛夫莱斯夫人的反对意见”。在关于机器智能的辩论中，这种观点仍然经常听到：“分析引擎，”艾达写道，“没有任何创造任何东西的企图。它可以做任何我们知道的命令它做的事情。”</p><p>She also noted that machines might someday be built with capabilities far beyond those possible with Victorian era technology, and speculated about the possibility of whether such machines could ever achieve intelligence. Her argument against artificial intelligence, set forth in her "Observations," was immortalized almost a century later by another software prophet, Alan Turing, who dubbed her line of argument "Lady Lovelace's Objection." It is an opinion that is still frequently heard in debates about machine intelligence: "The Analytical Engine," Ada wrote, "has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform."</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">艾达是如何、何时开始涉足这种隐秘而又灾难性的赌博活动的，</font>目前尚不清楚。没有任何证据表明巴贝奇与艾达接触过这种终生不为人知的恶习。洛夫莱斯勋爵曾一度与艾达一样痴迷于赌博，但在遭受重大损失后，他便停止了赌博。艾达则继续偷偷摸摸地赌博。</p><p>It is not known how and when <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Ada became involved in her clandestine and disastrous gambling ventures.</font> No evidence has ever been produced that Babbage had anything to do with introducing Ada to what was to be her lifelong secret vice. For a time, Lord Lovelace shared Ada's obsession, but after incurring significant losses he stopped. She continued, clandestinely.</p>

      <p>巴贝奇在艾达生命的最后阶段深深地卷入了她的赌博。艾达则帮助巴贝奇筹措资金建造分析机。这是恶习、高智商冒险和怪异创业精神的奇妙结合。他们建造了一台井字游戏机，但当一位顾问向他们保证 P.T. 巴纳姆的汤姆将军已经占领了旅行新奇物品的市场时，他们放弃了将其作为赚钱的冒险。讽刺的是，尽管巴贝奇的游戏机在商业上失败了，但他的理论方法为未来的博弈论科学奠定了基础，甚至比 20 世纪的天才约翰·冯·诺依曼早了大约一百年。</p><p>Babbage became deeply involved in Ada's gambling toward the end of her life. For her part, Ada helped Babbage in more than one scheme to raise money to construct the Analytical Engine. It was a curious mixture of vice, high intellectual adventure, and bizarre entrepreneurship. They built a tic-tac-toe machine, but gave up on it as a moneymaking venture when an adviser assured them that P. T. Barnum's General Tom Thumb had sewn up the market for traveling novelties. Ironically, although Babbage's game-playing machines were commercial failures, his theoretical approach created a foundation for the future science of game theory, scooping even that twentieth-century genius John von Neumann by about a hundred years.</p>

      <p>查理和艾达试图开发一种万无一失的马匹投注系统，但最终却让艾达陷入了两度在丈夫不知情的情况下典当其祖传珠宝的可悲境地，以向敲诈勒索的赌徒支付赎金。艾达和巴贝奇从不拒绝疯狂的计划，他们曾一度使用差分机的现有小规模工作模型来执行复杂的让分方案所需的计算。这些计算基于让分理论的合理方法，但正如人工智能界一个多世纪后才了解到的那样，即使是最好的建模程序也难以处理真正复杂的系统。他们损失惨重。更糟糕的是，当损失加重时，艾达不得不向母亲借钱赎回洛夫莱斯珠宝，而她的母亲并不是最宽容的人，她借钱赎回珠宝，以免丈夫得知珠宝不见了。</p><p>It was Charley and Ada's attempt to develop an infallible system for betting on the ponies that brought Ada to the sorry pass of twice pawning her husband's family jewels, without his knowledge, to pay off blackmailing bookies. At one point, Ada and Babbage--never one to turn down a crazy scheme--used the existing small scale working model of the Difference Engine to perform the calculations required by their complex handicapping scheme. The calculations were based on sound approaches to the theory of handicapping, but as the artificial intelligentsia were to learn over a century later, even the best modeling programs have trouble handling truly complex systems. They lost big. To make matters worse, when she compounded her losses Ada had to turn to her mother, who was not the most forgiving soul, to borrow the money to redeem the Lovelace jewels before her husband could learn of their absence.</p>

      <p>艾达因癌症去世，享年 36 岁。巴贝奇比她多活了几十年，但没有艾达的建议、支持，有时甚至没有严厉的指导，他无法完成他梦寐以求的分析机。由于当时的工具制造工艺无法满足他的设计要求，巴贝奇率先在精密车床上使用金刚石工具。为了系统化分析机部件的生产，他设计了批量生产可互换零件的方法，并撰写了一篇关于后来被称为“批量生产”的经典论文。</p><p>Ada died of cancer at the age of thirty-six. Babbage outlived her by decades, but without Ada's advice, support, and sometimes stern guidance, he was not able to complete his long-dreamed-of Analytical Engine. Because the toolmaking art of his day was not up to the tolerance demanded by his designs, Babbage pioneered the use of diamond-tipped tools in precision-lathing. In order to systematize the production of components for his Engine, he devised methods to mass-manufacture interchangeable parts and wrote a classic treatise on what has since become known as "mass production."</p>

      <p>巴贝奇写过的书条理不一，他在某些科学领域取得了突破，但在其他领域却失败了，他举办过精彩而著名的晚宴，邀请过查尔斯·达尔文等嘉宾，但最终似乎变得非常痛苦。鲍登指出，“巴贝奇去世前不久，他告诉一位朋友，他记不起自己一生中哪一天是完全快乐的：‘他说话的语气好像他讨厌人类，尤其是英国人，最讨厌英国政府和街头手摇风琴演奏者。’”</p><p>Babbage wrote books of varying degrees of coherence, made breakthroughs in some sciences and failed in others, gave brilliant and renowned dinner parties with guests like Charles Darwin, and seems to have ended up totally embittered. Bowden noted that "Shortly before Babbage died he told a friend that he could not remember a single completely happy day in his life: 'He spoke as if he hated mankind in general, Englishmen in particular, and the English Government and Organ Grinders most of all.'"</p>

      <p>虽然自 20 世纪 50 年代以来，Ada Lovelace 就已为程序员圈内人士所熟知，当时打卡批处理与 Ada 的编程并无太大区别，但直到最近，她才在程序员圈外广为人知。20 世纪 70 年代，美国国防部正式以她的名字命名了其“超级语言”。</p><p>While Ada Lovelace has been unofficially known to the inner circles of programmers since the 1950s, when card-punched batch-processing was not altogether different from Ada's kind of programming, she has been relatively unknown outside those circles until recently. In the 1970s, the U.S. Department of defense officially named its "superlanguage" after her.</p>

    <font size="+3">乔治·布尔</font>

    <font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">
      虽然它来得太晚，无法帮助分析机的原始设计，但另一项后来对计算机构造至关重要的发现是由巴贝奇和洛夫莱斯的同时代人做出的。符号逻辑代数的创造是另一位数学天才和英国个人主义者的作品，但他工作和生活在另一个世界，远离伦敦上流社会的客厅。

      </font></font><p><a href="http://ogham.ucc.ie/gb.html">1832 年的一天，一位名叫乔治·布尔</a>的 17 岁英国人在穿过草地时突然获得了惊人的启示。这个想法来得如此突然，对他的生活产生了如此深远的影响，以至于布尔对一种此前从未被怀疑过的人类能力做出了开创性的、尽管晦涩难懂的推测，他称之为“潜意识”。然而，布尔对人类知识的贡献并不在心理学领域，而是在他自己发明的领域。正如伯特兰·罗素在七十年后所说，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">布尔发明了纯数学。</font></p><p>A seventeen-year-old Englishman by the name of <a href="http://ogham.ucc.ie/gb.html">George Boole</a> was struck by an astonishing revelation while walking across a meadow one day in 1832. The idea came so suddenly, and made such a deep impact on his life, that it led Boole to make pioneering if obscure speculations about a heretofore unsuspected human facility that he called "the unconscious." Boole's contribution to human knowledge was not to be in the field of psychology, however, but in a field of his own devising. As Bertrand Russell remarked seventy years later, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Boole invented pure mathematics.</font></p>

      <p>尽管刚开始学习数学，十几岁的乔治·布尔却突然发现了一种以代数形式捕捉人类理性力量的方法。当布尔的方程式应用于逻辑问题时，它们确实有效。但有一个问题，它不在布尔的概念中。当时，问题是没有人关心。部分原因是他来自错误的社会阶层，部分原因是他那个时代的大多数数学家对逻辑知之甚少，布尔最终阐明这一见解时并没有引起太大的轰动。在他死后，他的启示在很大程度上被几代人忽视了。</p><p>Although he had only recently begun to study mathematics, the teenage George Boole suddenly saw a way to capture some of the power of human reason in the form of an algebra. And Boole's equations actually worked when they were applied to logical problems. But there was a problem, and it wasn't in Boole's concept. The problem, at the time, was that nobody cared. Partly because he was from the wrong social class, and partly because most mathematicians of his time knew very little about logic, Boole's eventual articulation of this insight didn't cause much commotion when he published it. His revelation was largely ignored for generations after his death.</p>

      <p>一百年后，当计算机技术的不同部分意外地融合在一起时，电气工程师需要数学工具来理解他们发明的复杂机器。他们创建的开关网络是电路，其行为可以通过精确的方程式描述和预测。由于现在使用电脉冲模式来封装逻辑运算，例如“与”、“或”和最重要的“如果”，以及计算器的常用运算“加”、“减”、“乘”和“除”，因此需要方程式来描述计算机电路的逻辑特性。</p><p>When the different parts of computer technology converged unexpectedly a hundred years later, electrical engineers needed mathematical tools to make sense of the complicated machinery they were inventing. The networks of switches they created were electrical circuits whose behavior could be described and predicted by precise equations. Because patterns of electrical pulses were now used to enclose logical operations like "and," "or," and the all important "if," as well as the calculator's usual fare of "plus," "minus," "multiply," and "divide," there arose a need for equations to describe the logical properties of computer circuits.</p>

      <p>理想情况下，同一套数学工具可以同时用于电子和逻辑运算。20 世纪 30 年代末的问题是，没有人知道任何数学运算能够同时描述逻辑和电子网络。于是，正确的头脑在正确的地方寻找。麻省理工学院一位非常精明的研究生克劳德·香农 (Claude Shannon) 后来发明了信息理论，他发现布尔的代数正是工程师们所寻找的。</p><p>Ideally, the same set of mathematical tools would work for both electrical and logical operations. The problem of the late 1930s was that nobody knew of any mathematical operations that had the power to describe both logical and electrical networks. Then the right kind of mind looked in the right place. An exceptionably astute graduate student at MIT named Claude Shannon, who later invented information theory, found Boole's algebra to be exactly what the engineers were looking for.</p>

      <p>如果没有布尔，这位与艾达出生在同一年的贫困、自学成才的数学老师，逻辑与数学之间的关键联系可能永远无法实现。虽然分析机是一个鼓舞人心的尝试，但它对后来创造现代计算机的思想家影响甚微。然而，如果没有布尔代数，计算机技术可能永远不会发展到电子速度，从而实现真正有趣的计算。</p><p>Without Boole, a poverty-stricken, self-taught mathematics teacher who was born the same year as Ada, the critical link between logic and mathematics might never have been accomplished. While the Analytical Engine was an inspiring attempt, it had remarkably little effect on the later thinkers who created modern computers. Without Boolean algebra, however, however, computer technology might never have progressed to the electronic speeds where truly interesting computation becomes possible.</p>

      <p>布尔对他的愿景的重要性的看法是正确的，尽管他不知道如何处理真空管或开关电路。与巴贝奇不同，布尔不是工程师。布尔在那片草地上发现的东西，以及二十年后在纸上得出的结论，注定会成为将<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">软件的逻辑抽象与电子机器的物理操作结合起来的数学关键。</font></p><p>Boole was right about the importance of his vision, although he wouldn't have known what to do with a vacuum tube or a switching circuit if he saw one. Unlike Babbage, Boole was not an engineer. What Boole discovered in that meadow and worked out on paper two decades later was destined to become the <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">mathematical linchpin that coupled the logical abstractions of software with the physical operations of electronic machines.</font></p>

      <p>可以说，巴贝奇和布尔的灵感代表了两种<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">不同的动机</font>，正是这两种动机促使几个世纪以来富有想象力的人们尝试并最终成功制造出计算机。一方面是科学家和工程师，他们总是渴望有一种设备来为他们处理繁琐的计算，让他们的思想自由地去探究更有趣的问题。另一方面是数学思维更抽象的愿望，希望在一组符号中捕捉人类理性的本质。</p><p>Between them, Babbage's and Boole's inspirations can be said to characterize the <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">two different kinds of motivation</font> that caused imaginatives over the centuries to try and eventually to succeed in building a computer. On the one side are scientists and engineers, who would always yearn for a device to take care of tedious computations for them, freeing their thoughts for the pursuit of more interesting questions. On the other side is the more abstract desire of the mathematical mind to capture the essence of human reason in a set of symbols.</p>

      <p>艾达一看到巴贝奇的模型就立刻理解了它们，她的导师是德摩根，德摩根是世界上最了解布尔的人，她是第一个对能够执行逻辑和数字运算的机器的操作进行深入思考的人。布尔的著作直到洛夫莱斯夫人去世后才出版。如果艾达再活几年，她对编程原理的强大直觉理解就会通过使用布尔代数得到极大增强。</p><p>Ada, who immediately understood Babbage's models when she saw them, and who was tutored by De Morgan, the one man in the world best equipped to understand Boole, was the first person to speculate at any length about the operations of machines capable of performing logical as well as numerical operations. Boole's work was not published until after Lady Lovelace died. Had Ada lived but a few years longer, her powerful intuitive grasp of the principles of programming would have been immeasurably enhanced by the use of Boolean algebra.</p>

      <p>巴贝奇和洛夫莱斯是帝国鼎盛时期的英国贵族。尽管巴贝奇在某些方面因其经常在公众场合表现怪异而遭到嘲笑，但他还是把威灵顿公爵、查尔斯·狄更斯和阿尔伯特亲王视为朋友。艾达可以接触到最好的导师、最好的实验室设备和最新的书籍。如果他们愿意，他们俩都有闲暇发展自己的思想，并享有在皇家学会出丑的特权。</p><p>Babbage and Lovelace were British aristocrats during the height of the Empire. Despite the derision heaped on Babbage in some quarters for his often-peculiar public behavior, he counted the Duke of Wellington, Charles Dickens, and Prince Albert among his friends. Ada had access to the best tutors, the finest laboratory equipment, and the latest books. They were both granted the leisure to develop their ideas and the privilege of making fools of themselves of the Royal Society, if they desired.</p>

      <p>布尔的父亲是一名小店主，这对他来说并不是接受良好科学教育的最佳途径。16 岁时，由于家庭经济状况不佳，布尔不得不找了一份普通的学校教师工作。面对着向学生传授数学知识的任务，布尔开始学习数学，而此时他的自学能力已经完全可以与林肯媲美。他很快发现，对于他这样有条件的人来说，这是最经济有效的智力活动，不需要实验室设备，只需要少量的基础书籍。17 岁时，他获得了灵感，这为他后来的研究奠定了基础，但在他能够向世界展示他的发现之前，他还需要学习很多数学和逻辑方面的知识。</p><p>Boole was the son of a petty shopkeeper, which wasn't the best route to a good scientific education. At the age of sixteen, his family's precarious financial situation obliged Boole to secure modest employment as a schoolteacher. Faced with the task of teaching his students something about mathematics, and by now thoroughly Lincolnesque in his self-educating skills, Boole set out to learn mathematics. He soon learned that it was the most cost-effective intellectual endeavor for a man of his means, requiring no laboratory equipment and a fairly small number of basic books. At seventeen he experienced the inspiration that was to result in his later work, but he had much to learn about both mathematics and logic before he was capable of presenting his discovery to the world.</p>

      <p>二十岁时，他发现了当时最伟大的数学家所忽略的东西——代数不变性理论，它后来成为爱因斯坦在提出相对论时不可或缺的工具。 1849 年，在担任了多年的小学教师之后，布尔的数学著作使他被任命为<a href="http://www.ucc.ie/">爱尔兰科克皇后学院的</a>数学教授。 五年后，他出版了<i>《思维规律研究》，逻辑和概率的数学理论就是在此基础上建立起来的</i>。</p><p>At the age of twenty he discovered something that the greatest mathematicians of his time had missed--an algebraic theory of invariance that was to become an indispensable tool for Einstein when he formulated the theory of relativity. In 1849, after his long years as an elementary-school teacher, Boole's mathematical publications brought him an appointment as professor of mathematics at <a href="http://www.ucc.ie/">Queen's College, Cork, Ireland</a>. Five years later, he published <i>An investigation of the laws of thought, on which are founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities</i>.</p>

      <p>形式逻辑自希腊时代就已存在，最广为人知的是亚里士多德完善的三段论形式，大多数人只知道简化版：“所有人都会死。苏格拉底是人。因此苏格拉底也是会死的。”经过数千年以同样形式存在，亚里士多德逻辑似乎注定停留在形而上学的外部边界，永远无法突破到更具体的数学领域，因为它仍然只是一个<i>文字</i>问题。缺少下一个级别的符号精度。</p><p>Formal logic had been around since the time of the Greeks, most widely known in the syllogistic form perfected by Aristotle, the simplified version of which most people learn no more than: "All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore Socrates is mortal." After thousands of years in the same form, Aristotelian logic seemed doomed to remain on the outer boundaries of the metaphysical, never to break through into the more concretely specified realm of the mathematical, because it was still just a matter of <i>words</i>. The next level of symbolic precision was missing.</p>

      <p>一千多年来，唯一能够用符号表达的、足够严谨和精确以致于被称为“数学”的逻辑系统是欧几里得创立的几何学。正如欧几里得在空间图形的公理和定理中确立了几何学的基本陈述和规则一样，布尔在代数符号中确立了逻辑的基础。这可不是小野心。虽然几何知识是走遍世界的一种广泛有用的工具，但<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">布尔坚信逻辑是人类理性本身的关键。</font>他知道他已经发现了从亚里士多德到笛卡尔的每一位形而上学家都忽略的东西。布尔在第一章中写道：</p><p>For over a thousand years, the only logic-based system that was expressible in symbols rigorous and precise enough to be called "mathematical" had been the geometry set down by Euclid. Just as Euclid set down the basic statements and rules of geometry in axioms and theorems about spatial figures, Boole set down the basics of logic in algebraic symbols. This was no minor ambition. While knowledge of geometry is a widely useful tool for getting around the world, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Boole was convinced that logic was the key to human reason itself.</font> He knew that he had found what every metaphysician from Aristotle to Descartes had overlooked. In his first chapter, Boole wrote:</p>

      
        <p><font size="-1">1. 以下论文的目的是研究进行推理的思维活动的基本规律；用微积分的符号语言来表达它们，并在此基础上建立逻辑科学和构造其方法……从这些研究过程中发现的各种真理要素中收集一些有关人类思维的性质和构成的可能的模仿……</font></p><p><font size="-1">1. The design of the following treatise is to investigate the fundamental laws of those operations of the mind by which reasoning is performed; to give expression to them in the symbolic language of a Calculus, and upon this foundation to establish a science of Logic and construct its method . . . to collect from the various elements of truth brought to view in the course of these inquiries some probable imitations concerning the nature and constitution of the human mind. . . .</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">2. ……让我们能够从给定的前提中推导出正确的推论并不是逻辑的唯一目的……这些研究还有另一种兴趣，源自它们对智力的阐释。它们教导我们语言和数字作为推理过程的工具辅助的方式；它们在某种程度上揭示了我们普通智力的不同能力之间的联系；它们为我们设定了……真理和正确性的基本标准——这些标准不是从外部获得的，而是深深植根于人类能力的构成中……揭示那些高级思维能力的秘密法则和关系，通过这些法则和关系，我们可以获得或成熟超越对世界和我们自身的感知知识的一切，对于理性思维来说，这是一个无需赞扬的目标。</font></p><p><font size="-1">2. . . . To enable us to deduce correct inferences from given premises is not the only object of logic . . . these studies have also an interest of another kind, derived from the light which they shed on the intellectual powers. They instruct us concerning the mode in which language and number serve as instrumental aids to the process of reasoning; they reveal to some degree the connexion between different powers of our common intellect; they set before us . . . the essential standards of truth and correctness--standards not derived from without, but deeply founded in the constitution of the human faculties . . . To unfold the secret laws and relations of those high faculties of thought by which all beyond the merely perceptive knowledge of the world and of ourselves is attained or matured, is an object which does not stand in need of commendation to a rational mind.</font></p>
      

      <p>尽管布尔的发现对纯数学和电子工程都产生了深远的影响，但他的逻辑代数最重要的元素在原理上很简单。他以学校里每个人都学过的代数作为起点，对代数组合的标准规则做了一些虽小但意义重大的例外，并用他的特殊版本精确地表达了经典逻辑的三段论。</p><p>Although his discovery had profound consequences in both pure mathematics and electrical engineering, the most important elements of Boole's algebra of logic were simple in principle. He used the algebra everybody learns in school as a starting point, made several small but significant exceptions to the standard rules of algebraic combination, and used his special version to precisely express the syllogisms of classical logic.</p>

      <p>布尔用来连接逻辑和计算这两个截然不同的思维工具的概念是数学系统的概念，其中只有两个量，他称之为“宇宙”和“虚无”，并用符号<i>1</i>和<i>0</i>表示。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">虽然当时他并不知道，但布尔发明了一种量化逻辑的双态系统，而该系统恰好也是分析继电器或真空管等双态物理设备逻辑的完美方法。</font></p><p>The concept Boole used to connect the two heretofore different thinking tools of logic and calculation was the idea of a mathematical system in which there were only two quantities, which he called "the Universe" and "Nothing" and denoted by the signs <i>1</i> and <i>0</i>. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Although he didn't know it at the time, Boole had invented a two-state system for quantifying logic that also happened to be a perfect method for analyzing the logic of two-state physical devices like electrical relays or vacuum tubes.</font></p>

      <p>通过使用指定的符号和运算，逻辑命题可以简化为方程，三段论结论可以根据普通代数规则计算出来。通过应用纯数学运算，任何了解布尔代数的人都可以发现任何在逻辑上包含在任何一组指定前提中的结论。</p><p>By using the symbols and operations specified, logical propositions could be reduced to equations, and the syllogistic conclusions could be computed according to ordinary algebraic rules. By applying purely mathematical operations, anyone who knew Boolean algebra could discover any conclusion that was logically contained in any set of specified premises.</p>

      <p>由于三段论逻辑与人类推理的思维过程非常相似，布尔确信他的代数不仅证明了数学和逻辑之间的有效等价性，而且代表了人类思维的数学系统化。自布尔时代以来，科学界已经认识到，人类的推理工具比形式逻辑工具复杂、模糊、不可预测且功能强大得多。但数学家们发现，布尔的数学逻辑对他们事业的基础比他们最初想象的要重要得多。第一台计算机的发明者了解到，一个只有两个值的简单系统确实可以进行非常复杂的计算。</p><p>Because syllogistic logic so closely resembles the thought processes of human reasoning, Boole was convinced that his algebra not only demonstrated a valid equivalence between mathematics and logic, but also represented a mathematical systemization of human thought. Since Boole's time, science has learned that the human instrument of reason is far more complicated, ambiguous, unpredictable, and powerful that the tools of formal logic. But mathematicians have found that Boole's mathematical logic is much more important to the foundation of their enterprise than they first suspected. And the inventors of the first computers learned that a simple system with only two values can weave very sophisticated computations indeed.</p>

      <p>数学和逻辑之间理论桥梁的建设已经光荣地开始了，但布尔的工作还远远没有完成。后来的人们发现，尽管人类思维可能并不像机器，但通过思考与思维运作相似的机器，仍然可以获得巨大的力量。</p><p>The construction of a theoretical bridge between mathematics and logic had been gloriously begun, but was far from completed by Boole's work. It remained for later minds to discover that although it is probably not true that the human mind resembles a machine, there is still great power to be gained by thinking about machines that resemble the operations of the mind.</p>

      <p>19 世纪的技术根本不够精确、不够快、不够强大，无法将巴贝奇、洛夫莱斯和布尔的理念付诸实践。制造现代计算机几个最重要部件所需的基础科学和工业能力根本就不存在。仍然有一些重要问题需要由发明者而不是理论家来解决。</p><p>Nineteenth-century technology simply wasn't precise enough, fast enough, or powerful enough for ideas like those of Babbage, Lovelace, and Boole to become practicalities. The basic science and the industrial capabilities needed for making several of the most important components of modern computers simply didn't exist. There were still important problems that would have to be solved by the inventors rather than the theorists.</p>

      <p>计算史上的下一个重要发展，也是 19 世纪的最后一个重要贡献，与计算对数表或设计思维定律无关。下一个推动这一技术发展的思想家是<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">赫尔曼·霍勒里斯，他是</font>美国人口普查局的一名 19 岁雇员。他的角色对计算的重要理论基础没有影响。最终，他的发明过时了。但他的小创新最终发展成为一个行业，后来主导了计算机技术的商业应用。</p><p>The next important development in the history of computation, and the last important contribution of the nineteenth century, had nothing to do with calculating tables of logarithms or devising laws of thought. The next thinker to advance the state of the art was <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Herman Hollerith,</font> a nineteen-year-old employee of the United States Census Office. His role would have no effect on the important theoretical foundations of computing. Ultimately, his invention became obsolete. But his small innovation eventually grew into the industry that later came to dominate the commercial use of computer technology.</p>

      <p>当人口普查办公室的上司给他制定一个自动收集和制表数据的计划时，霍尔瑞斯为计算的发展做出了第一个重要的美国贡献。根据上司的建议，他设计出了<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">一个系统，使用打孔的卡片将信息输入电子计数系统。</font></p><p>Hollerith made the first important American contribution to the evolution of computation when his superior at the Census Office set him on a scheme for automating the collection and tabulation of data. On his superior's suggestion, he worked out <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">a system that used cards with holes punched in them to feed information into an electrical counting system.</font></p>

      <p><i>1890 年的人口普查是历史上数据</i>处理和数学方程式计算成为自动化对象的一个​​转折点。事实证明，霍尔瑞斯既不是数学家也不是逻辑学家，而是一个数据处理者。他所研究的不是数值计算，而是收集、分类、存储和检索大量小信息项的复杂性。霍尔瑞斯和他的同事们是 20 世纪信息工作者的先驱，因为他们的任务是找到一种机械方法来跟踪组织所知道的信息。</p><p>The 1890 census was the point in history where the processing of <i>data</i> as well as the calculation of mathematical equations became the object of automation. As it turned out, Hollerith was neither a mathematician nor a logician, but a data processor. He was grappling, not with numerical calculation, but with the complexity of collecting, sorting, storing, and retrieving a large number of small items in a collection of information. Hollerith and his colleagues were unwitting forerunners of twentieth-century information workers, because their task had to do with finding a mechanical method to keep track of what their organization knew.</p>

      <p>霍勒里斯的上司约翰·肖·比林斯 (John Shaw Billings) 向他介绍了这项任务。比林斯自 1870 年起就一直担心信息量激增的问题，当时他受雇于人口普查办公室，负责开发处理大量信息的新方法。由于比林斯负责 1880 年和 1890 年人口普查的数据收集和制表，他敏锐地意识到，国家人口的增长使政府每十年进行一次宪法规定的调查的能力不堪重负。在可预见的未来，需要统计和分类的大量信息将需要十五到二十年才能完成制表！</p><p>Hollerith was introduced to the task by his superior, John Shaw Billings, who had been worrying about the rising tide of information since 1870, when he was hired by the Census Office to develop new ways to handle large amounts of information. Since he was in charge of the collection and tabulation of data for the 1880 and 1890 census, Billings was acutely aware that the growing population of the nation was straining the ability of the government to conduct the constitutionally mandated survey every ten years. In the foreseeable future, the flood of information to be counted and sorted would take fifteen or twenty years to tabulate!</p>

      <p>就像关于计算机其他部件起源的故事一样，关于穿孔卡系统的确切发明者也存在一些争议。一位名叫威尔科克斯 (Willcox) 的人在人口普查办公室与比林斯和霍勒里斯共事，他曾写道：</p><p>Like the stories about the origins of other components of computers, there is some controversy about the exact accreditation for the invention of the punched-card system. One account by a man named Willcox, who worked with both Billings and Hollerith in the census office stated:</p>

      
        <p><font size="-1">当华盛顿正在统计第十次（1881 年）人口普查的结果时，比林斯正与一位同伴走过办公室，办公室里有数百名办事员正忙着将信息从时间表转移到记录表上，手工计数的方式缓慢而令人心碎。当他们看着办事员时，他对他的同伴说：“应该有某种机械方式来完成这项工作，就像提花织机的原理一样，卡片上的孔可以调节要编织的图案。”种子落在了好地里。他的同伴是办公室里一位才华横溢的年轻工程师，他先是说服自己这个想法是可行的，然后又说服比林斯不想声称或使用它。</font></p><p><font size="-1">While the returns of the Tenth (1881) Census were being tabulated at Washington, Billings was walking with a companion through the office in which hundreds of clerks were engaged in laboriously transferring items of information from the schedules to the record sheets by the slow and heartbreaking method of hand tallying. As they were watching the clerks he said to his companion, 'There ought to be some mechanical way of doing this job, on the principle of the Jacquard loom, whereby holes in a card can regulate the pattern to be woven.' The seed fell on good ground. His companion was a talented young engineer in the office who first convinced himself that the idea was practicable and then that Billings had no desire to claim or use it.</font></p>
      

      <p>这位“才华横溢的年轻工程师”当然就是霍勒里斯，他于 1919 年写下了这个版本：</p><p>The "talented young engineer," of course, was Hollerith, who wrote this version in 1919:</p>

      
        <p><font size="-1">一个星期天晚上，在比林斯博士的茶桌上，他对我说应该有一台机器来完成统计人口和类似统计数据的纯机械工作。我们讨论了这个问题，我记得……他想到使用卡片，卡片边缘打出凹槽，显示个人的描述……研究完这个问题后，我回到比林斯博士那里，说我认为我可以解决这个问题，并问他是否愿意和我一起去。医生说他不感兴趣，只想看看这个问题的解决方案。</font></p><p><font size="-1">One Sunday evening at Dr. Billings' tea table, he had said to me that there ought to be a machine for doing the purely mechanical work of tabulating population and similar statistics. We talked the matter over and I remember . . . he thought of using cards with the description of the individual shown by notches punched in the edge of the card. . . .After studying the problem I went back to Dr. Billings and said that I thought I could work out a solution for the problem and asked him if he would go in with me. The Doctor said that he was not interested any further than to see some solution of the problem worked out.</font></p>
      

      <p>Hollerith 建立的系统使用在纸板上指定位置打孔来代表每个受访者的人口统计特征。与 Jacquard 和 Babbage 的纸板以及当时流行的“自动钢琴”一样，Hollerith 纸板上的孔是为了让机械部件通过。Hollerith 使用了一种机电计数器，其中铜刷在遇到孔时会闭合某些电路，如果没有孔则不会闭合电路。</p><p>The system Hollerith put together used holes punched in designated locations on cardboard cards to represent the demographic characteristics of each person interviewed. Like Jacquard's and Babbage's cards, and the "player pianos" then in vogue, the holes in Hollerith's cards were meant to allow the passage of mechanical components. Hollerith used an electromechanical counter in which copper brushes closed certain electrical circuits if a hole was encountered, and did not close a circuit if a hole was not present.</p>

      <p>每当该类别的电路闭合时，电动装置就会将每个类别的运行计数增加一个单位。通过添加分类设备，根据孔的图案和所需的制表类型将卡片分配到不同的箱子中，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">霍尔瑞斯不仅创造了处理大量数据的能力，还创造了对数据提出新的、更复杂的问题的能力。</font>新系统在 1890 年人口普查时及时到位。</p><p>An electrically activated mechanism increased the running count in each category by one unit every time the circuit for that category was closed. By adding sorting devices that distributed cards into various bins, according to the patterns of holes and the kind of tabulation desired, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Hollerith not only created the ability to keep up with large amounts of data, but created the ability to ask new and more complicated questions about the data.</font> The new system was in place in time for the 1890 census.</p>

      <p>霍勒里斯及时获得了他发明的系统的专利，拯救了国家，使其免于被自己的统计数据淹没。1882-83 年，他是麻省理工学院机械工程讲师，建立了该机构与计算机科学和技术发展之间的最早联系。1896 年，霍勒里斯成立了“制表机公司”，制造卡片和读卡机。1900 年，霍勒里斯将他的设备租给了人口普查局，用于第十二次人口普查。</p><p>Hollerith obtained a patent on the system that he had invented just in time to save the nation from drowning in its own statistics. In 1882-83, he was an instructor in mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, establishing the earliest link between that institution and the development of computer science and technology. In 1896, Hollerith set up the "Tabulating Machine Company" to manufacture both the cards and the card-reading machines. In 1900, Hollerith rented his equipment to the Census Bureau for the Twelfth Census.</p>

      <p>几年后，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">霍勒里斯的制表机变成了一家名为“国际商业机器公司”的机构，</font>由一位名叫托马斯·沃森的家伙管理。但是，在这家制表机和穿孔卡制造商开始涉足真正的计算机之前，还有两次世界大战在即，还有几位思想家——其中最杰出的思想家——尚未出现。这家公司的现代业务——销售用于跟踪业务信息的机器——必须等到一些极其重要的业务完成之后才能开展。</p><p>Some years later, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Hollerith's Tabulating Machine had become an institution known as "International Business Machines,"</font> run by a fellow named Thomas Watson, Senior. But there were two World Wars ahead, and several more thinkers--the most extraordinary of them all--still to come before a manufacturer of tabulating machines and punch cards would have anything to do with true computers. The modern-day concerns of this company--selling machines to keep track of the information that goes along with doing business--would have to wait for some deadly serious business to be transacted.</p>

      <p>陆军部（而非人口普查办公室或商用机器公司）是数字计算机之母，而它的诞生离不开众多助产士——从艾伦·图灵的英国团队（他们需要一种特殊的计算设备来破解德国密码），到约翰·冯·诺依曼在洛斯阿拉莫斯的数学家（他们面临着制造原子弹所涉及的几乎无法克服的计算），到诺伯特·维纳的研究人员（他们正在发明更好更快的瞄准防空火力的方法），再到陆军弹道研究实验室的项目（生产电子数字积分器和计算器 (ENIAC)）。</p><p>The War Department, not the Census Office or a business machine company, was the mother of the digital computer, and the midwives were many--from Alan Turing's British team who needed a special kind of computing device to crack the German code, to John von Neumann's mathematicians at Los Alamos who were faced with the almost insurmountable calculations involved in making the atomic bomb, to Norbert Weiner's researchers who were inventing better and faster ways to aim antiaircraft fire, to the project of the Army Ballistic Research Laboratory that produced the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (ENIAC).</p>

      <p>如果不了解计算机的起源，就推测计算机在不久的将来会变成什么样子，那就太愚蠢了。历史记录清楚无可争辩地表明：弹道学是控制论的起源。ENIAC 是第一台电子数字计算机，最初是为了计算弹道射击表而制造的。ENIAC 的发明者后来设计了第一台微型计算机，它就是 BINAC，这种设备小到可以装进洲际弹道导弹的鼻锥中，而且足够智能，可以根据星星的位置进行导航。</p><p>It would be foolish to speculate about what computers might become in the near future without realizing where they originated in the recent past. The historical record is clear and indisputable on this point: ballistics begat cybernetics. ENIAC, the first electronic digital computer, was originally built in order to calculate ballistic firing tables. When ENIAC's inventors later designed the first miniature computer, it was the BINAC, a device small enough to fit in the nose cone of an ICBM and smart enough to navigate by the position of the stars.</p>

      <p>尽管第一台电子数字计算机是为了生产更精确的武器而制造的，但如果没有至少一项与弹道学或炸弹无关的重要理论突破，这项技术就不可能实现。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">计算的理论起源不是寻找更高效的武器，而是寻求更强大、更优雅的符号系统。</font></p><p>Although the first electronic digital computer was constructed in order to produce more accurate weapons, the technology would not have been possible without at least one important theoretical breakthrough that had nothing to do with ballistics or bombs. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The theoretical origins of computation are to be found, not in the search for more efficient weaponry, but in the quest for more powerful and elegant symbol systems.</font></p>

      <p>第一台现代计算机并不是一台机器。它甚至不是一张蓝图。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">数字计算机被设想为一个符号系统——第一个<i>自动</i>符号系统</font>——而不是一种工具或武器。发明它的人并不关心弹道学或计算，而是关心思想的本质和机器的本质。</p><p>The first modern computer was not a machine. It wasn't even a blueprint. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The digital computer was conceived as a symbol system--the first <i>automatic</i> symbol system</font> --not as a tool or a weapon. And the person who invented it was not concerned with ballistics or calculation, but with the nature of thought and the nature of machines.</p>

      计算机在巴贝奇发明一个世纪后终于被发明出来，但那时它并不是发明家工作室或科学家实验室里的新玩意儿。1936</font></font><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">年，一篇发表在数学杂志上的深奥论文向世人揭示了制造数字计算机的可能性。当时没有人意识到，这一在晦涩难懂的数学领域的奇特发现最终将带来一项改变世界的技术，尽管年轻的作家<a href="http://www.wadham.ox.ac.uk/~ahodges/Turing.html">艾伦·麦席森·图灵</a>知道他正在研究能够模拟人类思维过程的机器。</font>

      <p>那篇数学论文是西方文明文化史上的一个转折点。这场智力游戏的第一步导致了数字计算机的诞生，而这又是另一场持续了数千年的游戏的最后一步。在测量土地和预测星象运行轨迹的系统起源的埃及和巴比伦，只有祭司和他们挑选的工匠才有幸了解深奥的计算艺术。在公元前五、六世纪希腊文明蓬勃发展的时期，这些原始科学被塑造成被称为公理<i>系统</i>的思维工具。</p><p>That mathematics paper was a pivotal point in the cultural history of Western civilization. The first move in the intellectual game that resulted in digital computers was also the last move in another game that had gone on for millennia. In Egypt and Babylonia, where systems for measuring land and forecasting the course of the stars originated, only the priests and their chosen craftsmen were privileged to know the esoteric arts of reckoning. During the flowering of Greek civilization into the fifth and sixth centuries B.C., these protosciences were shaped into the mental tools known as <i>axiomatic</i> systems.</p>

      <p>在公理系统中，你从已知为真的前提和已知有效的规则开始，以便产生保证为真的新陈述。可以通过根据规则集操纵符号得出结论。欧几里得几何是通过形式公理系统实现的那种普遍有用的工具的经典例子。</p><p>In an axiomatic system you start with premises that are known to be true, and rules that are known to be valid, in order to produce new statements that are guaranteed to be true. Conclusions can be reached by manipulating symbols according to sets of rules. Euclidean geometry is the classic example of the kind of generally useful tools made possible by formal axiomatic systems.</p>

      <p>公理系统是增强人类思维的工具。除了罕见的“闪电”计算器外，人们无法在心算中将两个六位数相加。然而，给几乎所有十岁以上的人一张纸和一支铅笔，他们都会不到一分钟就告诉你答案。将小学生变成计算机的神奇成分是一种执行计算的逐步方法，即所谓的算法<i>。</i>我们知道这些算法有效的原因在于它们基于被称为算术的形式系统，我们知道这是正确的。</p><p>An axiomatic system is a tool for augmenting human thought. Except for rare "lightning" calculators, people are not able to add two six-figure numbers in their head. Give virtually all people over the age of ten a piece of paper and a pencil, however, and they'll tell you the answer in less than a minute. The magic ingredient that makes a schoolchild into a calculating machine is the kind of step-by-step recipe for performing a calculation that is known as an <i>algorithm</i>. The reason we know such algorithms work is because they are based on the formal system known as arithmetic, which we know to be true.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">图灵的论文所做的事情以及数字计算机的出现导致了人们花了数千年的时间将各种形式系统简化为一个基本系统，以此作为所有形式系统的基础。</font>科学——我们文明收集和验证知识的卓越系统——建立在数学的基础上，而数学又是巴比伦人和希腊人原始数论的逻辑形式化。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">计算是人们试图证明数学真理可以简化为逻辑真理的意外结果。</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">What Turing's paper did, and what made digital computers possible, resulted in the millennia-long effort to reduce the various formal systems to one basic system that underlies them all.</font> Science--our civilization's preeminent system for gathering and validating knowledge--was built on mathematics, which was in turn a logical formalization of the primitive number theories of the Babylonians and the Greeks. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Computation was the unexpected result of the attempt to prove that the mathematical truths could be reduced to logical truths.</font></p>

      <p>随着我们文明预测和理解宇宙的方法因这些智力系统（即科学、数学和逻辑）而变得强大，一些人继续问这些系统是否可以简化为它们的基本组成部分。如果所有科学在变得足够先进时都可以简化为数学方程式，那么是否有可能将数学简化为最基本的逻辑层面？</p><p>At the same time that our civilization's methods for predicting and understanding the universe grew powerful as the result of these intellectual systems (i.e., science, mathematics, and logic), a few people continued to ask whether these same systems could be reduced to their basic components.

      <p>由于我们对知识体系的完整性和一致性的确定性可能取决于这种简化是否可能，因此当有证据表明存在例外、异常、悖论时，西方思想家们感到非常不安——数学结构中的漏洞可能会阻止任何这种形式系统的大规模简化。这两项智力探索——努力将数学简化为一个基本的、形式化的符号系统，以及试图修补在追求这种大规模简化的过程中出现的悖论——直接但出乎意料地导致了计算。</p><p>Since our certainty in the completeness and consistency of our knowledge system could depend on whether such a reduction was possible, it was very disconcerting to Western thinkers when evidence began to appear that there were exceptions, anomalies, paradoxes--holes in the structure of mathematics that might prevent any such grand reduction of formal systems. Those two intellectual quests--the effort to reduce mathematics to a fundamental, formal symbol system, and the attempt to patch up the paradoxes that cropped up during the pursuit of that grand reduction--led directly but unexpectedly to computation.</p>

      <p>在二十世纪的最初几十年，数学家和逻辑学家一直在尝试将数学<i>形式化</i>。大卫·希尔伯特和约翰·冯·诺依曼在 20 世纪 20 年代制定了形式主义的规则（我们将在下一章中看到）。在希尔伯特和冯·诺依曼之前，阿尔弗雷德·诺思·怀特黑德和伯特兰·罗素在他们的《<i>数学原理》</i>中证明了人类推理的某些方面可以形式化描述，从而将这种对数理逻辑的兴趣与早已被遗忘的该领域创始人乔治·布尔的思想联系起来。<i>形式系统</i>的概念特别令人感兴趣，因为它似乎在数学的抽象和人类思维的奥秘之间架起了桥梁。</p><p>In the first decades of the twentieth century, mathematicians and logicians were trying to <i>formalize</i> mathematics. David Hilbert and John von Neumann set down the rules of formalism in the 1920s (as we shall see in the next chapter). Before Hilbert and von Neumann, Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell demonstrated in their <i>Principia Mathematica</i> that some aspects of human reasoning could be formally described, thus linking this awakened interest in mathematical logic to the ideas of the long-forgotten originator of the field, George Boole. The idea of <i>formal systems</i> was of particular interest, because it appeared to bridge the abstractions of mathematics and the mysteries of human thought.</p>

      <p>形式系统是一种严格定义的游戏，它指定了操纵令牌的规则。制定形式系统的条件与任何其他游戏的规则非常相似。要告诉某人如何玩游戏，以及要使规则集符合形式系统的条件，必须传达游戏的三个方面 - 令牌的性质、起始位置的描述（或“棋盘”的起始布局）以及任何给定位置允许的移动列表。国际象棋跳棋、数学和逻辑是满足这些标准的形式系统的例子。到 20 世纪 30 年代，将数学简化为逻辑上安全的基础的努力带来了几次将算术（与数字运算有关的数学分支）视为形式系统的尝试。</p><p>A formal system is a rigidly defined kind of game that specifies rules for manipulating tokens. The qualifications for making a formal system are very much like the rules for any other game. To tell someone how to play a game, and for the set of rules to qualify as a formal system, the same three aspects of the game must be communicated -- the nature of the tokens, a description of the starting position (or the starting layout of the "board"), and a listing of what moves are allowed in any given position. Chess checkers, mathematics, and logic are examples of formal systems that satisfy these criteria. By the 1930s, the effort to reduce mathematics to logically secure foundations brought about several attempts to treat arithmetic -- the branch of mathematics concerned with operations on numbers -- as a formal system.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">1936 年，24 岁的艾伦·M·图灵向同事指出，可以用机器（体现形式系统规则的机器）进行数论计算，从而成为有史以来最伟大的数学天才之一。</font>尽管机器本身并没有作为工作模型存在，但图灵从一开始就强调，这种机器是可以制造出来的。他的发现是数学形式化努力的一个里程碑，同时也是计算史上的一个分水岭。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">In 1936, at the age of twenty-four, Alan M. Turing established himself as one of the greatest mathematical prodigies of all time when he pointed out to his colleagues that it was possible to perform computations in number theory by means of a machine -- a machine that embodied the rules of a formal system.</font> Although the machine itself didn't exist as a working model, Turing emphasized from the beginning that such machines could actually be built. His finding was a milestone in the effort to formalize mathematics and, at the same time, a watershed in the history of computation.</p>

      <p>艾伦·图灵巧妙地解决了形式主义者提出的一个关键元数学问题，他<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">用精确的数学术语描述了一个具有极其简单操作规则的<i>自动</i></font>形式系统如何具有非常强大的功能。自动形式系统是一种物理设备，它根据系统的规则自动操纵形式系统的标记。图灵的理论机器既是他的计算理论的一个例子，也是某种计算机器实际上可以构造的证明。</p><p>In his brilliant solution to one of the key metamathematical problems posed by the formalists, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Alan Turing described in precise mathematical terms how an <i>automatic</i> formal system with extremely simple rules of operation could have very powerful capabilities.</font> An automatic formal system is a physical device which automatically manipulates the tokens of a formal system according to the system's rules. Turing's theoretical machine was both an example of his theory of computation and a proof that a certain kind of computing machine could, in fact, be constructed.</p>

      <p>当图灵将数学和逻辑以机器的形式结合在一起时，他使<i>符号处理</i>系统成为可能。他提出，绝大多数智力问题都可以转化为“找到一个数字<i>n</i>，使得……”的形式。比这个将智力的抽象与更具体的数字领域联系起来的挑衅性言论更重要的是——这一暗示仍然激励着人工智能研究人员的努力——图灵认识到，在这种情况下，数字作为<i>符号</i>比作为数学计算的元素更重要。</p><p>When he brought mathematics and logic together in the form of a machine, Turing made <i>symbol-processing</i> systems possible. He proposed that the vast majority of intellectual problems could be converted to the form "find a number <i>n</i> such that . . . " Even more important than this provocative statement connecting the abstractions of intellect with the more concrete realm of numbers -- an implication that still inspires the efforts of artificial intelligence researchers -- was Turing's recognition that the numbers were more important as <i>symbols</i> in this case than as elements of mathematical calculations.</p>

      <p>图灵最伟大的洞见之一是，他从一开始就理解了大多数计算机专家尚未理解的一件事——数字<font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>只是解释自动形式系统内部状态的一种可能方式</i>。</font>巴贝奇的“行为模式”现在以数学的严谨性形式化。图灵的“状态”为连接人类认知能力和机器能力提供了至关重要的隐喻。</p><p>One of Turing's greatest insights was his understanding, from the very beginning, of something that the majority of the computer priesthood has yet to understand -- the fact that <font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>numbers are only one possible way of interpreting the internal states of an automatic formal system</i>.</font> Babbage's "patterns of action" were now formalized with mathematical rigor. Turing's "states" provided the crucial metaphor for bridging the power of human cognition and the capabilities of machines.</p>

      <p>图灵问道，人类符号处理器在进行计算时会做什么？他认为，心算包括将输入的数字转换为一系列中间<i>状态</i>的操作，这些中间状态按照一组固定的规则从一个状态发展到另一个状态，直到找到答案。有时，人们会用铅笔和纸来记录他们的计算状态。数学规则需要比形而上学家讨论的那些繁琐描述的人类心理状态更严格的定义，因此图灵专注于以一种清晰明确的方式定义这些状态，以便可以用这种描述来指挥机器的操作。</p><p>What, Turing asked, does a human symbol processor do when performing a calculation? He decided that mental calculations consist of operations for transforming the input numbers into a series of intermediate <i>states</i> which progress from one to the next according to a fixed set of rules, until an answer is found. Sometimes, people use pencil and paper to keep track of the states of their calculations. The rules of mathematics require more rigid definitions than those provided by the fussily described human states of mind discussed by metaphysicians, so Turing concentrated on defining these states in a way that was so clear and unambiguous that the description could be used to command the operations of a machine.</p>

      <p>图灵首先对<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">形式系统进行了精确描述，以“指令表”的形式描述了系统中每种可能的状态配置应采取哪些动作。</font>然后，他证明了这些指令的描述、形式公理系统（如逻辑）的步骤以及构成自动形式系统中“动作”的机器状态都是彼此等价的。形式系统和图灵机之类的问题听起来与计算机的实际功能相去甚远，但实际上它们是整个数字计算机技术的基础——直到艾伦·图灵发表他的划时代论文十多年后，数字计算机才出现。</p><p>Turing started with <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">a precise description of a formal system, in the form of "instruction tables" describing which moves to make for every possible configuration of states in the system.</font> He then proved that the description of these instructions, the steps of formal axiomatic system like logic, and the machine states that make up the "moves" in an automatic formal system are all equivalent to one another. Such matters as formal systems and Turing machines sound very far away from what computers actually do, but in fact they underlie the entire technology of digital computers -- which wasn't to come into existence until over a decade after Alan Turing published his epochal paper.</p>

      <p>图灵在论文中以图形方式描述了计算过程，他要求读者考虑一种可以在分成多个方格的纸带上读写简单符号的设备。“读写头”可以沿着纸带向任意方向移动，每次移动一个方格，而控制读写头动作的控制单元可以解释关于在方格中读写符号的简单指令。在每个阶段被“扫描”或“读取”的单个方格称为<i>活动方格</i>。想象一下，可以在现有纸带的任一端添加新的部分，因此纸带的长度可能是无限的。</p><p>The process of computation was graphically depicted in Turing's paper when he asked the reader to consider a device that can read and write simple symbols on a paper tape that is divided into squares. The "reading/writing head" can move in either direction along the tape, one square at a time, and a control unit that directs the actions of the head can interpret simple instructions about reading and writing symbols in squares. The single square that is "scanned" or "read" at each stage is known as the <i>active square</i>. Imagine that new sections can be added at either end of the existing tape, so it is potentially infinite.</p>

      <p>假设符号为“X”和“O”。假设设备在活动方块中读取任一符号时可以将其擦除并用另一个符号替换（即，擦除 X 并用 O 替换，反之亦然）。根据控制单元解释的指令，设备还能够一次向左或向右移动一个方块。指令会导致符号被擦除、写入或保持不变，具体取决于读取的符号。</p><p>Suppose the symbols are "X" and "O". Suppose that the device can erase either symbol when it reads it in the active square and replace it with the other symbol (i.e., erase an X and replace it with an O, and vice versa). The device also has the ability to move left or right, one square at a time, according to instructions interpreted by the control unit. The instructions cause a symbol to be erased, written, or left the same, depending on which symbol is read.</p>

      <p>使用这些规则可以构建任意数量的游戏，但它们不一定都有意义。图灵首先证明的一件事是，考虑到原始操作看起来多么粗糙和像自动机一样，根据这些规则构建的一些游戏可能非常复杂。以下示例说明了如何使用此游戏进行简单的计算。</p><p>Any number of games can be constructed using these rules, but they would not all necessarily be meaningful. One of the first things Turing demonstrated was that some of the games constructed under these rules can be very sophisticated, considering how crude and automaton-like the primitive operations seem to be. The following example illustrates how this game can be used to perform a simple calculation.</p>

      <p>这台图灵机所玩的游戏规则很简单：给定一个起始位置，即一段写着一些 X 和 O 的磁带，并标明一个起始方格，设备将执行指令列表规定的操作，并逐个执行后续指令，直到遇到迫使其停止的指令。（如果特定磁带配置的指令表中没有明确的指令，则机器在达到该配置时将无法执行任何操作，因此必须停止。）</p><p>The rules of the game to be played by this Turing machine are simple: Given a starting position in the form of a section of tape with some Xs and Os on it, and a starting square indicated, the device is to perform the actions dictated by a list of instructions and follows the succeeding instructions one at a time until it reaches an instruction that forces it to stop. (If there is no explicit instruction in the table of instructions for a particular tape configuration, there is nothing that the machine can do when it reaches that configuration, so it has to stop.)</p>

      <p>每条指令都指定了当读到指令时活动方块上有特定符号时要执行的特定操作。有四种不同的操作；它们是此游戏唯一合法的动作。它们是：</p><p>Each instruction specifies a particular action to be performed if there is a certain symbol on the active square at the time it is read. There are four different actions; they are the only legal moves of this game. They are:</p>

      <div style="margin-left:2em">
        <p>用 X 替换 O。<br><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">
        用 O 替换 X。</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">
        向右移动一格。</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">
        向左移动一格。</font></font><br><br></p><p>Replace O with X.<br><br>
        Replace X with O.<br><br>
        Go one square to the right.<br><br>
        Go one square to the left.<br><br></p>
      </div>

      <p>指令的一个示例是：“如果活动方块上有 X，则将其替换为 O。”此指令使机器执行上面列出的第二个操作。为了创建“游戏”，我们需要制作一个列表，指定每一步要遵循的指令编号以及接下来要遵循的指令编号。这就像说“机器现在正在遵循（例如）指令七，而接下来要遵循的指令是（例如）指令八。”</p><p>An example of an instruction is: "If there is an X on the active square replace it with O." This instruction causes the machine to perform the second action listed above. In order to create a "game," we need to make a list that specifies the number of the instruction that is being followed at every step as well as the number of the instruction that is to be followed next. That is like saying "The machine is now following (for example) instruction seven, and the instruction to be followed next is (for example) instruction eight."</p>

      <p>以下是一系列以编码形式给出的指令和更像英语的翻译。这些指令合在一起构成了一个“指令表”或“程序”，告诉图灵机如何玩某种游戏：</p><p>Here is a series of instructions, given in coded form and the more English-like translation. Taken together, these instructions constitute an "instruction table" or a "program" that tells a Turing machine how to play a certain kind off game:</p>

      <p>这个游戏可能看起来相当机械化。机械化是图灵试图强调的要点之一。如果你看一下起始位置，请注意有两个相邻的 X。然后看看最终位置，注意有四个 X。如果你使用相同的指令，但从有五个 X 的磁带开始，你最终会得到十个 X。规范中的指令列表用于计算程序，它将使输入加倍并显示输出。事实上，它可以由机器完成。</p><p>This game may seem rather mechanical. The fact that it is mechanical was one of the points Turing was trying to make. If you look at the starting position, note that there are two adjacent Xs. Then look at the final position and note that there are four Xs. If you were to use the same instructions, but start with a tape that had five Xs, you would wind up with ten Xs. This list of instructions in the specification for a calculating procedure that will double the input and display the output. It can, in fact, be done by a machine.</p>

      <p>本质上，每台图灵机都会将标记从磁带上的一个位置移动到磁带上的另一个位置，就像上面概述的程序将 X 和 O 从一个方格移动到另一个方格一样。如今，标记可以是微电路中的电子脉冲，磁带可以是存储芯片中的存储位置阵列，但基本思想是一样的。图灵证明了他假设的机器是由起始位置（计算开始时磁带上的 O 和 X 的模式）和规则（指令表给出的指令）指定的形式系统的自动化版本。游戏的移动是与计算的指定步骤相对应的机器状态的变化。</p><p>In essence, every Turing machine moves marks from one position on a tape to another position on a tape, in the way the procedure outlined above moved Xs and Os from square to square. These days, the marks can be electronic impulses in microcircuits, and the tape can be an array of memory locations in a memory chip, but the essential idea is the same. Turing proved that his hypothetical machine is an automated version of a formal system specified by the starting position (the pattern of Os and Xs on the tape at the beginning of the computation) and the rules (the instructions given by the instruction tables). The moves of the game are the changing states of the machine that correspond to the specified steps of the computation.</p>

      <p>图灵随后证明，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>对于任何形式系统，都存在一个可以编程来模仿它的图灵机。</i></font>图灵所追求的正是这种能够模仿任何其他形式系统的通用形式系统。这些系统现在被称为“<a href="http://www.wadham.ox.ac.uk/~ahodges/T-machine.html">通用图灵机</a>”。该理论首次提出是在一篇令人生畏的论文中，论文标题为“论可计算数及其在判定性问题中的应用”。</p><p>Turing then proved that <font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>for any formal system, there exists a Turing machine that can be programmed to imitate it.</i></font> This kind of general formal system with the ability to imitate any other formal system was what Turing was getting at. These systems are now known as "<a href="http://www.wadham.ox.ac.uk/~ahodges/T-machine.html">universal Turing machines</a>." The theory was first stated in a paper with the forbidding title "On Computable Numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem."</p>

      <p>图灵机是图灵在解决数学作为一种形式化思维方式的基础这一关键问题的过程中发明的一种假想装置。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他表明，他的装置可以解决无数问题，但有些问题无法解决，因为无法提前预测机器是否会停止或何时停止。</font>这就是元数学和计算之间的分道扬镳之处。</p><p>The Turing Machine was a hypothetical device Turing invented on the way to settling a critical question about the foundations of mathematics as a formalized means of thinking. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">He showed that his device could solve infinitely many problems, but that there are some problems that cannot be solved because there is no way of predicting in advance whether or when the machine is going to stop.</font> Here is where the parting of the ways between metamathematics and computation occurred.</p>

      <p>我们简单的倍增程序示例仅需 26 步。但是无法知道其他程序（可以是数论定理的直接翻译）是否会停止。通过证明这一点，图灵对所有机械系统（即程序足够明确，可以由机器执行的系统）提出了一个等价观点。</p><p>Our simple example of a doubling program took only twenty-six steps. But there is no way of knowing whether or not other programs (which can be direct translations of theorems in number theory) will ever stop. By proving this, Turing made an equivalent point about all mechanical systems (i.e., systems in which the procedures are definite enough to be carried out by a machine).</p>

      <p>图灵和他的同事们结束了对形式系统逻辑上确定基础的长期搜索，他们令人震惊地发现，形式系统有许多重要的特性我们永远无法确定。形式系统本质上具有某些固有的局限性。此时，计算理论已不仅仅是元数学的一个重要分支，因为形式系统的属性逐渐淡出人们的视线，而机器的属性则以一种完全出乎意料的戏剧性方式出现——因为<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">图灵在限制形式系统能力的同时，还表明确实存在一种通用形式系统。</font>从最基本的意义上讲，这就是计算机。</p><p>Turing and his colleagues ended the long search for a logically certain basis underlying formal systems by making the shocking discovery that there are a number of important features about formal systems about which we can never be certain. Formal systems, by their very nature, have certain inherent limitations. At this point, the theory of computation became something more than an important branch of metamathematics, as the properties of formal systems faded into the background and the properties of machines emerged in a wholly unexpected and dramatic manner -- because <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">at the same time that Turing put a limit on the capabilities of formal systems, he showed that there is indeed such a thing as a universal formal system.</font> And that is what a computer is, in the most basic sense.</p>

      <p>通用图灵机模仿其他图灵机的方式就像我们的倍增机将输入乘以二一样自动化。假设设备的控制单元能够解释简单的指令——自巴贝奇时代以来，这一直是工具制造商而不是数学家的事——那么就可以对描述各种图灵机的更复杂的指令列表进行编码，并将它们与起始位置一起放到输入带上。</p><p>The way the universal Turing machine imitates other Turing machines is as automatic as the way our doubling machine multiplies the input by two. Assuming that the control unit of the device is capable of interpreting simple instructions -- something that had been a matter for toolmakers, not mathematicians since Babbage's time -- it is possible to encode a more complex list of instructions describing various Turing machines and put them onto the input tape, along with the starting position.</p>

      <p>正如机器所遵循的指令可以用英语（或德语或法语等）或缩写形式（如“7XL8”）表示一样，它们也可以用更原始的形式进行编码。可以使用相同的 X 和 O 设计一个代码，该代码可以唯一地表示每条指令和指令表（程序）。指令和数据都可以放在同一磁带上。然后，通用图灵机可以扫描该编码磁带并执行代码中指定的功能（在我们的示例中，将磁带数据部分的数字加倍）。</p><p>Just as the instructions followed by the machine can be stated in English (or German or French, etc.), or in an abbreviated form like "7XL8," they can be encoded in an even more primitive form. A code can be devised, using the same Xs and Os, that can uniquely represent every instruction and instruction table (program). Both the instructions and the data can be put onto the same tape. A universal Turing machine can then scan that coded tape and perform the function specified in the code (doubling the number on the data portion of the tape, in our example).</p>

      <p>这段代码可以由一台机器解释，这台机器可以<i>自动</i>操纵令牌，只需给出一系列指令和起始配置。当机器停止时，您可以读取磁带并获取程序的输出。在这种情况下，您将要加倍的数字放入起始配置中，然后让机器一次一个方块地发出叮当声，擦除和写入 O 或 X。当机器停止时，您可以计算最终磁带配置中的 X。</p><p>This code can be interpreted by a machine, a machine that <i>automatically</i> manipulates the tokens, given a list of instructions and a starting configuration. When the machine stops, you read the tape and you get the output of the program. In this case, you put the number you want to double in the starting configuration, and then let the machine metaphorically clank away one square at a time, erasing and writing Os or Xs. When the machine stops, you count the Xs in the final tape configuration.</p>

      <p>指令列表将通用图灵机变成了倍增机。从机械上讲，这两台机器没有区别。代码描述的特定指令是通用图灵机所依据的。如果你能用类似的可编码指令描述一台用于三倍增、提取平方根或执行微分方程的机器，那么你那台基本的、愚蠢的老式通用图灵机就可以模仿<i>你</i>的三倍增机或平方根机。</p><p>The list of instructions is what turns the universal Turing machine into the doubling machine. Mechanically, there is no difference between the two machines. The particular instructions described by the code are what the universal Turing machine operates upon. If you can describe, in similarly codable instructions, a machine for tripling, or extracting square roots, or performing differential equations, then your basic, dumb old universal Turing machine can <i>imitate</i> your tripling machine or square root machine.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">正是这种模仿其他机器的能力催生了计算机。</font>磁带上的数字（或 X 和 O）并不那么重要。它们只是过程状态的符号——“加倍游戏”中的标记。指令列表（程序）使机器能够将输入数字加倍。指令，而不是跟踪执行方式的符号——规则，而不是标记——才是图灵机工作的基础。通用图灵机主要是<i>符号操纵器</i>。数字计算机是通用图灵机。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">That ability to imitate other machines is what led to computers.</font> The numbers (or Xs and Os) on the tape aren't that important. They are only symbols for states of a process -- markers in a "doubling game." The list of instructions (the program) is what enables the machine to double the input number. The instructions, not the symbols that keep track of the way they are carried out -- the rules, not the markers -- are what make the Turing machine work. Universal Turing machines are primarily <i>symbol manipulators</i>. And digital computers are universal Turing machines.</p>

      <p>将游戏规则视为一种机器并不容易。如果您考虑“机械过程”，那么这项任务会稍微容易一些，因为这些过程定义得非常明确，以至于机器可以通过引用指令表来执行它们。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">所有通用图灵机都是功能相同的设备，用于遵循指令表指定的程序。指令表可以不同，它们可以将通用图灵机变成许多不同类型的机器。因此，这些程序有时被称为“虚拟机”。</font></p><p>It isn't easy to think of the rules of a game as a kind of machine. The task is somewhat easier if you think about "mechanical processes" that are so clearly and specifically defined that a machine can perform them by referring to an instruction table. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">All universal Turing machines are functionally identical devices for following the program specified by an instruction table. The instruction tables can differ, and they can turn the universal Turing machine into many different kinds of machine. For this reason, the programs are sometimes called "virtual machines."</font></p>

      <p>通用图灵机和它能够模仿的许多不同图灵机之间的区别与数字计算机直接类似。与通用图灵机一样，所有数字计算机的功能都相同。从最基本的层面上讲，每台数字计算机的运行方式都与我们的倍增机处理正方形和 O 和 X 的方式相同。与其构建不同的物理机器来解决不同的问题，不如向指令跟踪机描述不同的<i>虚拟</i>机（程序），这些虚拟机使用这种一次一个正方形的机械指令跟踪过程，通过简单的操作模式来解决复杂的问题，这更为实际。</p><p>The distinction between a universal Turing machine and the many different Turing machines it is able to imitate is a direct analogy to digital computers. Like universal Turing machines, all digital computers are functionally identical. At the most basic level, every digital computer operates in the way our doubling machine did with the squares and Os and Xs. Instead of building a different physical machine to solve different problems, it is more practical to describe to an instruction-following machine different <i>virtual</i> machines (programs) that use this one-square-at-a-time mechanical instruction-following process to solve complicated problems through a pattern of simple operations.</p>

      <p>遵循指令是数字计算机的本质。例如，计算机计算器和计算机打字机之间的区别在于它们遵循的指令——它被赋予的虚拟机的编码描述，它要模仿虚拟机来执行任务。由于计算机理解可以对应于 O 和 X、0 和 1 或“开”和“关”的“位”，因此您可以使用这些符号来编写描述，将通用机器变成您想要的特定机器。这就是程序员所做的。他们考虑人们可能想要使用的机器，并找出将这些机器描述为通用机器（即计算机）的方法。</p><p>Following instructions is the nature of digital computers. The difference between a computer calculator and a computer typewriter, for example, lies in the instructions it follows -- the coded description it is given of the virtual machine it is meant to imitate in order to perform a task. Since computers understand "bits" that can correspond to O and X, or 0 and 1, or "on" and "off," you can use these symbols to write descriptions that turn the general machine into the specific machine you want. That's what programmers do. They think of machines people might want to use, and figure out ways to describe those machines to general machines -- computers, that is.</p>

      <p>如果程序员不得不花费所有时间思考如何用 O 和 X 字符串来描述机器，那么编程中任何重大成就都太耗时了。O 和 X 代码类似于现在所谓的<i>机器语言</i>，只有相对较少的程序员能够用它编写程序。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">但是，如果你能在虚拟机之上构建虚拟机，情况会怎样？</font>如果有一个用 O 和 X 编写的编码程序，就像我们为倍增机描述的系统一样，情况会怎样？只不过这个新系统的任务是将人类更容易使用和理解的符号（如“向左走”甚至“将此数字加倍”之类的指令）翻译成机器语言。</p><p>It would be too time-consuming to achieve anything significant in programming if programmers had to spend all their time thinking of ways to describe machines in strings of Os and Xs. The O and X code is similar to what is now called <i>machine language</i>, and a relatively small number of programmers are actually able to write programs in it. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">But what if you could build a virtual machine on top of a virtual machine?</font> What if there were a coded program written in terms of Os and Xs, much like the system we described for the doubling machine, except that this new system's task is to translate symbols that humans find easier to use and understand -- instructions like "go left" or even "double this number" -- into machine language?</p>

      <p><i>汇编语言</i>是机器语言的近亲，只不过它使用可识别的单词而不是由 X 和 O 组成的字符串，比机器语言更易于管理，因此大多数程序员在编写视频游戏或文字处理器时都使用汇编语言。汇编语言使用单词而不是数字，因此更容易操纵“方块”（计算机的存储单元）中的信息。您可以使用上述翻译程序（称为汇编程序<i>）</i>将汇编语言翻译成机器语言。</p><p><i>Assembly language</i>, a close relative of machine language except that is uses recognizable words instead of strings of Xs and Os, is a lot more manageable than machine language, so that's what most programmers use when they write video games or word processors. Assembly language makes it easier to manipulate the information in the "squares" -- the memory cells of the computer -- by using words instead of numbers. You use the translation program described above, called an <i>assembler</i>, to translate assembly language into machine language.</p>

      <p>每种不同的微处理器（现代计算机核心的实际硅片硬件）都内置有大约一百种原始机器语言操作（称为“固件”）。当汇编程序遵循汇编语言程序中的指令并使用机器语言与微处理器对话时，虚拟机与实际机器相遇，计算机便能够为启动整个过程的人完成指定的任务。</p><p>Every different microprocessor (the actual silicon chip hardware at the core of every modern computer) has a list of around a hundred primitive machine language operations -- known as "firmware" -- wired into it. When the assembler follows the instructions in the assembly language programs, using machine language to talk to the microprocessor, the virtual machine meets the actual machine, and the computer is able to accomplish the specified task for the human who started the whole process.</p>

      <p>因为你必须用汇编语言完成任务，通过非常具体地告诉计算机在哪里找到你想要的信息，何时将其移动到一个称为<i>累加器</i>的“活动方块”中，以及在处理时将其存储在何处，所以用汇编语言编写任何复杂的东西都可能是一项苦差事——就像用信号量标志写一本书，或者用一把尺子测量一个城市一样。</p><p>Since you have to accomplish tasks in assembly language by telling the computer very specifically where to find the information you want, when to move it into an "active square" called an <i>accumulator</i>, and where to store it when it is processed, writing anything complicated in assembly language can be a chore -- like writing a book with semaphore flags, or measuring a city with a yardstick.</p>

      <p>例如，要用汇编语言将两个数字相加，您必须指定第一个数字并将其赋值给累加器，然后您必须指定第二个数字并指示机器将其添加到累加器中已有的数字。然后您必须指定将答案存储在何处，并发出有关如何将答案发送到打印机或显示器的分步说明。</p><p>For example, to add two numbers in assembly language you have to specify what the first number is and assign it to the accumulator, then you have to specify the second number and instruct the machine to add it to the number already in the accumulator. Then you have to specify where to store the answer, and issue step-by-step instructions on how to send the answer to your printer or monitor.</p>

      <p>显然，用 BASIC 中的程序来完成整个过程会更容易：您只需在键盘上键入一些内容，例如“PRINT 2 + 3”，软件的某些部分就会处理累加器和内存地址。您的打印机会打印出“5”，或者将其显示在您的显示器上，而计算机不会打扰您有关其内部操作的详细信息。</p><p>Obviously, it is easier to do the whole thing in a procedure like the one in BASIC: You simply type something on the keyboard, like "PRINT 2 + 3," and some part of the software takes care of accumulators and memory addresses. Your printer prints out "5," or it is displayed on your monitor, and the computer doesn't bother you with details about its internal operations.</p>

      <p>每种计算机语言的核心都与倍增机非常相似。由于可以描述描述机器的机器，因此在通用图灵机游戏规则下，可以编写一个机器语言程序来描述可以将汇编语言翻译成机器语言的机器。完成此操作后，可以使用此新工具创建比汇编语言更易于管理的另一个通信级别，方法是创建一种更接近英语的代码语言。</p><p>At the core of every computer language is something very much like the doubling machine. Since it is possible to describe machines that describe machines, under the rules of the universal Turing machine game, it is possible to write a machine language program that describes a machine that can translate assembly language into machine language. Having done that, this new tool can be used to create yet another level of communication that is even more manageable than assembly language, by making a code-language that is still closer to English.</p>

      <p>最后一种虚拟机——类似英语的虚拟机——被称为高级编程语言。<i>高级</i>并不意味着一种语言在智力上高超，只是说它是一种由低级机器解释的虚拟机，而低级机器又可能由更低级的机器解释，直到你到达最低级别的开关脉冲，将 O 和 X 转换成电子可读的形式。程序员使用的 BASIC、FORTRAN 和其他语言实际上都是虚拟机，它们由其他虚拟机（相当于上述的汇编程序，称为<i>解释器</i>和<i>编译器</i>）向计算机描述。</p><p>That last virtual machine -- the English-like one -- is called a high-level programming language. <i>High-level</i> doesn't mean that a language is intellectually lofty, only that it us a virtual machine interpreted by a lower-level machine, which in turn may be interpreted by an even lower level machine, until you get to the lowest level of on and off impulses that translate the Os and Xs into electronically readable form. BASIC and FORTRAN and other languages that programmers work with are actually virtual machines that are described to the computer by other virtual machines equivalent to the assemblers mentioned above, known as <i>interpreters</i> and <i>compilers</i>.</p>

      <p>然而，第一个编译器直到 1953 年才被编写出来，这距离图灵的理论论文于 1936 年发表已经过去了 17 年。基于图灵机原理的数字计算机的出现受到第二次世界大战的刺激，而那场战争还远在四年之后。1936 年，克劳德·香农尚未发现乔治·布尔发明的用于形式化逻辑运算的代数与用于描述开关电路的数学相同。约翰·冯·诺依曼和他的同事们尚未设计出存储编程的概念。诺伯特·维纳尚未形式化控制系统中反馈电路的描述。一些关键的电子发展尚未到来。</p><p>The first compiler, however, was not to be written until 1953, seventeen years after Turing's theoretical paper was published in 1936. The emergence of the digital computer, based on the principles of Turing's machine, was stimulated by World War II, which was still four years in the future. In 1936, Claude Shannon had yet to discover that the algebra invented by George Boole to formalize logical operations was identical with the mathematics used to describe switching circuits. John von Neumann and his colleagues had yet to devise the concept of stored programming. Norbert Wiener hadn't formalized the description of feedback circuits in control systems. Several crucial electronic developments were yet to come.</p>

      <p>尽管在 20 世纪 30 年代只有六位元数学家考虑过这类问题，但机器的功能取决于其运行方式的描述这一概念恰好有一个现实世界的应用，并在 20 世纪 30 年代末突然变得非常重要。1940 年，英国政府对图灵的理论产生了浓厚的兴趣。</p><p>Although only a half-dozen metamathematicians thought about such things during the 1930s, the notion of machines whose functions depend on the descriptions of how they operate happened to have one real-world application that suddenly became very important toward the end of the decade. In 1940, the British government developed an intense interest in Turing's theories.</p>

    <font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">
      代号为“Ultra”的绝密项目在代号为“Intrepid”的情报官员的指导下，缴获了德国秘密密码机“Enigma”，并将其带到伦敦。该机器使纳粹最高指挥部能够以不可破解的密码形式向战地指挥官发送命令。尽管英国情报部门掌握了这台机器，但他们仍然对编码机制感到困惑。即使是最好的老式密码学家也无法提出解决方案。

      </font></font><p>英国最高统帅部招募了才华横溢的数学家、工程师和逻辑学家，无意中创建了人工智能领域最具开创性的研究小组之一。其中包括当时年仅 22 岁的唐纳德·米奇，他后来成为英国领先的机器智能研究人员。另一位后来脱颖而出的年轻同事是 IJ 古德，他是个爱开玩笑的人，曾写信给女王陛下，建议封他为贵族，因为这样他的朋友看到​​他来的时候就会不得不说：“老天，古德勋爵来了。”</p><p>The British high command recruited brilliant mathematicians, engineers, and logicians, inadvertently creating one of the seminal research groups in the field that was to be known as artificial intelligence. Among them was Donald Michie, then only twenty-two, who was later to become the leading British machine intelligence researcher. Another very young colleague who later distinguished himself was I. J. Good, a prankster who once wrote Her Majesty the Queen suggesting that he be made peer of the realm, because then his friends would be forced to remark, "Good Lord, here comes Lord Good," when they saw him coming.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.cranfield.ac.uk/CCC/BPark/">布莱切利园</a>远不如奥马哈海滩出名，但许多历史学家认为，欧洲战争的胜利很大程度上归功于英国赫特福德郡一栋戒备森严的维多利亚式豪宅，一群成功破​​译德国密码的思想家。这些才华横溢、年轻而又不拘一格的密码破译者在执行这项绝密行动时就住在布莱切利园附近。其中一位密码破译者是 28 岁的艾伦·图灵。</p><p>The place known as <a href="http://www.cranfield.ac.uk/CCC/BPark/">Bletchley Park</a> is far less famous than Omaha Beach, but many historians contend that the European war was won, in large part, in a closely guarded Victorian mansion in Hertfordshire, England, by the group of thinkers who succeeded in breaking the German code. The brilliant, young, unorthodox code-crackers were housed near Bletchley Park while they performed their role in the top-secret operation. One of the code breakers was twenty-eight-year-old Alan Turing.</p>

      <p>图灵性格古怪，喜欢玩乐，衣冠不整，诚实得令人痛苦，反复无常，喜欢内省，才华横溢，但社交能力略差。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">图灵是后来出现的那些笨手笨脚、超凡脱俗的计算机黑客的早期典范</font>：他衣着邋遢，热衷于下棋，喜欢儿童广播节目，热衷于长跑。（有时他甚至用系在腰间的闹钟来计时。）甚至他的一位亲密朋友也形容他的讲话“尖锐的口吃和咯咯的笑声，甚至连他的朋友都感到不安。”</p><p>Turing was eccentric, fun-loving, disheveled, painfully honest, erratic, introspective, prodigiously and elegantly brilliant, and somewhat inept socially. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Turing was an early model of the similar maladroit and analogously otherworldly computer hackers</font> who were to come later: He was a sloppy dresser and a passionate chessplayer, fond of children's radio programs and dedicated to long-distance running. (Sometimes he even timed himself with an alarm clock tied around his waist.) Even one of his few intimate friends described his speech as "a shrill stammer and crowing laugh which told upon the nerves even of his friends."</p>

      <p>他从未真正掌握汽车的驾驶技巧，考虑到图灵的思维方式远离了现实道路，汽车可能更安全。他更喜欢剑桥大学教授的破旧自行车。自行车和他跑二三十英里去参加会议的习惯是布莱切利地区关于图灵的各种趣闻轶事的主题。图灵曾因戴着<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">防毒面具骑自行车而被当地警察拘留，图灵声称这减轻了他的花粉症。</font></p><p>He never quite got the hang of automobiles, which was probably safer, considering the way Turing's mind wandered far away from the realities of the roadway. He preferred the battered bicycle of the Cambridge don. The bicycle and his habit of running twenty or thirty miles to attend a meeting were the objects of sundry anecdotes about "the Prof," as Turing was known around Bletchley. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">He was once detained by the local constable for bicycling around in a gas mask, which Truing claimed alleviated his hay fever.</font></p>

      <p>图灵和他在布莱切利园的同事们最终破解了恩尼格玛密码，他们设计了一系列机器，分别称为“炸弹机”、“罗宾逊机”，以及最终的“巨人机”。他们的目的是什么？当然是为了模仿“恩尼格玛机”！</p><p>Turing and his colleagues at Bletchley Park ended up solving the Enigma enigma by devising a series of machines known as "bombes," "the Robinsons," and a culminating contraption known as "Colossus." Their purpose? To imitate "Enigma," of course!</p>

      <p>按照图灵 1936 年的定义，布莱切利园的设备绝不是通用机器，但它们确实运用了图灵思想的重要方面。解码机使用高速设备来输入纸带上编码的指令，使用电路对编码信息执行简单但繁琐的逻辑运算，于 1943 年开始运行。这些机器使英国人能够破解恩尼格玛密码，部分原因是它们模仿了敌方编码机的关键功能。</p><p>The Bletchley Park devices were by no means universal machines by Turing's 1936 definition, but they did use important aspects of Turing's ideas. Using high-speed devices for feeding instructions encoded on paper tapes, and electrical circuitry for performing simple but tedious logical operations upon coded messages, the decoding machines began operating in 1943. The machines enabled the British to crack Enigma's code, in part by imitating crucial functions of the enemy coding machine.</p>

      <p>这些年轻的学者破解了密码这一事实是一个无比重要的秘密，也许是战争中保密最严的秘密，因为布莱切利机器之所以能够继续成功破译德国信息，取决于纳粹最高指挥官是否继续不知道他们的牢不可破的密码已被破解。</p><p>The fact that these young academecians had broken the code was a secret of unparalleled importance, perhaps the most closely kept secret of the war, because the ability of the Bletchley machines to continue to successfully decode German messages depended upon the Nazi high command's continuing ignorance that their unbreakable code had been cracked.</p>

      <p>尽管这项工作意义重大，但战时官僚作风和围绕该项目的层层保密措施，有可能抵消 1943 年 Enigma 密码机的突破为盟军带来的惊人战略优势。图灵直接向温斯顿·丘吉尔求助，丘吉尔将该项目列为重中之重。在整个战争期间，密码不断被破解，1944 年和 1945 年，这些宝贵信息被伪装成其他情报，然后传递给大西洋上的英国指挥官。</p><p>Despite the importance of this work, early wartime bureaucracy and the thickets of secrecy surrounding the project threatened to cancel the incredible strategic advantage the 1943 Enigma breakthrough had handed the Allies. Turing appealed directly to Winston Churchill, who gave the project top priority. The codes continued to be cracked throughout the duration of the war, and in 1944 and 1945 the valuable information was disguised in the form of other kinds of intelligence, then relayed to British commanders in the Atlantic.</p>

      <p>关键的 U 型潜艇冲突形势发生逆转，入侵欧洲成为可能，这在很大程度上要归功于图灵在海军版 Enigma 密码机上的成功。德国人从未察觉，而图灵在元数学方面的深奥工作最终被证明具有极为实际的应用。由于先进密码分析方法在冷战时期的战略意义日益增强，该项目在战后数十年一直处于保密状态。1945 年之后，很少有人知道图灵为战争努力做出了重要贡献，但没有人知道具体是什么，因为他仍然不被允许提及。</p><p>The tide of the critical U-boat conflict was turned, and the invasion of Europe became possible, largely because of Turing's success with the naval version of the Enigma. The Germans never caught on, and Turing's esoteric work in metamathematics turned out to have dramatically practical applications after all. Because of the growing strategic significance of advanced cryptanalysis methods in the cold war era, the project continued to be held secret for decades after the war. After 1945, a very few people knew that Turing had done something important for the war effort but nobody knew exactly what it was, because he still wasn't allowed to allude to it.</p>

      <p>图灵在布莱切利学院的角色并不是他在战争期间做出的唯一贡献。他被派往美国，当时乘坐北大西洋游轮确实很危险，但他与美国情报部门分享了英国密码分析进展的关键方面，并将他的情报提供给了几个与战争有关的美国科学项目。</p><p>His role at Bletchley wasn't Turing's only wartime contribution. He was sent over to America, at a time when it was indeed dangerous to take a North Atlantic cruise, to share crucial aspects of British cryptanalytic progress with American intelligence and to lend his intelligence to several American war-related scientific projects.</p>

      <p>正是在这次美国之行中，图灵获得了电子学的实用知识。图灵第一次接触到当时被称为“电子管”的东西，是在他研究使用雷达研究中产生的奇特真空管设备来加速布莱切利密码破译员所需的大量信息处理任务的可能性时。在美国，图灵参与了另一个高度机密的项目，这次涉及<i>语音</i>加密——间谍小说中称之为“扰频器”。由于这项代号为“黛利拉”的设备的工作，图灵从业内一些最优秀的工程师那里学到了电子学知识——纽约贝尔实验室的工程师（其中包括一位名叫克劳德·香农的天才，他是另一种类型的天才，他将再次出现在故事​​中）。</p><p>It was during this American visit that Turing picked up practical knowledge of electronics. Turing had first become acquainted with what were then called "electronic valves" when he investigated the possibility of using the exotic vacuum-tube devices coming out of radar research to speed up the massive information-processing tasks needed by the Bletchley code-breakers. In America, Turing was involved in another hypersecret project, this time involving <i>voice</i> encryption -- what the spy novels call "scramblers." Because of this work on the device that was code-named "Delilah," Turing learned his electronics from some of the best in the business -- the engineers at Bell Laboratories in New York (including one named Claude Shannon, a prodigy of a different kind, who will enter the story again).</p>

      <p>战争结束时，人们认识到电子技术可用于加速逻辑开关电路，并有可能构建图灵通用机器的工作模型，这促使英国政府再次支持自动计算设备。这一次，它不叫“分析机”，而是“<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">自动计算机”</font> ——也就是后来的<i>ACE</i>。二战结束时，尽管<a href="#OEBPS/Text/4.html">莫奇利和埃克特</a>（ENIAC 的发明者）在美国开展了工作，但英国仍然处于制造第一台真正的电子数字计算机的竞争中处于有利地位。但不幸的是，对于艾伦·图灵来说，战后英国的计算机研究并没有像美国那样积极和大规模地开展。</p><p>By the end of the war, the knowledge that electronic technology could be used to speed up logical switching circuits, and the possibility of building working models of Turing's universal machines, led His Majesty's government to once again support an automatic calculating device. This time, it was not called the "Analytical Engine," but the <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"Automatic Computing Engine"</font> -- or <i>ACE</i>, as it became known. At the end of World War II, despite the work in America of <a href="#OEBPS/Text/4.html">Mauchly and Eckert</a> (ENIAC's inventors), the British were in an excellent position to win the race to build the first true electronic digital computer. But unfortunately for Alan Turing, postwar computer research in Britain was not pursued as aggressively and on the same scale as the American effort.</p>

      <p>当然，图灵参与了战后计算机开发工作，但并非核心人物，也绝对没有控制权。事实证明，他英勇而秘密的战争工作使他成为科学政治的受害者，而不是他们的主人。他关于 ACE 硬件和软件设计的报告雄心勃勃，如果他最初设想的机器在设计后立即制造出来，那将使 ENIAC 汗颜。</p><p>Turing, of course, was in the thick of the postwar computer development effort, but not at the center, and certainly not in control. As it turned out, his heroic and secret war work helped to make him the victim of scientific politics, not their master. His reports on the hardware and software design for ACE were ambitious, and if the machine he originally envisioned had been constructed as soon as it was designed, it would have put ENIAC to shame.</p>

      <p>当其他人接连接管国家物理实验室和曼彻斯特大学的计算机项目时，图灵徘徊在政治权力的边缘，他专心致志地建造他长期想象的通用机器之一。在这方面，他受到同行普遍的态度的阻碍，他们认为剑桥上层中产阶级的理论家根本不会参与“工程”。但严格遵守社会标准并不是艾伦的强项。他继续推进他所知道的重要的事情——软件科学的发展。</p><p>While a succession of other men took over the direction of the computer projects at the National Physical Laboratory and at the University of Manchester, Turing hovered at the periphery of the political power while he put his mind to the actual construction of one of his long-imaginary universal machines. In this he was hampered by the attitude prevalent among his peers that upper-middle-class Cambridge theoreticians simply did not get their hands dirty with "engineering." But rigid conformity to social standards was not Alan's strong point. He forged ahead with what he knew was important -- the development of a science of software.</p>
    <font size="+3">编程</font>

    <font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">
      图灵关于计算机设计正确方法的想法强调，需要将计算能力融入程序，而不是硬件。</font></font><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他对编程操作（或后来被称为“编码”）特别感兴趣，</font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">通过编程，真正有趣的数学运算，甚至可能是“思考”本身，最终可能会被电子计算机模拟。虽然图灵首次编写编程语言的尝试以今天的标准来看可能很粗糙，但他的想法比当时可用的硬件状态要先进得多。

      </font></font><p>当他的同事和美国团队忙着组装最基本的电子数字计算机模型时，图灵的眼光已经远远超出了 20 世纪 40 年代末和 50 年代初制造的笨重装置。他的公开演讲和私人谈话表明，他坚信电子技术的成本将下降，而其作为计算媒介的功能将在未来几十年内增强。他还相信，这些设备的功能将很快超越其最初的用途。</p><p>While his colleagues and the American team scrambled to put together the most elementary models of electronic digital computers, Turing was already looking far beyond the clumsy contraptions constructed in the late forties and early fifties. His public talks and private conversations indicated a strong belief that the cost of electronic technology would drop while its power as a medium for computation would increase in the coming decades. He also believed that the capabilities of these devices would quickly extend beyond their original purposes.</p>

      <p>计算数字的两倍、开平方根或破译密码的程序都是方便的工具，但图灵知道计算只是计算机可以模仿的形式系统之一。特别是，他看到了他的理论机器的简单“指令表”如何成为强大语法的元素，机器可以使用这些语法来修改自己的操作。</p><p>Programs for doubling numbers or extracting square roots or breaking codes are handy tools, but Turing was aware that calculation was only one of the kinds of formal systems that could be imitated by a computational device. In particular, he saw how the simple "instruction tables" of his theoretical machines could become elements of a powerful grammar that the machines could use to modify their own operations.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">图灵的一项创新</font>源于这样一个事实：基于布尔逻辑的计算机只能对二进制数形式的输入进行操作（即，用两个符号表示的 2 的幂数），而人类习惯于用十进制书写数字（用十个符号表示的 10 的幂数）。图灵参与了指令表的编写，该指令表可以<i>自动</i>将人为书写的十进制数转换为机器可读的二进制数。如果可以将加法、乘法和十进制到二进制的转换等基本运算以指令表的形式输入到机器中，图灵认为可以建立此类表的<i>层次结构</i>。程序员不再需要担心一步一步重复编写每一条操作指令，从而可以自由地编写更复杂操作的程序。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">One innovation</font> of Turing's stemmed from the fact that computers based on Boolean logic operate only on input that is in the form of binary numbers (i.e., numbers expressed in powers of two, using only two symbols), while humans are used to writing numbers in the decimal system (in which numbers are expressed in powers of ten, using ten symbols. Turing was involved in the writing of instruction tables that <i>automatically</i> converted human-written decimals to machine-readable binary digits. If basic operations like addition, multiplication, and decimal-to-binary conversion could be fed to the machine in terms of instruction tables, Turing saw that it would be possible to build up <i>heirarchies</i> of such tables. The programmer would no longer have to worry about writing each and every operational instruction, step by repetitive step, and would thus be freed to write programs for more complex operations.</p>

      <p>战争结束后不久，图灵写了一份提案，讨论了他长期假设的机器的硬件和“编码”原理。他预见到这些指令表的创建将成为整个过程中特别关键的部分，因为他认识到计算机的最终功能并不总是严格受工程考虑因素的限制，而是受当时还不知道的“软件”因素的限制。</p><p>Turing wrote a proposal shortly after the end of the war in which he discussed both the hardware and "coding" principles of his long-hypothetical machines. He foresaw that the creation of these instruction tables would become particularly critical parts of the entire process, for he recognized that the ultimate capabilities of computers would not always be strictly limited by engineering considerations, but by considerations of what was not yet known as "software."</p>

      <p>图灵不仅预见到了软件工程最终会比硬件工程更加困难和耗时，而且预见到了后来被称为“调试”的重要性：</p><p>Turing not only anticipated the fact that software engineering would end up more difficult and time-consuming than hardware engineering, but anticipated the importance of what came to be known as "debugging":</p>

      
        <font size="-1">指令表必须由具有计算经验和一定解谜能力的数学家来制作。可能有大量此类工作要做，因为每个已知过程都必须在某个阶段转换成指令表形式。这项工作将在机器建造过程中进行，以避免在机器交付和结果产生之间出现一些延迟。由于几乎看不见的障碍，必然会有延迟，因为在某种程度上，让障碍存在总比花时间设计没有障碍要好（这个过程需要多少年？）。构建指令表的过程应该非常有趣。它不会真正成为苦差事，因为任何非常机械的过程都可以交给机器本身。</font>
      除了德国发明家康拉德·楚泽 ( <a href="http://www.zib-berlin.de/Prospect/zuse.html">Konrad Zuse)</a>的几乎同样先进的思想（英国和美国科学家早已不知道这些思想）之外，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">图灵在战后撰写的关于指令表构建中固有的逻辑复杂性和数学挑战的著作是计算机编程艺术和科学的第一步重要进步。</font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">图灵对创建编码指令表的复杂性着迷，但他也对使用真正复杂的编程语言可以做什么感兴趣。他最初的元数学形式主义源于他试图将人类思维过程与形式系统的结构联系起来，图灵仍然对自动形式系统（计算机）有朝一日可能模拟人类推理方面的可能性很感兴趣。

      </font></font><p>图灵提出的有关通用机器能力的最深刻的问题集中在计算机引擎模拟人类思维的假设未来能力上。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">如果机器有朝一日可以帮助编写自己的程序，那么机器是否真的能够执行类似人类思维的活动，哪怕只是在原则上？</font>他在 1936 年发表的论文发表在一份数学期刊上，但它最终为数学领域之外的一个全新研究领域——计算机科学——奠定了基础。1950 年，图灵发表了另一篇影响深远的文章；这篇论文的标题更简单，叫做《计算机器与智能》，发表在哲学期刊《<i>心灵》</i>上。图灵<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">用相对简短的文字，使用的工具并不比常识更深奥，而且绝对没有数学公式，提出了计算机科学最大胆的分支——人工智能领域。</font></p><p>The most profound questions Turing raised concerning the capabilities of universal machines were centered around this hypothesized future ability of computing engines to simulate human thought. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">If machinery might someday help in creating its own programming, would machinery ever be capable, even in principle, of performing activities that resembled human thought?</font> His 1936 paper was published in a mathematical journal, but it eventually created the foundation of a whole new field of investigation beyond the horizons of mathematics -- computer science. In 1950, Turing published another article that was to have profound impact; the piece, more simply titled "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," was published in the philosophical journal <i>Mind</i>. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">In relatively few words, using tools no more esoteric than common sense, and absolutely no mathematical formulas, Turing provided the boldest subspecialty of computer science -- the field of artificial intelligence.</font></p>

      <p>尽管图灵假设的机器很简单，但数学期刊上的正式描述却让人读起来很费劲。然而，这篇 1950 年的文章值得任何对人工智能问题感兴趣的人阅读。第一句话听起来仍然像图灵无疑想要的那样直接和具有挑衅性：“我建议考虑‘机器能思考吗？’这个问题。”</p><p>Despite the simplicity of Turing's hypothetical machine, the formal description in the mathematics journal makes very heavy reading. The 1950 article, however, is worth reading by anyone interested in the issue of artificial intelligence. The very first sentence still sounds as direct and provocative as Turing undoubtedly intended it to be: "I propose to consider the question 'Can machines think?' "</p>

      <p>以典型的图灵风格，他通过描述一个游戏来开始思考深层人工智能问题！他称这个游戏为“模仿游戏”，但历史上它被称为<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">“图灵测试”。</font>他写道，让我们先把机器智能问题放在一边，考虑一个由三个人玩的游戏——一个男人、一个女人和一个询问者（无论男女），询问者位于与其他两个人分开的房间里。游戏的目标是向另一个房间里的人提问，并最终仅根据答案确定哪个是男人，哪个是女人。为了向玩家隐藏外表、声音和其他感官线索，询问是通过电传打字机进行的。</p><p>In typical Turing style, he began his consideration of deep AI issues by describing -- a game! He called this one "The Imitation Game," but history knows it as the <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"Turing Test."</font> Let us begin, he wrote, by putting aside the question of machine intelligence and consider a game played by three people -- a man, a woman, and an interrogator of either gender, who is located in a room apart from the other two. The object of the game is to ask questions of the people in the other room, and to eventually identify which one is the man and which is the woman -- on the basis of the answers alone. In order to disguise the appearance, voice, and other sensory clues from the players, the interrogation takes place over a teletype.</p>

      <p>图灵随后要求我们用一台<i>机器</i>代替其中一位未知玩家，并为游戏制作一个新的对象：这一次，询问者要根据电传打字机的对话猜测另一个房间里的哪个人是人，哪个人是机器。在描述这种对话可能如何进行时，图灵引用了这种对话的一个简短“样本”：</p><p>Turing then asks us to substitute a <i>machine</i> for one of the unknown players and make a new object for the game: This time, the interrogator is to guess, on the basis of the teletyped conversation, which inhabitant of the other room is a human being and which one is a machine. In describing how such a conversation might go, Turing quoted a brief "specimen" of such a dialog:</p>

      <div style="margin-left:2em"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">
        问：请给我写一首关于福斯桥的十四行诗。</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">
        答：这首诗别算我一份。我从来不会写诗。</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">

        答：（停顿 15 秒后）R-R8 死将。
      </font></font></div>

      <p>请注意，如果此对话是与机器进行的，则它能够进行错误的算术运算（39457 + 7064 不<i>等于</i>105621）并同时进行像样的国际象棋比赛。</p><p>Note that if this dialog is with a machine, it is able to do faulty arithmetic (39457 + 7064 does <i>not</i> equal 105621) and play decent chess at the same time.</p>

      <p>在将模仿游戏确立为判断机器是否智能的标准之后，在继续考虑对人工智能概念的各种反对意见之前，图灵解释了自己对此事的看法：</p><p>Having established his imitation game as the criterion for determining whether or not a machine is intelligent, and before proceeding to consider various objections to the idea of artificial intelligence, Turing explained his own beliefs in the matter:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">……我相信，大约五十年后，我们就可以对计算机进行编程……让它们能够很好地玩模仿游戏，以至于普通的询问者在五分钟的询问后，做出正确识别的几率不会超过 70%。最初的问题“机器能思考吗？”我认为毫无意义，不值得讨论。然而，我相信，在本世纪末，词语的使用和受过教育的观点将发生巨大变化，人们将能够谈论机器思考，而不会期望它被反驳。</font>
      

      <p>在论文的其余部分，图灵提出了一些反对人工智能可能性的主要论点，并进行了反驳。图灵给这些论点起的标题显示出他异想天开的性格：“神学反对”、“‘把头埋在沙子里’的反对”、“数学反对”、“洛夫莱斯夫人的反对”、“意识论证”、“神经系统连续性论证”、“行为非正式性论证”和“超感知论证”。</p><p>In the rest of the paper, Turing presented, then countered, a number of principal objections to the possibility of artificial intelligence. The titles Turing gave these objections reveal his whimsical streak "The Theological Objection," "The 'Heads in the Sand' Objection," "The Mathematical Objection," "Lady Lovelace's Objection," "The Argument from Consciousness," "Arguments from the Continuity in the Nervous System," "The Argument from Informality of Behavior," and "The Argument from Extrasensory Perception."</p>

      <p>在这篇论文中，图灵通过反驳艾达在其评论中提出的反对意见，证明了他对该领域的智力前身的了解，艾达在其评论中提出了一个至今仍被大多数人在争论机器智能可能性时引用的问题：“分析引擎不具备<i>创造</i>任何东西的本领。它可以做<i>任何我们知道如何命令它</i>做的事情。图灵指出，如果艾达像他一样看到电子设备可以表现出一种原始形式的“学习”的证据，她可能会说不同的话，通过这种学习，程序最终将能够掌握从未专门编程过的任务，但这些任务是从预先编程的反复试验技术中产生的。</p><p>In this paper, Turing made evident his knowledge of his intellectual antecedents in this field by countering the objection raised by Ada in her commentary, in which she stated the problem that is still cited by most people in an argument about the possibility of machine intelligence: "The Analytical Engine has no pretensions to <i>originate</i> anything. It can do <i>whatever we know how to order it</i> to perform. Turing pointed out that Ada might have spoken differently if she had seen, as he had, evidence that electronic equipment could be made to exhibit a primitive form of "learning," by which programs would be able to eventually master tasks that had never been specifically programmed, but which emerged from trial-and-error techniques that had been preprogrammed.</p>

      <p>1954 年 6 月，图灵不幸去世，年仅 42 岁，这也使他在计算机、数学和其他领域的工作戛然而止。图灵不仅是个天才，还是个同性恋。20 世纪 50 年代初，两名同性恋间谍叛逃苏联后，英国对任何被发现有违禁性行为的人而言，都是一个极其恶劣的环境——尤其是对于那些脑子里有比雷达或原子弹更机密的东西的人来说。图灵被捕并被判犯有“严重猥亵罪”，并被判缓刑，条件是他必须接受羞辱性的、使身体虚弱的女性荷尔蒙注射。图灵的战争记录仍然过于机密，甚至无法在他的辩护中提及。</p><p>Turing's work in computing, mathematics, and other fields was cut short by his tragic death in June, 1954, at the age of forty-two. Besides being a genius, Turing was also a homosexual. During the early 1950s, following the defection of two homosexual spies to the Soviet Union, Great Britain was an especially harsh environment for anyone caught engaging in prohibited sexual acts -- especially for someone who had something even more secret than radar or the atomic bomb in his head. Turing was arrested and convicted of "gross indecency," and sentenced to probation on the condition that he submit to humiliating and physically debilitating female hormone injections. Turing's war record was still too secret to even be mentioned in his defense.</p>

      <p>图灵忍受了荷尔蒙和公众的耻辱，悄悄地开始为生物学数学基础领域的又一轮辉煌工作奠定基础——如果这项工作能够完成，其影响可能比他在可计算数字方面的工作更为重大。被捕后的近两年里，同性恋恐惧症和“国家安全”压力愈发强烈，图灵在工作中意识到，他正在被他战时的工作所保护的政府所摧毁。1954 年 6 月，艾伦·图灵躺在床上，咬了一口苹果，将其浸入氰化物中，然后又咬了一口。</p><p>Turing put up with the hormones and the public disgrace, and quietly began to break ground for another cycle of brilliant work in the mathematical foundations of biology -- work that might have had even more momentous consequences, if it had been completed, than his work with computable numbers. For nearly two years after his arrest, during which time the homophobic and "national security" pressures grew even stronger, Turing worked with the ironic knowledge that he was being destroyed by the very government his wartime work had been instrumental in preserving. In June, 1954, Alan Turing lay down on his bed, took a bite from an apple, dipped it in cyanide, and bit again.</p>

      <p>和艾达一样，艾伦·图灵的不循规蹈矩也是他失败的原因之一，和她一样，他也看到了软件的无限可能，远远超出了当时计算机器的极限。和她一样，他死得太早了。</p><p>Like Ada, Alan Turing's unconventionality was part of his undoing, and like her he saw the software possibilities that stretched far beyond the limits of the computing machinery available at the time. Like her, he died too young.</p>

      <p>其他战时研究项目和其他杰出的数学家都知道图灵的工作，尤其是在美国，那里的科学家突然成为核时代的权力人物。大西洋两岸的军方资助的研究和开发团队继续研究他们自己的数字计算机。其中一些独立的研究工作源于弹道学工作。其他研究则与制造第一枚核裂变和核聚变炸弹的努力有关。</p><p>Other wartime research projects and other brilliant mathematicians were aware of Turing's work, particularly in the United States, where scientists were suddenly emerging into the nuclear age as figures of power. Military-sponsored research-and-development teams on both sides of the Atlantic continued to work on digital computers of their own. A few of these independent research efforts grew out of Ballistics work. Others were connected with the effort to build the first nuclear fission and fusion bombs.</p>

      <p>从巴贝奇到图灵之间已过去了一百多年。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">如果第二次世界大战没有提供一流的工程团队、几乎无限的资金，以及在数学史上计算理论使计算机成为可能的那个时刻将科学发现应用于现实问题的意愿，计算机时代可能还要推迟几十年。</font>虽然这个想法无疑会在后人心中产生共鸣，但自从图灵解释了计算之后，计算机的发展就是一个不可避免的工程步骤。</p><p>Over a hundred years had passed between Babbage and Turing. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The computer age might have been delayed for decades longer if World War II had not provided top-notch engineering teams, virtually unlimited funds, and the will to apply scientific findings to real-world problems at the exact point in the history of mathematics when the theory of computation made computers possible.</font> While the idea undoubtedly would have resonated in later minds, the development of the computer was an inevitable engineering step once Turing explained computation.</p>

      <p>当一位同样甚至更有天赋的思想家偶然发现了图灵一直在追求的相同思想时，图灵的理论见解被转化为可行的机器并非历史的偶然。计算理论是一个非常重要的一步——但如果你被限制在一个沿着磁带滚动的盒子里，擦除 O 并写入 X，你根本无法在相当短的时间内执行非常复杂的计算。软件和硬件历史的下一步是由编程历史上另一位独特、可能不可或缺的人物——约翰·冯·诺依曼的思想所促成的。</p><p>When an equally, perhaps even more gifted thinker happened upon the same ideas Turing had been pursuing, it was no accident of history that Turing's theoretical insights were converted to workable machinery. A theory of computation is one very important step -- but you simply cannot perform very sophisticated computations in a decently short interval if you are restricted to a box that chugs along a tape, erasing Os and writing Xs. The next step in both software and hardware history was precipitated by the thinking of another unique, probably indispensable figure in the history of programming -- John von Neumann.</p>

      <p>战前，图灵曾在普林斯顿高等研究院与冯·诺依曼共事。冯·诺依曼希望这位年轻的天才继续留在他身边，作为他的门生和助手，但图灵回到了剑桥。冯·诺依曼对图灵工作含义的深刻理解后来成为不同研究领域融合的重要因素，并导致了第一台数字计算机的发明。</p><p>Turing had worked with von Neumann before the war, at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study. Von Neumann wanted the young genius to stay on with him, as his prot�g� and assistant, but Turing returned to Cambridge. Von Neumann's profound understanding of the implications of Turing's work later became a significant factor in the convergence of different lines of research that led to the invention of the first digital computers.</p>

      <p>人类很少会培养出像冯·诺依曼这样的博学者，然后让他在人类历史上最大的危机中投入工作。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">冯·诺依曼不仅仅是图灵思想的修饰者——他还在数学家的抽象概念和试图创造第一代电子计算机的人们的实际关注之间架起了桥梁。</font>他是设计第一台电子计算机软件和创建计算机物理架构模型的团队的关键成员。他还为图灵创建真正的编程语言的第一步增添了优雅和力量。</p><p>It isn't often that the human race produces a polymath like von Neumann, then sets him to work in the middle of the biggest crisis in human history. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Von Neumann was far more than an embellisher of Turing's ideas -- he built the bridge between the abstractions of mathematicians and the practical concerns of the people who were trying to create the first generation of electronic computers.</font> He was a key member of the team who designed the software for the first electronic computer and who created the model for the physical architecture of computers. He also added elegance and power to Turing's first steps towards creating a true programming language.</p>

      在他生命的最后，他是一个美国人，也是美国科学政策和外交政策的幕后力量。但这只是在不同国家和思想领域中几个同样杰出的身份中的最后一个。亚诺什·诺伊曼，又名“Jansci”，是一位天才的年轻化学工程师，20 世纪 20 年代初在匈牙利成为数学家和逻辑学家。约翰·冯·诺伊曼是 20 世纪 20 年代末德国哥廷根的精英量子物理学革命者之一。从 1933 年直到他去世，他都是新泽西州普林斯顿、新墨西哥州洛斯阿拉莫斯和华盛顿特区的约翰·冯·诺伊曼，教授和总统都称他为“约翰尼”。

      </font></font><p>艾达和巴贝奇只能梦想着他们的设备有一天能够投入使用。图灵在得到一台名副其实的计算机之前，不幸成为政治事件的牺牲品。然而，约翰尼不仅设法制造出他的机器，并用它们创建了软件的第一个工作原理——而且他最终还告诉了政府如何使用这项新技术。他所做出的贡献远不止是第一次推动美国发展计算机技术的努力。</p><p>Ada and Babbage could only dream of the day their device could be put to work.

      <p><a href="http://www.needham.mec.edu/NPS_Web_docs/High_School/cur/mp/index.html">冯·诺依曼是曼哈顿计划</a>科学团队中非常重要、可能不可或缺的成员。奥本海默、费米、泰勒、玻尔、劳伦斯以及历史上最有天赋的科学人才聚集地的其他成员都对冯·诺依曼的才智感到敬畏，就像见过他的其他人一样。更令人印象深刻的是，他们和其他人一样依赖他的数学判断。在那个由世界级物理学家、化学家、数学家和工程师组成的银河系中，冯·诺依曼负责数学计算，这是罕见的荣誉，他们的所有理论——以及他们的“小玩意”的功能——都依赖于这些计算。</p><p>Von Neumann was a very important, probably indispensable, member of the <a href="http://www.needham.mec.edu/NPS_Web_docs/High_School/cur/mp/index.html">Manhattan Project</a> scientific team. Oppenheimer, Fermi, Teller, Bohr, Lawrence, and the other members of the most gifted scientific gathering of minds in history were as awed by Johnny's intellect as anyone else who ever met him. More impressively, they were as reliant on his mathematical judgment as anyone else. In that galactic cluster of world-class physicists, chemists, mathematicians, and engineers, it was a rare tribute that von Neumann was put in charge of the mathematical calculations upon which all their theories -- and the functioning of their "gadget" -- would depend.</p>

      <p>似乎他对第一枚核武器和第一台计算机的开发所做出的重大贡献还不足以仅代表一个人，他还是最早提出图灵和库尔特·哥德尔在 20 世纪 30 年代所回答问题的逻辑学家之一。他是现代博弈论科学的共同创始人（继承了巴贝奇的遗志），运筹学的创始人之一（有趣的是，他还推动了巴贝奇首先探索的领域），量子物理学的积极参与者，最早提出计算机电路和大脑过程之间的相似性和差异性的人之一，也是自图灵以来最早研究编码数学与生物繁殖之谜之间关系的科学家之一。</p><p>As if his significant contributions to the development of the first nuclear weapons and the first computers were not enough for one man, he was also one of the original logicians who had posed the questions that Turing and Kurt G�del answered in the 1930s. He was a cofounder of the modern science of game theory (picking up where Babbage left off), one of the founders of operational research (also, curiously, advancing a field first explored by Babbage), an active participant in the creation of quantum physics, one of the first people to suggest analogies and differences between computer circuits and brain processes, and one of the first scientists since Turing to examine the relationship between the mathematics of code-making and the mystery of biological reproduction.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">冯·诺依曼最终成为核能、核武器和洲际弹道武器领域的关键决策者：</font>他是原子能委员会主任，也是洲际弹道导弹委员会有影响力的成员。将军和参议员很幸运能得到任命。即使在他临终之际，世界上最有权势的人也聚集在他身边进行最后的会诊。据原子能委员会前主席刘易斯·施特劳斯上将说：“在生命的最后时刻，在沃尔特里德医院举行了一次戏剧性的会议，国防部长和他的副手、陆军、海军和空军部长以及所有军事参谋长聚集在他的床边，聆听他最后的忠告和智慧。”</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Von Neumann ended up a key policy-maker in the fields of nuclear power, nuclear weapons, and intercontinental ballistic weaponry:</font> he was the director of the Atomic Energy Commission and an influential member of the ICBM Committee. Generals and senators were lucky to get an appointment. Even when he was dying, the most powerful men in the world gathered around for a final consultation. According to Admiral Lewis Strauss, former chairman of the Atomic Energy commission: "On one dramatic occasion near the end, there was a meeting at Walter Reed Hospital where, gathered around his bedside and attentive to his last words of advice and wisdom, were the secretary of Defense and his Deputies, the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and all the military Chiefs of Staff."</p>

      <p>根据公开记录和传记作者的说法，约翰·冯·诺依曼的政治观点无疑根植于他匈牙利上流社会的过去，他的观点明确而极端。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他不仅利用自己的科学专业知识加速核武器和计算机制导导弹的发展，还建议军事和政治领导人考虑在“预防性战争”中使用这些美国新发明对抗苏联。 （在他去世后不久发表的</font><i>《生活》</i>杂志的一篇文章中，冯·诺依曼说：“如果你说为什么不明天轰炸他们，我会说，为什么不今天。如果你说五点钟，我会说为什么不一点钟。”）</p><p>John von Neumann's political views, undoubtedly rooted in his upper-class Hungarian past, were unequivocal and extreme, according to the public record and his biographers. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">He not only used his scientific expertise to hasten and accelerate the development of nuclear weapons and computer-guided missiles, but counseled military and political leaders to think about using these new American inventions against the USSR in a "preventive war."</font> (In an article in <i>Life</i> magazine, published shortly after he died, von Neumann was quoted as saying: "If you say why not bomb them tomorrow, I say, why not today. If you say at five o'clock, I say why not one o'clock.")</p>

      <p>与图灵（图灵战前在普林斯顿大学学习，战时一起工作）相比，冯·诺依曼是一个老练、世故、善于交际的人，他在普林斯顿高等研究院和洛斯阿拉莫斯梅萨任职期间，因每周举办鸡尾酒会和妻子而闻名。他有一笔可观的私人收入，每年还从研究院获得 1 万美元的额外收入。众所周知，他能用多种语言讲出大量笑话，对粗俗的打油诗了如指掌，开车时非常鲁莽，经常撞坏汽车，但每次都能奇迹般地毫发无损。</p><p>In contrast to Turing, whom he knew from Turing's prewar stay at Princeton and from their wartime work, von Neumann was a sophisticated, worldly, and gregarious fellow, famous for the weekly cocktail parties he and his wife hosted during his tenure at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study and up on the Mesa at Los Alamos. He had a substantial private income and an additional $10,000 a year from the Institute. He was widely known to have a huge repertoire of jokes in several languages, a vast knowledge of risqu� limericks, and a casual manner of driving so recklessly that he demolished automobiles at regular intervals, always managing to emerge miraculously unscathed.</p>

      <p>尽管冯·诺依曼的一生似乎充满魅力，但他和艾达·洛夫莱斯和艾伦·图灵一样，死得相对年轻。洛夫莱斯三十六岁死于癌症，图灵四十二岁死于氰化物，冯·诺依曼五十三岁死于癌症。和许多其他洛斯阿拉莫斯退伍军人一样，他可能是早期核弹试验期间受到辐射的受害者。他的死让所有认识他的人都感到震惊，他是一个充满活力、充满活力、四处奔波、似乎无懈可击的人。冯·诺依曼的数学同事和终生好友斯坦尼斯拉夫·乌拉姆在冯·诺依曼去世后不久发表在数学杂志上的一篇纪念约翰尼的文章中，用充满爱意的细节描述了<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他的存在：</font></p><p>Despite his apparently charmed existence, von Neumann, like Ada Lovelace and Alan Turing, died relatively young. Lovelace died of cancer at thirty-six, Turing of cyanide at forty-two, and von Neumann of cancer at fifty-three. Like many other Los Alamos veterans, he may have been a victim of exposure to radiation during the early nuclear bomb tests. His death came as a shock to all who knew him as a vital, lively, peripatetic, seemingly invulnerable individual. Stanislaw Ulam, von Neumann's mathematical colleague and lifelong friend, in a memorial to Johnny published in a mathematical journal shortly after von Neumann's death, described <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">his physical presence</font> in loving detail:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">约翰尼的朋友们都记得他特有的姿势：站在黑板前或在家里讨论问题。不知何故，他的手势、微笑和眼神总是反映出所讨论问题的思想或性质。他中等身材，年轻时很苗条，后来越来越肥胖；步履蹒跚，加速度相当随机，但速度从不快。每当问题表现出逻辑或数学悖论的特征时，他的脸上就会闪过一丝微笑。与他对抽象智慧的喜爱完全无关，他对更朴实的喜剧和幽默有着强烈的欣赏（几乎可以说是渴望）。</font>
      

      <p>认识他的人都会记得冯·诺依曼的两点：无论讲什么语言，他都魅力十足、风度翩翩；即使在一群近乎天才的人中，他总是显得比其他人聪明得多。在他的朋友中，关于<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">约翰尼的标准笑话是，他实际上不是人类，但他模仿人类的技巧与他模仿其他一切的技巧一样高超。</font></p><p>Everyone who knew him remembers to point out two things about von Neumann -- how charming and personable he was, no matter what language he was speaking, and how much more intelligent that other human beings he always seemed to be, even in a crowd of near-geniuses. Among his friends, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">the standard joke about Johnny was that he wasn't actually human but was as skilled at imitating human beings as he was at everything else.</font></p>

      <p>扬斯基出生于匈牙利犹太上流社会家庭，十岁前就精通五六种语言，他曾告诉同事赫尔曼·戈德斯坦，六岁时他和父亲经常用古典希腊语开玩笑。众所周知，他读过的东西永远不会忘记，他闪电般快速的计算能力也广为人知。</p><p>Born into an upper-class Hungarian Jewish family, Jansci was fluent in five or six languages before the age of ten, and he once told his collaborator Herman Goldstine that at age six he and his father often joked with each other in classical Greek. It was well known that he never forgot anything once he read it, and his ability to perform lightning fast calculations was legendary.</p>

      <p>1944 年仲夏的一个晚上，冯·诺依曼在马里兰州阿伯丁火车站偶然遇到了一位过去认识的数学家。如果他们的火车早几分钟出发，历史可能会大不相同。那次在阿伯丁的偶然相遇让冯·诺依曼几乎完成了对一个问题的解决，他只有独特的能力才能理解这个问题的战略意义，这个问题的细节复杂而深刻，足以吸引他的好奇心，而利用他的政治影响力可以加速这个问题的成功解决。</p><p>One night in the middle of the summer of 1944, von Neumann encountered by happenstance a mathematician of past acquaintance in the Aberdeen, Maryland, train station. History might have been far different if one of their trains had been scheduled a few minutes earlier. That accidental meeting in Aberdeen presented von Neumann with a nearly completed approach to a problem the strategic significance of which he was uniquely equipped to understand, the details of which were complex and profound enough to attract his intellectual curiosity, the successful completion of which could be hastened by the use of his political clout.</p>

      <p>当时在马里兰州阿伯丁的美国陆军军械弹道实验室工作的赫尔曼·戈德斯坦中尉对冯·诺依曼当时正在处理的其他项目一无所知。但他知道冯·诺依曼的安全权限比他高出很多，而且他是弹道研究实验室科学顾问委员会的成员。所以戈德斯坦碰巧提到，摩尔工程学院的一个陆军项目即将生产一种能够以惊人的速度进行数学计算的设备。</p><p>Lieutenant Herman Goldstine, then associated with the U.S. Army Ordnance Ballistic Laboratory at Aberdeen, Maryland, didn't know anything about the other projects von Neumann was juggling at that time. But he knew that von Neumann's security clearance was miles above his and that he was a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee at the Ballistic Research Laboratory. So Goldstine happened to mention that an Army project at the Moore School of Engineering was soon to produce a device capable of performing mathematical calculations at phenomenal speeds.</p>

      <p>多年后，戈德斯坦回忆说，在阿伯丁站的站台上见到这位世界著名的数学家时，他感到紧张，这是可以理解的。戈德斯坦回忆道：</p><p>Years later, Goldstine remembered that he was understandably nervous upon meeting the world-famous mathematician on the platform at the Aberdeen station. Goldstine recalled:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">对我来说幸运的是，冯·诺依曼是一个热情友好的人，他尽力让人们在他面前感到轻松自在。谈话很快就转到了我的工作上。当冯·诺依曼得知我关心的是每秒能进行 333 次乘法的电子计算机的开发时，我们谈话的整个气氛从轻松愉快的气氛变成了更像是数学博士学位的口试。</font>
      

      <p>由于他迫切需要一台快速自动计算器，冯·诺依曼要求进行演示。在摩尔工程学院，他遇到了该设备的发明者莫奇利和埃克特，接下来的几年里，约翰尼将阿伯丁作为他往返普林斯顿-华盛顿特区-洛斯阿拉莫斯的航天飞机上的一个常规停靠站。像他关注的其他事情一样，冯·诺依曼似乎立即比任何人都更清楚地看到了当时还只是粗糙原型的未来潜力。虽然第一台电子计算机的其他主要创造者要么是数学家，要么是电子工程师，但冯·诺依曼也是一位出色的<i>逻辑学家</i>，这使他能够理解很少有人能理解的事情——这些小玩意儿远远超出了超高速计算引擎的范畴。</p><p>Because he had all-important reasons for wanting a fast automatic calculator, von Neumann asked for a demonstration. At the Moore School of Engineering, he met the gadget's inventors, Mauchly and Eckert, and the next years saw Johnny adding Aberdeen as a regular stop on his Princeton-D.C.-Los Alamos shuttle. Like everything else he turned his mind to, von Neumann immediately seemed to see more clearly than anyone else the future potential of what was then only a crude prototype. While the other principal creators of the first electronic computer were either mathematicians or electrical engineers, von Neumann was also a superb <i>logician</i>, which enabled him to understand what few others did -- that these gadgets were in a class quite far beyond that of superfast calculating engines.</p>

      <p>从 1944 年的早期会议到 ENIAC、EDVAC、UNIVAC、MANIAC 和（是的）JOHNNIAC 时代，将<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">法律和历史功劳归于第一台电子数字计算机的发明者的问题</font>变得错综复杂，无法做出简单的解释，许多冲突仍未解决。戈德斯坦——与冯·诺依曼同台的另一位演讲者——对早期计算机历史上的关键事件有自己的看法。莫奇利和埃克特的观点截然不同。贝尔实验室有一个关于斯蒂比茨的故事。IBM 的托马斯·沃森老先生还有另一个故事。1973 年，爱荷华州一位名叫阿塔纳<a href="http://www.intercom.net/local/shore_journal/joc10225.html">索夫</a>的男子最终在法庭上出人意料地笑到了最后。</p><p>From those early meetings in 1944 to the eras of ENIAC, EDVAC, UNIVAC, MANIAC, and (yes) JOHNNIAC, the <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">problem of assigning legal and historical credit to the inventors of the first electronic digital computers</font> becomes a tangled affair in which easy explanations are impossible and many conflicts are still unresolved. Goldstine -- the other man on the platform with von Neumann -- had his own version of the key events in early computer history. Mauchly and Eckert had a distinctly different point of view. There was a tale of Stibitz at Bell Labs. IBM's Thomas Watson, Senior, had yet another story. And a man in Iowa named <a href="http://www.intercom.net/local/shore_journal/joc10225.html">Atanasoff</a> eventually had the unexpected last laugh in a courtroom in 1973.</p>

      <p>关于现代计算机发明功劳归属的问题，人们曾多次在法庭上争论不休，甚至法律判决也有些含糊。当然，这是一个世界各地少数人独立工作得出类似结论的领域。就 ENIAC 团队而言，这是一个由几个意志坚定的人共同努力的案例。</p><p>Monumental court cases have been fought over the issue of assigning credit for the invention of the modern computer, and even the legal decisions have been somewhat murky. Certainly it was a field in which a few people all over the world, working independently, reached similar conclusions. In the case of the ENIAC team, it was a case of several determined minds working together.</p>

      <p>不难想象，在其他人花了数年时间攻克了<a href="http://www.upenn.edu/AR/penninfo-new/ENIAC_Papers.html">ENIAC（电子数字积分计算器</a>）的重大工程难题之后，冯·诺依曼登场亮相，并在团队阐述他们的发现时占据了主导地位，这并不是出于自我吹嘘，而是因为他无疑拥有最优雅的方式来陈述团队协同工作得出的结论。由于冯·诺依曼在其他领域的杰出成就，以及他对记者和将军的魅力，大众媒体经常将他描述为关键概念的<i>唯一</i>发明者，例如至关重要的“存储程序”——他从未声称自己是发明者。</p><p>It isn't hard to envision von Neumann coming onto the scene after others have worked for years on the considerable engineering problems involved in building <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/AR/penninfo-new/ENIAC_Papers.html">ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator</a>), then dominating the voice of the group when they articulated their discoveries, not out of self-aggrandizement, but because he undoubtedly had the most elegant way of stating the conclusions that the group had arrived at, working in concert. Because of von Neumann's prominence in other fields, and the way his charm worked on journalists as well as generals, he was often described by the mass media as the <i>sole</i> inventor of key concepts like the all-important "stored program" -- a credit he never claimed himself.</p>

      <p>尽管最早的计算机硬件的发明者是谁是个棘手的问题，但不可否认的是，冯·诺依曼在软件史上发挥了核心作用。他在 20 世纪 40 年代末和 50 年代初对计算科学的贡献，比他更早的理论工作更早，这些理论工作催生了计算的概念。他是 ENIAC 构建过程中融合的两种思想流派（数理逻辑和弹道学）的主要参与者之一。</p><p>Although the matter of assigning credit for the earliest computer hardware is a tricky business, there is no denying von Neumann's central role in the history of software. His contributions to the science of computation in the late forties and early fifties were preceded by even earlier theoretical work that led to the notion of computation. He was one of the principal participants in both of the lines of thought that converged into the construction of ENIAC -- mathematical logic and ballistics.</p>

      <p>约翰·冯·诺依曼在计算发明中的作用开始于 ENIAC 项目之前近二十年。20 世纪 20 年代末，在他为量子物理、逻辑和博弈论做出重大贡献期间，哥廷根的年轻人约翰·冯·诺依曼是国际数学谜题游戏的主要参与者之一，这场游戏始于七十年前的布尔，并导致了十年后图灵发明了通用机器。</p><p>John von Neumann's role in the invention of computation began nearly twenty years before the ENIAC project. In the late 1920s, between his major contributions to quantum physics, logic, and game theory, young Johann von Neumann of G�ttingen was one of the principal players in the international game of mathematical riddles that started with Boole seventy years prior and led to Turing's invention of the universal machine a decade later.</p>

      <p>19 世纪末，哲学与数学之间即将发生碰撞，这一趋势愈发明显，这让数学家们感到极为不安。与人类思维相关的模糊的形而上学概念可能对布尔或图灵等人很有吸引力。但对于哥廷根大学的戴维·希尔伯特和 20 世纪初的其他数学家来说，这种模糊性对于旨在将所有科学定律简化为数学方程式的事业的未来构成了严重威胁。</p><p>The impending collision of philosophy and mathematics that was becoming evident at the end of the nineteenth century made mathematicians extremely uncomfortable. Slippery metaphysical concepts associated with human thought might have appealed to minds like Boole's or Turing's. But to David Hilbert of G�ttingen and others of the early 1900s, such vagueness was a grave danger to the future of an enterprise that intended to reduce all scientific laws to mathematical equations.</p>

      <p>希尔伯特坚持认为，更“纯”数学形式的逻辑和元数学基础只能用数值问题和精确定义的符号、规则和运算来清楚地表述。这是<i>形式主义</i>的学说，后来促使图灵做出了关于机器能力的惊人发现。希尔伯特的学生约翰·冯·诺依曼是形式主义者中的明星之一。冯·诺依曼的元数学成就本身就非常了不起。然而，他在形式主义方面的工作只是冯·诺依曼在同一辉煌的一年中在几个不同领域取得的成就的一部分。</p><p>The logical and metamathematical foundations of more "pure" forms of mathematics, Hilbert insisted, could only be stated clearly in terms of numerical problems and precisely defined symbols and rules and operations. This was the doctrine of <i>formalism</i> that later spurred Turing to make his astonishing discovery about the capabilities of machines. Johann von Neumann, a student of Hilbert's, was one of the stars of the formalists. In itself, von Neumann's metamathematical achievement was remarkable. His work in formalism, however, was only part of what von Neumann achieved in several disparate fields, all in the same dazzling year.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">1927 年，24 岁的冯·诺依曼发表了五篇论文，这些论文在学术界引起了轰动，至今仍是三个不同思想领域的丰碑。</font>这是历史上最引人注目的跨学科三重奏之一。他在 1927 年发表的三篇杰作对量子物理学领域至关重要。另一篇论文开创了博弈论的新领域。与计算未来最直接相关的论文是关于形式逻辑系统与数学极限之间的关系。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">In 1927, at the age of twenty-four, von Neumann published five papers that were instant hits in the academic world, and which still stand as monuments in three separate fields of thought.</font> It was one of the most remarkable interdisciplinary triple plays in history. Three of his 1927 masterpieces were critical to the field of quantum physics. Another paper established the new field of game theory. The paper most directly to the future of computation was about the relationship between formal logic systems and the limits of mathematics.</p>

      <p>在 1927 年发表的最后一篇论文中，冯·诺依曼证明了证明所有数学都是一致的必要性，这是建立计算理论基础的关键一步（尽管当时没有人知道这一点）。一年后，这导致希尔伯特发表了一篇论文，其中列出了三个尚未解答的数学问题，他和冯·诺依曼认为，这些问题是现代逻辑学家和数学面临的最重要的问题。</p><p>In his last 1927 paper, von Neumann demonstrated the necessity of proving that all mathematics was consistent, a critically important step toward establishing the theoretical basis for computation (although nobody yet knew that). This led, one year later, to a paper published by Hilbert that listed three unanswered questions about mathematics that he and von Neumann had determined to be the most important questions facing logicians and mathematics of the modern era.</p>

      <p>第一个问题是数学是否<i>完备</i>。完备性，按照数学家的专业意义来说，是指每一个真实的数学陈述都可以被证明（即有效证明的最后一行）。</p><p>The first of these questions asked whether or not mathematics was <i>complete</i>. Completeness, in the technical sense used by mathematicians, means that every true mathematical statement can be proven (i.e., is the last line of a valid proof).</p>

      <p>第二个问题，也是最让冯·诺依曼担心的问题，是数学（或任何其他形式系统）是否具有<i>一致性</i>。从技术意义上讲，一致性意味着不存在任何有效的可允许步骤序列（或“移动”或“状态”）可以证明不真实的陈述为真。如果算术是一个一致的系统，那么就永远没有办法证明 1 + 1 = 3。</p><p>The second question, the one that most concerned von Neumann, asked whether mathematics (or any other formal system) was <i>consistent</i>. Consistency in the technical sense means that there is no valid sequence of allowable steps (or "moves" or "states") that could prove an untrue statement to be true. If arithmetic was a consistent system, there would never be a way to prove that 1 + 1 = 3.</p>

      <p>第三个问题打开了计算的侧门，即数学是否可<i>判定</i>。可判定性意味着存在某种确定的方法，可以保证正确确定断言是否可证明。</p><p>The third question, the one that opened the side door to computation, asked whether or not mathematics was <i>decidable</i>. Decidability means that there is some definite method that is guaranteed to correctly determine whether an assertion is provable.</p>

      <p>不久之后，第一个希尔伯特-冯·诺依曼问题就得到了一个令人震惊的答案。1930 年，另一位年轻的数学家库尔特·哥德尔 (Kurt G�del) 指出，算术不可能完备，因为总会有至少一个无法证明的真断言。在证明这一点的过程中，哥德尔跨越了逻辑和数学之间的一个关键门槛，他指出，任何像数字系统一样丰富的形式系统（即包含数学运算符 + 和 =）都可以用算术来表达。这意味着，无论数学（或任何其他同样强大的形式系统）变得多么复杂，它总是可以用对数字执行的运算来表达，并且系统的各个部分（无论它们是否本质上是数字的）都可以通过计数和比较规则来操纵。</p><p>It didn't take long for a shocking answer to emerge in response to the first Hilbert-von Neumann question. In 1930, yet another young mathematician, Kurt G�del, showed that arithmetic cannot be complete, because there will always be at least one true assertion that cannot be proved. In the course of demonstrating this, G�del crossed a crucial threshold between logic and mathematics when he showed that any formal system that is as rich as the number system (i.e., contains the mathematical operators + and =) can be expressed in terms of arithmetic. This means that no matter how complicated mathematics (or any other equally powerful formal system) becomes, it can always be expressed in terms of operations to be performed on numbers, and the parts of the system (whether or not they are inherently numerical) can be manipulated by rules of counting and comparing.</p>

      <p>冯·诺依曼和希尔伯特关于数学可判定性的第三个问题促使图灵在 1936 年取得了突破。可判定性问题要求的“确定方法”（确定数学断言是否可证明）由艾伦·图灵表述为一种机器，该机器可以按照确定的步骤对磁带上以符号形式编码的语句进行操作。哥德尔展示了数字如何表示形式系统的操作，而图灵展示了如何用数字向配备有解码这种描述的机器描述形式系统（例如，将系统的规则转换为“找到一个数字<i>n</i>，使得... ”的形式，“ <i>n</i> ”可以表示为一串 1 和 0）。</p><p>Von Neumann's and Hilbert's third question about the decidability of mathematics led Turing to his 1936 breakthrough. The "definite method" (of determining whether a mathematical assertion is provable) that was demanded by the decidability question was formulated by Alan Turing as a machine that could operate in definite steps on statements encoded as symbols on tape. G�del had shown how numbers could represent the operations of formal system, and Turing showed how the formal system could be described numerically to a machine equipped to decode such a description (e.g., translate the system's rules into the form "find a number <i>n</i>, such that . . . ", "<i>n</i>" being expressible as a string of ones and zeroes).</p>

      <p>所有这些问题在提出时都非常重要——对于全世界能够理解其重要性的少数人来说。但在 1930 年，其余的人有更重要的事情要担心，而不是元数学家的假想机器。即使是那些知道通用机器实际上可以制造的人，也没有能力开始这项任务。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">制造数字计算机是一项工程项目，需要只有国家政府才能负担得起的支持。</font></p><p>All of these questions were terribly important at the time they were formulated -- to the few dozen people around the world who were equipped to understand their significance. But in 1930, the rest of the population had more important things to worry about that the hypothetical machines of the metamathematicians. Even those who understood that universal machines could in fact be built were in no position to begin such a task. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Making a digital computer was an engineering project that would require the kind of support that only a national government could afford.</font></p>

      <p>当年轻的哥德尔和图灵出现时，约翰·冯·诺依曼正在<a href="http://www.ias.edu/">普林斯顿高等研究院</a>工作。尽管他敏锐地意识到了他在 20 世纪 20 年代末发起的“数学基础危机”的最新发展，但到 20 世纪 30 年代初，冯·诺依曼的永不停歇的才智已经开始攻克六个新问题。对于当时还二十多岁的约翰来说，生活中最重要的事情就是找到“有趣的问题”。</p><p>John von Neumann was at the <a href="http://www.ias.edu/">Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton</a> by the time young G�del and Turing came along. Although he was keenly aware of the latest developments in the "foundation crisis of mathematics" he had helped initiate in the late 1920s, von Neumann's restless intellect was attacking half a dozen new problems by the early 1930s. To Johnny, still in his twenties, the most important thing in life was to find "interesting problems."</p>

      <p>他对涉及湍流现象的数学问题尤其感兴趣，而爆炸和内爆的动力学恰好是这类问题可以应用的一个领域。他还对用于模拟复杂现象（如全球天气模式或辐射穿过物质的通道）的新数学方法感兴趣——这些方法虽然强大，但需要进行大量计算，以至于该领域未来的发展受到严重限制，因为人类无法在合理的时间内计算出最有趣的方程式的结果。</p><p>In particular, he was interested in mathematical questions involving the phenomenon of turbulence, and the dynamics of explosions and implosions happened to be one area where such questions could be applied. He was also interested in new mathematical methods for modeling complex phenomena like global weather patterns or the passage of radiation through matter -- methods that were powerful but required such enormous numbers of calculations that future progress in the field was severely limited by the human inability to calculate the results of the most interesting equations in a reasonable length of time.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">冯·诺依曼似乎有一种“点石成金”的本领。</font>他所解决的问题，无论当时看起来多么深奥和晦涩，在十年或二十年后都会变得非常重要。例如，他在 20 世纪 20 年代写了一篇关于经济战略数学原理的论文。四分之一个世纪后，这篇论文被证明是解决飞机如何搜索潜艇问题的完美解决方案（也是巴贝奇开创的“运筹学”的首批胜利之一）。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Von Neumann seemed to have a kind of "Midas Touch."</font> The problems he tackled, no matter how abstruse and apparently obscure they might have seemed at the time, had a way of becoming very important a decade or two later. For example, he wrote a paper in the 1920s on the mathematics underlying economic strategies. A quarter of a century later it turned out to be a perfect solution to the problem of how airplanes should search for submarines (as well as one of the first triumphs of "operational research," one of the fields pioneered by Babbage).</p>

      <p>到了 20 世纪 40 年代，冯·诺依曼在流体动力学湍流数学和处理超大规模计算方面的专业知识变得出乎意料地重要，因为这两个专业特别适用于一种新型爆炸，这种爆炸是由一些来自哥廷根、现已聚集在新墨西哥州的老家伙策划的。第一枚裂变弹的设计者知道，必须先解决这两个领域的棘手数学问题，然后才能将任何优雅的量子物理方程转化为核爆炸的火球。正如冯·诺依曼已经怀疑的那样，设计核武器和热核武器所涉及的数学工作产生了大量的计算。</p><p>By the 1940s, von Neumann's expertise in the mathematics of hydrodynamic turbulence and the management of very large calculations took on unexpected importance because these two specialties were especially applicable to a new kind of explosion that was being cooked up by some of the old gang from G�ttingen, now gathered in New Mexico. The designers of the first fission bomb knew that hellish mathematical problems in both areas had to be solved before any of the elegant equations of quantum physics could be transformed into the fireball of a nuclear detonation. As von Neumann already suspected, the mathematical work involved in designing nuclear and thermonuclear weapons created an avalanche of calculations.</p>

      <p>热核武器研发所需的计算能力最终成为了 ENIAC 最优先的用途之一——当该设备投入使用时，首批官方程序就是为洛斯阿拉莫斯进行绝密计算——尽管<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">该电子计算器最初被委托的原因是为了生成正确瞄准常规火炮所需的数学表格。</font></p><p>The calculating power needed in the quest for thermonuclear weaponry ended up being one of the highest-priority uses for ENIAC -- top-secret calculations for Los Alamos were the subject of the first official programs run on the device when it became operational -- although <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">the reason the electronic calculator had been commissioned in the first place was to generate the mathematical tables needed for properly aiming conventional artillery.</font></p>

      <p>ENIAC 项目是在陆军弹道研究实验室的赞助下启动的。计算历史学家兼主要参与者之一赫尔曼·戈德斯坦不辞辛劳地指出，<i>弹道学</i>一词源于拉丁语<i>ballista</i>，这是一种大型导弹发射装置的名称。现代意义上的弹道学是预测射弹从发射到击中目标之间的路径的数学科学。有关运动物体的复杂方程式由于需要调整不同速度的风以及从非常大的火炮发射的射弹在穿越大气层时遇到的空气阻力变化而变得更加复杂。对于每种特定尺寸和炮口速度的火炮，所有可能的距离、高度和天气计算结果都列在“射击表”中，炮兵在设置射击时会参考这些表。</p><p>The ENIAC project was started under the auspices of the Army Ballistic Research Laboratory. Herman Goldstine, a historian of computation as well as one of the key participants, took the trouble to point out that the word <i>ballistics</i> is derived from the Latin <i>ballista</i>, the name of a large device for hurling missiles. Ballistics in the modern sense is the mathematical science of predicting the path of a projectile between the time it is launched and the moment it hits the target. Complex equations concerning moving bodies are complicated further by the adjustments necessary for winds of different velocities and for the variations in air resistance encountered by projectiles fired from very large guns as they travel through the atmosphere. The results of all possible distance, altitude, and weather calculations for guns of each specific size and muzzle velocity are given in "firing tables" which artillerymen consult as they set up a shot.</p>

      <p>大规模生产技术应用于武器意味着新型枪支和炮弹以前所未有的速度出现，这使得持续生产射击表并非易事。在第一次世界大战期间，这些计算是由被称为“计算机”的人完成的。但即使在那时，很明显，组织这些大规模计算的新方法，以及帮助人类计算机工作的新型机械计算器，将成为现代战争中越来越重要的组成部分。</p><p>The application of mass-production techniques to weapons meant that new types of guns and shells were coming along at an unprecedented pace, making the ongoing production of firing tables no easy task. During World War I, such calculations were done by humans who were called "computers." But even then it was clear that new methods of organizing these large-scale calculations, and new kinds of mechanical calculators to help the work of human computers, would be an increasingly important part of modern warfare.</p>

      <p>1918 年，军械部弹道分部在马里兰州阿伯丁试验场设立了一个专门的数学部门。早期招募的人员之一是年轻的<a href="#OEBPS/Text/5.html">诺伯特·维纳</a>，他后来在弹道技术主流的另一个研究分支——高射炮的自动控制中占据了重要地位，后来成为与计算机相关的新学科——控制论的创始人<i>之一</i>。</p><p>In 1918 the Ballistics Branch of the Chief of Ordnance set up a special mathematical section at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. One of the early recruits was the young <a href="#OEBPS/Text/5.html">Norbert Wiener</a>, who was to feature prominently in another research tributary of the mainstream of ballistic technology -- the automatic control of antiaircraft guns -- and who was later to become one of the creators of the new computer-related discipline of <i>cybernetics</i>.</p>

      <p>20 世纪 30 年代，阿伯丁实验室和宾夕法尼亚大学摩尔工程学院的一个相关小组都获得了由麻省理工学院的<a href="#OEBPS/Text/9.html">Vannevar Bush</a>建造的自动模拟计算机的模型，这是一个巨大的机械装置，被称为“微分分析仪”。它是计算的奇妙辅助工具，但无论从设计还是性能上看，它都远非数字计算机。</p><p>In the 1930s, both the Aberdeen laboratory and an associated group at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of Engineering obtained models of the automatic analog computer constructed by <a href="#OEBPS/Text/9.html">Vannevar Bush</a> at MIT, a gigantic mechanical device known as the "differential analyzer." It was a marvelous aid to calculation, but it was far from being a digital computer, in either its design or its performance.</p>

      <p>在这些机器的帮助下，弹道计算的工作量有所减轻。二战前，机器仍是主要资源——摩尔学院名誉教授的次要资源，他们使用手摇机械计算器手工进行计算。<a href="#OEBPS/Text/2.html">巴贝奇的康沃尔牧师</a>的影子！</p><p>With the aid of these machines, the work of performing ballistic calculations was somewhat relieved. Before World War II, the machines were still second to the main resource -- mathematics professors emeriti at the Moore School, who performed the calculations by hand, with the aid of hand-cranked mechanical calculators. Shades of <a href="#OEBPS/Text/2.html">Babbage's Cornish clergymen</a>!</p>

      <p>战争爆发后，负责为多个军种进行弹道计算的机构显然需要专家的帮助。正因为如此，1942 年 8 月，一位被动员的数学家 Herman Goldstine 中尉在阿伯丁报到，并被指派精简弹道计算。他很快发现摩尔学院的设施不够用，于是开始扩充人力“计算机”人员，从女子陆军部队招募了大量年轻女性，加入到一小批年长的前教授队伍中。</p><p>When war broke out, it was obvious that the institutions in charge of producing ballistic calculations for several armed services needed expert help. It was for this reason that a mobilized mathematician, Lieutenant Herman Goldstine, reported for duty at Aberdeen in August, 1942, and was assigned the task of streamlining ballistic computations. He soon found the Moore School facilities inadequate, and started to expand the staff of human "computers" by adding a large number of young women recruited from the Women's Army Corps to the small cadre of elderly ex-professors.</p>

      <p>戈德斯坦的妻子阿黛尔是一名数学家，在早期计算机编程中发挥了重要作用（她和其他六名女性最终被指派负责 ENIAC 的编程工作），她参与了招募和培训新员工的工作。冯·诺依曼的妻子克拉拉在洛斯阿拉莫斯担任过类似的职务，无论是在电子计算机问世之前还是之后。让女性从事此类工作的传统非常普遍——在英国的密码破译工作中，数百名熟练的计算器扮演着同样的角色，图灵和他的同事们称她们为“女孩”和“计算机”。</p><p>Goldstine's wife, Adele, herself a mathematician who was to play a prominent role in the programming of early computers (she and six other women were eventually assigned the task of programming the ENIAC), became involved with recruiting and teaching new staff members. Von Neumann's wife, Klara, performed a similar role at Los Alamos, both before and after electronic computing machines became available. The tradition of using women for such work was widespread -- the equivalent roles in Britain's code-breaking efforts were played by hundreds of skilled calculators whom Turing and his colleagues called "girls" as well as "computers."</p>

      <p>阿伯丁的人工计算人员扩充到近 200 人，其中大部分是 WAC，这只是权宜之计。射击表的计算已经失控。一旦一种新型枪支、引信或炮弹可用于战斗，就必须计算新的射击表。最终结果要么印在一本小册子上，让炮手放在口袋里，要么机械地编码在一种称为自动<i>机</i>的特殊瞄准装置中。（朱利安·比奇洛、沃伦·韦弗和诺伯特·维纳进行了一项完全不同的数学研究，专注于这些自动瞄准机器的特性。）</p><p>The expansion of the human computing staff at Aberdeen to nearly two hundred people, mostly WACs, was a stopgap measure. The calculation of firing tables was already out of hand. As soon as a new kind of gun, fuse, or shell became available for combat, a new table had to be calculated. The final product was either printed in a booklet that gunners kept in their pockets, or was mechanically encoded in special aiming apparatus called <i>automata</i>. (An entirely different mathematical research effort by Julian Bigelow, Warren Weaver, and Norbert Wiener was to concentrate on the characteristics of these automatic aiming machines.)</p>

      <p>戈德斯坦是最早意识到射击台难题的人之一，他提出的解决办法是委托发明一种全新的机械计算辅助设备。万尼瓦尔·布什的计算器不再是最高效的计算设备。哈佛大学的霍华德·艾肯博士和 IBM 团队以及贝尔实验室的乔治·斯蒂比茨领导的团队根据不同的原理制造了更快的机器。但戈德斯坦知道，阿伯丁和摩尔学校真正需要的是一台比现有最快机器快数百倍甚至数千倍的自动计算器。</p><p>The answer to the firing table dilemma, as Goldstine was one of the first to recognize, was to commission the invention of an entirely new kind of mechanical calculating aid. The Vannevar Bush calculators were no longer the most efficient calculating devices. Faster machines, built on different principles, had been built by Dr. Howard Aiken and an IBM team at Harvard, and by a group led by a man named George Stibitz at Bell laboratories. But Goldstine knew that what they really needed at Aberdeen and the Moore School was an automatic calculator that was hundreds, even thousands of times faster than the fastest existing machines.</p>

      <p>这样的梦想就像空军军官希望拥有一架时速一万英里的飞机，只不过另一项新技术似乎可以在理论上制造出这种机器，尽管在执行上可能性不大。这项技术只有少数人想过应用于数学问题。新兴电子学领域的研究已经揭示了真空管的各种奇妙特性。在英国，布莱切利园的神童们正在使用这种设备制造出<i>Colossus</i>，这是一种不太具备计算能力的密码破译机。</p><p>Such dreams would have been akin to an Air Force officer wishing for a ten-thousand-mile-per-hour airplane, except for the fact that another new technology, one that only a few people even thought of applying to mathematical problems, looked as if it might make such a machine possible in theory, if only questionably probable in execution. Research in the young field of electronics had been uncovering all sorts of marvelous properties of the vacuum tube. Over in Great Britain, the whiz kids at Bletchley Park were using such devices in <i>Colossus</i>, their not-quite-computational code-breaking machine.</p>

      <p>直到战争爆发之前，电子真空管几乎只用作放大器。但它们也可以用作非常快速的开关。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">由于快速执行大量开/关脉冲是数字计算的标志，</font>而真空管可以每秒打开和关闭一百万次，因此电子开关（与 Vannevar Bush 机器的机械开关相反）是超快计算机关键组件的绝佳候选者。</p><p>Until the war, electronic vacuum tubes had been used almost exclusively as amplifiers. But they could also be used as very fast switches. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Since the rapid execution of a large number of on/off impulses is the hallmark of digital computation,</font> and vacuum tubes could switch on and off as fast as a million times a second, electronic switching (as opposed to the mechanical switching of Vannevar Bush's machine) was an unbelievably good candidate for the key component of an ultrafast computing machine.</p>

      <p>1943 年，戈德斯坦和几乎所有上司都不知道，另一位级别高得多的科学家也在寻找超快计算机。戈德斯坦抢先一步。1942 年，戈德斯坦找到了莫奇利和埃克特。1944 年，约翰·冯·诺依曼偶然发现了戈德斯坦。</p><p>By 1943, unknown to Goldstine and almost all of his superiors, another, much higher-ranking scientist was also searching for an ultrafast computing machine. Goldstine beat the other fellow to it. Goldstine found Mauchly and Eckert in 1942. John von Neumann, and chance, found Goldstine in 1944.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.library.upenn.edu/special/gallery/mauchly/jwmintro.html">约翰·W·莫奇利和 J·普雷斯珀·埃克特</a>被公认为是 ENIAC 的发明者，但在他们实现电子数字计算机的关键理念之前，20 世纪 30 年代，爱荷华州一位名叫阿塔纳索夫的人制造了小型、粗糙但功能齐全的电子计算机原型。他的名字并不广为人知，当计算机从一种奇特的新兴技术发展成为一个强大的新兴产业时，他的命运与其他先驱者不同。但 1973 年，美国地方法院裁定约翰·文森特·阿塔纳索夫发明了电子数字计算机。</p><p><a href="http://www.library.upenn.edu/special/gallery/mauchly/jwmintro.html">John W. Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert</a> have been properly credited with the invention of ENIAC, but before they implemented the key ideas of electronic digital computing machines, a man named Atanasoff in Iowa, in the 1930s, built small, crude, but functioning prototypes of electronic calculating machines. His name has not been as widely known, and his fortunes turned out differently from those of other pioneers when computers grew from an exotic newborn technology to a powerful infant industry. But in 1973 a Unites Stated district court ruled that John Vincent Atanasoff invented the electronic digital computer.</p>

      <p>这是一项复杂的决定，经过多年的诉讼才做出，如果双方都没有如此有力的证据，那么结果可能就不会那么明确。争议的核心围绕着阿塔纳索夫在 20 世纪 30 年代所做的原创工作，以及他后来的工作对约翰·莫奇利设计 ENIAC 的影响。就像霍勒里斯-比林斯发明穿孔卡数据处理的故事一样，一个人的想法从哪里结束，另一个人的想法从哪里开始，很难简单地解释清楚。</p><p>It was a complicated decision, reached after years of litigation, and was not as clear-cut as it might have been if both did not have such strong cases. The core of the dispute centered around original work Atanasoff did in the 1930s, and the influence that his work later had on John Mauchly's design of ENIAC. Like the Hollerith-Billings story of the invention of punched-card data processing, simple explanations of where one man's ideas left off and another's began are difficult to reconstruct at best.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">阿塔纳索夫是计算领域最后一位孤军奋战的发明家</font>；在他之后，这类项目过于复杂，只有团队合作才能完成。和布尔一样，阿塔纳索夫也是灵感迸发，解决了困扰他多年的问题。20 世纪 30 年代初，阿塔纳索夫在爱荷华州立大学任教，他遇到了当时其他数学家和物理学家面临的同样障碍。最有趣的想法被执行大量复杂计算的问题所阻碍。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Atanasoff was the last of the lone inventors in the field of computation</font>; after him, such projects were too complicated for anything less than a team effort. Like Boole, Atanasoff was the recipient of one of those sudden inspirations that provided the solution to a problem he had been grappling with for years. A theoretical physicist teaching at Iowa State in the early 1930s, he came up against the same obstacle faced by other mathematicians and physicists of his era. The approaches to the most interesting ideas were blocked by the problems of performing large numbers of complex calculations.</p>

      <p>到 1935 年，阿塔纳索夫开始热衷于研究一种使计算机械化的方案。他知道巴贝奇的想法，但他既是物理学家，也是电子爱好者，而巴贝奇时代不存在的整个技术现在显示出巨大的前景。阿塔纳索夫逐渐相信，电子计算机是一个不错的选择，但他不知道如何设计一台，而且他不确定如何在没有编程方法的情况下设计一台机器。20 世纪 70 年代末，阿塔纳索夫告诉作家凯瑟琳·菲什曼：</p><p>By 1935, Atanasoff was in hot pursuit of a scheme to mechanize calculation. He was aware of Babbage's ideas, but he was an electronic hobbyist as well as a physicist, and entire technologies that didn't exist in Babbage's time were now showing great promise. Atanasoff was gradually convinced that an electronic computing machine was a good bet to pursue, but he had no idea how to go about designing one, and he wasn't sure how to design a machine without working out a method of programming it. In the late 1970s, Atanasoff told writer Katherine Fishman:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">我开始陷入痛苦之中。接下来的两年，我的生活很艰难。我反复思考这个问题。每天晚上我都会去物理楼的办公室。1937 年冬天的一个晚上，我因为试图解决机器的问题而全身受尽折磨。我上了车，以高速行驶了很长一段时间，以便控制自己的情绪。我习惯这样做几英里：我可以通过集中精力开车来控制自己。但那天晚上我受尽了折磨，我一直开车，直到我穿过密西西比河进入伊利诺伊州，距离出发地有 189 英里。我知道我必须停下来；我看到一盏灯，原来是一家路边旅馆，于是我走了进去。外面大概是零度，我记得我挂起了厚厚的外套；我开始喝酒，开始暖和起来，意识到我控制住了自己。</font>
      

      <p>近四十年后，当他在有关电子计算机发明的专利案中作证时，阿塔纳索夫回忆说，那天晚上他在路边旅馆里确定了几个设计元素和原则 - 包括用于编码输入的二进制系统和用于切换的电子管技术 - 将他的电子计算器梦想变成切实可行的计划。</p><p>Nearly forty years later, when he testified in the patent case concerning the invention of the electronic computer, Atanasoff recalled that he decided upon several design elements and principles that night in the roadhouse -- including a binary system for encoding input and electronic tube technology for switching -- that would transform his dream of an electronic calculator into a practical plan.</p>

      <p>1940 年和 1941 年两位发明家讨论时，他们的心态是法律和历史冲突的关键。毫无疑问，约翰·莫奇利也曾多年思考自动计算的想法。莫奇利在 33 岁时遇到了阿塔纳索夫，他曾在约翰霍普金斯大学担任研究助理，这让他在涉及详细测量和计算的程序方面拥有丰富的经验。1933 年，作为费城附近乌尔辛斯学院物理系主任，他开始进行大气电学研究。</p><p>The state of each inventor's mind at the time of their discussions in 1940 and 1941 was the crux of the legal and historical conflict. There is no dispute that John Mauchly had also devoted years of thought to the idea of automated calculation. Thirty-three years old when he met Atanasoff, Mauchly had worked his way through Johns Hopkins as a research assistant, which gave him extensive experience with procedures that involve detailed measurement and calculation. In 1933, as head of the physics department at Ursinus College near Philadelphia, he began to perform research in atmospheric electricity.</p>

      <p>莫奇利对长期存在争议的太阳黑子对地球天气的影响理论特别感兴趣。这些巨大的太阳风暴与地球天气状况之间没有明显的联系，但这并不能证明这种联系不存在。1936 年，莫奇利安排将政府大量气象记录运回他在乌尔西努斯的办公室。他打算将现代统计分析应用于天气数据，试图将它们与太阳黑子活动记录联系起来，希望这次探测能揭示出以前未被发现的模式。</p><p>Mauchly was particularly interested in the long-disputed theory about the effect of sunspots on the earth's weather. There was no obvious connection between these huge storms on the sun and terrestrial weather conditions, but that did not prove that such a connection did not exist. In 1936, Mauchly arranged to have many parts of the government's voluminous meteorological records shipped back to his office at Ursinus. He intended to apply modern statistical analysis to the weather data in an attempt to correlate them with records of sunspot activity, hoping that this probe would reveal the previously undetected pattern.</p>

      <p>就像冯·诺依曼等其他数学气象学家很快发现的那样，莫奇利发现，任何涉及天气数据的计算都变得非常复杂，甚至需要一生的时间才能计算出从最短的观察期中生成的所有方程式。因此，他发现自己在做与弹道专家相同的事情——雇佣大量拥有加法机的人。大萧条时期的一家机构——国家青年管理局帮助莫奇利向学生支付每小时 50 美分的费用，让他们用手持计算器将天气数据制成表格。莫奇利计划在让他的团队处理第一部分数据后，再购买打孔卡机。但当他在 1939 年世界博览会上观看世界上最先进的打孔卡制表机的演示时，他意识到，即使是训练有素的操作员手中的数十台这样的机器，也可能需要再花十年时间才能处理完天气数据。</p><p>As other mathematical meteorologists like von Neumann were also quickly discovering, Mauchly found that any calculations involving data based on weather quickly grew so complicated that it would take a lifetime to calculate all the equations generated from even the shortest periods of observation. So he found himself doing the same thing that the ballistics experts did -- hiring a lot of people with adding machines. A Depression-era agency, the National Youth Administration, helped Mauchly pay students fifty cents an hour to tabulate his weather data with hand calculators. Mauchly planned to obtain punched-card machines, once he got his crew to tackle the first part of the data. But when he watched a demonstration of the world's most advanced punched-card tabulator at the 1939 World's Fair, he realized that even scores of such machines in the hands of trained operators might take another decade to go through the weather data.</p>

      <p>1939 年和 1940 年，莫奇利在科学期刊上读到了一种用于协助宇宙射线研究的新型测量和计数系统。该系统吸引他注意的部分是，这种使用电子电路的新设备可以比十几个快速打孔卡制表机更快地计数宇宙射线。宇宙射线可以以每秒数千次的速度被探测到，但之前所有的记录器都无法保持每秒超过 500 次的速度。莫奇利尝试自己制作了一些电子电路，他开始看到它们可以用于计算的方法。</p><p>In 1939 and 1940, Mauchly read in scientific journals about a new measuring and counting system developed to assist cosmic-ray research. The part of the system that caught his eye was the fact that this new device, using electronic circuits, could count cosmic rays far faster than a dozen of the fasted punched-card tabulators. Cosmic rays can be detected at the rate of thousands per second, but all previous recorders failed to keep pace beyond 500 times a second. Mauchly tried making a few electronic circuits for himself, and he began to see a way that they could be used for computation.</p>

      <p>莫奇利特别注意到了宇宙射线研究人员开发的一种电路——<i>巧合电路</i>，其中的开关只有当多个信号同时到达时才会闭合，从而实际上做出决策。通过这种电路的某种变体，是否可以制造出能够进行电子逻辑运算的机器？莫奇利用自己的真空管电路进行实验，推测可能还存在其他仪器中使用的电路，使他能够制造出一台可以进行加、减、乘、除运算的机器。此时，他的推测比手工接线的原型更为宏大，但他从宇宙射线研究人员那里获得的线索足以让莫奇利的天气预报机器与美国陆军计划中的某种与太阳黑子或天气无关的设备发生冲突。</p><p>Mauchly took note of one circuit in particular that was developed by the cosmic-ray researchers -- the <i>coincidence circuit</i>, in which a switch would be closed only when several signals arrived at exactly the same time, thus, in effect, rendering a decision. Would a machine capable of making electronic logical operations be possible via some variation of this circuit? Experimenting with his own vacuum-tube circuits, Mauchly speculated that there might also exist circuits used in other kinds of instruments that would enable him to build a machine to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. At this point his speculations were more grandiose than his hand-wired prototypes, but the clues he had obtained from the cosmic-ray researchers were enough to put Mauchly's weather-predicting machines on a collision course with a certain device the U.S. Army had in mind, one that had nothing to do with sunspots or the weather.</p>

      <p>莫奇利带着一台小型模拟设备参加了美国科学促进会的会议，并在那里遇到了阿塔纳索夫。1941 年 6 月，他搭便车前往爱荷华州艾姆斯拜访阿塔纳索夫。阿塔纳索夫演示了 ABC，莫奇利呆了五天。32 年后，法院裁定，莫奇利后来发明的 ENIAC 依赖于阿塔纳索夫的关键思想，这些思想在 6 月的五天里从他的脑海中转移到了另一个人的脑海中。</p><p>Mauchly brought a small analog device to the AAAS meeting where he met Atanasoff, and in June, 1941, he hitched a ride to visit Atanasoff in Ames, Iowa. Atanasoff demonstrated the ABC, Mauchly stayed for five days, and thirty-two years later a court decided that Mauchly's later invention of the ENIAC relied upon key ideas of Atanasoff's that were transferred from mind to mind those five days in June.</p>

      <p>1973 年的法律判决（<i>霍尼韦尔诉斯佩里兰德案</i>，美国地方法院，明尼苏达州，第四分庭）并没有说莫奇利窃取了任何东西，但确实将电子计算机发明的部分功劳归还给了一个人，而这个人的名字在莫奇利和埃克特获得的所有宣传和荣誉中几乎被遗忘了。判决后，莫奇利说：“我觉得那次拜访阿塔纳索夫除了后来的皇家敕令外一无所获。”代表莫奇利，必须指出的是，没有人质疑 ENIAC 的规模和工程大胆性远远超出了 ABC，而且莫奇利至少和阿塔纳索夫一样早地走上了正确的道路。</p><p>The 1973 legal decision (<i>Honeywell versus Sperry Rand</i>, U.S. District Court, District of Minnesota, Fourth Division) did not state that Mauchly stole anything, but did restore partial credit for the invention of the electronic computer to a man whose name had been nearly forgotten in all the publicity and honors heaped upon Mauchly and Eckert. After the ruling, Mauchly said: "I feel I got nothing out of that visit to Atanasoff except the royal shaft later." On Mauchly's behalf, it must be noted that nobody has disputed the fact that the sheer scale and engineering audacity of ENIAC was far beyond the ABC, and that Mauchly was indeed on the right track at least as early as Atanasoff.</p>

      <p>ENIAC 的成功和 ABC 的默默无闻的部分原因必须归咎于历史的偶然。撇开法律问题不谈，1941 年夏末，历史的重心转向了莫奇利，当时他报名参加了摩尔工程学院由军队赞助的电子学课程。他的导师 J. Presper Eckert 是一位非常聪明的费城贵族，比莫奇利年轻 12 岁。当电子奇才 Eckert 得知莫奇利计划自动化大规模数值计算时，他们的创意力量达到了临界点。他们恰好在正确的时间出现在正确的地点，策划了这样一个雄心勃勃的项目。</p><p>Part of the reason for ENIAC's success and ABC's obscurity must be attributed to the accidents of history. Legal issues aside, the historical momentum shifted to Mauchly later in the summer of 1941, when he signed up for an Army-sponsored electronics course at the Moore School of Engineering. His instructor, J. Presper Eckert, was an exceptionally bright Philadelphia blueblood twelve years younger than Mauchly. When Eckert, the electronics wizard, learned of Mauchly's plan to automate large-scale numerical calculations, a critical mass of idea-power was reached. They were in exactly the right place at the right time to cook up such an ambitious project.</p>

      <p>34 岁的约翰·莫奇利和 22 岁的埃克特总统开始草拟电子计算机计划后不久，他们结识了赫尔曼·戈德斯坦中尉，他既是数学家，又是摩尔学院和弹道研究实验室之间的联络官。在见到他们时，戈德斯坦<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">已经对弹道计算能力的缺乏感到十分沮丧，以至于他甚至接受了这两位神童向他讲述的科幻故事。</font></p><p>Not long after thirty-four-year-old John Mauchly and twenty-two-year-old Pres Eckert started to sketch out a plan for an electronic computer, they became acquainted with Lieutenant Herman Goldstine, both as a mathematician and as a liaison officer between the Moore School and the Ballistic Research Laboratory. By the time he met them, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Goldstine was sufficiently frustrated by the lack of ballistic computing power that he was receptive to even a science-fiction story like the one presented to him by these two whiz kids.</font></p>

      <p>虽然这听起来像是一项工程壮举，但戈德斯坦知道，像莫奇利和埃克特向他描述的这种电子设备，其弹道计算速度有可能比当时最好的机器——艾肯-IBM-哈佛-海军设备 Mark I 快 1000 倍以上。但要验证他们是否正确，需要花费大量资金。阿塔纳索夫和贝里制造的<a href="http://www.scl.ameslab.gov/ABC/">原型机</a>总共花费了 6500 美元。这些家伙需要数十万美元才能组装出如此复杂而精密的东西，以至于当时大多数电气工程师都发誓它绝对不可能成功。</p><p>As wild as it sounded as an engineering feat, Goldstine knew that an electronic device such as the one Mauchly and Eckert described to him had the potential to perform ballistic calculations over 1000 times faster than the best existing machine, the Aiken-IBM-Harvard-Navy device called the Mark I. But it would cost a lot of money to find out if they were right. Atanasoff and Berry built <a href="http://www.scl.ameslab.gov/ABC/">their prototype</a> for a total of $6500. These boys would need hundreds of thousands of dollars to lash together something so complicated and delicate that most electrical engineers of the time would swear it could never work.</p>

      <p>戈德斯坦后来解释了尝试拟议的电子计算器项目所涉及的风险：</p><p>Goldstine later explained the risks associated with attempting the proposed electronic calculator project:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">...我们应该意识到，这台机器实际上包含了16种类型的17,000多个电子管，以每秒100,000个脉冲的基本时钟频率运行。...<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">每10微秒，如果17,000个电子管中有一个运行不正常，就会出现一次错误；这意味着在一秒钟内就有17亿次...发生故障的机会。...人类从未制造出能够以这种保真度或可靠性运行的仪器，这就是为什么这项工作如此冒险，成就如此伟大。</font></font>
      

      <p>1943 年 4 月 9 日，摩尔学院的两位年轻的计算机发明家、发现他们的数学家出身的中尉，以及他们通过创造世界上最复杂的机器来解决计算问题的大胆计划，成为了一次高层会议的主题。出席会议的有军事数学研究工作的最初创始人之一、普林斯顿高等研究院院长奥斯瓦尔德·凡勃伦，以及弹道研究实验室主任莱斯利·西蒙上校和戈德斯坦。</p><p>The two young would-be computer inventors at the Moore School, the mathematician-turned-lieutenant who found them, and their audacious plan for cutting through the calculation problem by creating the world's most complicated machine were the subject of a high-level meeting on April 9, 1943. Attending was one of the original founders of the military's mathematical research effort and President of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, Oswald Veblen, as well as Colonel Leslie Simon, director of the Ballistic Research Laboratory, and Goldstine.</p>

      <p>戈德斯坦在近 30 年后写道，当时美国战争部开始了对计算机的古老探索，并因此而取得了必然成果，凡勃伦“听了我一会儿演讲后，摇摇晃晃地坐在椅子后腿上，把椅子砰的一声倒在地上，然后站起来说：‘西蒙，把钱给戈德斯坦。’”他们拿到了钱——最终多达 40 万美元——并开始建造他们的机器。</p><p>The moment when the United States War Department entered the age-old quest for a computing machine, and thus made the outcome inevitable, was recalled by Goldstine when he wrote, nearly thirty years later, that Veblen, "after listening for a short while to my presentation and teetering on the back legs of his chair brought the chair down with a crash, arose, and said, 'Simon, give Goldstine the money.'" They got their money -- eventually as much as $400,000 -- and started building their machine.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">ENIAC 体积庞大，长 100 英尺，高 10 英尺，深 3 英尺，重达 30 吨，而且温度非常高，足以使室温高达 120 华氏度，同时它通过超过 17,000 个电子管、70,000 个电阻器、10,000 个电容器和 6,000 个手持开关来处理多变量微分方程。它耗电量巨大，传说当它通电时，费城的灯光会变暗。</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">ENIAC was monstrous -- 100 feet long, 10 feet high, 3 feet deep, weighing 30 tons -- and hot enough to keep the room temperature up toward 120 degrees F while it shunted multivariable differential equations through its more than 17,000 tubes, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors, and 6,000 hand-set switches. It used an enormous amount of power -- the apocryphal story is that the lights of Philadelphia dimmed when it was plugged in.</font></p>

      <p>当 ENIAC 最终完成时，已经来不及投入战争，但它确实实现了发明者的承诺：一个熟练的人类计算器需要 20 个小时才能完成的弹道计算，在机器上只需不到 30 秒即可完成。这是第一次，炮弹的弹道计算时间比实际炮弹飞向目标的时间还短。但当 ENIAC 完成时，射击表已不再是当时最火爆的东西。1945 年冬末，机器运行的第一个问题是当时正在设计的氢弹的试验计算。</p><p>When it was finally completed, ENIAC was too late to use in the war, but it certainly delivered what its inventors had promised: a ballistic calculation that would have taken twenty hours for a skilled human calculator could be accomplished by the machine in less than thirty seconds. For the first time, the trajectory of a shell could be calculated in less time than it took an actual shell to travel to its target. But the firing tables were no longer the biggest boom on the block by the time ENIAC was completed. The first problem run on the machine, late in the winter of 1945, was a trial calculation for the hydrogen bomb then being designed.</p>

      <p>在阿伯丁第一次偶然遇见戈德斯坦，并在不久之后展示了 ENIAC 原型机后，冯·诺依曼以特别顾问的身份加入了摩尔学院项目。约翰尼在形式、系统和逻辑思维方面的天赋被运用到了这个庞大的电子电路迷宫的逻辑特性中。工程问题仍然十分艰巨，但人们逐渐意识到，非物理组件、设置机器操作的微妙之处（他们开始称之为<i>编码）同样困难且重要。</i></p><p>After his first accidental meeting with Goldstine at Aberdeen, and the demonstration of a prototype ENIAC soon afterward, von Neumann joined the Moore School project as a special consultant. Johnny's genius for formal, systematic, logical thinking was applied to the logical properties of this huge maze of electronic circuits. The engineering problems were still formidable, but it was becoming clear that the nonphysical component, the subtleties of setting up the machine's operations -- the <i>coding</i>, as they began to call it -- was equally difficult and important.</p>

      <p>几年后晶体管出现之前，ENIAC 代表着大量高速开关所能实现的物理上限。1945 年，提高计算能力最有希望的方法是改进机器的逻辑结构。而冯·诺依曼可能是布莱切利园以西唯一一个能够理解第一台数字计算机逻辑属性的人。</p><p>Until the transistor came along a few years later, ENIAC would represent the physical upper limit of what could be done with a large number of high-speed switches. In 1945, the most promising approach to greater computing power was in improving the logical structure of the machine. And von Neumann was probably the one man west of Bletchley Park equipped to understand the logical attributes of the first digital computer.</p>

      <p>ENIAC 能够如此快速运行的部分原因是电子脉冲所遵循的路径已连接到机器中。这种电子路径是机器将输入数据转换为解决方案的指令的具体化。ENIAC 可以求解多种不同类型的方程，并且计算的性能可能会因子问题的结果而改变，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">但 ENIAC 远不如巴贝奇的分析机灵活，后者可以重新编程以求解不同的方程组，不是通过改变机器本身，而是通过改变输入卡的顺序。</font></p><p>Part of the reason ENIAC was able to operate so fast was that the routes followed by the electronic impulses were wired into the machine. This electronic routing was the materialization of the machine's instructions for transforming the input data into the solution. Many different kinds of equations could be solved, and the performance of a calculation could be altered by the outcome of subproblems, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">but ENIAC was nowhere near as flexible as Babbage's Analytical Engine, which could be reprogrammed to solve a different set of equations, not by altering the machine itself, but by altering the sequence of input cards.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">莫奇利和埃克特在计算能力和速度方面取得了进步，但他们也因此牺牲了整体灵活性。这台庞大的电子机器必须通过改变类似电话交换机的配置来解决每个问题，这个过程可能需要几天时间。该设备</font>最初是一个弹道学项目，这在一定程度上导致了这种不灵活性。摩尔学院的工程师们并没有打算制造一台通用机器。他们的合同明确规定，他们要制造一种全新的弹道计算器。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">What Mauchly and Eckert gained in calculating power and speed, they paid for in overall flexibility. The gargantuan electronic machine had to be set up for solving each separate problem by changing the configuration of a huge telephone-like switchboard, a procedure that could take days.</font> The origins of the device as a ballistics project were partially responsible for this inflexibility. It was not the intention of the Moore School engineers to build a universal machine. Their contract quite clearly specified that they create an altogether new kind of trajectory calculator.</p>

      <p>尤其是在冯·诺依曼加入团队后，他们意识到他们正在建造的东西不仅会成为终极数学计算器，而且会成为全新机器类别的第一个原型，尽管这个原型必然不完美。在 ENIAC 完成之前，它的设计者们已经在计划继任者了。尤其是冯·诺依曼，他开始意识到他们谈论的是一种<i>通用机器</i>，这种机器本质上特别适合作为人类思维的延伸。</p><p>Especially after von Neumann joined the team, they realized that what they were constructing would not only become the ultimate mathematical calculator, but the first, necessarily imperfect prototype of a whole new category of machine. Before ENIAC was completed, its designers were already planning a successor. Von Neumann, especially, began to realize that what they were talking about was a <i>general-purpose machine</i>, one that was by its nature particularly well suited to function as an extension of the human mind.</p>

      <p>如果说有什么东西对约翰尼来说是神圣的，那就是人类思想的力量，它能够洞悉宇宙的奥秘，人类将知识应用于实际的意愿。当时，他脑子里还有其他事情要考虑——从氢弹设计的秘密到逻辑机器的结构——但他似乎最热衷于这些设备可能演变成某种智力延伸的想法。像他这样的思想家在这样一台机器的帮助下还能取得多少成就呢？一位传记作者这样写道：</p><p>If one thing was sacred to Johnny, it was the power of human thought to penetrate the mysteries of the universe, and the will of human beings to apply that knowledge to practical ends. He had other things on his own mind at the time -- from the secrets of H-bomb design to the structure of logic machines -- but he appeared to be most keen on the idea that these devices might evolve into some kind of intellectual extension. How much more might a thinker like himself accomplish with the aid of such a machine? One biographer put it this way:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">冯·诺依曼在 1944 年和 1945 年的热情首先来自于改进通用计算机的挑战。他曾是原子弹项目中使用最新计算机的支持者，但他意识到对于即将进行的氢弹项目，仍然需要更好更快的机器。在理论层面，他对大脑和计算机之间似乎存在组织上的相似性感到好奇，这些相似性可能会导致涵盖计算机和大脑的形式逻辑理论；此外，逻辑理论本身将构成有趣的抽象逻辑。他谨慎地假设计算机和人脑的惊人功能相似，尤其是因为 1944 年他在生理学方面几乎没有准备。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">相反，他认为计算机是一种作为其用户的延伸而运行的技术设备；它将导致人脑的强化，而冯·诺依曼希望尽可能快地推动这种强化。</font></font>
      

      <p>毫无疑问，在计算机技术的关键孕育期，莫奇利、埃克特、戈德斯坦和冯·诺依曼曾作为一个团队一起工作。然而，这个团队在 1946 年解散了，因此，对具体想法的认可问题变得棘手。备忘录的撰写，就像任何项目一样，丝毫没有想到多年后它们会被视为历史或法律文件。技术发展得太快，传统的同行评审和出版过程无法实现：早期最重要的两份文件名为“初稿……”和“初步报告……”。</p><p>There is no dispute that Mauchly, Eckert, Goldstine, and Von Neumann worked together as a team during this crucial gestation period of computer technology. The team split up in 1946, however, so the matter of accrediting specific ideas has become a sticky one. Memoranda were written, as they are on any project, without the least expectation that years later they would be regarded as historical or legal documents. Technology was moving too fast for the traditional process of peer review and publication: the two most important documents from these early days were titled "First Draft . . ." and "Preliminary Report . . ."</p>

      <p>当他们开始为下一代电子计算机起草设计草图时，ENIAC 的四位主要设计师一致认为，目标是设计一台能够以更高效的方式使用相同硬件技术的机器。下一步，即存储编程的发明<i>，</i>正是认证争议的来源。1945 年 6 月底，ENIAC 团队准备了一份提案，形式为“电子离散变量计算器报告初稿”（EDVAC）。它由冯·诺依曼签署，但反映了团队的结论。戈德斯坦后来对此表示：“有人说，冯·诺依曼在他的<i>初稿</i>中没有给其他人署名。原因是，该文件是冯·诺依曼打算作为工作文件，用于澄清和协调团队的思想，并不打算出版。” （然而，莫奇利和埃克特对冯·诺依曼的意图持不那么善意的看法。）这篇论文中阐述的最重要的创新涉及编码的逻辑方面，以及处理遵循编码指令的物理设备的工程。</p><p>By the time they got around to sketching the design for the next electronic computer, the four main ENIAC designers had agreed that the goal was to design a machine that would use the same hardware technology in a more efficient way. The next step, the invention of stored <i>programming</i>, is where the accreditation controversy comes in. At the end of June, 1945, the ENIAC team prepared a proposal in the form of a "First Draft of a Report on the Electronic Discrete Variable Calculator" (EDVAC). It was signed by von Neumann, but reflected the conclusions of the group. Goldstine later said of this: "It has been said by some that von Neumann did not give credits in his <i>First Draft</i> to others. The reason for this was that the document was intended by von Neumann as a working paper for use in clarifying and coordinating the thinking of the group and was not intended for publication." (Mauchly and Eckert, however, took a less benign view of von Neumann's intentions.) The most significant innovations articulated in this paper involved the logical aspects of coding, as well as dealing with the engineering of the physical device that was to follow the coded instructions.</p>

      <p>在 ENIAC 上为新计算编写编码指令所花费的时间远不及手工计算。一旦编写了执行计算所需的指令代码，要对任何输入数据集执行计算，只需正确配置机器以执行指令即可。以前耗时最多的计算变得微不足道，但重置开关又产生了新的瓶颈，与运行计算所需的时间相比，重置开关所花费的时间太长了。</p><p>Creating the coded instructions for a new computation on ENIAC was nowhere near as time consuming as carrying out the calculation by hand. Once the code for the instructions needed to carry out the calculation had been drawn up, all that had to be done to perform the computation on any set of input data was to properly configure the machine to perform the instructions. The calculation, which formerly took up the most time, had become trivial, but a new bottleneck was created with the resetting of switches, a process that took an unreasonable amount of time compared with the length of time it would take to run the calculation.</p>

      <p>重置开关是最令人担忧的瓶颈，但并非唯一瓶颈。指令利用数据所花费的时间虽然比手动计算时代大大减少，但也十分重要——在弹道学中，自动计算的最终目标是能够在导弹着陆<i>前</i>预测其路径，而不是几天、几小时甚至几分钟后。如果有一种更直接的方式让不同的指令集（计算系统中不灵活、变化缓慢的组件）与存储在电子存储器中的数据（计算中访问速度更快的组件）进行交互就好了。正如冯·诺依曼及其同事所提出的，解决方案是基于<i>逻辑</i>突破的创新。</p><p>Resetting the switches was the most worrisome bottleneck, but not the only one. The amount of time it took for the instructions to make use of the data, although greatly reduced from the era of manual calculation, was also significant -- in ballistics, the ultimate goal of automating calculation was to be able to predict the path of a missile <i>before</i> it landed, not days or hours or even just minutes later. If only there was a more direct way for the different sets of instructions -- the inflexible, slow-to-change component of the computing system -- to interact with the data stored in the electronic memory, the more quickly accessible component of computation. The solution, as von Neumann and colleagues formulated it, was an innovation based upon a <i>logical</i> breakthrough.</p>

      <p>如今已声名远扬的“初稿”描述了真正的通用电子数字计算机的逻辑特性。EDVAC 草案中有一个关键段落指出了巴贝奇（如果不是图灵的话）忽略的一点：“该设备需要相当大的内存。虽然内存的各个部分似乎必须执行性质略有不同、用途大不相同的功能，但将整个内存视为一个器官仍然很诱人。”换句话说，通用计算机应该能够在其内部内存中存储指令和数据。</p><p>The now-famous "First Draft" described the logical properties of a true general-purpose electronic digital computer. In one key passage, the EDVAC draft pointed out something that Babbage, if not Turing, had overlooked: "The device requires a considerable memory. While it appears that various parts of this memory have to perform functions which differ somewhat in their nature and considerably in their purpose, it is nevertheless tempting to treat the entire memory as one organ." In other words, a general-purpose computer should be able to store instructions in its internal memory, along with data.</p>

      <p>以前复杂的总机设置配置现在可以由程序员以数字的形式表示出来，并由计算机读取为存储在内存中的指令的位置，该指令将自动应用于同样存储在内存中的指定数据。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">这意味着程序可以调用其他程序，甚至修改其他程序，而无需人工操作员的干预。突然间，通过这一简单的改变，真正的信息处理成为可能。</font></p><p>What used to be a complex configuration of switchboard settings could be symbolized by the programmer in the form of a number and read by the computer as the location of an instruction stored in memory, an instruction that would automatically be applied to specified data that was also stored in memory. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">This meant that the program could call up other programs, and even modify other programs, without intervention by the human operator. Suddenly, with this simple change, true information processing became possible.</font></p>

      <p>这是存储程序概念的核心，尽管 ENIAC 团队是第一个正式用这种术语描述电子计算设备的团队，但应该注意的是，艾伦·图灵在 1936 年的论文中提出了完全相同想法的抽象版本，即通用图灵机的单条磁带。当宾夕法尼亚小组整理 EDVAC 报告时，图灵又在思考存储程序的概念：</p><p>This is the kernel of the concept of stored programming, and although the ENIAC team was officially the first to describe an electronic computing device in such terms, it should be noted that the abstract version of exactly the same idea was proposed in Alan Turing's 1936 paper in the form of the single tape of the universal Turing machine. And at the same time the Pennsylvania group was putting together the EDVAC report, Turing was thinking again about the concept of stored programs:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">于是 1945 年春，ENIAC 团队与阿兰·图灵自然而然地想到用单一“磁带”构建一台通用机器。...</font>

        <p><font size="-1">但是当阿兰·图灵谈到“构建大脑”时，他正在业余时间独自工作和思考，在英国后花园的棚子里闲逛，用特工勉强让出的几台设备。他并没有被要求提供冯·诺依曼所从事的数值问题的解；他一直在为自己思考。他只是把以前没有人组合在一起的东西组合在一起：他的一带通用图灵机、大规模脉冲技术可以工作的知识，以及将密码分析思想转化为“确定的方法”和“机械过程”的经验。自 1939 年以来，他只关心符号、状态和指令表——以及尽可能有效地以具体形式体现它们的问题。</font></p><p><font size="-1">But when Alan Turing spoke of "building a brain," he was working and thinking alone in his spare time, pottering around in a British back garden shed with a few pieces of equipment grudgingly conceded by the secret service. He was not being asked to provide the solution to numerical problems such as those von Neumann was engaged upon; he had been thinking for himself. He had simply put together things that no one had put together before: his one tape universal Turing machine, the knowledge that large scale pulse technology could work, and the experience of turning cryptanalytic thought into "definite methods" and "mechanical processes." Since 1939 he had been concerned with little but symbols, states, and instruction tables -- and with the problem of embodying these as effectively as possible in concrete forms.</font></p>
      随着 EDVAC 的设计，弹道计算器向通用计算机迈出了第一步，一些人清楚地认识到，这种设备肯定会发展成为功能更强大的设备。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">发明者们对他们的技术未来用途的设想，是导致</font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">ENIAC 四位负责人之间出现重大理论分歧的原因之一。冯·诺依曼和戈德斯坦看到了为科学家和数学家打造一款极其强大的研究工具的机会。莫奇利和埃克特已经在考虑军事或研究机构以外的商业和政府应用。

      </font></font><p>1945 年 12 月，即“初稿”发布六个月后，ENIAC 首次运行，这是洛斯阿拉莫斯实验室的科学家提出的一个问题。ENIAC 于 1946 年 2 月正式投入使用。到那时，战时条件强加给研究团队的爱国团结精神已经消散。冯·诺依曼对计算机制造企业的军事和科学未来充满热情，但在高层介入之前，这两个年轻人梦想着这个计算机项目，但他们对自己的创意应该如何成熟有不同的想法。机构、人员和思想之间的紧张关系不断加剧，直到 1946 年 3 月 31 日，莫奇利和埃克特因与大学就 ENIAC 的专利权发生争执而离开摩尔学院。此后不久，他们成立了自己的团队，最终将其命名为<i>埃克特-莫奇利计算机公司</i>。</p><p>The first calculation run on ENIAC in December, 1945, six months after the "First Draft," was a problem posed by scientists from Los Alamos Laboratories. ENIAC was formally dedicated in February, 1946. By then, the patriotic solidarity enforced upon the research team by wartime conditions had faded away. Von Neumann was enthusiastic about the military and scientific future of the computer-building enterprise, but the two young men who had dreamed up the computer project before the big brass stepped in were getting other ideas about how their brain-child ought to mature. The tensions between institutions, people, and ideas mounted until Mauchly and Eckert left the Moore School on March 31, 1946, over a dispute with the university concerning patent rights to ENIAC. They founded their own group shortly thereafter, eventually naming it <i>The Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation</i>.</p>

      <p>当莫奇利和埃克特后来声称，他们实际上是 EDVAC 报告的唯一发起人时，用戈德斯坦的话来说，他们遭到了戈德斯坦和冯·诺依曼的“强烈反对”。这场分裂最终成为了终生的不和。戈德斯坦在 1972 年从他公认的偏颇观点出发，毫不含糊地指出了冯·诺依曼的贡献：</p><p>When Mauchly and Eckert later suggested that they were, in fact, the sole originators of the EDVAC report, they were, in Goldstine's phrase, "strenuously opposed" by Goldstine and von Neumann. The split turned out to be a lifelong feud. Goldstine, writing in 1972 from his admittedly partial perspective, was unequivocal in pointing out von Neumann's contributions:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">首先，他的整个总结作为一个整体构成了一项重大贡献，不仅对 EDVAC 产生了深远影响，而且成为几乎所有未来逻辑设计研究的典范。其次，在那份报告中，他引入了一个改编自 McCulloch 和 Pitts 的逻辑概念，后者在神经系统研究中使用了该概念。这种符号被广泛使用，并且以修改后的形式仍然是一种重要且确实必不可少的方式，用于从逻辑的角度以图形方式描述计算机电路的行为。</font>

        <p><font size="-1">第三，在著名的报告中，他提出了一套 EDVAC 指令，并在随后的一封信中制定了<i>排序和合并</i>程序的详细程序。这是一个里程碑，因为它首次阐明了现在著名的存储程序概念，并给出了完整的示例。</font></p><p><font size="-1">Third, in the famous report he proposed a repertoire of instructions for the EDVAC, and in a subsequent letter he worked out a detailed programming for a <i>sort and merge</i> routine. This represents a milestone, since it is the first elucidation of the now famous stored program concept together with a completely worked-out illustration.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">第四，他明确阐述了现代计算机的串行操作方式，即每次检查一条指令然后执行，这与 ENIAC 的并行操作方式（多件事同时进行）形成了鲜明的对比。</font></p><p><font size="-1">Fourth, he set forth clearly the serial mode of operation of the modern computer, i.e., one instruction at a time is inspected and then executed. This is in sharp distinction to the parallel operation of the ENIAC in which many things are simultaneously performed.</font></p>
      

      <p>当莫奇利和埃克特着手建立计算机技术的商业应用时，戈德斯坦、冯·诺依曼和另一位名叫亚瑟·伯克斯的数学家共同起草了一份提案，并将其提交给普林斯顿高等研究院、美国无线电公司和陆军军械部，要求拨款一百万美元建造一台先进的电子数字计算机。再一次，这个项目中的一些想法是 ENIAC 项目的集体创作的延伸。但这次“初步讨论”毫无疑问是由冯·诺依曼主导的，也大胆地超越了“初稿”中所述的 EDVAC 概念。</p><p>While Mauchly and Eckert set forth to establish the commercial applications of computer technology, Goldstine, von Neumann, and another mathematician by the name of Arthur Burks put together a proposal and presented it to the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, the Radio Corporation of America, and the Army Ordnance Department, requesting one million dollars to build an advanced electronic digital computer. Once again, some of the thinking in this project was an extension of the group creations of the ENIAC project. But this "Preliminary Discussion," unquestionably dominated by von Neumann, also went boldly beyond the EDVAC conception as it was stated in the "First Draft."</p>

      <p>尽管最新的提案旨在建造一台比 EDVAC 更复杂的机器，但作者们所做的远不止描述一台特定的机器。他们强烈建议他们的规范应该是所有未来计算机的逻辑结构和基本操作方法的总体规划。他们是对的：<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">花了近四十年的时间，直到 20 世纪 80 年代才有人认真尝试建造“非冯·诺依曼机器”。</font></p><p>Although the latest proposal was aimed at the construction of a machine that would be more sophisticated than EDVAC, the authors went much farther than describing a particular machine. They very strongly suggested that their specification should be of the general plan for the logical structure and fundamental method of operation for all future computers. They were right: <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">it took almost forty years, until the 1980s until anyone made a serious attempt to build "non-von Neumann machines."</font></p>

      <p>“电子计算仪器逻辑设计的初步讨论”自此被公认为<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">现代电子计算机设计科学的奠基性文献，该文献于 1946 年 6 月 28 日提交，但直到 1962 年，浓缩版才在</font><i>《数据管理》</i>杂志上发表，当时只有原始报告的油印副本可供军械部使用。该文献的主要贡献与内存机制的逻辑使用以及后来被称为“逻辑架构”的总体规划有关。该架构的一个方面是巧妙地使数据和指令在计算过程中可更改，而无需人工操作员的直接干预。</p><p>"Preliminary Discussion of the Logical Design of an Electronic Computing Instrument," which has since been recognized <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">as the founding document of the modern science of electronic computer design,</font> was submitted on June 28, 1946, but was available only in the form of mimeographed copies of the original report to the Ordnance Department until 1962, when a condensed version was published in <i>Datamation</i> magazine. The primary contributions of this document were related to the logical use of the memory mechanism and the overall plan of what has been come to be known as the "logical architecture." One aspect of this architecture was the ingenious way data and instructions were made to be changeable during the course of a computation without requiring direct intervention by the human operator.</p>

      <p>这种可变性是通过将数值数据视为可以分配给内存中特定位置的“值”来实现的。EDVAC 型计算机的基本内存组件使用称为“寄存器”的内存元素集合，以一系列开/关脉冲的形式存储数值。这些数字中的每一个都被分配了内存中的“地址”，任何地址都可以包含数据或指令。这样，控制单元可以在需要时找到特定的数据和指令。这样做的一个结果是，特定数据可以是一个变量——就像代数中的<i>x——</i>可以通过将操作结果存储在适当的地址或通过告诉计算机对该位置找到的任何内容执行操作来独立更改它。</p><p>This changeability was accomplished by treating numerical data as "values" that could be assigned to specific locations in memory. The basic memory component of an EDVAC-type computer used collections of memory elements known as "registers" to store numerical values in the form of a series of on/off impulses. Each of these numbers was assigned an "address" in the memory, and any address could contain either data or an instruction. In this way, specific data and instructions could be located when needed by the control unit. One result of this was that a particular piece of data could be a variable -- like the <i>x</i> in algebra -- that could be changed independently by having the results of an operation stored at the appropriate address, or by telling the computer to perform an operation on whatever was found at that location.</p>

      <p>任何一系列计算指令的特征之一就是对数据的引用：当指令告诉机器如何执行计算时，它们必须指定要插入计算的数据。通过使对数据的引用成为对特定内存位置内容的引用，而不是对特定数字的引用，数据可以根据先前步骤的结果在计算过程中发生变化。通过这种方式，存储在内存中的数字可以成为除数值之外的数量符号，就像代数使人们能够操纵<i>x</i>和<i>y</i>等符号而无需指定值一样。</p><p>One of the characteristics of any series of computation instructions is a reference to data: when the instructions tell the machine how to perform a calculation, they have to specify what data to plug into the calculation. By making the reference to data a reference to the contents of a specific memory location, instead of a reference to a specific number, it became possible for the data to change during the course of a computation, according to the results of earlier steps. It is in this way that the numbers stored in the memory can become symbolic of quantities other than just numerical value, in the same way that algebra enables one to manipulate symbols like <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> without specifying the values.</p>

      <p>如果您将内存地址视为类似于编号的储物格或邮政信箱的东西，则更容易想象此模式的逻辑——每个地址只不过是查找消息的地方。地址充当易于定位的容器，用于在其中找到（可变的）值（“消息”）。例如，盒子 1 可能包含一个数字；盒子 2 可能包含另一个数字；盒子 3 可能包含对盒子 1 和盒子 2 中的数字执行算术运算的指令；盒子 4 可能包含盒子 3 中指定的操作。前两个盒子中的数字可能是固定数字，也可能是变量，其值可能取决于其他操作的结果。</p><p>It is easier to visualize the logic of this schema if you think of the memory addresses as something akin to numbered cubbyholes or post-office boxes -- each address is nothing but a place to find a message. The addresses serve as easily located containers for the (changeable) values (the "messages") to be found inside them. Box #1, for example, might contain a number; box #2 might contain another number; box #3 might contain instructions for an arithmetic operation to be performed on the numbers found in boxes #1 and #2; box #4 might contain the operation specified in box #3. The numbers in the first two boxes might be fixed numbers, or they might be variables, the values of which might depend on the result of other operations.</p>

      <p>通过将指令和原始数据放在同一内存中，可以比 ENIAC 更快地执行计算，但也需要设计一种方法来清楚地向机器指出某些特定地址包含指令，而其他地址包含这些指令要操作的数字。</p><p>By putting both the instructions and the raw data inside the same memory, it became possible to perform computations much faster than with ENIAC, but it also became necessary to devise a way to clearly indicate to the machine that some specific addresses contain instructions and other addresses contain numbers for those instructions to operate on.</p>

      <p>在《初稿》中，冯·诺依曼规定，程序编码中的每条指令都应以数字 1 开头的数字表示，而每个数字（数据）都应以数字 0 开头。《初步报告》扩展了区分指令和数据的方法，指出计算机还将通过在两个不同的<i>时间周期</i>内运行来将这两类信息分开。</p><p>In the "First Draft," von Neumann specified that each instruction should be designated in the coding of a program by a number that begins with the digit 1, and each of the numbers (data) should begin with the digit 0. The "Preliminary Report" expanded the means of distinguishing instructions from data by stating that computers would keep these two categories of information separate by operating during two different <i>time cycles</i>, as well.</p>

      <p>所有指令都按照基于内置时钟滴答声的计时方案执行。“指令”周期和“执行”周期交替进行：在“滴答”周期，机器的控制单元将输入的数字解释为指令，并在“滴答”周期开始时准备执行指令指定的操作，此时“执行”周期开始，控制单元将输入解释为要操作的数据。</p><p>All the instructions are executed according to a timing scheme based on the ticking of a built-in clock. The "instruction" cycles and "execution" cycles alternate: On "tick," the machine's control unit interprets numbers brought to it as instructions, and prepares to execute the operations specified by the instructions on "tock," when the "execution" cycle begins and the control unit interprets input as data to operate upon.</p>

      <p>这种新型通用计算机的计划不仅指定了时间方案，还规定了后来被称为计算机“架构”的东西——逻辑功能在物理组件之间的划分。该方案与巴贝奇和图灵的模型有相似之处。《初步报告》的作者声称，所有此类机器都必须有一个可以执行算术和逻辑运算的单元（进行实际计算的处理单元，相当于巴贝奇的“磨机”），一个可以存储当前问题的指令和数据的单元（如巴贝奇的“存储器”，一种临时存储设备），一个按照指定的顺序执行指令的单元（如图灵理论机器的“读/写头”），以及一个人类操作员可以输入原始信息或查看计算输出的单元（我们现在称之为“输入输出设备”）。</p><p>The plan for this new category of general-purpose computer not only specified a timing scheme but set down what has become known as the "architecture" of the computer -- the division of logical functions among physical components. The scheme had similarities to both Babbage's and Turing's models. All such machines, the authors of the "Preliminary Report" declared, must have a unit where arithmetic and logical operations can be performed (the processing unit where actual calculation takes place, equivalent to Babbage's "mill"), a unit where instructions and data for the current problem can be stored (like Babbage's "store," a kind of temporary memory device), a unit that executes the instructions according to the specified sequential order (like the "read/write head" of Turing's theoretical machine), and a unit where the human operator can enter raw information or see the computed output (what we now call "input-output devices").</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">任何遵循这些原则的机器——无论使用什么物理技术来实现这些逻辑功能——都是所谓的“冯·诺依曼架构”的一个例子。</font>无论你用齿轮和弹簧、真空管还是晶体管来制造这样的机器，只要它的操作遵循这个逻辑顺序，都没有关系。这个理论模板首先在美国高等研究院实施。IAS 机器的修改版被制作给兰德公司，兰德公司是一家空军衍生的“智囊团”，负责跟踪国家新但快速增长的核军械库和洛斯阿拉莫斯实验室的目标。尽管冯·诺依曼有些反对，兰德机器还是被称为 JOHNNIAC。洛斯阿拉莫斯负责核武器相关计算的机器被赋予了一个奇怪的、不委婉的名字 MANIAC。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Any machine that adheres to these principles -- no matter what physical technology is used to implement these logical functions -- is an example of what has become known as "the von Neumann architecture."</font> It doesn't matter whether you build such a machine out of gears and springs, vacuum tubes, or transistors, as long as its operations follow this logical sequence. This theoretical template was first implemented in the Unites States at the Institute for Advanced Study. Modified copies of the IAS machine were made for the Rand Corporation, an Air Force spinoff "think tank" that was responsible for keeping track of targets for the nation's new but fast-growing nuclear armory, and for the Los Alamos Laboratory. Against von Neumann's mild objections, the Rand machine was dubbed JOHNNIAC. The Los Alamos machine assigned to nuclear weapons-related calculations was given the strangely uneuphemistic name of MANIAC.</p>

      <p>（EDVAC、IAS 机、洛斯阿拉莫斯机和兰德机都不是第一台全功能存储程序计算机的运行实例。英国计算机制造商一直在进行并行研究，他们了解冯·诺依曼的思想，在建造基于冯·诺依曼所阐述的逻辑原理的机器时击败了美国人。第一台二进制、串行、使用存储程序内存的机器是 EDSAC——电子延迟存储自动计算器，由英国剑桥大学的大学数学实验室建造。）</p><p>(Neither EDVAC, the IAS machine, the Los Alamos machine, nor the Rand machine was the first operational example of a fully functioning stored-program computer. British computer builders, who had been pursuing parallel research and who were aware of Von Neumann's ideas, beat the Americans when it came to constructing a machine based on the logical principles enunciated by von Neumann. The first machine that was binary, serial, and used stored-program memory was EDSAC -- the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator, built at the University Mathematical Laboratory, University of Cambridge, England.)</p>

      <p>在冯·诺依曼机器中，算术和逻辑单元是系统基本操作的实现点。所有其他指令都是基于这些基本原理构建的。原则上，可以构建一个只包含很少、极其简单的内置操作的此类设备。例如，只要程序要求执行乘法运算，就可以反复执行加法。事实上，唯一绝对必要的两个操作是“非”和“与”。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">使用一些非常简单的硬连线操作和基于它们构建的复杂软件结构的问题在于，这会减慢计算机的运行速度：由于指令是随着内部时钟的滴答声一次执行一个（“串行”）的，因此程序中的基本指令数量决定了计算机运行该程序所需的时间。</font></p><p>In a von Neumann machine, the arithmetic and logic unit is where the basic operations of the system are wired in. All the other instructions are constructed out of these fundamentals. It is possible, in principle, to build a device of this type with very few, extremely simple, built-in operations. Addition, for example, could be performed over and over again whenever a multiplication operation is requested by a program. In fact, the only two operations that are absolutely necessary are "not" and "and." <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The problem with using a few very simple hardwired operations and proportionally complex software structures built from them is that it slows down the operation of the computer: Because instructions are executed one at a time ("serially") as the internal clock ticks, the number of basic instructions in a program dictates how long it takes a computer to run that program.</font></p>

      <p>“初步报告”中指定的控制单元（监督指令执行的组件）是埃米尔·L·波斯特和图灵创建的形式逻辑设备的实现，他们已经证明，可以设计出数字形式的代码，使机器能够解决任何明确陈述的问题。这就是符号与信号的交汇之处，是电路中开关脉冲序列、无尽磁带单元上的 X 和 O、程序员代码中的数字串，将人类创造的计算与计算机器结合在一起的地方。</p><p>The control unit specified by the "Preliminary Report" -- the component that supervises the execution of instructions -- was the materialization of the formal logic device created by Emil L. Post and Turing, who had proved that it was possible to devise codes in terms of numbers that could cause a machine to solve any problem that was clearly statable. This is where the symbol meets the signal, where sequences of on and off impulses in the circuits, the Xs and Os on the cells of the endless tape, the strings of numbers in the programmer's code, marry the human-created computation to the machine that computes.</p>

      <p>输入输出设备是系统中发展最慢的部分，而基于交换机的内存、算术和控制组件则以数量级的速度发展。在 ENIAC 之后的十多年里，穿孔卡是主要的输入设备，而电传打字机则是二十多年来最常见的输出设备。</p><p>The input-output devices were the parts of the system that were to advance the most slowly while the switch-based memory, arithmetic, and control components ascended through orders of magnitude. For over a decade after ENIAC, punched cards were the main input devices, and for over two decades, teletype machines were the most common output devices.</p>

      <p>未来该领域可能取得的突破及其影响并没有被忽视。在 1945 年 11 月撰写的一份关于 IAS 机器早期提案之一的备忘录中，冯·诺依曼预见了创建更注重视觉的输出设备的可能性：</p><p>The possibility of future breakthroughs in this area and their implications were not overlooked. In a memorandum written in November, 1945, concerning one of the early proposals for the IAS machine, von Neumann anticipated the possibility of creating a more visually oriented output device:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">在许多情况下，真正需要的输出不是数字的（可能是打印的），而是图像的（图形化的）。在这种情况下，机器应该直接将其图形化，特别是因为图形化可以以电子方式完成，因此比打印更快。在这种情况下，自然的输出是示波器，即荧光屏上的图片。在某些情况下，这些图片需要永久存储……在其他情况下，只需要目视检查。应该提供这两种替代方案。</font>
      <font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">但是，个人交互式计算机虽然对冯·诺依曼这样的人很有帮助，但问题却不够有趣。在解决了有关恒星中心过程的有趣问题之后，这项科学技术杰作也成为了历史的转折点，当科学家的雇主在广岛展示了他们的发明时，这项杰作也成为了历史的转折点，然后又解决了另一组与计算机器制造有关的问题，同时还向历史上最强大国家的领导人高谈阔论外交政策最有力的方面，约翰·冯·诺依曼的目标就是揭开最大的秘密。在 20 世纪 40 年代末和 50 年代初，当时最有趣的科学问题是“生命是什么？”

      </font></font><p>对于曾经在阿拉莫戈多和摩尔学院学习过的人来说，相信下一次智力征服可能使肉体永生的秘密触手可及，这并不太过牵强。当然，除非<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他下定决心破解生命的秘密，否则他永远不会知道自己是否真的能够解决最令人敬畏的自然奥秘。而他确实做到了。冯·诺依曼一如既往地专注于生命奥秘中吸引他最珍贵的本能和最强大能力的方面——自然密码的纯粹、逻辑和数学基础。他对被称为</font><i>自动机</i>的理论设备的逻辑特性特别感兴趣，图灵的机器就是一个例子。</p><p>To someone who had been at Alamogordo and the Moore School, it would not have been too farfetched to believe that the next intellectual conquest might bring the secret of physical immortality within reach. Certainly he would never know whether he could truly resolve the most awesome of nature's mysteries until <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">he set his mind to decoding the secret of life.</font> And that he did. Characteristically, von Neumann focused on the aspect of the mystery of life that appealed to his dearest instincts and most powerful capacities -- the pure, logical, mathematical underpinnings of nature's code. He was particularly interested in the logical properties of the theoretical devices known as <i>automata</i>, of which Turing's machine was an example.</p>

      <p><i>冯·诺依曼对自我复制</i>自动机的概念尤其感兴趣——空间和时间中的数学模式具有自我复制的特性。他能够利用自己对计算机的知识、对神经生理学和生物学日益增长的理解，并特别善于利用自己对逻辑的深刻理解，因为他认为自我复制自动机本质上是逻辑野兽。地球上的生物体完成这项任务的方式只是其中一种。原则上，这项任务可以由能够遵循计划的机器完成，因为计划，而不是执行计划的机制，是系统的一部分，具有特殊的、迄今为止神秘的属性，将生命与非生命物质区分开来。</p><p>Von Neumann was especially drawn to the idea of <i>self-reproducing</i> automata -- mathematical patterns in space and time that had the property of being able to reproduce themselves. He was able to draw on his knowledge of computers, his growing understanding of neurophysiology and biology, and make particularly good use of his deep understanding of logic, because he saw self-replicating automata as essentially logical beasts. The way the task was accomplished by living organisms of the type found on earth was only one way it could be done. In principle, the task could be done by a machine that could follow a plan, because the plan, and not the mechanism that carried it out, was a part of the system with the special, heretofore mysterious property that distinguished life from nonliving matter.</p>

      <p>冯·诺依曼从抽象的层面研究“细胞自动机”，就像图灵研究他的第一台机器一样。早在 1948 年，他就表明，任何自我复制系统都必须有原材料、提供指令的程序、遵循指令并在图灵型机器的细胞中排列符号的自动机、复制指令的系统和监督单元——这被证明是对活细胞中蛋白质合成的 DNA 方向的极好描述。</p><p>Von Neumann approached "cellular automata" on an abstract level, just as Turing did with his first machines. As early as 1948, he showed that any self-replicating system must have raw materials, a program that provides instructions, an automaton that follows the instructions and arranges the symbols in the cells of a Turing-type machine, a system for duplicating instructions, and a supervisory unit -- which turned out to be an excellent description of the DNA direction of protein synthesis in living cells.</p>

      <p>约翰尼感兴趣的另一件事是这个世界的游戏性。因此，他认为他的自我复制机器人就像一场游戏：</p><p>Another thing that interested Johnny was the gamelike aspect of the world. Accordingly, he thought about the way his self-reproducing automaton was like a game:</p>

      
        <p><font size="-1">利用同事斯坦尼斯拉夫·乌拉姆的工作成果，冯·诺依曼得以改进他的计算，使之具有更广泛的应用。冯·诺依曼的心理实验，我们可以轻松地以游戏的形式呈现，它利用了一个按单元格细分的均匀空间。我们可以将这些单元格视为棋盘上的方块。每个方块被分配有限数量的状态 - 例如，空、被占用或被特定颜色占用。同时，为每个单元格定义一个邻域。这个邻域可以由四个正交相邻的单元格或八个正交和对角相邻的单元格组成。在以这种方式划分的空间中，转换规则同时应用于每个单元格。任何特定单元格经历的转换都将取决于其自身状态及其邻居的状态。冯·诺依曼能够证明，一个由大约 200,000 个单元组成的配置，每个单元都有 29 种不同的可能状态，每个单元都位于 4 个正交相邻的正方形的邻域中，可以满足自我复制自动机的所有要求。大量的元素是必要的，因为冯·诺依曼的模型也是为模拟图灵机而设计的。从理论上讲，冯·诺依曼的机器可以执行任何数学运算。</font></p><p><font size="-1">Making use of the work done by his colleague Stanislav Ulam, von Neumann was able to refine his calculations and make them more generally applicable. Von Neumann's mental experiment, which we can easily present in the form of a game, makes use of a homogeneous space subdivided by cells. We can think of these cells as squares on a playing board. A finite number of states -- e.g., empty, occupied, or occupied by a specific color -- is assigned to a square. At the same time, a neighborhood is defined for each cell. This neighborhood can consist of either the four orthogonally bordering cells or the eight orthogonally and diagonally bordering cells. In the space divided up this way, transition rules are applied simultaneously to each cell. The transition any particular cell undergoes will depend on its state and on the states of its neighbors. Von Neumann was able to prove that a configuration of about 200,000 cells, each with 29 different possible states and each placed in a neighborhood of 4 orthogonally adjacent squares, could meet all the requirements of a self-reproducing automaton. The large number of elements was necessary because von Neumann's model was also designed to simulate a Turing machine. Von Neumann's machine can, theoretically, perform any mathematical operation.</font></p>
      

      <p>1950 年，当所有人都意识到计算机技术的工程阶段正在完成令人印象深刻的任务时，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">冯·诺依曼假设了一个这样的系统，即一个工厂，其中包含机器和详细的蓝图，用于利用提供给它的原材料建造相同的工厂（和相同的蓝图）。</font>如果再复杂一点，细节可以包括子系统的规范，这些子系统可以从环境中为工厂寻找原材料，而无需人工干预。</p><p>In 1950, when it was evident to all that the engineering phase of computer technology was accomplishing impressive tasks, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">von Neumann postulated one such system in terms of a factory that contains within it the machinery and the detailed blueprints for making identical factories (and identical blueprints) from raw materials provided to it.</font> Take that a step up in complexity, and the details can include a specification for subsystems that find raw materials for the factory from the environment, with no human intervention.</p>

      <p>如果人们幻想在复杂性范围上更进一步，指令和能力可以指定能够建造宇宙飞船的工厂，以便向其他星球发送更多的宇宙飞船，在那里找到的原材料将被塑造成更多的工厂-宇宙飞船-发射台系统，如果你可以建造可以建造<i>两个</i>或更多此类综合体的工厂，你就可以对宇宙普遍无序的趋势形成反作用力，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">以（无意识的？）工厂建造工厂的形式，像一群反熵的逻辑蝗虫一样在星系中向外咀嚼。</font></p><p>If one fantasizes one step farther on the complexity spectrum, the instructions and capabilities could specify factories capable of building spaceships to send more spaceships to other planets, where the raw materials found would be shaped into more factory-spaceship-launchpad systems, and if you could build factories that could build <i>two</i> or more such complexes, you could have a counterforce to the generally disorderly trend of the cosmos, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">in the form of a (mindless?) horde of factory-building factories, munching outward through the galaxies like an anti-entropic swarm of logical locusts.</font></p>

      <p>虽然这听起来确实像是一个科幻故事，而且许多人会补充说它可以被解读为一种非人性的冷酷，甚至可以说是“恶魔般的”，但这种场景却是自动机领域的合法话题，并且仍然被称为“冯·诺依曼机”（与他为数字计算机创建的逻辑架构“冯·诺依曼机”不同）。</p><p>While it definitely sounds like a science-fiction story, and many would add that it could be interpreted to be an idea of such inhuman coldness as to be termed "fiendish" such scenarios are legitimate topics in the field of automata, and are still known as "von Neumann machines" (as distinguished from "the von Neumann machine," the logical architecture he created for digital computers).</p>

      <p>冯·诺依曼于 1957 年去世，未能在自动机领域取得突破。和艾达一样，他死于癌症，据说和艾达一样，他也遭受了巨大的痛苦，既因为智力的丧失，也因为疼痛。但他身后的世界被他在未能解决最后一个也许是最有趣的问题之前所取得的成就有力地重塑了。</p><p>Von Neumann died in 1957, before he could achieve a breakthrough in the field of automata. Like Ada, he died of cancer, and like Ada, he was said to have suffered terribly, as much from the loss of his intellectual facilities as from pain. But the world he left behind him was powerfully rearranged by what he had accomplished before he failed to solve his last, perhaps most interesting problem.</p>

      <p>诺伯特的父亲是哈佛大学的教授，他本身就是一个多姿多彩的人物，对教育有着明确的看法，并公开宣布他打算塑造他年幼的儿子的思想。诺伯特将成为一个充满爱心但又系统地设计的天才。1911 年，一家全国性杂志上的一篇文章报道了这些计划：</p><p>Norbert's father, a Harvard professor who was a colorful character in his own right, had definite opinions about education, and publicly declared his intention to mold his young son's mind. Norbert was to become a lovingly but systematically engineered genius. In 1911, an article in a national magazine reported these plans:</p>

      
        <p><font size="-1">哈佛大学的利奥·维纳教授……认为，智力早熟的秘诀在于早期训练……他是四个孩子的父亲，年龄从四岁到十六岁不等；他有勇气将他们作为教育实验的对象。实验结果……令人震惊，尤其是他的大儿子诺伯特。</font></p><p><font size="-1">Professor Leo Wiener of Harvard University . . . believes that the secret of precocious mental development lies in early training . . .

      <p>诺伯特十八岁时完成了数学逻辑的考试和博士论文，随后在剑桥大学<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Russell.html">师从伯特兰·罗素，在哥廷根</a><a href="http://loki.sonoma.edu/Math/faculty/falbo/hilbert.html">大学师从戴维·希尔伯特</a>。后来，他结识了比他小九岁的冯·诺依曼，他也是希尔伯特的学生，也是维纳感兴趣的多个领域的世界知名权威。这两位天才之间最直接的差异之一，即使在他们职业生涯的早期，也是他们性格的鲜明对比。</p><p>Norbert completed his examinations and his doctoral dissertation in mathematical logic when he was eighteen, then studied with <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Russell.html">Bertrand Russell</a> in Cambridge and <a href="http://loki.sonoma.edu/Math/faculty/falbo/hilbert.html">David Hilbert</a> in G�ttingen, where he later crossed paths with von Neumann, nine years his junior, also a student of Hilbert's, and a world renowned authority in several of Wiener's fields of interest. One of the most immediate differences between the two prodigies, even this early in their careers, was the pronounced contrast between their personalities.</p>

      <p>很少有老师或学生不被冯·诺依曼所吸引，他竭尽全力向人类同胞保证，他和其他人一样是凡人。维纳缺乏安全感，远不世故，有时虚荣，而且经常过于敏感，他根本没有费心在数学领域之外留下印象，在数学领域，他自信得近乎傲慢。伯特兰·罗素在给朋友的信中这样评价维纳：</p><p>Rare was the teacher or student who failed to be charmed by von Neumann, who went out of his way to assure fellow humans that he was just as mortal as everyone else. Wiener, an insecure, far less worldly, sometimes vain, and often hypersensitive personality, simply didn't go to as much trouble to make an impression outside the realm of mathematics, where he was confident to the point of arrogance. Bertrand Russell wrote of Wiener, in a letter to a friend:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">九月底，一位名叫维纳的神童，哈佛大学博士，18岁，和他的父亲一起来到美国，他的父亲在那里教斯拉夫语，他来美国是为了建立一个素食共产主义殖民地，他放弃了务农的初衷，转而从事各种学科的教学。……这个年轻人被奉承了，认为自己是全能的上帝——我和他之间永远都在争夺谁来教书。</font>
      

      <p>和巴贝奇一样，维纳也因与人争吵而闻名。在哥廷根大学读书时，维纳给大学行政主管理查德·库朗留下了深刻印象，但维纳指责他盗用了这位年轻人的几个数学思想，并在其中加上了库朗自己的名字。回到剑桥后，这位愤怒的年轻天才将精力转向了一部从未出版的小说，小说讲述了一个与库朗有着惊人相似之处的人，他被描绘成一个窃取年轻天才思想的人。</p><p>Like Babbage, Wiener was famous for the feuds he carried on. While a student at G�ttingen, he impressed the administrative head of the university, Richard Courant, but Wiener accused him of misappropriating several of the younger man's mathematical ideas and appending Courant's own name to them. When he returned to Cambridge, the outraged young genius turned his energies to a novel that was never published, about someone who bore a remarkable resemblance to Courant, and who was depicted as a man who stole the ideas of young geniuses.</p>

      <p><i>第一次世界大战前，维纳为《美国百科全书》</i>撰写文章，在哈佛大学教授哲学，在缅因大学教授数学。第一次世界大战期间，维纳被派往马里兰州美国陆军阿伯丁试验场，他是负责计算射击表的数学家之一。他在 1918 年服役，这也是维纳的朋友万尼瓦尔·布什 (Vannevar Bush) 30 年后自然而然地想到诺伯特的原因之一，当时盟军需要一种方法将射击表直接放入高射炮的雷达制导装置中。</p><p>Before World War I, Wiener wrote pieces for <i>Encyclopedia Americana</i>, taught philosophy at Harvard and mathematics at the University of Maine. During World War I, Private Wiener was assigned to the U.S. Army's Aberdeen proving Grounds in Maryland, where he was one of the mathematicians responsible for the computation of firing tables. His service in 1918 was one of the reasons it was natural for Wiener's friend Vannevar Bush to think of Norbert thirty years later, when the allies needed a way to put firing tables directly into the radar-guided mechanism of antiaircraft guns.</p>

      <p>第一次世界大战结束后，诺伯特·维纳加入麻省理工学院担任数学讲师。这成为他与该机构终身联系的开始。到 20 世纪 20 年代初，像大西洋彼岸的博学者一样，维纳在数学、逻辑和理论物理方面发表了世界级的论文。在麻省理工学院，维纳与万<a href="#OEBPS/Text/9.html">尼瓦尔·布什</a>开始了长期的友谊，万尼瓦尔·布什在 20 世纪 30 年代初深入研究机械计算器的制造问题，并在 20 世纪 40 年代负责历史上规模最大的应用科学管理。</p><p>After the end of World War I, Norbert Wiener joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an instructor of mathematics. It turned out to be the beginning of his lifelong association with that institution. By the early 1920s, like his fellow polymath across the Atlantic, Wiener was turning out world-class papers in mathematics, logic, and theoretical physics. At MIT Wiener began his long friendship with <a href="#OEBPS/Text/9.html">Vannevar Bush</a>, a man who in the early 1930s was deeply involved in the problems of building mechanical calculators, and in the 1940s took charge of the largest-scale administration of applied science in history.</p>

      <p>几十年后，维纳与他的终生好友发生了争执，因为布什在维纳与另外两位同事的争执中没有坚定地站在他这一边。这种争执是维纳风格中最为人熟知的特征之一——他倾向于将科学问题上的分歧视为人身攻击，即使这些争论涉及他最亲密的私人朋友。和巴贝奇一样，他的判断力似乎并不总是与他的想象力相称。</p><p>Decades later, Wiener quarreled with his lifelong friend because Bush didn't side strongly enough with Wiener in his feud with two other colleagues. Such feuds were one of the more well-known characteristics of Wiener's style -- he tended to take disagreements over scientific issues as personal attacks, even if the disputes involved his closest personal friends. Like Babbage, his judgement did not always seem equal to his imagination.</p>

      <p>必须说，维纳确实拥有许多终生温暖的友谊，这些友谊并没有变质。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">尽管维纳喜怒无常、偏执多疑，但他真正关心的是“人类对人类的利用”</font>（这是他后来的一本关于控制论影响的书的标题），并热情地提醒科学界他们对他们创造的末日武器负有特殊责任。尽管<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">维纳与一些同事相处不融洽，但他从未动摇过他的信念，即科学事业的未来在于跨学科合作。</font>他与生理学家阿图罗·罗森布鲁斯的友谊，以及他们共同的激发这种跨学科追求的梦想，催化了控制论的起源。但如果不是因为不列颠之战，维纳可能永远不会与罗森布鲁斯合作。</p><p>It must be said that Wiener did have many warm lifelong friendships that didn't go sour. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">For all his moodiness and paranoia, Wiener truly cared about "the human use of human beings"</font> (as he was to title one of his later books on the implications of cybernetics), and passionately reminded the scientific community of their special responsibilities regarding the apocalyptic weaponry they had created. Despite his failure to get along with some of his colleagues, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Wiener never wavered in his belief that the future of scientific enterprise lay in interdisciplinary cooperation.</font> His friendship with the physiologist Arturo Rosenbluth, and their shared dream of stimulating such interdisciplinary pursuits, catalyzed the origins of cybernetics. But Wiener might never have worked with Rosenblueth if it wasn't for the Battle of Britain.</p>

      <p>和冯·诺依曼一样，维纳最重要的需求是寻找有趣的问题。和冯·诺依曼一样，他知道量子革命是 20 世纪 20 年代最有趣的问题。<a href="http://www.links.net/vita/swat/course/reality/quantum.html">量子物理</a>对这位年轻数学家思维的影响之一是让他相信，纯理论数学中一些最有趣的问题最终可能会在现实世界中得到最具体的应用。</p><p>Like von Neumann, Wiener's most important need was for interesting problems. Like von Neumann, he knew that the quantum revolution was the most interesting problem of the 1920s. And one of the effects of <a href="http://www.links.net/vita/swat/course/reality/quantum.html">quantum physics</a> on the young mathematician's thinking was to convince him that some of the most interesting problems of purely theoretical mathematics could end up having the most concrete applications in the real world.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>量子物理学的另一个影响是概率</i></font><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">和统计测量对于处理基于不确定信息的现象的重要性。维纳对这些概念的熟悉是在意想不到的情况下逐渐成熟的。与冯·诺依曼、戈德斯坦和埃克特一样，在 20 世纪 30 年代末，维纳还没有意识到弹道学将成为将他的概率和统计知识应用于最实际问题的途径，最终产生最惊人的结果。但是，像他们一样，他很快就会明白，他的战争相关任务正在产生远远超出弹道学范围的深远科学后果。</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Another effect of quantum physics was the importance of <i>probability</i></font> and statistical measures for dealing with phemomena based on uncertain information. Wiener's familiarity with these concepts was to mature under unexpected circumstances. Like von Neumann and Goldstine and Eckert, in the late 1930s Wiener wasn't yet aware that ballistics would be the avenue for bringing his knowledge of probability and statistics to bear on the most pragmatic problems, eventually to yield most astonishing results. But, like them, he would soon come to understand that his war-related task was leading to profound scientific consequences far beyond the bounds of ballistics.</p>

      <p>维纳的惊人成果之所以能问世，并非因为一系列科学事件，而是因为 20 世纪 40 年代早期的政治环境。欧洲爆发战争后，布什指派维纳负责麻省理工学院的防空控制项目，由著名数学家沃伦·韦弗负责指导。考虑到维纳在第一次世界大战期间在阿伯丁进行早期弹道计算的经验，这似乎是他自然而然的举动。</p><p>The scene was set for the emergence of Wiener's astounding results, not by any series of scientific events, but by the political circumstances of the early 1940s. When war broke out in Europe, Bush assigned Wiener to the antiaircraft control project at MIT, under the direction of Warren Weaver, himself a distinguished mathematician. It seemed like a natural step for Wiener, considering his prior experience in the early ballistic calculation efforts at Aberdeen during World War I.</p>

      <p>20 世纪 30 年代末，计算机诞生的关键思想开始流行，尽管当时还处于元数学和其他深奥学科的稀薄空气中。战争的必要性和随之而来的协调科学努力，使这些关键思想与少数有能力理解它们的人联系在一起，这种联系比在正常时期可能更快、更紧迫。</p><p>The key ideas that led to computers were in the air in the late 1930s, albeit in the rather rarefied air of metamathematics and other esoteric intellectual disciplines. The necessities of war and the coordinated scientific effort that they entailed served to bring those key ideas together with the few people who were equipped to understand them more quickly and urgently than might have happened in more normal times.</p>

      <p>冯·诺依曼和戈德斯坦在阿伯丁的偶然相遇是偶然的，也是不太可能的，但很难称之为不可思议。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">然而，让维纳与高射炮问题联系在一起的情况之一却非常奇怪。不列颠之战的技术转折点，以及机器和生物体通信系统科学的关键篇章，源于美国贝尔实验室的一名年轻员工做了一个奇怪的梦。</font>这个关键的梦不是关于与计算机有关的数学或工程问题，而是与高射炮的技术问题有关。而如何对付俯冲轰炸机的问题是一个相当紧迫的问题，尽管是间接的问题，它导致了维纳后来的洞见。</p><p>Von Neumann and Goldstine's accidental meeting at Aberdeen was fortuitous and unlikely, but it could hardly be called incredible. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">One of the circumstances that brought Wiener together with the problem of antiaircraft guns, however, was downright weird. The technological turning point of the Battle of Britain, and a critical chapter in the science of communications systems in machines and organisms, originated when a young Bell Laboratories employee in America had an odd dream.</font> The crucial dream was not about mathematics or engineering problems connected with computers, but was related to technical issues involving antiaircraft artillery. And it was the question of how to deal with dive bombers that was the rather urgent if indirect problem that led to Wiener's later insights.</p>

      <p>军事战略与科学理论之间的路径过于曲折、巧合，而且不太可能事先预测到，只有在事后回顾时才变得清晰可见。从许多方面来看，控制论的诞生更像是小说而不是科学期刊中的故事。历史巧合之一是万尼瓦尔·布什 (Vannevar Bush) 担任战争相关研究的领导者。作为一名研究管理人员，布什知道防空技术是他的首要任务之一。作为一名科学家、麻省理工学院的研究员和诺伯特·维纳 (Norbert Wiener) 的朋友，布什还关心制造高速机械计算器的任务。</p><p>The pathway between military strategy and scientific theory was far too circuitous, coincidental, and unlikely to have been predicted in advance, and became clearly discernible only in retrospect. In many respects, the birth of cybernetics was the kind of story more likely to be found in a novel than in a scientific journal. One of the historical coincidences was the position of Vannevar Bush as the leader of war-related research. In his role as a research administrator, Bush knew that antiaircraft technology was one of his top priorities. As a scientist, MIT researcher, and friend of Norbert Wiener's, Bush was also concerned with the task of building high-speed mechanical calculators.</p>

      <p>第二次世界大战初期，盟军面临的两个最紧迫问题是北大西洋的毁灭性 U 型潜艇战和同样毁灭性的德国空军对英国的袭击。图灵对海军恩尼格玛密码机的秘密解决方案在很大程度上解决了 U 型潜艇问题。但是，图灵的问题是一个密码分析问题，即从乱码信息中数学检索含义，而德国空军的问题则是预测未来：你如何向速度与子弹一样快的飞机射击？</p><p>The allies' two most pressing problems in the early years of World War II were the devastating U-boat war in the North Atlantic and the equally devastating Luftwaffe attacks on Britain. Turing's secret solution to the naval Enigma machine was responsible, in large part, for solving the U-boat problem. But where Turing's problem was one of cryptanalysis, of mathematically retrieving the meaning from a garbled message, the Luftwaffe problem was one of predicting the future: How can you shoot at a plane that is going as fast as your bullets?</p>

      <p>雷达使跟踪敌机位置成为可能，但无法快速将雷达提供的信息转化为弹道方程，无法发挥作用。而且，攻击飞机有一种令人不安的规避行为。当贝尔实验室向万尼瓦尔·布什提出一个有趣的电动瞄准装置想法时，他非常熟悉计算问题。这位年轻工程师的梦想就此实现。</p><p>Radar made it possible to track the positions of enemy aircraft, but there was no way to translate the radar-provided information into a ballistic equation quickly enough to do any good. And attacking airplanes had a disconcerting habit of taking evasive action. Vannevar Bush was well acquainted with the calculation problem when Bell Laboratories came to him with an interesting idea for an electrically operated aiming device. That is where the young engineer's dream came in.</p>

      <p>他的名字是 DB Parkinson，他当时正与一组贝尔工程师合作，研究一种自动电平记录器，以便更准确地测量电话传输——他们称之为“控制电位计”。1940 年春天，帕金森做了以下梦：</p><p>His name was D. B. Parkinson, and he was working with a group of Bell engineers on an automatic level recorder for making more accurate measurements of telephone transmissions -- a "control potentiometer," they called it. In the spring of 1940, Parkinson had the following dream:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">我发现自己身处一个炮坑或炮台，身边有一支高射炮组……那里有一门炮，在我看来——我从未与高射炮有过密切接触，但掌握了一些关于火炮的一般知识——像是 3 英寸的炮。它偶尔会开火，令人印象深刻的是，<i>每一发炮弹都能击落一架飞机！</i>三四发炮弹之后，一名机组人员对我微笑，示意我靠近炮。当我走近时，他指着左耳轴的裸露端。那里安装的是我的液位记录仪的控制电位计！没有弄错——它是一模一样的东西。</font>
      

      <p>碰巧的是，这种电子装置是自动瞄准装置的良好开端。但当他们试图构建这种装置时，出现了与控制装置发送和接收指令的方式有关的非常严重的理论和数学问题。这时，布什向韦弗和维纳求助。</p><p>The electrical device, as it happened, was a good start on an automatic aiming mechanism. But very serious theoretical and mathematical problems, having to do with the way the control device sent and received instructions, cropped up when they tried to construct such a mechanism. That is when Bush turned to Weaver and Wiener.</p>

      <p>在战争期间，维纳从事与雷达引导防空火力有关的数学工作，他认识到了两个基本问题——通信和控制之间的根本关系。雷达早期的通信问题是，雷达设备就像一个调谐不良的无线电接收器。攻击飞机的真实信号经常被来自其他来源的虚假信号——噪音——淹没。维纳认识到，如果将敌机的位置视为必须以某种方式从周围噪音中解码的信息，那么这也是一种密码学问题。</p><p>During this wartime mathematical work related to radar-directed antiaircraft fire, Wiener recognized the fundamental relationship between two basic problems -- communication and control. The communication problem in the earliest days of radar was that the radar apparatus was like a badly tuned radio receiver. The true signal of attacking planes was often drowned out by false signals -- noise -- from other sources. Wiener recognized that this too was a kind of cryptography problem, if the location of the enemy aircraft is seen as a message that must somehow be decoded from the surrounding noise.</p>

      <p>噪声雷达不仅仅是一个普通的“有趣问题”，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">因为一旦你从有序和信息的角度理解信息和噪声，并用无序和不确定性来衡量，并应用统计数据来预测未来的信息，就会清楚地发现（对于像维纳这样的数学家来说）这个问题与宇宙中有序和无序的基本过程有关。</font>一旦从统计和数学的角度来看待这个问题，通信问题就会引出更重要的东西的核心，即信息理论。但这个故事的这个分支与<a href="#OEBPS/Text/6.html">克劳德·香农</a>的关系不亚于维纳，甚至比维纳的关系还要深。</p><p>The noisy radar was more than an ordinary "interesting problem," <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">because once you understand messages and noise in terms of order and information measured against disorder and uncertainty, and apply statistics to predict future messages, it becomes clear (to a mathematician of Wiener's stature) that the issue is related to the basic processes of order and disorder in the universe.</font> Once it is seen in statistical and mathematical terms, the communication problem leads to the heart of something more important, called information theory. But that branch of the story belongs to <a href="#OEBPS/Text/6.html">Claude Shannon</a> as much as, or more than, it does to Wiener.</p>

      <p>控制问题正是维纳和他年轻而又才华横溢的助手——一位名叫朱利安·比奇洛的工程师——偶然发现反馈回路普遍重要性的地方。假设可以将飞机的航线信息输入枪的瞄准装置，那么该如何利用这些信息预测飞机的可能位置呢？使用统计学和概率论是一个线索。根据消息开头的信息预测消息结尾的方法是另一个线索。帕金森梦中的设备也是另一个线索。</p><p>The control problem was where Wiener, and his very young and appropriately brilliant assistant, an engineer by the name of Julian Bigelow, happened upon the general importance of feedback loops. Assuming that it is possible to feed information about a plane's path into the aiming apparatus of a gun, how can that information be used to predict the probable location of the plane? The use of statistics and probability theory was one clue. A method for predicting the end of a message based on information about the beginning was another clue. The device in Parkinson's dream was another clue.</p>

      <p>维纳和毕格罗突然想到，人类有机体已经解决了他们面临的问题。人类，或者说黑猩猩，如何能够伸出手拿起铅笔？人们如何能够将一只脚放在另一只脚前面，面朝前跌倒一小段距离，最后迈出一步？这两个过程都涉及肌肉的连续、精确调整（移动枪支的伺服机构），由连续的视觉信息（雷达）引导，由连续的预测轨迹过程控制。预测和控制发生在神经系统（动画自动机的控制电路）中。</p><p>Then it occurred to Wiener and Bigelow that the human organism had already solved the problem they were facing. How is any human being, or a chimpanzee for that matter, able to reach out a hand and pick up a pencil? How are people able to put one foot in front of the other, fall face-forward for a short distance, and end up taking a step? Both processes involve continuous, precise readjustments of muscles (the servomechanisms that move the gun), guided by continuous visual information (radar), controlled by a continuous process of predicting trajectories. The prediction and control take place in the nervous system (the control circuits of the animating automata).</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">维纳和比奇洛更仔细地研究了其他伺服机构，包括像恒温器一样简单的自动驾驶机构，并得出结论，<i>反馈</i>是连接大脑、自动火炮、蒸汽机、自动驾驶仪和恒温器执行其功能的方式的概念。在每个系统中，过去输出的一小部分作为当前输入反馈到中央处理器，以控制未来的输出。</font>眼睛看到的从手到铅笔的距离信息被反馈到控制手的肌肉。同样，枪的位置和雷达感应到的目标位置也被反馈到自动瞄准装置。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Wiener and Bigelow looked more closely at other servomechanisms, including self-steering mechanisms as simple as thermostats, and concluded that <i>feedback</i> is the concept that connects the way brains, automatic artillery, steam engines, autopilots, and thermostats perform their functions. In each of those systems, some small part of the past output is fed back to the central processor as present input, in order to steer future output.</font> Information about the distance from the hand to the pencil, as seen by the eye, is fed back to the muscles controlling the hand. Similarly, the position of the gun and the position of the target as sensed by radar are fed back to the automatic aiming device.</p>

      <p>麻省理工学院的研究小组曾想知道，是否有更了解神经生理学的人遇到过类似的数学推笔方法，并得出了类似的结果。结果碰巧的是，还有另一个团队，像维纳和比奇洛一样，由一个神童和一个稍年长的天才组成，分别名叫皮茨和麦卡洛克，他们从另一个方向走上了完全相同的道路。在战争的压力下，一种既被迫又偶然的思想汇聚正在发生，这种思想汇聚与数字计算的汇聚有关，但又截然不同。</p><p>The MIT team had wondered whether someone more informed about neurophysiology had come across analogous mathematics of pencil pushing, with similar results. As it happened, there was another team that, like Wiener and Bigelow, was made up of one infant prodigy and one slightly older genius, by the names of Pitts and McCulloch respectively, who were coming down exactly the same trail from the other direction. A convergence of ideas that was both forced and fortuitous, related to but distinctly different from the convergence on digital computation, was taking place under the pressure of war.</p>

      <p>甚至连冯·诺依曼也打算加入进来，正如维纳希望的那样——维纳说服麻省理工学院在战后试图以高于普林斯顿的价格吸引冯·诺依曼的注意力。从政治、军事和科学<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">角度来看，维纳的参与度越来越高。防空问题、脑细胞如何工作的可能解释、数字计算机的构造、从噪音中解码信息——所有这些看似不相关的问题在战争将主要人物聚集在一起时交织在一起。</font></p><p>Even von Neumann was due to get into the act, as Wiener wanted him to do -- Wiener persuaded MIT to try to outbid Princeton for von Neumann's attentions after the war. Politically, militarily, and scientifically, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Wiener's corner of the plot was getting thick. The antiaircraft problem, the possible explanations for how brain cells work, the construction of digital computers, the decoding of messages from noise -- all these seemingly unrelated problems were woven together when the leading characters were brought together by the war.</font></p>

      <p><i>这门后来被称为控制论</i>的跨学科研究的创立源于维纳和比奇洛想知道人体中是否有任何过程与伺服机构过度反馈问题相对应。他们向墨西哥城国立心脏病研究所的生理学权威求助。阿图罗·罗森布鲁斯博士回答说，确实存在一种病理状况，它被有意义地命名为目的性<i>震颤</i>，与小脑（大脑中与平衡和肌肉协调有关的部分）损伤有关。</p><p>The founding of the interdisciplinary study that was later named <i>cybernetics</i> came about when Wiener and Bigelow wondered whether any processes in the human body corresponded to the problem of excessive feedback in servomechanisms. They appealed to an authority on physiology, from the Instituto Nacional de Cardolog�a in Mexico City. Dr. Arturo Rosenblueth replied that there was exactly such a pathological condition named (meaningfully) the <i>purpose tremor</i>, associated with injuries to the cerebellum (a part of the brain involved with balance and muscular coordination).</p>

      <p>数学家、神经生理学家和工程师共同设计出了一种新的神经系统过程模型，他们认为该模型将展示目的如何体现在机械装置中——无论该机械装置是由金属还是肉体制成。维纳从不吝惜吹嘘自己的胜利，后来他指出，这一概念“大大超越了神经生理学家的潮流”。</p><p>Together the mathematician, the neurophysiologist, and the engineer plotted out a new model of the nervous system processes that they believed would demonstrate how purpose is embodied in the mechanism -- whether that mechanism is made of metal or flesh. Wiener, never reluctant to trumpet his own victories, later noted that this conception "considerably transcended that current among neurophysiologists."</p>

      <p>维纳、比奇洛和罗森布鲁斯的模型虽然间接源自绝密的战争工作，但却具有如此普遍和深远的影响，以至于它于 1943 年以“行为、目的和技术”为题发表在通常沉稳的《<i>科学哲学》</i>杂志上。然而，该模型最初是在 1942 年在纽约举行的一次私人会议上向一小群专家讨论的，该会议由约西亚·梅西基金会赞助。在那次会议上，神经生理学家沃伦·麦卡洛克曾与他们就神经网络的数学特征进行过交流。</p><p>Wiener, Bigelow, and Rosenblueth's model, although indirectly derived from top-secret war work, had such general and far-reaching implications that it was published under the title "Behavior, Purpose and Technology," in 1943, in the normally staid journal <i>Philosophy of Science</i>. The model was first discussed for a small audience of specialists, however, at a private meeting held in New York in 1942, under the auspices of the Josiah Macy Foundation. At that meeting was Warren McCulloch, a neurophysiologist who had been corresponding with them about the mathematical characteristics of nerve networks.</p>

      <p>麦卡洛克是伊利诺伊大学的神经生理学家，他自然而然地属于这个圈子，因为他天赋异禀、才华横溢，数学功底深厚。麦卡洛克讲过一个关于自己的故事，可以追溯到他在哈弗福德学院（一所贵格会学校）读书的时候。一位老师问他，他显然前途光明，想做什么：</p><p>McCulloch, a neurophysiologist based at the University of Illinois, was, naturally enough in this company, an abnormally gifted and colorful person who had a firm background in mathematics. One story that McCulloch told about himself goes back to his student days at Haverford College, a Quaker institution. A teacher asked him what he wanted to do with his obviously brilliant future:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">“沃伦，”他说，“你要做什么？”我说：“我不知道。”“你要做什么？”我又说：“我不知道，但有一个问题我想回答：什么是人类可以知道的数字，什么是人类可以知道的数字？”他笑着说：“朋友，只要你活着，你就会很忙。”</font>
      <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">因此，麦卡洛克作为数学家，强烈希望找到一种工具，将神经生理学的模糊观察和理论不确定性简化为数学的精确度。</font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">图灵、他之前的伯特兰·罗素和更早的布尔都在追求类似的东西，但他们都缺乏对大脑生理学的深刻理解。麦卡洛克的目标是找到大脑的一个基本功能单元，由某种神经细胞组合组成，并发现该基本单元是如何构建成一个更复杂的系统的。他一直在试验“神经网络”模型，并发现这些网络具有某些数学和逻辑特性。

      </font></font><p>麦卡洛克开始与一位名叫沃尔特·皮茨的年轻逻辑学家合作。人工智能研究历史学家帕梅拉·麦考达克将皮茨进入控制论领域的故事归功于麦卡洛克的学生、现任加州大学教授的曼努埃尔·布鲁姆。15 岁时，沃尔特·皮茨离家出走，因为他的父亲希望他辍学找份工作。他来到芝加哥，遇到了一位对逻辑略知一二的人。这位名叫“伯特”的人建议皮茨读一本逻辑学家卡尔纳普的书，当时卡尔纳普正在芝加哥任教。结果发现，伯特就是伯特兰·罗素，皮茨向卡尔纳普介绍了自己，以指出这位伟大的逻辑学家在书中犯的一个错误。</p><p>McCulloch started to work with a young logician by the name of Walter Pitts. Pamela McCorduck, a historian of artificial intelligence research, attributes to Manuel Blum, a student of McCulloch's and now a professor at the University of California, the story of Pitt's arrival on the cybernetic scene. At the age of fifteen, Walter Pitts ran away from home when his father wanted him to quit school and get a job. He arrived in Chicago, and met a man who knew a little about logic. This man, "Bert" by name, suggested that Pitts read a book by the logician Carnap, who was then teaching in Chicago. Bert turned out to be Bertrand Russell, and Pitts introduced himself to Carnap in order to point out a mistake the great logician had made in his book.</p>

      <p>皮茨师从卡尔纳普，最终与麦卡洛克取得联系。麦卡洛克对就神经生理学研究向逻辑学家咨询很感兴趣。皮茨帮助麦卡洛克理解了某些类型的网络（可能是神经系统和电子设备重要组成部分的电路类型）如何体现被称为图灵机的逻辑设备。</p><p>Pitts studied with Carnap, and eventually came into contact with McCulloch, who was interested in consulting with logicians in regard to his neurophysiological research. Pitts helped McCulloch understand how certain kinds of networks -- the kinds of circuits that might be important parts of nervous systems as well as electrical devices -- could embody the logical devices known as Turing machines.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">麦卡洛克和皮茨发展了一种理论，将神经视为全或无、开或关的开关式装置，并将网络视为可以用数学和逻辑描述的电路。</font>他们的论文《神经活动中内在思想的逻辑演算》于 1943 年发表，当时皮茨只有 18 岁。他们觉得自己只是开始了一项研究，最终将解决大脑生理学如何与知识联系在一起的问题。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">McCulloch and Pitts developed a theory that regarded nerves as all-or-none, on-or-off, switchlike devices, and treated the networks as circuits that could be described mathematically and logically.</font> Their paper, "A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity," was published in 1943 when Pitts was still only eighteen years old. They felt that they were only beginning a line of work that would eventually address the questions of how brain physiology is linked to knowledge.</p>

      <p>1943 年和 1944 年，当维纳、比奇洛和罗森布鲁斯与麦卡洛克和皮茨聚在一起时，思想的临界点已经形成。皮茨在麻省理工学院与维纳一起，战后在高等研究院与冯·诺依曼一起工作。当这种跨学科的相互影响开始时，ENIAC 项目已经取得了足够的进展，数字计算机可以加入到思想的大结合中。</p><p>When Wiener, Bigelow, and Rosenblueth got together with McCulloch and Pitts, in 1943 and 1944, a critical mass of ideas was reached. Pitts joined Wiener at MIT, then worked with von Neumann at the Institute for Advanced Study after the war. By the time this interdisciplinary cross-fertilization was beginning, the ENIAC project had progressed far enough for digital computers to join the grand conjunction of ideas.</p>

      <p>1944 年举行了一系列会议，涉及各种跨学科主题，这些主题似乎来自逻辑、统计学、通信工程和神经生理学等各个领域。与会者同样是各行各业的思想家。正是在其中一次会议上，冯·诺依曼结识了戈德斯坦，不久之后，他们在阿伯丁火车站再次相遇。罗森布鲁斯不得不在 1944 年启程前往墨西哥城，但到了 12 月，维纳、比奇洛、冯·诺依曼、哈佛-海军-IBM Mark I 计算器项目的霍华德·艾肯、戈德斯坦、麦卡洛克和皮茨成立了一个协会，他们称之为<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">“目的论学会”，</font>目的是讨论“通信工程、控制设备工程、统计中的时间序列数学以及神经系统的通信和控制方面”。一句话——控制论。</p><p>A series of meetings occurred in 1944, involving an interdisciplinary blend of topics that seemed to be coming from subject areas as far afield as logic, statistics, communication engineering, and neurophysiology. The participants were an equally eclectic assortment of thinkers. It was at one of these meetings that von Neumann made the acquaintance of Goldstine, whom he was to encounter again not long afterward, at the Aberdeen railroad station. Rosenblueth had to depart for Mexico City in 1944, but by December, Wiener, Bigelow, von Neumann, Howard Aiken of the Harvard-Navy-IBM Mark I calculator project, Goldstine, McCulloch and Pitts formed an association they called <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"The Teleological Society,"</font> for the purpose of discussing "communication engineering, the engineering of control devices, the mathematics of time series in statistics, and the communication and control aspects of the nervous system." In a word -- cybernetics.</p>

      <p>1945 年和 1946 年，在目的论学会会议和私人通信中，维纳和冯·诺依曼争论了过于信任神经生理学的合理性。冯·诺依曼认为，麦卡洛克和皮茨所掌握的工具让脑生理学家处于一种隐喻的境地，他们试图通过拼凑计算机并研究残骸来破译计算机电路，</p><p>In 1945 and 1946, at the teleological society meetings, and in personal correspondence, Wiener and von Neumann argued about the advisability of placing too much trust in neurophysiology. Von Neumann thought that the kinds of tools available to McCulloch and Pitts put brain physiologists in the metaphorical position of trying to decipher computer circuits by bashing computers together and studying the wreckage,</p>

      <p>对于冯·诺依曼来说，噬菌体（一种可以自我繁殖的非生命微生物）是一个更有前途的研究对象。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他认为，通过观察微生物，可以比研究大脑更多地了解自然密码。</font>大脑生理学的奥秘和生物繁殖的秘密之间的联系后来从涉及信息性质的理论中更加清晰地显现出来，事实证明冯·诺依曼是对的——生物学家在理解生物繁殖编码方面取得的进展比神经科学家在破解大脑功能方面取得的进展更快。</p><p>To von Neumann, the bacteriophage -- a nonliving microorganism that can reproduce itself -- was a much more promising object of study. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">He felt that much more could be learned about nature's codes by looking at microorganisms than by studying brains.</font> The connection between the mysteries of brain physiology and the secrets of biological reproduction were later to emerge more clearly from theories involving the nature of information, and von Neumann turned out to be right -- biologists were to make faster progress in understanding the coding of biological reproduction than neuroscientists were to make in their quest to decode the brain's functions.</p>

      <p>梅西基金会曾赞助促成目的论学会成立的会议，现在继续赞助自由会议。冯·诺依曼和维纳是会议中引人注目的联合主演，他们个人风格的差异成为控制论形成时期激烈而激烈的辩论的一部分。传记作者史蒂夫·海姆斯在他关于约翰·冯·诺依曼<i>和诺伯特·维纳</i>两人的书中指出，他们在这些活动中表现出了截然不同的个性：</p><p>The Macy Foundation, which had sponsored the meetings that led to the creation of the Teleological Society, continued to sponsor free-wheeling meetings. Von Neumann and Wiener were the dramatic co-stars of the meetings, and the differences in their personal style became part of the excited and dramatic debates that characterized the formative years of cybernetics. Biographer Steve Heims, in his book about the two men -- <i>John von Neumann and Norbert Wiener --</i> noted the way their contrasting personae emerged at these events:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">在有关机器-有机体相似性的半年一度的会议上，维纳和冯·诺依曼的形象截然不同，他们各自都有自己的崇拜者圈子。冯·诺依曼身材矮小、体态丰满，额头宽大，脸型呈椭圆形，他的英语优美而清晰，略带中欧口音，而且他总是衣着讲究；通常穿着背心，外套扣得严严实实，口袋里放着手帕，更像是银行家而不是学者。他给人的印象是温文尔雅、国际化、诙谐、低调、友好和平易近人。他说话很快，梅西会议上的许多人常常无法理解他那谨慎、精确、快速的推理……</font>

        <p><font size="-1">维纳是该系列会议的主导人物，他既是思想的杰出创始人，又是顽童。如果没有他的科学思想和对科学思想的热情，该系列会议就永远不会出现，如果没有他，该系列会议也不会有持续七年的势头。他身材矮小、体态丰腴，通常双脚张开，五官粗糙，留着一小撮白色山羊胡。他戴着厚厚的眼镜，粗短的手指上通常拿着一根粗雪茄。他体格健壮，不是那种体弱多病的神童的典型形象。维纳显然很享受这些会议以及他在会议中的核心角色：有时他会从椅子上站起来，像鸭子一样绕着桌子走一圈，手里拿着雪茄，兴高采烈地发表演讲，似​​乎势不可挡。他可能完全没有意识到其他人的存在，但他能有效地表达自己的想法，并与许多与会者建立了友谊。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">有些人对维纳在讨论时睡觉甚至打鼾的倾向感到好奇和恼火，但他显然能听到并消化正在讨论的内容。</font>他一醒来就会经常做出尖锐的评论。</font></p><p><font size="-1">Wiener was the dominant figure at the conference series, in his role as brilliant originator of ideas and enfant terrible. Without his scientific ideas and his enthusiasm for them, the conference series would never have come into existence, nor would it have had the momentum to continue for seven years without him. A short, stout man with a paunch, usually standing splay-footed, he had coarse features and a small white goatee. He wore thick glasses and his stubby fingers usually held a fat cigar. He was robust, not the stereotype of the frail and sickly child prodigy. Wiener evidently enjoyed the meetings and his central role in them: sometimes he got up from his chair and in his ducklike fashion walked around the circle of tables, holding forth exuberantly, cigar in hand, apparently unstoppable. He could be quite unaware of other people, but he communicated his thoughts effectively and struck up friendships with a number of the participants. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Some were intrigued as much as annoyed by Wiener's tendency to go to sleep and even snore during a discussion, but apparently hearing and digesting what was being said.</font> Immediately upon waking he would often make penetrating comments.</font></p>
      <font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">尽管在 20 世纪 40 年代神经生理学的发展超出了人们对神经细胞的了解，神经网络理论的命运并不光彩，但神经网络模型已经深刻影响了计算机的设计。（后来的研究表明，开关电路并不是人类神经系统的准确模型，因为神经元并不严格地充当“全有或全无”的设备。）尽管冯·诺依曼对大脑功能理论的最新进展心存疑虑，但他在 1945 年的“第一稿”中采用了麦卡洛克和皮茨提出的逻辑形式主义。当所有未来通用计算机的架构模板首次确定时，控制论专家的发现影响了逻辑设计。

      </font></font><p>1944 年和 1945 年，维纳已经在思考一种涉及通信、信息、自我控制的科学模型——一种看待自然的包罗万象的方式，包括对计算机和大脑、生物学和电子学、逻辑和目的的解释。他后来写道：“我几乎从一开始就清楚地认识到，这些新的通信和控制概念涉及对人类、人类对宇宙和社会的认识的新解释。”</p><p>In 1944 and 1945, Wiener was already thinking about a scientific model involving communication, information, self-control -- an all-embracing way of looking at nature that would include explanations for computers and brains, biology and electronics, logic and purpose. He later wrote: "It became clear to me almost at the very beginning that these new concepts of communication and control involved a new interpretation of man, of man's knowledge of the universe, and of society."</p>

      <p>维纳坚信生物学，甚至社会学和人类学，都会像电子理论或计算机工程一样，受到控制论的深刻影响；事实上，人类学家格雷戈里·贝特斯顿与维纳以及后来的第一批人工智能研究人员关系密切。当香农发表了信息理论，冯·诺依曼推动了计算机技术的发展时，维纳在战后世界中退出了大科学政治，以阐明他的宏伟框架。</p><p>Wiener was convinced that biology, even sociology and anthropology, were to be as profoundly affected by cybernetics as electronics theory or computer engineering; in fact anthropologist Gregory Bateston was closely involved with Wiener and later with the first AI researchers. While Shannon published information theory, and von Neumann pushed the development of computer technology, Wiener retreated from the politics of big science in the postwar world to articulate his grand framework.</p>

      <p>战后，冯·诺依曼提出的高等研究院计算机计划付诸实施，朱利安·毕格罗担任冯·诺依曼的首席工程师，莫奇利和埃克特开始独立开创商业计算机行业，维纳前往墨西哥城与罗森布鲁斯一起工作。然后，在 1947 年春天，维纳去了英国，在那里他参观了英国的计算机建设项目，并与阿兰·图灵进行了交谈。</p><p>After the war, as the plans for the Institute for Advanced Study's computer proposed by von Neumann were put into action, with Julian Bigelow as von Neumann's chief engineer on the project, and as Mauchly and Eckert struck out on their own to start the commercial computer industry, Wiener headed for Mexico City to work with Rosenblueth. Then, in the spring of 1947, Wiener went to England, where he visited the British computer-building projects, and spoke with Alan Turing.</p>

      <p>回到墨西哥城后，维纳开始撰写他的书，并决定将这本书和这个新领域命名为“<a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/CYBSYSTH.html"><i>控制</i></a><a href="http://members.gnn.com/cybernetic/CTI.html">论</a>”，该词源于希腊语，意为“舵手”。这本书的副标题是：<i>或动物和机器的控制和通信</i>。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">控制论是一种通用科学，描述了在无序宇宙中维持秩序的机制，即基于过去的信息和对未来的预测，在物理世界的随机力量中引导航向的过程。</font></p><p>When he returned to Mexico City, Wiener wrote his book and decided to title it and the new field <a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/CYBSYSTH.html"><i>Cybernet</i></a><a href="http://members.gnn.com/cybernetic/CTI.html">ics</a>, from the Greek word meaning "steersman." It was subtitled: <i>or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine</i>. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Cybernetics was the description of a general science of mechanisms for maintaining order in a disorderly universe, the process for steering a course through the random forces of the physical world, based on information about the past and forecasts about the future.</font></p>

      <p>当舵手移动舵时，船就会改变航向。当舵手发现先前的航向改变已经过度转向时，舵就会再次朝相反方向移动。舵手感官的反馈是保持船航向的控制因素。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">维纳打算在这门学科的名称中嵌入这样一种思想，即转向和通信之间存在联系。</font> “工程学中的控制理论，无论是人类、动物还是机械，”他说，“都是信息理论的一个篇章。”</p><p>When a steersman moves a rudder, the craft changes course. When the steersman detects that the previous change of course has oversteered, the rudder is moved again, in the opposite direction. The feedback of the steersman's senses is the controlling element that keeps the craft on course. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Wiener intended to embed in the name of the discipline the idea that there is a connection between steering and communication.</font> "The theory of control in engineering, whether human or animal or mechanical," he stated, "is a chapter in the theory of messages."</p>

      <p>舵或高射炮操纵和生物系统操纵背后的数学原理是一样的——维纳认为，这是一种普遍规律，就像运动定律或引力定律一样。维纳的直觉是正确的。通信和控制、编码和解码、操纵和预测对物理学家和生物学家来说变得越来越重要，因为他们感兴趣的现象与枪支或计算机截然不同。</p><p>The mathematics underlying the steering of rudders or antiaircraft guns and the steering of biological systems was the same -- it was a general law, Wiener felt, like the laws of motion or gravity. Wiener's intuitions turned out to be correct. Communication and control, coding and decoding, steering and predicting, were becoming more important to physicists and biologists, who were interested in phenomena very different from guns or computing machines.</p>

      <p>20 世纪 40 年代末，另一类新的跨学科理论家，即后来的分子生物学家，开始思考遗传学的<i>编码</i>机制。甚至量子物理学家也在研究维纳、比奇洛和罗森布鲁斯非常关心的问题。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">维纳似乎可能发现了信息、能量和物质之间更为宇宙的联系。</font>科学的分水岭即将到来，他的许多同事都期待着维纳能有更多重大突破。到 1947 年秋天，在 1948 年出版之前，他的控制论著作以手稿形式在政府和学术专家中流传。</p><p>In the late 1940s, another new category of interdisciplinary theorists who would come to be known as molecular biologists were beginning to think about the <i>coding</i> mechanism of genetics. Even the quantum physicists were looking into the issues that were so dear to Wiener, Bigelow, and Rosenblueth. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">It looked as if Wiener might be onto an even more cosmic link between information, energy, and matter.</font> A scientific watershed was imminent, and many of his colleagues were expecting more major breakthroughs from Wiener. By the fall of 1947, prior to its 1948 publication, his book on cybernetics was making the rounds of government and academic experts in manuscript form.</p>

      <p>罗伯特·法诺 (Robert Fano) 是电气工程学教授，后来成为麻省理工学院电气工程系主任，也是麻省理工学院开创性计算机项目 MAC 的行政负责人。他目睹了维纳当时的一些奇怪行为，后来克劳德·香农 (Claude Shannon) 发表了他的论文，法诺有理由记住这些行为。法诺当时正在撰写电气工程博士论文。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">维纳会不时走进学生的办公室，含糊地告诉他“信息就是熵”，然后一言不发地走出去。</font></p><p>Robert Fano, a professor of electrical engineering who eventually became head of the electrical engineering department at MIT and administrative leader of MIT's pioneering computer project known as MAC, witnessed some strange behavior on Wiener's part around that time, behavior that Fano later had cause to remember when Claude Shannon published his work. Fano was working on his doctoral thesis in electrical engineering. From time to time, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Wiener would walk into the student's office, inform him rather cryptically that "information is entropy," and walk out without saying another word.</font></p>

      <p>到 1946 年底，维纳做出了一个与数学的冷酷形式主义无关的决定，这一决定使他与这位专注于武器研究的同事又有了一个区别。维纳放弃了未来在武器相关研究中的角色，他故意将自己从计算机技术（而不是控制论理论）发展的热点中抽离出来，他说：“我不希望发表任何可能落入不负责任的军国主义者手中造成损害的未来研究成果。”对维纳和科学界来说幸运的是，他的发现的影响不仅限于军事应用。很快人们就发现，武器并不是唯一由通信和控制代码制造出来的东西。</p><p>By the end of 1946, Wiener had reached a decision that had nothing to do with the cold formalisms of mathematics, a decision that distinguished him in yet another way from his weaponry-oriented colleague. Renouncing any future role in weapons-related research, Wiener deliberately removed himself from the hot center of the action in the development of computer technology (as opposed to cybernetic theory) when he stated: "I do not expect to publish any future work of mine which may do damage in the hands of irresponsible militarists." Fortunately for Wiener, and for the scientific world, the implications of his discoveries were not limited to military applications. It quickly became evident that weapons were not the only things of interest that were built from communication and control codes.</p>

      <p>到了四十年代末五十年代初，科学界开始涌现出许多与信息论有关的新思想。1945 年，量子物理学家埃尔温·薛定谔在剑桥大学发表了一场著名的演讲，题目是“生命是什么？”，后来发表在了杂志上。当时在场的一位年轻物理学家弗朗西斯·克里克决定转行研究生物学，因为科学史上最重要的解码问题正在等待他。冯·诺依曼在与维纳的争论中被证明是正确的——下一个伟大解码的主题是噬菌体，而不是神经系统。</p><p>By the late forties and early fifties, the atmosphere was crackling with new scientific ideas having to do with what nobody yet called information theory. The quantum physicist Erwin Shroedinger gave a famous lecture at Cambridge University in 1945, later published, on the topic "What is Life?" One of the younger physicists in the audience, Francis Crick, decided to switch to biology, where the most crucial decoding problem in scientific history was waiting for him. Von Neumann turned out to be right in his dispute with Wiener -- the bacteriophage, not the nervous system, was the subject of the next great decoding.</p>

      <p>冯·诺依曼关于自我复制自动机的想法——模式足够复杂、高度有序，足以指导它们自我复制——似乎指向了同一个想法。有序与无序、信息与噪音之间的某种关系接近生命的核心。信息操纵看起来更像是数学家玩的游戏，甚至比机器的能力还要多。信息开始看起来像是宇宙运作方式的反映，直到克劳德·香农 1948 年的出版物才以数学形式得到证明。整个想法最初对科学家来说是一次思维上的颠覆，然后对许多其他人来说也是如此。</p><p>Von Neumann's ideas about self-reproducing automata -- patterns complex enough and highly ordered enough to direct their own replication -- seemed to point toward the same idea. Something about order and disorder, messages and noise, was near the heart of life. The manipulation of information looked like something more like a game mathematicians play, even more than a capability of machines. Information, in a way that was not mathematically demonstrated until Claude Shannon's 1948 publications, began to look like a reflection of the way the universe works. The whole idea was a wrenching of mind-set, at first for scientists, then for many others.</p>

      <p>二十世纪初，科学家认为宇宙是由粒子和力相互作用形成的，这些粒子和力以复杂但有序的模式相互作用，原则上完全可以预测。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">在重要的方面，生活在日益机械化的文明中的所有非科学家也认为宇宙是由粒子和力以及钟表宇宙构成的。大约六十年前，量子理论消除了钟表和可预测性。大约三十年前，</font>一些人开始观察世界，正如诺伯特·维纳所说，看到了“无数的致相关人士的信息”。</p><p>At the beginning of the twentieth century, scientists saw the universe in terms of particles and forces interacting in complicated but orderly patterns that were, in principle, totally predictable. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">In important ways, all of the nonscientists who lived in an increasingly mechanized civilization also saw the universe in terms of particles and forces and a clockwork cosmos. Around sixty years ago, quantum theory did away with the clockwork and predictability.</font> Around thirty years ago, a few people began to look at the world and see, as Norbert Wiener put it, "a myriad of To Whom It May Concern messages."</p>

      <p>信息仍是宇宙的基本特征，就像物质和能量一样，这一观点还很年轻，在更好的模型出现之前，肯定会出现更多令人惊奇的发现和应用。20 世纪 50 年代之前，只有科学家想到信息与任何事物都有关系。维纳和克劳德·香农为<i>通信</i>和<i>信息</i>等常用词赋予了新的技术含义，他们独立且大致同时证明了从亚原子粒子的随机运动到电子交换网络的行为以及人类语音的可理解性，一切都以一种可以通过某些基本数学方程式表达的方式相互关联。</p><p>The idea that information is still a fundamental characteristic of the cosmos, like matter and energy, is still young, and further surprise discoveries and applications are sure to pop up before a better model comes along. Before the 1950s, only scientists thought about the idea that information had anything to do with anything. Common words like <i>communication</i> and <i>message</i> were given new, technical meanings by Wiener and Claude Shannon, who independently and roughly simultaneously demonstrated that everything from the random motions of subatomic particles to the behavior of electrical switching networks and the intelligibility of human speech is related in a way that can be expressed through certain basic mathematical equations.</p>

      <p>与信息相关的方程式不仅在构建计算机和电话网络方面非常有用，而且对所有科学也产生了重大影响。受信息通信模型启发的研究为宇宙的一些基本特征提供了线索，从细胞生命指令如何编织到 DNA 分子中原子的排列，到脑细胞编码记忆的过程。该模型已成为托马斯·库恩所说的“科学范式”。该范式的两个基本支柱是克劳德·香农的信息和维纳的控制论。</p><p>The information-related equations were useful in building computers and telephone networks, but they also had significant impact on all the sciences. Research inspired by the information-communication model has provided clues to some of the fundamental features of the universe, from the way the cellular instructions for life are woven into the arrangement of atoms in DNA molecules, to the process by which brain cells encode memory. The model has become what Thomas Kuhn calls a "scientific paradigm." The two fundamental pillars of this paradigm were Claude Shannon's information and Wiener's cybernetics.</p>

      <p>这两个理论框架的重要意义在 20 世纪 40 年代末引起了科学家们的注意，并在 20 世纪 50 年代开始在公众意识中浮现，而它们所暗示的大众态度转变，被 Paula McCorduck 在其人工智能研究史中指出：</p><p>The significance of these two theoretical frameworks that came to the attention of scientists in the late 1940s and began to surface in public consciousness in the 1950s, and the mass attitude shift they implied, was noted by Paula McCorduck, in her history of artificial intelligence research:</p>

      
        <font size="-1"><i>控制论</i>记录了从一种主导模型或现象解释集向另一种主导模型或现象解释集的转变。<i>能量</i>——牛顿力学的核心概念——现在被<i>信息</i>取代。信息论的概念，如编码、存储、噪声等，为从电子电路行为到复制细胞行为等一系列事件提供了更好的解释。……这些术语的含义与你想象的差不多。<i>编码</i>是指“用于表示字母或数字以传输消息的信号系统”；<i>存储</i>是指保存这些信号直到需要它们为止。<i>噪声</i>是一种干扰，它会在传输过程中掩盖或影响信号（或消息）的质量。</font>
      <font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">事实证明，编码和存储恰好是计算机逻辑设计和软件创建的核心问题。然而，信息理论的基础科学工作并非源自对计算的研究，而是源自对通信的分析。克劳德·香农比图灵年轻几岁，在英国逻辑学家图灵发现元数学一年后，他又做了一些巧妙的研究生工作，将理论与工程、哲学和机械联系在一起。

      克劳德·香农是一位真正的天才，22 岁时（1937 年）发表了著名的麻省理工学院硕士论文，将电路与逻辑形式联系起来。他是图灵、维纳和冯·诺依曼等先驱的同辈，是约翰·麦卡锡和</font></font><a href="http://brainop.media.mit.edu/people/minsky.html">马文·明斯基</a><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">等第一代人工智能探索者的老师，也是当代最重要的信息航天建筑师之一

      </font></font><a href="http://www.kzoo.edu/~abrady/CS400/bioW96/soulier.html">伊万·萨瑟兰</a>的导师。<p>1948 年，香农发表建立信息论的论文时，他 32 岁。仅凭这两项贡献，香农的职业生涯对科学的影响就难以估量，但他还撰写了一篇关于游戏机人工智能问题的开创性文章，发表于 1950 年。1953 年，大约在冯·诺依曼和图灵都在思考自我复制机器的数学可能性的同时，香农发表了另一部关于这些特殊自动机主题的重要著作。</p><p>When Shannon's papers establishing information theory were published in 1948, he was thirty-two. The impact on science of this man's career was incalculable for these two contributions alone, but he also wrote a pioneering article on the artificial intelligence question of game-playing machines, published in 1950. In 1953, at about the same time von Neumann and Turing were both thinking about the mathematical possibilities of self-reproducing machinery, Shannon published another major work on the subject of these special automata.</p>

      <p>1956 年，四十岁的香农是达特茅斯会议的组织者之一，该会议开创了人工智能领域。从战前让维纳和冯·诺依曼脱颖而出的发现，到 20 世纪 50 年代引领人工智能和多路访问计算机系统的探索，他的一生和思想构成了控制论和数字计算机战时起源与当今人工智能和个人计算时代之间最重要的桥梁。</p><p>In 1956, at the age of forty, Shannon was one of the organizers of the conference at Dartmouth that gave birth to the field of artificial intelligence. From the pre-war discoveries that scooped Wiener and von Neumann, to the explorations in the 1950s that led to both AI and multi-access computer systems, his life and ideas formed the single most important bridge between the wartime origins of cybernetics and digital computers and the present age of artificial intelligence and personal computing.</p>

      <p>香农在 1937 年所做的，是提供一种基于乔治布尔一个世纪前描述的逻辑代数来设计机器的方法。<a href="#OEBPS/Text/2.html.boole">布尔</a>在<i>《思维定律》</i>中表示，他成功地将人类推理过程与数学的精确符号力量联系起来。布尔提出的逻辑计算系统中只有两个值：1 和 0。如果一个值为真，可以用符号 1 表示；如果为假，则用符号 0 表示。在该系统中，真值表<i>描述</i>了系统可能的各种逻辑状态。给定一个输入状态，特定操作的真值表将确定每当该操作应用于该输入时适当的输出状态。换句话说，给定一个起始磁带，真值表将确定终止磁带是什么。</p><p>What Shannon did in 1937 was to provide a way to design machines based on the logical algebra described a century before by George Boole. <a href="#OEBPS/Text/2.html.boole">Boole</a>, in <i>The Laws of Thought</i>, stated that he had succeeded in connecting the process of human reason to the precise symbolic power of mathematics. There were only two values in the logical calculation system that Boole proposed: 1 and 0. If a value is true, it can be designated by the symbol 1; and if it is false, the symbol 0 can be used. In this system, a <i>truth table</i> describes the various possible logical states of a system. Given an input state, a truth table for a specific operation determines the appropriate output state for whenever that operation is applied to that input. Another way of saying that would be that given a starting tape, the truth table determines what the ending tape will be.</p>

      <p>在布尔代数中，一个基本的逻辑运算是非<i>，</i>这是一种反转输入的运算，因此“非”运算的输出与输入相反（请记住，只有两个符号或状态）。另一个基本运算是<i>与</i>，它规定当且仅当几个输入中的每一个也为真（“开”、“1”）时，输出才为真（或“开”或“1”）。例如，表中“A 为真且 B 为真”的列表在 A 为“1”且 B 为“1”时设置为“1”，在所有其他情况下设置为“0”。可以通过查找 A 和 B 都等于 1 的输入行来查找真值表中的答案：</p><p>In Boolean Algebra, one fundamental logical operation is <i>not</i>, an operation that reverses the input, so that the output of a "not" operation is the opposite of the input (remember that there are only two symbols or states). Another fundamental operation is <i>and</i>, which dictates that the output is true (or "on" or "1") if and only if every one of the several inputs are also true ("on," "1"). For example, the listing in the table for "A is true and B is true" would be set for "1" when A is "1" and B is "1" and set for "0" in all other cases. One could look up the answer in the truth table by finding the input row where both A and B are equal to 1:</p>

      <p>通过匹配真值表中的适当行和列来确定结果的方式（一个纯粹自动的过程）与图灵提出的“指令表”有着至关重要的相似之处。</p><p>The way that results are determined by matching the proper rows and columns in the truth tables, a purely automatic procedure, has a crucial resemblance to the "instruction tables" Turing proposed.</p>

      <p>布尔代数的一个重要特征是可以将逻辑运算组合在一起形成新的逻辑运算，并且可以将逻辑运算集合组合在一起执行算术运算。逻辑三段论可以根据对零和一的运算来构建，方法是将一个真值表的输出安排为另一个真值表的输入。例如，事实证明，通过在每个“与”输入之前放置一个“非”，在其输出之后放置另一个“非”，可以构建“或”运算。通过串联这两个基本运算“非”和“与”的各种序列，可以构建加、减、乘、除的程序。因此，逻辑和算术是紧密而简单的关联。在香农告诉我们之前，没有人知道同样的代数可以描述电开关电路的行为。</p><p>One of the important features of Boolean algebra is the way logical operations can be put together to form new ones, and collections of logical operations can be put together to perform arithmetic operations. Logical syllogisms can be constructed in terms of operations on zeroes and ones, by arranging for the output of one truth table to feed input to another truth table. For example, it turns out that by putting a not before every and input, and putting another not after its output, it is possible to build an "or" operation. By stringing various sequences of only these two basic operations, "not" and "and," it is possible to build procedures for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. Logic and arithmetic are thus intimately and simply related. What nobody knew until Shannon told us was that the same algebra could describe the behavior of electrically switched circuits.</p>

      <p>同样重要的是，这些逻辑和算术运算的组合可用于构建“记忆”运算。布尔代数使得设计一个程序或构建一个设备成为可能，其“状态”可以存储特定信息——数据或运算。如果电路可以执行逻辑和数学运算，也可以存储这些运算的结果，那么就可以设计电子数字计算机。</p><p>Equally important was the way these combinations of logical and arithmetic operations could be used to build a "memory" operation. Boolean algebra makes it possible to devise a procedure, or build a device, the "state" of which can store specific information -- either data or operations. If electrical circuitry can perform logical and mathematical operations, and can also store the result of those operations, then electronic digital computers can be designed.</p>

      <p>在香农之前，布尔代数在数学思想的主流中是一个几乎被完全遗忘的奇怪漩涡，已经持续了近一个世纪，而且在更注重实践的物理学和电子工程界中，布尔代数当然是未知的。香农重新发现布尔代数的天才之处就在于此，因为他写的是电子工程论文，而不是数理逻辑论文，他关注的对象不是思维过程，而是连接在一起的电子开关组成的大型电路的行为，就像电话系统中的电路一样。</p><p>Until Shannon, Boolean algebra had been a curious and almost totally forgotten eddy in the mainstream of mathematical thought for almost a century, and was certainly unknown to the more practical-minded world of physics and electrical engineering. And that is where the genius of Shannon's rediscovery lies, for he was writing a thesis in electrical engineering, not mathematical logic, and the objects of his concern were not the processes of thought but the behavior of large circuits of electrical switches connected together into the kinds of circuits one finds in a telephone system.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">香农对复杂电路的特性很感兴趣，这些电路是由非常简单的装置“</font><i>继电器</i>”构成的。继电器是一种开关——一种打开或关闭电路、允许或阻止电流流动的装置——与普通的电灯开关没什么不同，只不过继电器不是通过人手来打开或关闭的，而是通过电流的通过来打开或关闭的。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Shannon was interested in the properties of complicated electrical circuits</font> that were built from very simple devices known as <i>relays</i>. A relay is a switch -- a device that opens or closes a circuit, permitting or blocking the flow of electricity -- not unlike an ordinary light switch, except a relay is not switched on or off by a human hand, but by the passage of an electrical current.</p>

      <p>继电器包含一个电磁铁。当小电流流入继电器时，电磁铁被激活，关闭继电器控制的电路，直到输入电流关闭。换句话说，电磁铁是一个可以打开和关闭另一个电路的小电路。一个继电器的电路还可以控制下一个继电器的电磁铁，依此类推，直到您拥有一个由开关组成的完整电路，所有开关都相互控制，具体取决于它们在开始时的设置方式以及它们如何被新输入改变。</p><p>A relay contains an electromagnet. When a small current flows into the relay, the electromagnet is activated, closing the circuit controlled by the relay until the input current is turned off. In other words, the electromagnet is a small electrical circuit that opens and closes another electrical circuit. The circuit of one relay can also control the electromagnet of the next relay, and so on, until you have a complete circuit that is made of nothing but switches, all controlling one another, depending on how they are set at the beginning and how they are altered by new input.</p>

      <p>每个继电器和由该继电器控制的电路只能处于两种状态之一：开或关。开关电路的这种双态特性正是将电与逻辑联系起来的原因，因为每个继电器控制的电路都可以看作是一个真值表，其中只有当满足指定的输入条件时，电流才会从输出流出，逻辑操作可以看作是物理设备，当且仅当其所有输入开关都处于开、关或某种特定组合时，它们才会发出输出脉冲，</p><p>Each relay and circuit controlled by that relay can be in only one of two states, on or off. This two-state characteristic of switched circuits is what links electricity to logic, for each relay-controlled circuit can be seen as a truth table, where current flows from the output only when specified input conditions are satisfied, and logical operations can be seen as physical devices that emit an output pulse if and only if all of their input switches are on, or off, or some specified combination,</p>

      <p>在 20 世纪 30 年代，电话系统使用由这些继电器控制的更大、更复杂的电路迷宫。无需人工操作员将正确的插孔插入交换机的正确部分，继电器可以在达到指定的输入条件时关闭电路。使用继电器，可以以自动拨号和路由的方式完成各种有用的事情。但电路越来越复杂，这开始成为一个问题。越来越难以弄清楚这些大型开关集合在做什么。</p><p>In the 1930s, telephone systems were using ever larger and more complicated mazes of circuits controlled by these relays. Instead of requiring a human operator to plug the proper jack into the right part of a switchboard, relays could close the circuit when the specified input conditions were reached. Using relays, all kinds of useful things could be done in the way of automatic dialing and routing. But the growing complexity of the circuitry was getting to be a problem. It was becoming harder and harder to figure out what these big collections of switches were doing.</p>

      <p>香农正在寻找一种最适合描述继电器电路行为的数学方法。他的论文展示了如何使用乔治·布尔代数学来描述这些复杂电路的运行。他意识到，如果这些电路现在可以被设计来表示逻辑和算术运算，那么这将会带来怎样的影响。</p><p>Shannon was looking for a mathematical procedure that was best suited for describing the behavior of relay circuits. His thesis showed how George Boole's algebra could be used to describe the operations of these complex circuits. And he was not unaware of the implications if the fact that these circuits could now be designed to represent the operations of logic and arithmetic.</p>

      <p>如果逻辑是与人类推理操作最为接近的形式系统，并且如果布尔的真值表可以体现这种模拟推理的形式系统，那么使用真值表作为图灵所讨论的“指令表”，并使用继电器等开关设备来表示机器的“状态”（或磁带的单元），<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">就有可能构建可以模拟人类思维的一些逻辑运算的电路。</font></p><p>If logic was the formal system that most closely matched the operations of human reason, and if Boole's truth tables could embody such a formal system of simulated reasoning, then the use of truth tables as the "instruction tables" Turing discussed, and with switching devices like relays to represent the "states" of the machines (or the cells of the tape), <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">it would be possible to build electrical circuits that could simulate some of the logical operations of human thought.</font></p>

      <p>当数字计算机建造者们聚在一起规划这项技术的未来发展时，香农身处其中——他毫不犹豫地提醒同事们，他们所建造的东西是迈向人工智能的第一步。但在取得首次突破后的十年间，香农转向了这个新领域的另一个方面。他的新雇主是<a href="http://www.bell-labs.com/">贝尔实验室</a>，信息的电气或电子通信是他的专长。全球领先的通信公司 AT&amp;T 是贝尔实验室的所有者，因此该实验室自然有兴趣支持香农对通信基本性质的探索。香农被鼓励去探究他感兴趣的问题，例如：当进行通信时，一方向另一方传递了什么？当通信被噪音或加密所掩盖时，什么无法传达？</p><p>When the digital computer builders got together to plan the future development of the technology, Shannon was in the thick of it -- and he didn't hesitate to remind his colleagues that what they were building was the first step toward artificial intelligence. But during the ten years immediately following his first breakthrough, Shannon turned to a different aspect of this new field. His new employer was <a href="http://www.bell-labs.com/">Bell Laboratories</a>, and the electrical or electronic communication of messages was his specialty. AT&amp;T, the foremost communication company in the world, was the owner of Bell Laboratories, so naturally the laboratory was interested in supporting Shannon's probes into the fundamental nature of communication. Shannon was encouraged to pursue his interesting questions such as: When something is communicated, what is delivered from one party to another? When a communication is obscured by noise or encryption, what fails to get across?</p>

      <p>这是维纳指出的通信和控制问题中的通信部分。战争期间，香农在贝尔实验室从事绝密国防项目，参与了密码学工作，并因此与图灵有了联系。战争结束后，香农专注于描述他们用所有这些逻辑和数学电路进行通信和操纵的实体的性质。</p><p>This was the communication part of the communication and control problem pointed out by Wiener. During the war, working at top-secret defense projects for Bell Laboratories, Shannon was involved in cryptological work that brought him into contact with Turing. After the war, Shannon concentrated on describing the nature of the entity they were communicating and manipulating with all these logical and mathematical circuits.</p>

      <p>当时，没有人知道信息到底是什么。正如他找到了描述继电器电路的完美工具一样，战后，香农希望找到数学工具来精确定义这些新机器正在处理的看不见但功能强大的商品。他成功地找到了他所寻求的描述工具，不是在数学的一个模糊角落，如布尔代数，而是在控制能量的基本定律中。</p><p>At this point, nobody knew, exactly, what information was. Just as he had found the perfect tool for describing relay circuits, after the war Shannon wanted to find mathematical tools for precisely defining the invisible but powerful commodity that these new machines were processing. He succeeded in finding the descriptive tools he sought, not in an obscure corner of mathematics, as in the case of Boole's algebra, but in the fundamental laws governing energy.</p>

      <p>和图灵一样，香农出人意料地为科学家们已经研究了几个世纪的项目画上了句号。在这种情况下，他们的探索不是要了解符号系统的本质，而是更加务实地关注能量的本质及其与信息的关系。尽管香农专门研究人造系统中信息通信的基本规律，并且对信息和噪声之间的差异很感兴趣，但他最终研究的是宇宙中能量流动的规律。特别是，他<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">发现了解码电话交换网络的秘密，这些秘密隐藏在之前科学家的工作中，这些科学家发现了控制蒸汽机热能的某些规律。</font></p><p>Like Turing, Shannon put a surprise finishing touch on a project that scientists had worked at for centuries. In this case, the quest was not to understand the nature of symbol systems, but a more pragmatic concern with the nature of energy and its relation to information. Although Shannon was specifically looking at the laws underlying the communication of messages in man-made systems, and generally interested in the difference between messages and noise, he ended up dealing with the laws governing the flow of energy in the universe. In particular, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">he discovered the secrets of decoding telephone switching networks, hidden in the work of previous scientists who had discovered certain laws governing heat energy in steam engines.</font></p>

      <p>早在工业革命刚刚开始、蒸汽机风靡一时，研究这些能量转换设备的效率就成为一种实际需要。在此过程中，人们发现，热的某些基本性质阻碍了任何机器达到完美的效率。蒸汽机中热量运动的研究成为了热力学科学，1850 年，鲁道夫·克劳<a href="http://physics.hallym.ac.kr/reference/physicist/Ch.html#Clausius">修斯</a>在他的两条热力学定律中对此进行了精确的表达。</p><p>Back when the Industrial Revolution was getting started, and steam-powered engines were the rage, it became a practical necessity to find out something about the efficiency of these energy-converting devices. In the process, it was discovered that something fundamental to the nature of heat prevents any machine from ever becoming perfectly efficient. The study of the movement of heat in steam engines became the science of thermodynamics, given precise expression in 1850 by <a href="http://physics.hallym.ac.kr/reference/physicist/Ch.html#Clausius">Rudolf Clausius</a>, in his two laws of thermodynamics.</p>

      <p>热力学第一定律指出，封闭系统中的能量是恒定的。这意味着，在这样的系统中，能量既不能被创造也不能被毁灭，而只能被转化。第二定律实际上指出，每次发生转化时，那部分不变的能量库就会变得不那么稳定。当你把热水倒入冷水中时，你就不能再把它分离成一杯热水和一杯冷水（除非使用更多的能量）。<i>熵</i>，意思是“转化”，是克劳迪斯后来为可用能量的损失量提出的一个词。</p><p>The first law of thermodynamics stated that the energy in a closed system is constant. That means that energy cannot be created or destroyed in such systems, but can only be transformed. The second law states, in effect, that part of that unchangeable reservoir of energy becomes a little less stable every time a transformation takes place. When you pour hot water into cold water, you can't separate it back into a hot and a cold glass of water again (without using a lot more energy). <i>Entropy</i>, meaning "transformation," was the word Claudius later proposed for that lost quantity of usable energy.</p>
    <font size="+3">熵</font>

    <font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">
      克劳修斯所定义的熵不仅仅是蒸汽机或水杯中发生的事情。它是一种普遍趋势，既适用于天空中星星的能量交换，也适用于炉子上的茶壶。由于宇宙被假定为一个封闭系统，而且克劳修斯证明了这种系统的熵会随着时间的推移而增加，因此，遥远但不可避免的“宇宙热寂”的悲观预测是热力学第二定律令人不安的暗示。他们之所以称之为“热寂”，是因为热是能量中熵最高的形式。

      </font></font><p>但关于世界末日的悲观消息并不是熵概念的唯一含义。当人们发现热量是分子群平均运动的量度时，熵的概念就与系统中有序或无序的量度联系起来了。如果“热量”、“平均运动”和“系统有序”等不同概念之间的联系听起来令人困惑，那么你就可以理解十九世纪物理学家的感受了。长期以来，他们认为热量是一种从一个物体转移到另一个物体的无形流体。当人们发现热量是一种物质的特征，其中分子的平均移动速度比“冷”物质中的分子快时，一种观察由大量部分（在本例中为分子）组成的系统的新方法应运而生。这种观察系统各部分排列方式的新方法最终导致了熵与信息的联系。</p><p>But the gloomy news about the end of time wasn't the only implication of the entropy concept. When it was discovered that heat is a measure of the average motion of a population of molecules, the notion of entropy became linked to the measure of order or disorder in a system. If this linkage of such disparate ideas as "heat," "average motion," and "order of a system" sounds confusing, you have a good idea of how nineteenth-century physicists felt. For a long time, they thought that heat was some kind of invisible fluid that was transferred from one object to another. When it was discovered that heat is way of characterizing a substance in which the molecules were, on the average, moving around faster than the molecules in a "cold" substance, a new way of looking at systems consisting of large numbers of parts (molecules, in this case) came into being. And this new way of looking at the way the parts of systems are arranged led, eventually, to the entropy-information connection.</p>

      <p>因为分子的“平均运动”是一种统计量度，所以说一个系统中的热量多少就说明了该系统各部分的排列方式。想象一下一个气体容器。在这种情况下，系统包括容器内的所有物质和容器外的所有物质。如果容器内分子的平均能量高于容器外分子的平均能量，则认为该气体是热的。事实上，容器内的一些分子可能比容器外的一些分子能量更低（温度更低）——但平均而言，容器内分子群的能量比容器外分子群的能量更高。</p><p>Because "average motion" of molecules is a statistical measure, saying something about the amount of heat in a system says something about they way the parts of that system are arranged. Think about a container of gas. The system in this case includes everything inside the container and everything outside the container. The gas is considered to be hot if the average energy of the molecules inside the container is higher than the average energy of the molecules outside the container. Some of the molecules inside the container might, in fact, be less energetic (cooler) than some of the molecules outside the container -- but on the average, the population of molecules inside are more energetic than the population of the molecules outside.</p>

      <p>这种排列有一定的<i>顺序</i>——高能分子更可能出现在容器内部，低能分子更可能出现在外部。如果没有容器，高能分子和低能分子就会混合，系统中热的部分和冷的部分就不会有明显的差别。</p><p>There is a certain <i>order</i> to this arrangement -- energetic molecules are more likely to be found inside the container, less energetic molecules are more likely to be found outside. If there were no container, the highly energetic molecules and the less energetic molecules would mix, and there would be no sharp differentiation between the hot parts and the cold parts of the system.</p>

      <p>熵值高的系统有序度低。熵值低的系统有序度较高。在蒸汽机中，热量集中在一个地方（锅炉），然后散发到冷的部分（冷凝器）。这是一个非常有序（熵值低）的系统，任何人都可以可靠地预测热分子可能出现在蒸汽机的哪个部分。但是，当蒸汽机的所有部件温度相同时，热分子和冷分子出现在锅炉和冷凝器中的可能性相同（因此熵值高），蒸汽机就无法做任何功。</p><p>A system with high entropy has a low degree of order. A system with low entropy has a higher degree of order. In a steam engine, you have the heat in one place (the boiler) and it is dissipated into the cold part (the condenser). This is a very orderly (low entropy) system in the sense that anyone can reliably predict in which part of the engine the hot molecules are likely to be found. But when all the parts of a steam engine are the same temperature, and the hot and cold molecules are equally likely to be found in the boiler and the condenser (and hence the entropy is high), the engine can't do any work.</p>

      <p>另一位物理学家玻尔兹曼指出，熵是系统各部分排列方式的函数<i>，而不是系统</i><i>排列</i>方式的数量。现在，让我们暂时忘掉分子，想想一副牌。52 张牌可以有无数种排列方式。每副牌出厂时都按花色和点数按确定的顺序排列。只要稍加思考，任何人都可以预测哪张牌是从牌堆顶部数第五张。当洗牌时，可预测性和有序性就消失了。</p><p>Another physicist, Boltzmann, showed that entropy is a function of the way the parts of the system are <i>arranged</i>, compared with the number of ways the system <i>can be arranged</i>. For the moment, let's forget about molecules and think about decks of cards. There is a large number of ways that fifty-two cards can be arranged. When they come from the factory, every deck of cards is arranged in a definite order, by suit and by value. With a little bit of thought, anybody can predict which card is the fifth from the top of the deck. The predictability and orderliness disappears when the deck is shuffled.</p>

      <p>一副未洗过的牌的熵值较低，因为以不太可能的方式排列它需要能量。因此，将牌置于更可能、更无序、更不可预测、熵值更高的状态所需的能量较少：根据热力学第二定律，宇宙中的所有牌最终都会被洗牌，就像所有分子都具有相同的能量一样。</p><p>An unshuffled deck of cards has a lower degree of entropy because energy went into arranging it in an unlikely manner. Less energy is then required to put the deck into a more probable, less orderly, less predictable, more highly entropic state: According to the second law of thermodynamics, all decks of cards in the universe will eventually be shuffled, just as all molecules will have an equal amount of energy.</p>

      <p>另一位十九世纪的科学家詹姆斯·克拉克·麦克斯韦提出了一个关于这种难以捉摸的性质的悖论，这种性质似乎与能量、信息、秩序和可预测性等直观上不同的度量有关。这个悖论在物理学家中以“麦克斯韦妖”之名臭名昭著。考虑一个被屏障分开的容器，屏障的开口小到每次只能让一个分子从一侧通过到另一侧。一侧是热气体，其中分子的平均能量高于容器冷侧分子的平均能量。根据第二定律，更热、更活跃的分子最终应该迁移到容器的另一侧，在与移动较慢的分子碰撞时损失能量，直到两侧达到相同的温度。</p><p>James Clerk Maxwell, yet another nineteenth-century scientist, proposed a paradox concerning this elusive quality called entropy, which seems to relate such intuitively dissimilar measures as energy, information, order, and predictability. The paradox became infamous among physicists under the name "Maxwell's demon." Consider a container split by a barrier with an opening small enough to pass only one molecule at a time from one side to another. On one side is a volume of hot gas, in which the average energy of the molecules is higher than the average energy of the molecules in the cold side of the container. According to the second law, the hotter, more active molecules should eventually migrate to the other side of the container, losing energy in collisions with slower moving molecules, until both sides reach the same temperature.</p>

      <p>麦克斯韦问道，如果把一个小恶魔放在分子门上，这个恶魔不会给系统贡献能量，但可以打开和关闭容器两侧之间的门，会发生什么？现在，如果这个恶魔决定只让偶尔缓慢移动、较冷的分子在随机接近门时从热侧穿过到冷侧，会发生什么？从长远来看，这一政策可能意味着热侧会变得更热，冷侧会变得更冷，熵会减少而不是增加，而系统不会增加任何能量！</p><p>What would happen, Maxwell asked, if you could place a tiny imp at the molecular gate, a demon who didn't contribute energy to the system, but who could open and close the gate between the two sides of the container? Now what if the imp decides to let only the occasional slow-moving, colder molecule pass from the hot to the cold side when it randomly approaches the gate? Taken far enough, this policy could mean that the hot side would get hotter and the cold side would get colder, and entropy would decrease instead of increase without any energy being added to the system!</p>

      <p>1922 年，当时在柏林的匈牙利物理学学生利奥·西拉德（后来成为冯·诺依曼在曼哈顿计划中的同事）终于解决了麦克斯韦妖悖论，他证明了妖精确实需要为系统贡献能量，但就像一个优秀的魔术师一样，妖精不会将能量消耗在其最明显的活动（移动门）上，而是消耗在<i>其对系统的了解</i>上。妖精是系统的一部分，它必须做一些工作才能在适当的时间区分热分子和冷分子，从而打开门。妖精只需获得操作门所需的分子信息，它给系统增加的熵就会多于它减少的熵。</p><p>In 1922, a Hungarian student of physics by the name of Leo Szilard (later to be von Neumann's colleague in the Manhattan project), then in Berlin, finally solved the paradox of Maxwell's demon by demonstrating that the demon does indeed need to contribute energy to the system, but like a good magician the demon does not expend that energy in its most visible activity -- moving the gate -- but in <i>what it knows</i> about the system. The demon is a part of the system, and it has to do some work in order to differentiate the hot and cold molecules at the proper time to open the gate. Simply by obtaining the information about molecules that it needs to know to operate the gate, the demon adds more entropy to the system than it subtracts.</p>

      <p>尽管西拉德含蓄地表明信息和熵是紧密相连的，但这两个性质之间以方程形式表达的关系的具体细节，以及这种关系如何推广到电路和遗传密码等各种现象，尚不清楚。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">克劳德·香农将信息变成了一个技术术语，而这个技术术语从此改变了这个词的流行含义。</font></p><p>Although Szilard showed implicitly that information and entropy were intimately connected, the explicit details of the relationship between these two qualities, expressed in the form of equations, and the generalization of that relationship to such diverse phenomena as electrical circuits and genetic codes, were not yet known. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">It was Claude Shannon who made information into a technical term, and that technical term has since changed the popular meaning of the word.</font></p>

      <p>另一个与熵有关的谜题，以及另一位物理学家于 1945 年提出的神秘的部分解决方案，是将其与信息联系起来的第二条线索。很简单：如果宇宙趋向于熵，那么生命这种高度有序、耗能、反熵的现象如何继续存在？在一个趋向于无序的宇宙中，单细胞生物究竟是如何让自己变得足够复杂以构建人类神经系统的？</p><p>Another puzzle related to entropy, and the cryptic partial solution to it proposed in 1945 by another physicist, was a second clue linking it to information. Quite simply: If the universe tends toward entropy, how does life, a highly ordered, energy-consuming, antientropic phenomenon, continue to exist? In a universe flowing toward disorder, how on earth did one-celled creatures complicate themselves enough to build a human nervous system?</p>

      <p>量子物理学家<a href="http://physics.hallym.ac.kr/reference/physicist/Schrodinger.html">埃尔温·薛定谔</a>指出，生命不受太阳产生的宇宙能量潮汐的影响。只要太阳继续照耀，地球就不是一个封闭的系统。地球上的光化学反应捕获了太阳辐射能的一小部分，并利用它来使事物复杂化。在 1945 年著名的“生命是什么？”演讲中，薛定谔指出“生物体以负能量为食”。负能量和信息之间的关系就像布尔晦涩难懂的代数一样，正等待着人们去发现，而香农开始思考信息如何在无序性很高的媒介中保持秩序。</p><p>Quantum physicist <a href="http://physics.hallym.ac.kr/reference/physicist/Schrodinger.html">Erwin Schr�dinger</a> pointed out that life defies the cosmic energy tide courtesy of our sun. As long as the sun keeps shining, the earth is not a closed system. Photochemical reactions on earth capture a tiny fraction of the sun's radiant energy and use it to complicate things. In his famous "What Is Life?" lecture in 1945, Schr�dinger remarked that "living organisms eat negative energy." The relationship between negative energy and information, like Boole's obscure algebra, was just waiting to be found when Shannon started to wonder how messages manage to maintain their order in a medium where disorder is often high.</p>

      <p>设计一个简单的代码并可靠地将其从一个地方传输到另一个地方对英国密码学家来说非常重要，而香农在密码学方面也有自己的工作。预测用于传输由这些代码组成的信息的电路的行为是香农的另一个兴趣。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">当他把这一切与如何区分信息和噪音的正式研究结合起来时，发现他所寻找的方程正是熵的定义方程的变体，克劳德·香农偶然发现了宇宙在与自己玩 20 个问题。</font></p><p>The matter of devising a simple code and reliably transmitting it from place to place was very important to British cryptographers, and Shannon had done his own work in cryptography. The prediction of the behavior of electrical circuits used to transmit messages made of these codes was another of Shannon's interests. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">When he put it all together with a formal examination of how messages can be distinguished from noise, and found that the very equation he sought was a variation of the defining equation for entropy, Claude Shannon happened upon the fact that the universe plays twenty questions with itself.</font></p>

      <p>信息理论的正式基础是在 1948 年的两篇论文中奠定的，其核心是一些基本方程，这些方程与玻尔兹曼方程有明确的关系，玻尔兹曼方程将熵与系统的有序度联系起来。但这些方程背后的总体思路很简单，香农建议用游戏来理解编码和通信的量化维度。</p><p>The formal foundations of information theory were laid down in two papers in 1948, and at their core were fundamental equations that had a definite relationship to Boltzmann's equations relating entropy to the degree of order in a system. But the general idea behind the equations was simple enough for Shannon to suggest a game as a way of understanding the quantitative dimension of coding and communication.</p>

      <p>这个游戏是“二十个问题”的平凡版本。对于英文字母，它变成了“五个问题”的游戏。玩家一想出字母表中的一个字母。玩家二试着猜出这个字母，只使用诸如“它在字母顺序中是否比 L 更早？”这样的问题。这是一个严格的是非游戏，每次移动只能得到两个可能答案中的一个。</p><p>The game is a mundane version of "twenty questions." In the case of the English alphabet, it turns out to be a game of "five questions." Player number one thinks of a letter of the alphabet. Player number two tries to guess the letter, using only questions like "is it earlier than L in the alphabetical sequence?" It is a strictly yes-or-no game, in which only one of two possible answers applies at every move.</p>

      <p>香农指出，最多只需回答五个问题，就能找出构成英语句子所需的三十个符号中的任何一个。如果将指定正确字母所需的“是”或“否”决定序列转换为零和一序列或开和关脉冲序列，或任何其他类型的二进制符号，你就有了一个用于传达字母表的代码——事实上，这是用于传输电传打字机信息的代码的基础。</p><p>Shannon pointed out that it takes a maximum of five questions to locate any of the thirty symbols necessary for making English sentences. If the sequence of yes or no decisions needed to specify the correct letter is converted into a sequence of zeroes and ones or a sequence of on and off impulses, or any other kind of binary symbol, you have a code for communicating the alphabet -- which is, in fact, the basis of the code used for transmitting teletypewriter messages.</p>

      <p>这个游戏可以看作是一个树形结构，每个字母都是树枝上唯一的一片叶子，树枝最终会从树干上分叉。或者，它可以看作是一个岔路花园，每条路径都是一系列非此即彼的决策，任何端点的位置都可以通过指定路径上的决策序列来编码。这也是在计算机内存中定位地址或编码要放置在该位置的指令的好方法。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">这个游戏树代码中的基本元素，即二元决策，是香农基本信息度量——比特的基础<i>。</i>每当</font>计算机爱好者提到“比特”时，他们指的是岔路花园中的那些决策之一。</p><p>This game can be visualized as a tree structure, where each letter is the only leaf on a branch that branches off a branch that eventually branches off a trunk. Or it can be seen as a garden of forking paths, where each path is a sequence of one-way-or-the-other decisions, and the location of any endpoint can be coded by specifying the sequence of decisions along the path. It is also a good way to locate an address in a computer's memory or to encode an instruction to be placed in that location. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">This basic element in this game-tree-code, the binary decision, was the basis for Shannon's basic measure of information -- the <i>bit</i>.</font> Whenever computer enthusiasts speak of a "bit," they are referring to one of those decisions in the garden of forking paths.</p>

      <p>请注意，每个决定、每个细节都会减少情况的不确定性，无论您是在指定路径中的转弯、猜谜游戏中的数字还是容器中分子的能量状态。但是，如果您使用不同的策略来猜测正确答案，结果会怎样？如果您只是按顺序或随机地命名每个可能的字母，结果会怎样？这与概率论有关，概率论是控制从大群体中随机选择小样本的数学原理。</p><p>Note that each decision, each bit, reduces the uncertainty of the situation, whether you are designating turns in a pathway or numbers in a guessing game or the energy state of molecules in a container. But what if you were to use a different strategy to guess the right answer? What if you just named each of the possible letters, one at a time, in a sequence or randomly? This relates to probability theory, the mathematical principles governing the random selection of small samples from large populations.</p>

      <p>事件发生的相对概率，无论是分子变热的概率还是符号是字母表中特定字母的概率，都取决于总体中的案例总数和特定事件的频率。如果总体中只有两种情况，那么一个是或否的决定就会将不确定性降低到零。在四人组中，需要两个决定才能确定。在数万亿人的群体中，你不得不进行一些猜测。当你对如此庞大的群体进行预测时，基于总体行为的<i>平均值</i>必须取代基于个体行为的精确的个案计算。</p><p>The relative probability of an event occurring, whether it is the probability of a molecule being hot or the probability of a symbol being a specific letter of the alphabet, depends upon the total number of cases in the population and the frequency of the specified event. If there are only two cases in the population, a single yes or no decision reduces the uncertainty to zero. In a group of four, it takes two decisions to be sure. In a group of trillions, you have to guess a little. When you are making predictions about such large populations, <i>averages</i> based on the overall behavior of the population have to replace precise case-by-case calculations based on the behavior of individual members of the population.</p>

      <p>统计平均值的一个特性是，一个群体很可能以平均值来表征，而这个平均值并不属于群体中的任何一个特定元素。如果你有一个由三个人组成的群体，你知道其中一个人身高三英尺，另一个人身高五英尺，另一个人身高六英尺，那么你就有关于这个群体的相当精确的信息，这可以让你根据身高挑选出个体。但是，如果你只知道这个群体的平均身高是四英尺八英寸，那么你对这三个特定个体中的任何一个都一无所知。每当一个系统用平均值来表示时，必然会丢失一些信息，就像两个能量状态在达到平衡时会损失一点能量一样。</p><p>One of the properties of a statistical average is that it is quite possible for a population to be characterized by an average value that is not held by any particular element of the population. If you have a population consisting of three people, and you know that one is three feet tall, one five feet tall, and one is six feet tall, you have quite precise information about that population, which would enable you to pick out individuals by height. But if all you know is that the average height of the population is four feet, eight inches, you wouldn't know anything useful about any one of the three particular individuals. Whenever a system is represented by an average, some information is necessarily lost, just as two energy states lose a little energy when they are brought into equilibrium.</p>

      <p>每当你从平均测量转为精确测量时，你就会减少对该群体的不确定性。而不确定性的减少正是控制分子群体运动的统计特性与二进制代码的统计特性相联系的地方，在这里熵与信息相遇。要了解不确定性与二进制代码之间的关系，可以想象一下一个有 20 个问题的游戏。如果游戏的目标是猜一个介于 1 到 100 之间的数字，而玩家一问这个数字是否大于 50，那么玩家二的回答（无论是是或否）都会将玩家一的不确定性减少一半。在问这个问题之前，玩家一有 100 种可能的选择。在问完这个是非问题之后，玩家一要么知道这个数字大于 50，要么知道它小于 50。</p><p>Whenever you move from an average measure to a precise measure, you have reduced uncertainty about that population. And that reduction in uncertainty is where the statistical properties that govern the motions of populations of molecules are connected to the statistical properties of a binary code, where entropy meets information. To see how uncertainty can relate to a binary code, think about a game of twenty questions. If the object of the game is to guess a number between one and one hundred, and player one asks if the number is larger than fifty, an answer from player two (no matter if it is yes or no) reduces player one's uncertainty by one half. Before asking the question, player one had one hundred possible choices. After asking that single yes or no question, player one either knows that the number is greater than fifty or that it is less than fifty.</p>

      <p>香农在 1948 年证明了一件事，即系统的熵用该系统中可能的状态组合的对数来表示——这等于找出一个个案需要提出的是或否问题的数量。香农重新定义了熵，它等于识别特定符号序列所需的二元决策数量。总的来说，这些二元决策，就像游戏中的答案一样，构成了有关系统的一定数量的信息。</p><p>One of the things Shannon demonstrated in 1948 was that the entropy of a system is represented by the logarithm of possible combinations of states in that system -- which is the same as the number of yes-or-no questions that have to be asked to locate one individual case. Entropy, as it was redefined by Shannon, is the same as the number of binary decisions necessary to identify a specific sequence of symbols. Taken together, those binary decisions, like the answers in the game, constitute a definite amount of information about the system.</p>

      <p>说到排列分子，生物体似乎掌握了大量有关如何将基本物质转化为复杂化合物的信息。不知何故，活细胞设法将环境中发现的杂乱无章的分子排列成维持生物体生命所必需的物质。在无序的环境中，生物体以某种方式创造了自己的内部秩序。这一非凡的特性现在听起来很像麦克斯韦妖。我们现在知道，答案在于 DNA 分子排列其元素的方式——以这样一种方式编码了新陈代谢和繁殖所必需的过程。薛定谔<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">所说的“负熵”是所有生命的营养，即信息，而香农则准确地展示了这种编码是如何进行的——在分子、信息或交换网络中。</font></p><p>When it comes to arranging molecules, living organisms seem to have a great deal of information about how to take elementary substances and turn them into complex compounds. Somehow, living cells manage to take the hodgepodge of molecules found in their environment and arrange them into the substances necessary for sustaining life of the organism. From a disorderly environment, living creatures somehow create their own internal order. This remarkable property now sounds suspiciously like Maxwell's demon. The answer, as we now know, is to be found in the way the DNA molecule arranges its elements -- doing so in such a way that the processes necessary for metabolism and reproduction are encoded. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The "negative entropy" that Schrodinger says is the nourishment of all life is information, and Shannon showed exactly how such coding can be done -- in molecules, messages, or switching networks.</font></p>

      <p>顺便说一句，必须要说的是，香农不愿意使用“熵”这个词来表示他的方程式所暗示的这个度量，但冯·诺依曼告诉他继续使用它，因为“既然没有人知道熵是什么，那么在辩论中你肯定会占优势。”</p><p>It has to be said, by the way, that Shannon was reluctant to use the word "entropy" to represent this measure implied by his equations, but von Neumann told him to go ahead and use it anyway, because "since nobody knows what entropy is, in a debate you will be sure to have an advantage."</p>

      <p>请记住，熵是香农的最终目标，而不是他的起点。热分子和 DNA 远非他的初衷。他之所以能参与猜谜游戏、比特的概念以及不确定性和熵之间的关系，是因为他仔细研究了信息的真正含义。传递信息的信号与其他所有事物有何不同？在无线电中广播声音时，必须投入多少能量才能确保在受到大气干扰或其他来源的静电干扰的情况下仍能听懂？这些都是香农想要回答的问题。</p><p>Remember that entropy is where Shannon ended up, not where he started. Hot molecules and DNA were far from his original intention. He got to the guessing game and the notion of bits and the relationship between uncertainty and entropy because he looked closely at what a message really is. How does a signal that conveys information differ from everything else that happens? How much energy must be put into broadcasting a voice over the radio to be sure that it will be understood despite atmospheric interference or static from other sources? These were the questions that Shannon set out to answer.</p>

      <p>香农 1948 年出版的《信息的数学理论》提出了一组定理，这些定理与在噪声介质上经济高效地传输信息直接相关，并且间接但仍然根本性地与能量和信息之间的联系相关。香农的工作直接回答了一个自战争以来一直很重要的工程问题：如何对信息进行编码，以便它们能够在一定量的噪声会干扰接收的介质上可靠地传输和接收？</p><p>Shannon's 1948 publication ("A Mathematical Theory of Information") presented a set of theorems that were directly related to the economical and efficient transmission of messages on noisy media, and indirectly but still fundamentally related to the connection between energy and information. Shannon's work was a direct answer to an engineering problem that had not decreased in importance since the war: how can messages be coded so that they will be reliably transmitted and received over a medium where a certain amount of noise is going to garble reception?</p>

      <p>香农表明，只要设计出正确的代码，任何信息都可以按照人们的期望以最高的可靠性传输。自然施加的限制只与通信信道的限制有关。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">只要有信道，无论噪声有多大，都可以设计出一种代码来以任意程度的确定性传输任何信息。</font>熵是代码复杂度与确定度之间关系的度量。这些定理对无线电和电话工程师意义重大，并使彩色电视以及月球广播成为可能，但香农以一种超越电气工程领域的方式来表达它们，证明了它们的普遍性。</p><p>Shannon showed that any message can be transmitted with as high a reliability as one wishes, by devising the right code. The limit imposed by nature is concerned only with the limit of the communication channel. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">As long as there is a channel, no matter how noisy, a code can be devised to transmit any message with any degree of certainty.</font> Entropy is a measure of the relationship between the complexity of the code and the degree of certainty. These theorems meant a lot to radio and telephone engineers, and made color television as well as broadcasts from the moon possible, but Shannon stated them in a way that demonstrated their universality beyond the domain of electrical engineering.</p>

      <p>事实上，生命本身的关键原来是信息问题，正如世界在五年后了解到的那样，当时，听过薛定谔讲座的年轻物理学家弗朗西斯·克里克与詹姆斯·沃森合作破译了 DNA 螺旋的分子遗传编码。从科学和意识层面来看，人们似乎太快地从基于能量的宇宙隐喻过渡到信息模型。人们急于将信息理论推广到各种科学领域，其中一些领域的科学价值值得怀疑，这导致香农谴责这种“从众效应”，他指出信息理论“可能已经膨胀到超出其实际成就的重要性……自然界的秘密很少会一次被揭开。”</p><p>The key to life itself, in fact, turned out to be a matter of information, as the world learned five years later, when that young physicist-turned-biologist who had attended Schr�dinger's lecture, Francis Crick, teamed up with James Watson to decipher the molecular genetic coding of the DNA helix. Scientifically, and on the level of consciousness, people seemed to jump rather too quickly to make the transition from an energy-based metaphor of the universe to an information model. The rush to generalize information theory to all sorts of scientific areas, some of them of dubious scientific merit, led Shannon to decry this "bandwagon effect," remarking that information theory "has perhaps ballooned to an importance beyond its actual accomplishments. . . . Seldom do more than a few of nature's secrets give way at one time."</p>

      <p>尽管香农对此不予承认，但<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">基于信息和通信的模型已被证明在科学领域非常有用，因为许多重要现象都可以从信息的角度来看待。人体可以更好地理解为复杂的通信网络，而不是像钟表一样的机器。</font>香农“噪声通道”定理所保证的纠错码对于蛋白质合成的遗传控制和计算机网络中的协议同样有用。香农的麻省理工学院同事<a href="http://www.worldmedia.com/archive/index.htm">诺姆·乔姆斯基</a>在探索语言的“深层结构”时使用了类似的工具。</p><p>Despite Shannon's disclaimer, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">information- and communication-based models have proved to be enormously useful in the sciences because so many important phenomena can be seen in terms of messages. Human bodies can be better understood as complex communication networks than as clockwork-like machines.</font> The error-correcting codes guaranteed by Shannon's "noisy channel" theorem are just as useful for genetic control of protein synthesis as for protocols in a computer network. Shannon's MIT colleague, <a href="http://www.worldmedia.com/archive/index.htm">Noam Chomsky</a>, has used a similar tool in his exploration of the "deep structure" of language.</p>

      <p>尽管有这些更高层次的抽象概念，香农并没有完全放弃对数字计算机潜力的思考。维纳将计算机视为一种自我控制机制，冯·诺依曼将计算机视为一种既具有逻辑特性又具有数学特性的设备，而香农则倾向于将 ENIAC 和 UNIVAC 视为信息处理机器。</p><p>With all these higher-level abstractions, Shannon did not abandon all thought of the potential of digital computers. Where Wiener saw the computer as a self controlling mechanism and von Neumann saw a device with logical as well as mathematical properties, Shannon tended to think of ENIAC and UNIVAC as information processing machines.</p>

      <p>和图灵以及此后的其他数学家一样，香农对这样的想法非常着迷：从理论上讲，下棋这种复杂且本质上具有人类特征的活动可以通过未来版本的设备进行模拟。1950 年 2 月，香农在《<i>科学美国人》</i>上发表了《下棋机器》 。在有人敢于将这项努力称为“人工智能研究”的五年前，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">香农就指出了当时很少有人认识到的一点——电子数字计算机可以“适应以符号方式处理代表单词、命题或其他概念实体的元素”。</font></p><p>Like Turing and other mathematicians since then, Shannon was fascinated with the idea that something as sophisticated and essentially human as chess playing could, in theory, be emulated by some future version of these devices. In February, 1950, Shannon published "A Chess Playing Machine" in <i>The Scientific American</i>. Half a decade before anyone dared to name the endeavor "artificial intelligence research," <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Shannon pointed out what a very few people then recognized -- that electronic digital computers could "be adapted to work symbolically with elements representing words, propositions or other conceptual entities."</font></p>

      <p>国际象棋游戏就是图灵机。而通用图灵机只要遵循正确的编码规则，就应该能够下国际象棋。香农指出，大多数人设计国际象棋机器的方法——机械地检查每一种备选走法并进行评估，即所谓的蛮力法——几乎是不可能的，即使是在最快的计算机上也是如此。他估计，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">一场典型的国际象棋游戏大约有 10^120 种可能的走法，因此“一台每百万分之一秒计算一种变化的机器需要超过 10^95 年才能决定第一步走法！”</font></p><p>A chess game is a Turing machine. And a universal Turing machine, given the properly coded rules, ought to be able to play chess. Shannon pointed out that the way most people would design a machine to play chess -- to mechanically examine each alternative move and evaluate it, the so-called brute-force method -- would be virtually impossible, even on the fastest imaginable computer. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">He estimated that a typical chess game has about 10^120 possible moves, so "A machine calculating one variation each millionth of a second would require over 10^95 years to decide on its first move!"</font></p>

      <p>这种“组合爆炸”——任何系统中每个层次都通向两个或更多更深层次的替代方案迅速而势不可挡地增加——是克劳德·香农经常发现的另一个自然秘密。备选决策数量的爆炸性增长是任何试图详尽检查分支结构的尝试所面临的障碍，并且继续困扰着那些试图通过在问题空间中执行搜索来模拟认知功能的程序员。</p><p>This "combinatorial explosion" -- the rapid and overwhelming buildup of alternatives in any system in which each level leads to two or more deeper levels -- was another one of those secrets of nature that Claude Shannon was in the habit of turning up. The explosive expansion of the number of alternative decisions is a barrier that confronts any attempt to exhaustively examine a branching structure, and continues to confront programmers who seek to emulate cognitive functions by performing searches through problem spaces.</p>

      <p>图灵和香农对国际象棋的兴趣非常浓厚，因为国际象棋游戏的复杂性与其规则的简单性有关，而且他们怀疑执行这种耗时的搜索过程所需的捷径也可能是大脑解决各种问题的方式的线索。</p><p>Turing and Shannon were altogether serious in their interest in chess, because of the complexity of the game in relation to the simplicity of its rules, and because they suspected that the shortcut needed to perform this kind of time-consuming search-procedure would also be a clue to the way brains solved all sorts of problems.</p>

      <p>下棋程序之所以有趣，还因为它与冯·诺依曼和图灵一直在研究的<i>自动机</i>信息实体有相似之处。与图灵的通用机器一样，这些自动机也是当时并不存在但理论上可以制造出来的理论设备。多年来，香农一直在试验几乎简单到荒谬的自制版本——能够穿越简单迷宫的机械老鼠。</p><p>A chess playing program was also interesting because it was a relative of the kind of informational entities known as <i>automata</i> that von Neumann and Turing had been toying with. Once again, like Turing's universal machines, these automata were theoretical devices that did not exist at that time, but were possible to build, in principle. For years, Shannon experimented with almost absurdly simple homemade versions -- mechanical mice that were able to navigate simple mazes.</p>

      <p>1953 年，香农发表了一篇论文《计算机与自动机》，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">文中提出了一些至今仍引起心理学家和计算机专家浓厚兴趣的问题。下棋的计算机能从错误中吸取教训吗？</font>能制造出能自我诊断和修复故障的机器吗？能不能创建计算机程序（“虚拟机”），让计算机根据人类用户的规格编写自己的软件？人脑处理信息的方式（在一些硬核人工智能圈子里被称为“湿件”）能被硬件和软件有效模拟吗？</p><p>In 1953, Shannon wrote a paper, "Computers and Automata," <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">in which he posed questions that continue to be of acute interest to psychologists as well as computerists. Can a chess playing computer learn form its mistakes?</font> Is it possible to build a machine that can diagnose itself and repair its own malfunctions? Can computer programs ("virtual machines") be created that enable computers to write their own software to the specifications of the human user? Can the way human brains process information (known in some hard-core AI circles as "wetware") ever be effectively simulated by hardware and software?</p>

      <p>1953 年夏天，在香农研究这些想法的同时，他聘请了两名临时实验室助理，分别是明斯基和麦卡锡，他们也是一对天才，懂得一些复杂的数学知识，并认为自己可以用计算机做出大成就。他们是第一代本土计算机科学家的第一批成员，他们已经了解电子学、控制论、信息理论和大脑生理学，并希望用这些知识做点有野心的事。当他们在贝尔实验室挖到香农时，他们来对了地方。</p><p>In the summer of 1953, while he was working on these ideas, Shannon hired two temporary laboratory assistants named Minsky and McCarthy, another pair of prodigies who knew some fancy mathematics and thought they could do big things with computers. Here were the first members of the first native generation of computer scientists, the ones who already knew about electronics and cybernetics and information theory and brain physiology and were looking for something ambitious to do with it all. They ended up in the right place when they dug up Shannon in the midst of Bell Laboratories.</p>

      <p>香农早就说过，他怀疑未来更复杂的计算机硬件的发展将使构建能够模拟人类认知某些部分的软件成为可能。但这些年轻人是赤裸裸的信徒。他们想要创造一种智能，而且不介意这么说。麦卡锡和香农编辑了一本关于自动机的书，三年后，即 1956 年，香农与明斯基、麦卡锡和 IBM 计算机研究员纳撒尼尔·罗切斯特一起赞助了达特茅斯大学的夏季会议，为这个新领域设定目标。他们聚集在一起讨论的新领域是一个尚未命名的科学分支，但它建立在这样一个假设之上：计算机的存在现在使得考虑创建科学界已知的最复杂系统——人类智能的人工版本成为可能。</p><p>Shannon had long spoken of his suspicion that the future evolution of more sophisticated computer hardware would make it possible to construct software capable of simulating some parts of human cognition. But these younger guys were blatant believers. They were out to build an intelligence, and didn't mind saying so. McCarthy and Shannon edited a book on automata, and three years later, in 1956, Shannon joined Minsky, McCarthy, and an IBM computer researcher, Nathaniel Rochester, in sponsoring a summer conference at Dartmouth University, to set goals for this new field. The new field they gathered to discuss was a branch of science that did not yet have a name, but which was founded on the assumption that the existence of computers now made it possible to consider creating an artificial version of the most complex system known to science -- human intelligence.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">大约在 1956 年，麦卡锡开始使用“人工智能”一词。</font>达特茅斯会议是人工智能派的制宪会议，也是两位几乎不为人知的兰德程序员艾伦·纽厄尔和赫伯特·西蒙从圣莫尼卡带着他们与克里夫·肖共同编写的一款软件轻而易举地赶来的地方。令所有人惊讶的是，这个程序——著名的<i>逻辑理论家</i>，可以证明罗素和怀特海的<i>《数学原理》</i>中的定理——竟然实现了其他人认为他们计划要做的事情。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">It was around 1956 that McCarthy started using the words "artificial intelligence."</font> The Dartmouth Conference was the constitutional convention of the artificial intelligence faction, and it was also the place where two virtually unknown Rand programmers named Alan Newell and Herbert Simon breezed in from Santa Monica with a piece of software they wrote with Cliff Shaw. To everyone's astonishment, it was a program -- the famous <i>Logic Theorist</i> that could prove theorems from Russell and Whitehead's <i>Principia Mathematica</i> -- that actually did what the rest of them thought they were there to plan to do.</p>

      <p>1956 年和 1957 年，人们对 AI 叛逆者寄予厚望。重大努力正在进行中，雄心勃勃的目标已在眼前。极少数非传统思想家将自己的职业生涯押注于这样的信念：这个计算机科学分支（以前是科幻小说的一个分支）很快就会被视为比人类曾经尝试过的任何其他事物都重要：明斯基留在麻省理工学院，专心研究知识如何在思想和机器中表现的问题；纽厄尔和西蒙（现已成为诺贝尔奖获得者）开始了他们彼此以及卡内基梅隆大学的长期合作，在那里他们专注于心理学和 AI 设计的信息处理方法；麦卡锡创建了<a href="http://www.apl.jhu.edu/~hall/lisp.html">LISP</a>，一种专门用于进行 AI 研究的语言，然后离开麻省理工学院，主持斯坦福大学的 AI 实验室。</p><p>Hopes were high for the AI rebels in 1956 and 1957. Major efforts were under way and ambitious goals were in sight. A very few unorthodox thinkers staked their careers on the conviction that this branch of computer science, formerly a branch of science fiction, would soon be seen as more important than anything else humankind had ever attempted: Minsky remained at MIT and concentrated on the problem of how knowledge is represented in minds and machines; Newell and Simon (now a Nobel Laureate) began their long association with one another and Carnegie-Mellon University, where they concentrated on the information processing approach to psychology and AI design; McCarthy created <a href="http://www.apl.jhu.edu/~hall/lisp.html">LISP</a>, a language specifically for conducting AI research, and left MIT to preside over Stanford's AI laboratory.</p>

      <p>克劳德·香农回到了他的国际象棋机器，继续制造能够学会如何走简单迷宫的机械老鼠。1956 年，电气工程专业的学生罗伯特·法诺 (Robert Fano) 目睹了诺伯特·维纳 (Norbert Wiener) 在 1947 年夏天提出的“熵就是信息！”的感叹，他将香农从贝尔实验室带到了麻省理工学院。</p><p>Claude Shannon went back to his chess playing machines and continued building the mechanical mice that could learn how to run simple mazes. In 1956, Robert Fano, the electrical engineering student who witnessed Norbert Wiener's "Entropy is information!" exclamations back in the summer of 1947, brought Shannon to MIT from Bell Laboratories.</p>

      <p>香农的专业地位无可挑剔，他偶尔骑着独轮车穿梭于麻省理工学院的大厅，以及他不愿经常演讲或发表论文，这些都几乎不会损害他的声誉。事实上，他的名声已经达到了神话般的程度，以至于他不得不开始写免责声明。名声不是他想要或需要的东西。到 1960 年，他甚至不再来办公室了。</p><p>His professional standing was so far beyond reproach that his occasional unicycle excursions through MIT halls, and his reluctance to lecture or publish frequently, hardly dented Shannon's reputation. In fact, his reputation had reached such mythological proportions that he had to start writing disclaimers. Fame wasn't something he wanted or needed. By 1960, he didn't even come to the office.</p>

      <p>20 世纪 60 年代，香农开始对股票市场产生兴趣，将其作为概率论的一个现实实验，据说他做得还不错。他开始认真地将他对通信和消息的分析扩展到英语。除了香农，没有人知道他的全部发现。罗伯特·法诺（后来成为 MAC 项目的行政主管）最近这样评价香农：</p><p>In the 1960s Shannon became interested in the stock market as a real-world experiment in probability theory, and rumor has it that he didn't do too badly. He began to seriously extend his analysis of communications and messages to the English language. Nobody but Shannon knows the full extent of his discoveries. Robert Fano (who went on to become the administrative director of Project MAC) recently said this of Shannon:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">他在 1950 年代所做的大量工作从未出版过。他不想让别人为他写论文，他自己也不会写。就这么简单，又这么复杂。他不喜欢教书。他不喜欢讲课。他的讲座都是珍品。它们听起来很随意，但实际上都是经过精心准备的。</font>
      

      <p>20 世纪 60 年代初，香农亲自收下的极少数学生之一、麻省理工学院培养的另一位神童伊万·萨瑟兰 (Ivan Sutherland) 在计算机科学界引起了不小的轰动。到 20 世纪 70 年代中期，年逾花甲的香农已然成为名副其实的“白发老人”。到 20 世纪 80 年代初，他仍然没有停止思考，考虑到他的成就，可以推测他最重要的发现尚未发表。</p><p>In the early sixties, one of the extremely few students Shannon personally took on, another MIT bred prodigy by the name of Ivan Sutherland, made quite a splash on the computer science scene. By the mid-1970s, Shannon, now in his sixties, had become a literal gray eminence. By the early 1980s, he still hadn't stopped thinking about things, and considering his track record, it isn't too farfetched to speculate that his most significant discoveries have yet to be published.</p>

      <p>20 世纪 50 年代末，也就是香农开始淡出公众视野的时候，人工智能先驱们开始为他们的实验室划定雄心勃勃的领域——目标包括自动定理证明程序、知识表示语言或机器人技术——人们开始梦想计算机可以用作实验室，用于运行新型人工智能程序的实验。然后命运再次给这个故事施加了一点压力。</p><p>In the late 1950s, around the time Shannon began to retreat from public life, the artificial intelligence pioneers began to stake out ambitious territories for their laboratories -- goals like automatic theorem-proving programs, or knowledge-representation languages, or robotics -- and it began to be possible to dream of computers that could be used as laboratories for running experiments in new kinds of AI programs. Then fate put a little pressure on the story once again.</p>

      <p>这一次，它不是一场战争，而是一种隐含的战争威胁。太空竞赛和计算机革命已准备就绪，1957 年即将启动，二战计算机发明者率先发明的信息处理设备也已准备就绪，走出实验室，开始渗透到现实世界。像往常一样，当麻省理工学院的一位教授偶然发现了一件大事时，事情开始变得扑朔迷离。</p><p>This time, it was not a war, but an implicit threat of war. The space race and the computer revolution were ready to be launched by 1957, and the information processing devices pioneered by the World War II creators of computing were ready to leave the laboratories and begin to infiltrate the real world. As usual, things started popping when an MIT professor stumbled onto something big.</p>

      <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">利克莱德的研究专长是<i>心理声学</i>。</font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">二战期间，他探索了电子技术如何应用​​于理解人类通信。具体来说，他想了解人类的耳朵和大脑如何将大气振动转化为对不同声音的感知。战后，麻省理工学院成为使用电子机制模拟神经系统各个部分的各种尝试的中心——这是生物学、心理学和工程学领域的一项运动，受到维纳和其他跨学科控制论领域工作的启发。利克莱德是被这种范式吸引的研究人员之一，他并不是因为想要制造一种新型机器，而是出于对模拟人类大脑活动的新方法的需求。这种需求受到控制论的启发，同时扩展到工程学和生理学。计算机是利克莱德最不关心的事情——直到他的人类感知机制理论模型失控。

      </font></font><p>到了 20 世纪 50 年代末，利克莱德开始尝试建立大脑处理声音感知机制的数学和电子模型。控制论研究早期的兴奋部分来自于研究生物体机械模型的前景，这有助于创建这些生物体运作方式的理论模型，反之亦然。利克莱德认为，他可能对音调感知的复杂神经模型有了一个好主意，但很快令他沮丧的是，他的数学模型变得过于复杂，无法在合理的时间内手工计算出来，即使使用当时可用的模拟计算机也无法实现。在数学模型得到解决之前，建立音调感知的机械模型是毫无希望的。</p><p>By the late 1950s, Licklider was trying to build mathematical and electronic models of the mechanisms the brain uses to process the perception of sounds. Part of the excitement generated during the early days of cybernetic research came from the prospect of studying mechanical models of living organisms to help create theoretical models of the way those organisms function, and vice-versa. Licklider thought he might be onto a good idea with an intricate neural model of pitch perception, but quickly learned, to his dismay, that his mathematical model had grown too complex to work out by hand in a reasonable length of time, even using the analog computers that were then available. And until the mathematical model could be worked out, there was no hope of building a mechanical model of pitch perception.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">建立数学或电子模型的目的是<i>简化</i>理解大脑复杂性的任务，比如绘制图表来查看数据集合中的关键关系。但现在模型本身开始变得难以控制的复杂。就像二十年前莫奇利处理气象数据一样，利克莱德发现他花越来越多的时间处理创建模型所需的计算，这让他没有时间做他认为的主要工作——思考所有这些信息意味着什么。在</font>这些数字和图表之下是他真正的目标——人类交流的理论基础。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The idea of building a mathematical or electronic model was meant to <i>simplify</i> the task of understanding the complexities of the brain, like plotting a graph to see the key relationships in a collection of data. But the models themselves now began to grow unmanageably complex. Like Mauchly with his meteorological data, twenty years before, Licklider found he was spending more and more of his time dealing with the calculations he needed to do to create his models, which left less time for what he considered to be his primary occupation -- thinking about what all that information meant.</font> Beneath those numbers and graphs was his real objective -- the theoretical underpinnings of human communication.</p>

      <p>尽管他主要对大脑如何处理听觉信息感兴趣，但他觉得自己大部分时间都花在了将信息存入文件或从文件中取出信息，以及管理构建他心中的模型所需的越来越多的数字数据上。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">出于好奇，他想知道他的同事是否有人研究过科研人员是如何利用时间的。</font></p><p>Although he was primarily interested in how the brain processes auditory information, he felt that he was spending most of his time putting things into files or taking them out, as well as managing the increasing amounts of numerical data he needed to construct the models he had in mind. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Out of curiosity, he wondered if any of his colleagues had looked into the way scientific researchers spent their time.</font></p>

      <p>当利克莱德找不到任何像他一样的信息混编研究人员的时间和动作研究时，他决定在正常工作日中记录自己的活动。“尽管我意识到采样的不足，”他后来以同事中众所周知的谦虚写道，“但我还是把自己当成了自己的研究对象。”</p><p>When he couldn't find any time-and-motion studies of information-shuffling researchers like himself, Licklider decided to keep track of his own activities as he went through his normal working day. "Although I was aware of the inadequacy of the sampling," he later wrote, with the modesty that he is known for among his colleagues, "I served as my own subject."</p>

      <p>没过多久，我就发现，即使不记录自己的行为，他的主要工作也是记录其他一切。对于像他一样有自尊心的科学家来说，这一定令人震惊，但<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他的观察表明，他大约 85% 的“思考”时间实际上是“进入思考、做出决定、学习我需要知道的东西的状态。花在寻找或获取信息上的时间比消化信息上的时间多得多。</font> ”</p><p>It didn't take long to discover that his main occupation, even when he wasn't keeping records of his behavior, was centered on keeping records of everything else. Astonishing as it must have seemed to any self-respecting scientist like himself, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">his observations revealed that about 85% of his "thinking" time was actually spent "getting into a position to think, to make a decision, to learn something I needed to know. Much more time went into finding or obtaining information than into digesting it.</font>"</p>

      <p>和几乎所有其他实验者一样，他无法理解心理声学数据，除非他能看到这些数据被转换成图表的形式。绘制图表需要几天时间。甚至教他的助手如何绘制图表也需要几个小时。一旦图表完成，他就能查看它们，他所寻找的关系就立刻显现出来了。花几天时间绘制图表，而解读图表只需要几秒钟，这是非常低效和乏味的。</p><p>Like almost any other experimentalist, he couldn't begin to make sense of psychoacoustic data until he could see it translated into the form of graphs. Plotting the graphs took days. Even teaching his assistants how to plot graphs took hours. As soon as the graphs were finished and he was able to look at them, the relationships he was seeking became immediately obvious. It was grossly inefficient and tedious to spend days plotting graphs that took seconds to interpret.</p>

      <p>虽然利克莱德一直认为解释和评估是他作为一名科学家最重要的职能，但<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">利克莱德对他的研究行为的分析表明，他的大部分任务都是文书性或机械性的：</font> “搜索、计算、策划、确定一组假设或假说的逻辑或动态后果，为决策或洞察做好准备。此外，我尝试或不尝试什么的选择在很大程度上取决于文书可行性，而不是智力能力。”</p><p>While he had always thought of interpretation and evaluation as his most important function as a scientist, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Licklider's analysis of his research behavior showed that most of his tasks were clerical or mechanical:</font> "searching, calculating, plotting, determining the logical or dynamic consequences of a set of assumptions or hypotheses, preparing the way for a decision or an insight. Moreover, my choices of what to attempt or not to attempt were determined to an embarrassingly great extent by considerations of clerical feasibility, not intellectual capacity."</p>

      <p>他得出的结论，虽然今天听起来并不那么激进，但在 1957 年他想到的时候还是令人震惊的。一个不那么谦虚的人可能无法让自己面对这个结论：<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">利克莱德根据非正式的自学决定，任何技术思想家所花费时间的大部分任务都可以由机器更有效地完成。</font></p><p>The conclusion he reached, while it doesn't sound so radical today, was shocking when it occurred to him in 1957. A less modest man might not have been able to bring himself to face the conclusion: <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Licklider decided, on the basis of his informal self-study, that most of the tasks that take up the time of any technical thinker would be performed more effectively by machines.</font></p>

      <p>当时，还有一两个人也产生了这种想法——尤其是加州的<a href="#OEBPS/Text/9.html">道格·恩格尔巴特 (Doug Engelbart)</a>。但由于利克莱德在 20 世纪 50 年代参与了麻省理工学院的某些军方资助的研究项目，他与其他梦想将计算机转变为某种思维放大工具的人之间存在着重要区别。这一关键区别在于，利克莱德得出<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">这一结论不久后，情况就使他成为唯一能够资助一项全新技术创造的机构的权力中心。</font></p><p>This was a thought that was occurring to one or two other people at about the same time -- notably <a href="#OEBPS/Text/9.html">Doug Engelbart</a>, out in California. But because of his association with certain military-sponsored research projects at MIT in the 1950s, there was an important difference between Licklider and the others who dreamed of converting computers into some kind of mind-amplifying tool. This crucial difference was the fact that <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Licklider had reached his conclusion not long before circumstances put him at the center of power in the one institution capable of sponsoring the creation of an entire new technology.</font></p>

      <p>在计算机技术发展史上的那个阶段——在此之前，利克莱德只是间接涉足该领域——没有一位受人尊敬的计算机科学家敢于建议彻底改造计算机技术，以便科学家可以使用这些机器来帮助跟踪数据并建立他们正在研究的现象的理论模型。对于那些大胆提出这种建议的人——尤其是当时正在创立人工智能领域的麻省理工学院年轻的计算机异军突起者——这个想法可能看起来太明显、太琐碎，不值得追求。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">无论如何，人工智能的创始人更感兴趣的是取代科学家，而不是科学家的档案管理员。</font>然而，利克莱德既不是受人尊敬的计算机科学家，也不是计算机异军突起者，而是一位在电子学方面有一定专长的心理学家。和其他任何有能力的研究人员一样，他跟随数据的指引。</p><p>At that point in the history of computer technology -- a field in which Licklider had been only tangentially involved until then -- no respectable computer scientist would dare suggest that computer technology ought to be totally revamped so that scientists could use these machines to help keep track of data and build theoretical models of the phenomena they were studying. To those who were wild enough to make such a suggestion -- especially the young MIT computer mavericks who were founding the field of artificial intelligence around that time -- the idea might have seemed too obvious and too trivial to pursue. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">In any case, the AI founders were more interested in replacing the scientist than the scientist's file clerk.</font> Licklider, however, was neither a respectable computer scientist nor a computer maverick, but a psychologist with some expertise in electronics. And like any other competent investigator, he followed where the data led him.</p>

      <p>20 世纪 50 年代末，利克莱德在数字计算机设计方面并没有真正的专业知识，尽管他知道只有计算机才能满足他的需求，但他认为当时可用的计算机类型以及它们所做的事情不适合构建某种“电子文件管理员”。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他知道<i>数据处理</i>不是他想要的。</font></p><p>In the late 1950s, Licklider had no real expertise in digital computer design, and although he knew that only a computer could give him what he needed, he didn't think that the kinds of computers then available, and the kinds of things they did, were suitable for building a sort of "electronic file clerk." <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">He knew that <i>data processing</i> wasn't what he wanted.</font></p>

      <p>如果您是人口普查办公室，掌握着数亿人的信息，出于某种疯狂的原因，您想要知道阳光地带农场里有多少 60 岁以上的离婚人士，您可以使用 UNIVAC 进行分类和计算，以了解您想知道的信息。这就是数据处理。如果您每隔一个星期五要计算 10,000 名员工的工资单，需要将时间表转换为分类账中的条目并打印所有支票 - 数据处理能力正是您可以从当地 IBM 代表那里购买的。</p><p>If you were the Census Office, overflowing with information on a couple of hundred million people, and for some crazy reason you wanted to find out how many divorced people over sixty lived on farms in the sun belt, you could use a UNIVAC to perform the sorting and calculating needed to tell you what you wanted to know. That was data processing. If you had a payroll for 10,000 employees to calculate every other Friday and needed to transform time sheets into entries in a ledger and print up all the checks -- data processing power was just what you could buy from your local IBM representative.</p>

      <p>数据处理涉及对计算机功能和处理方式的某些限制。工资单、数学计算和人口普查数据是适当的任务类型，而一种称为“批处理”的神秘过程是执行这些任务的<i>适当</i><i>方式</i>。如果您要解决问题，则必须对程序和程序要操作的数据进行编码，通常使用两种主要计算机语言之一 - FORTRAN 和 COBOL。编码后的程序和数据被转换成装满众所周知的“IBM 卡”的盒子 - 您不能将其卷起、折叠或损坏。这些卡片被送到校园“计算机中心”或公司“数据处理中心”的系统管理员那里。这位专家是唯一被允许将程序提交给机器的人，也是您在几小时或几天后从他那里取回打印输出的人。</p><p>Data processing involved certain constraints on <i>what</i> could be done with computers, and constraints on <i>how</i> one went about doing these things.. Payrolls, mathematical calculations, and census data were the proper kinds of tasks An arcane process known as "batch processing" was the proper way to do these things. If you had a problem to solve, you had to encode your program and the data that the program was meant to operate upon, usually in one of the two major computer languages -- FORTRAN and COBOL. The encoded program and data were converted into boxes full of what had become universally known as "IBM cards" -- the kind you weren't supposed to spindle, fold, or mutilate. The cards were delivered to a systems administrator at the campus "computer center" or the corporate "data processing center." This specialist was the only one allowed to submit the program to the machine, and the person from whom you would retrieve your printout hours or days later.</p>

      <p>但是，如果你想在一条线上绘制一万个点，或者将一串数字变成飞机机翼上气流模式的图形模型，你就不会需要数据处理或批处理。你需要<i>建模</i>——这是飞机设计师开创的一种奇特的新计算机用途。利克莱德最初寻求的只是一个机械仆人来处理模型构建过程中的文书和计算工作。然而不久之后，他开始怀疑计算机是否可以帮助<i>制定</i>模型并进行计算。</p><p>But if you wanted to plot ten thousand points on a line, or turn a list of numbers into a graphic model of airflow patterns over an airplane wing, you wouldn't want data processing or batch processing. You would want <i>modelling</i> -- an exotic new use for computers that the aircraft designers were pioneering. All Licklider sought, at first, was a mechanical servant to take care of the clerical and calculating work that accompanied model building. Not long after, however, he began to wonder if computers could help <i>formulate</i> models as well as calculate them.</p>

      <p>同年晚些时候，获得终身教职后，利克莱德决定加入剑桥附近的一家名为 Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman 的咨询公司。他们为他提供了继续进行心理声学研究的机会，以及学习数字计算机的机会。</p><p>When he attained tenure, later that same year, Licklider decided to join a consulting firm near Cambridge named Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman. They offered him an opportunity to pursue his psychoacoustic research -- and a chance to learn about digital computers.</p>

      <p>“BB&amp;N 拥有数字设备公司制造的第一台机器 PDP-1，”利克莱德在 1983 年回忆道。这台价值 25 万美元的机器是后来被称为“小型计算机”的一系列机器中的第一台，这种计算机在 60 年代中期被称为“小型计算机”。这些新的、更小、功能更强大的计算机并不花费数百万美元，也不占用大部分房间，而是只花费数十万美元，占用的空间与几台冰箱差不多。但它们仍然需要专家来操作。因此，利克莱德聘请了一位研究助理，一位对计算机了如指掌的大学辍学生，一位名叫埃德·弗雷德金的非常有能力的年轻人，他后来成为人工智能研究领域的一股力量——他是众多非常有能力的年轻人中的第一个，他们被利克莱德的十字军东征所吸引，以制造一种新型计算机并创造一种新的计算方式。</p><p>"BB&amp;N had the first machine that Digital Equipment Company made, the PDP-1," Licklider recalled in 1983. The quarter-million-dollar machine was the first of a continuing line of what came to be called, in the style of the midsixties, "minicomputers." Instead of costing millions of dollars and occupying most of a room, these new, smaller, powerful computers only cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and took up about the same amount of space as a couple of refrigerators. But they still required experts to operate them. Licklider therefore hired a research assistant, a college dropout who was knowledgeable about computers, an exceptionally capable young fellow by the name of Ed Fredkin, who was later to become a force in artificial intelligence research -- the first of many exceptionally capable young fellows who would be drawn to Licklider's crusade to build a new kind of computer and create a new style of computing.</p>

      <p>Fredkin 和 BB&amp;N 的其他人设置了 PDP-1，以便 Licklider 可以直接与其交互。不再需要花几天时间通过一盒盒打孔卡进行编程，而是可以通过高速纸带将程序和数据输入到机器中；还可以<i>在程序运行时</i>更改纸带输入。操作员首次可以与机器<i>交互</i>。（这种交互的可能性得到了其他一些人的充分关注，这些人后来成为计算机历史上有影响力的人物。麻省理工学院的另外几位年轻计算机专家，John McCarthy 和 Marvin Minsky，也在以计算机通常不常用的方式使用 PDP-1。）</p><p>Fredkin and others at BB&amp;N had the PDP-1 set up so that Licklider could directly interact with it. Instead of programming via boxes of punched cards over a period of days, it became possible to feed the programs and data to the machine via a high-speed paper tape; it was also possible to change the paper tape input <i>while the program was running</i>. The operator could <i>interact</i> with the machine for the first time. (The possibility of this kind of interaction was duly noted by a few other people who turned out to be influential figures in computer history. A couple of other young computerists at MIT, John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky, were also using a PDP-1 in ways computers weren't usually used.)</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">与今天的计算机相比，PDP-1 还很原始，但在 1960 年却是一个突破。它就是利克莱德最初设想的模型构建器。这种快速、廉价、交互式的计算机开始变得像他在麻省理工学院心理声学实验室时梦想的那种设备</font>，当时他第一次意识到，他的理论化能力似乎总是受到从数据中绘制图表所花费精力的限制。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The PDP-1 was primitive in comparison with today's computers, but it was a breakthrough in 1960. Here was the model builder that Licklider had first envisioned. This fast, inexpensive, interactive computer was beginning to resemble the kind of device he dreamed about back in his psychoacoustic lab at MIT</font> , when he first realized how his ability to theorize always seemed constrained by the effort it took to draw graphs from data.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">“我想你可以说我经历了某种宗教转变，”</font>利克莱德承认，他还记得 25 年前拿到第一台交互式计算机时的感受。正如他所料，计算机确实可以帮助他根据实验数据建立模型，并理解任何复杂的信息集合。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"I guess you could say I had a kind of religious conversion,"</font> Licklider admits, remembering how it felt, a quarter of a century ago, to get his hands on his first interactive computer. As he had suspected, it was indeed possible to use computers to help build models from experimental data and to make sense of any complicated collection of information.</p>

      <p>后来他发现，尽管计算机是他建立模型所需要的合适<i>机器</i>，但即使是 PDP-1 也对他想要研究的现象来说过于粗糙。自然界对于 1960 年代的计算机来说太复杂了。他需要更多的内存组件和更快的大量计算处理速度。当他开始思考计算机和大脑各自的优势和不足时，他意识到<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他所寻求的是一种替代当时存在的人机关系的方法。</font></p><p>Then he learned that although the computer was the right <i>kind</i> of machine he needed to build his models, even the PDP-1 was hopelessly crude for the phenomena he wanted to study. Nature was far too complicated for 1960-style computers. He needed more memory components and faster processing of large amounts of calculations. As he began to think about the respective strengths and deficiencies of computers and brains, it occurred to him that <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">what he was seeking was an alternative to the human-computer relationship as it then existed.</font></p>

      <p>自 1956 年夏天在达特茅斯会面确定该领域以来，利克莱德在麻省理工学院认识的几位年轻的计算机和通信科学家一直在谈论一个模糊而遥远的未来，即机器将超越人类智能。利克莱德更关心计算机与人类关系的短期潜力。即使在一开始，他就意识到各种技术思想家都开始遇到他在 1957 年开始注意到的问题。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">让人工智能研究员们去担心如何制造下棋或语言翻译机器吧。他和许多其他人需要的是一个智能助手。</font></p><p>Since the summer of 1956, when they met at Dartmouth to define the field, several young computer and communication scientists Licklider knew from MIT had been talking about a vaguely distant future when machines would surpass human intelligence. Licklider was more concerned with the shorter-term potential of computer-human relations. Even at the beginning, he realized that technical thinkers of every kind were starting to run up against the problems he had started noticing in 1957. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Let the AI fellows worry about ways to build chess-playing or language translating machines. What he and a lot of other people needed was an intelligent assistant.</font></p>

      <p>尽管利克莱德坚信自己“虔诚地皈依互动计算”——这句话被随后参加活动的人们反复使用——但他对计算机技术的经济性仍然知之甚少，无法想象如何真正构建一个智能实验室助理。尽管他不知道计算机如何或何时才能变得足够强大和便宜，以充当“思考工具”，但他开始意识到，如果通用计算机能够以人类能够直接与之交互的方式进行设置，那么它可能会演变成与 20 世纪 50 年代的数据处理器和数字计算器完全不同的东西。尽管创建个人工具的可能性在经济上似乎仍然不可行，但对图书馆等社区资源进行现代化改造的想法开始吸引他。他对万尼瓦尔·布什 (Vannevar Bush) 在 1945 年提出的想法感到兴奋，即一种适应世界新知识体系的新型图书馆的概念。</p><p>Although he was convinced by his "religious conversion to interactive computing" -- a phrase that has been used over and over again by those who participated in the events that followed -- Licklider still knew too little about the economics of computer technology to see how it might become possible to actually construct an intelligent laboratory assistant. Although he didn't know how or when computers would become powerful enough and cheap enough to serve as "thinking tools," he began to realize that the general-purpose computer, if it was set up in such a way that humans could interact with it directly, could evolve into something entirely different from the data processors and number crunchers of the 1950s. Although the possibility of creating a personal tool still seemed economically infeasible, the idea of modernizing a community-based resource, like a library, began to appeal to him. He got fired up about the idea Vannevar Bush had mentioned in 1945, the concept of a new kind of library to fit the world's new knowledge system.</p>

      <p>“PDP-1 让我想到了未来人和机器如何运作，”利克莱德在 1983 年回忆道，“但我从未想过，让每个人都拥有自己的计算机在经济上是可行的。”<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他确实想到，这些新计算机是万尼瓦尔·布什 (Vannevar Bush) 预言的超级机械化图书馆的绝佳候选者。1959 年，他写了一本名为《<i>未来的图书馆》的</i>书，描述了基于计算机的系统如何创造一种新型的“思考中心”。</font></p><p>"The PDP-1 opened me up to ideas about how people and machines like this might operate in the future," Licklider recalled in 1983, "but I never dreamed at first that it would ever become economically feasible to give everybody their own computer." <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">It did occur to him that these new computers were excellent candidates for the super-mechanized libraries that Vannevar Bush had prophesied. In 1959, he wrote a book entitled <i>Libraries of the Future</i>, describing how a computer-based system might create a new kind of "thinking center."</font></p>

      <p>他在书中首次描述的计算机化图书馆并不涉及任何奢侈的事情，比如给每个使用它的人提供整台计算机。相反，他描述了一种设置，技术细节留待未来，通过这种设置，不同的人可以同时使用中央计算机的远程扩展。</p><p>The computerized library as he first described it in his book did not involve anything as extravagant as giving an entire computer to every person who used it. Instead he described a setup, the technical details of which he left to the future, by which different humans could use remote extensions of a central computer, all at the same time.</p>

      <p>在他写完这本书之后，在后人造卫星时代开始的令人振奋的研究加速过程中，利克莱德发现了他和其他接近电子学发展的人所称的“二元法则”：其最重要部件的不断小型化意味着计算机硬件的成本效益每两年翻一番。这在 1950 年是真的，在 1960 年也是如此，甚至超出了晶体管革命者最疯狂的想象，在 1980 年也是如此。关于这一现象如何推动过去三十年电子革命的书籍和文章已经很少。看起来它将持续运作至少到 1990 年，那时个人负担得起的计算机将比ENIAC 强大数百万倍<i>。</i></p><p>After he wrote the book, during the exhilarating acceleration of research that began in the post-Sputnik era, Licklider discovered what he and others who were close to developments in electronics came to call "the rule of two": Continuing miniaturization of its most important components means that the cost effectiveness of computer hardware doubles every two years. It was true in 1950 and it held true in 1960, and beyond even the wildest imaginings of the transistor revolutionaries, it was still true in 1980. A small library of books and articles have been written about the ways this phenomenon has fueled the electronics revolution of the past three decades. It looks like it will continue to operate until at least 1990, when personally affordable computers will be <i>millions</i> of times more powerful than ENIAC.</p>

      <p>利克莱德开始思考是否有可能设计出比计算机图书馆更具革命性的东西。当他开始意识到这种持续的指数增长速度将使计算机在 15 年内以十分之一的成本实现比 PDP-1 强大一百倍的功能时，利克莱德开始思考一个既包含计算机的电子能力又包含人类操作员的大脑皮层能力的系统。操作员和 PDP-1 之间的粗略交互可能只是一种强大的新型人机合作的开始。</p><p>Licklider then started to wonder about the possibility of devising something far more revolutionary that even a computerized library. When it began to dawn on him that this relentlessly exponential rate of growth would make computers over a hundred times as powerful as the PDP-1 at one tenth the cost within fifteen years, Licklider began to think about a system that included both the electronic powers of the computer and the cortical powers of the human operator. The crude interaction between the operator and the PDP-1 might be just the beginning of a powerful new kind of human-computer partnership.</p>

      <p>在实现这种更高层次的人机交互之前，必须开发出一种新型计算机。人们操作机器的方式必须改变，机器本身也必须变得更快、更强大。尽管利克莱德在数字计算机设计方面仍是新手，但他对真空管电路很熟悉，而且在“人为因素工程”这一混合学科方面也算是专家，他认识到，他想要的机械助手需要具备一些功能，而这些功能只有在他预见到的不久的将来的超快计算机中才能实现。</p><p>A new kind of computer would have to evolve before this higher level of human-machine interaction could be possible. The way the machine was operated by people would have to change, and the machine itself would have to become much faster and more powerful. Although he was still a novice in digital computer design, Licklider was familiar with vacuum tube circuitry and enough of an expert in the hybrid discipline of "human factors engineering" to recognize that the mechanical assistant he wanted would need capabilities that would be possible only with the ultrafast computers he foresaw in the near future.</p>

      <p>当他开始将自己在人类因素研究中使用的方法应用到像他这样的技术思想家的信息和交流活动中时，利克莱德发现自己被一种更具动态性、更具对话性、更有助于<i>制定</i>和<i>绘制模型</i><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">的计算理念所吸引</font>。1960 年，利克莱德提出了一种新型计算机的规格以及操作它们时使用的一种新思维模式，而这一规格在 25 年后仍未完全实现：<i></i><i></i></p><p>When he began applying the methods he had been using in human factors research to the informational and communication activities of technical thinkers like himself, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Licklider found himself drawn to the idea of a kind of computation that was more dynamic, more of a dialogue</font> , more of an aid in <i>formulating</i> as well as <i>plotting</i> models. Licklider set forth in 1960 the specifications for a new species of computer and a new mode of thinking to be used when operating them, a specification that is still not fully realized, a quarter of a century later:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">信息处理设备会将假设转换成可测试的模型，然后根据数据（当计算机将数据提交给操作员批准时，操作员可以粗略地指定并确定相关数据）测试这些模型。设备将回答问题。它将模拟机制和模型，执行程序，并向操作员显示结果。它将转换数据，绘制图表（以操作员指定的任何方式“切蛋糕”，如果操作员不确定自己想要什么，则以几种替代方式）。设备将进行内插、外推和转换。它将静态方程或逻辑语句转换为动态模型，以便操作员可以检查其行为。一般来说，它将执行可例行的文书操作，填补决策之间的间隔。</font>

        <p><font size="-1">此外，只要有足够的基础支持正式的统计分析，计算机将充当统计推断、决策理论或博弈论机器，对建议的行动方案进行初步评估。最后，它将尽可能多地进行诊断、模式匹配和相关性识别，但它将接受这些领域明显的次要地位。</font></p><p><font size="-1">In addition, the computer will serve as a statistical-inference, decision-theory, or game-theory machine to make elementary evaluations of suggested courses of action whenever there is enough basis to support a formal statistical analysis. Finally, it will do as much diagnosis, pattern matching, and relevance recognizing as it profitably can, but it will accept a clearly secondary status in those areas.</font></p>
      

      <p>20 世纪 50 年代首次研究使用计算设备协助人类控制复杂系统，这直接源于对新型防空指挥控制系统的需求。利克莱德作为人为因素专家，曾参与规划这些早期的防空通信系统。和其他几个和他一样早早意识到这一点的人一样，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他意识到管理复杂性是 20 世纪余下时间及以后需要解决的主要问题。机器必须帮助我们跟踪保持全球文明生存和发展的复杂问题。而人类将需要新方法来解决我们继续生存和发展所带来的重大问题。</font></p><p>The first research in the 1950s into the use of computing equipment for assisting human control of complex systems was a direct result of the need for a new kind of air defense command-and-control system. Licklider, as a human factors expert, had been involved in planning these early air defense communication systems. Like the few others who saw this point as early as he did, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">he realized that the management of complexity was the main problem to be solved during the rest of the twentieth century and beyond. Machines would have to help us keep track of the complications of keeping global civilization alive and growing. And humans were going to need new ways of attacking the big problems that would result form our continued existence and growth.</font></p>

      <p>假设生存和可容忍的生存质量是所有理智、智能生物（无论它们是生物还是技术物种）的最基本需求，利克莱德想知道，对于人类和人类创造的符号处理实体来说，这个星球上的最佳安排可能既不是主奴关系，也不是竞争对手之间不稳定的休战，而是一种<i>伙伴关系</i>。</p><p>Assuming that survival and a tolerable quality of existence are the most fundamental needs for all sane, intelligent organisms, whether they are of the biological or technological variety, Licklider wondered if the best arrangement for both the human and the human-created symbol-processing entities on this planet might not turn out to be neither a master-slave relationship nor an uneasy truce between competitors, but a <i>partnership</i>.</p>

      <p>然后，他在大自然中找到了完美的隐喻，可以形容他在 1957-1958 年“皈依”交互式计算期间以及在 1958-1960 年与小型计算机的接触中预见的未来能力，这些接触让他的思绪漫游于未来的信息生态中。这个新发现的隐喻向他展示了如何将他的计算机经验应用于他对技术思想家如何利用时间的谦虚发现。由此产生的想法发展成为一个大胆而巨大的理论，如果它被证明是正确的，它不仅会改变人类历史，还会改变人类进化。</p><p>Then he found the perfect metaphor in nature for the future capabilities he had foreseen during his 1957-1958 "religious conversion" to interactive computing and during those 1958-1960 minicomputer encounters that set his mind wandering through the informational ecology of the future. The newfound metaphor showed him how to apply his computer experience to his modest discovery about how technical thinkers spend their time. The idea that resulted grew into a theory so bold and immense that it would alter not only human history but human evolution, if it proved to be true.</p>

      <p>1960 年，利克莱德在一篇论文中讨论了机器如何帮助制定和构建理论模型，同时还提出了人机关系的概念，后来这一概念被他所倡导：</p><p>In 1960, in the same paper in which he talked about machines that would help formulate as well as help construct theoretical models, Licklider also set forth the concept of the kind of human-computer relationship that he was later to be instrumental in initiating:</p>

      
        <font size="-1"><i>无花果树仅靠昆虫Blastophaga grossorum</i>授粉。昆虫的幼虫生活在无花果树的卵巢中，并从那里获取食物。因此，树木和昆虫相互依赖性很强：没有昆虫，树木就无法繁殖；没有树木，昆虫就无法进食；它们共同构成了不仅可行而且富有成效和蓬勃发展的伙伴关系。这种“两个不同生物以亲密关系甚至紧密结合的方式共同生活”的合作被称为共生。</font>

      <font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">实现这种合作关系需要克服的问题，一部分在于制造更好的计算机，另一部分在于学习思维如何与信息互动。最重要的问题可能不是关于大脑或技术，而是关于它们如何结合。

      </font></font><p>利克莱德预见到计算机将被用作制造更好计算机的工具，他得出结论，1960 年将开始一个过渡阶段，人类将开始制造能够学习与我们交流的机器，这些机器最终将帮助我们更有效、甚至更深入地相互交流。</p><p>Licklider, foreseeing the use of computers as tools to build better computers, concluded that 1960 would begin a transitional phase in which we humans would begin to build machines capable of learning to communicate with us, machines that would eventually help us to communicate more effectively, and perhaps more profoundly, with one another.</p>

      <p>此时，他已经偏离了心理声学研究的轨道，开始被制造设备的前景所吸引，他最初设想的设备是用来帮助他理解实验室数据的工具。就像巴贝奇需要一种方法来制作准确的对数表，戈德斯坦想要更好的射击表，图灵想要一种完美确定的方法来解决数学和密码学问题一样，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">利克莱德开始远离他以前的目标，因为他沉浸在创造他需要的工具的兴奋之中。</font></p><p>By this time, he had strayed far enough off the course of his psychoacoustic research to be seduced by the prospect of building the device he first envisioned as a tool to help him make sense of his laboratory data. Like Babbage who needed a way to produce accurate logarithm tables, or Goldstine, who wanted better firing tables, or Turing, who wanted a perfectly definite way to solve mathematical and cryptological problems, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Licklider began to move away from his former goals as he got caught up in the excitement of creating tools he needed.</font></p>

      <p>但利克莱德并不是像巴贝奇那样的天文学家和修补匠，也不是像戈德斯坦那样的弹道学家，更不是像图灵那样的数学家和密码破译员，而是一位拥有一些电子实践经验的实验心理学家。他原本打算建立一个小型模型，用于模拟人类意识的一部分——音调感知，但最终梦想着能够帮助他思考模型的机器。</p><p>Except Licklider wasn't an astronomer and tinkerer like Babbage, a ballistician like Goldstine, or a mathematician and code-breaker like Turing, but an experimental psychologist with some practical electronic experience. He had set out to build a small model of one part of human awareness -- pitch perception -- and ended up dreaming about machines that could help him think about models.</p>

      <p>正如他之前和之后的其他软件梦想家所熟知的那样，利克莱德的愿景虽然宏伟，但本身并不足以确保现实世界中会发生任何事情。实验心理学家，即使是麻省理工学院的教授，也很难带领大批计算机工程师走向互动的未来。就像冯·诺依曼和戈德斯坦在阿伯丁火车站台上相遇，或者莫奇利和埃克特在摩尔学院的电子课上相遇一样，利克莱德在偶然的情况下遇到了自己的命运，因为他曾在一个名为“林肯实验室”的地方工作过，这是麻省理工学院的绝密国防研究机构，他在信息处理历史的关键过渡时期担任顾问。</p><p>As other software visionaries before and after him knew very well, Licklider's vision, as grandiose as it might have been, wasn't enough in itself to ensure that anything would ever happen in the real world. An experimental psychologist, even an MIT professor, is hardly in a position to set armies of computer engineers marching toward an interactive future. Like von Neumann and Goldstine meeting on the railroad platform at Aberdeen, or Mauchly and Eckert encountering each other in an electronics class at the Moore School, Licklider happened upon his destiny through accidental circumstances, because of the time he spent at a place called "Lincoln Laboratory," an MIT facility for top-secret defense research, where he was a consultant during a critical transition period in the history of information processing.</p>

      <p>正是由于利克莱德在人机交互心理学方面的专业知识，他才得以实现自己的梦想。20 世纪 50 年代初期和中期，麻省理工学院和 IBM 参与建造了有史以来最大的计算机 IBM AN/FSQ-7，作为美国全新大陆防空系统的控制中心。SAGE（半自动地面环境）是美国空军针对潜在核轰炸机袭击这一新问题的解决方案。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">这些计算机重达 300 吨，占地 2 万英尺，每台计算机由 18 辆大型货车运送。最终，空军购买了 56 台。</font></p><p>It was his expertise in the psychology of human-machine interaction that led Licklider to a position where he could make big things out of his dreams. In the early and mid 1950s, MIT and IBM were involved in building what were to be the largest computers ever built, the IBM AN/FSQ-7, as the control centers of a whole new continental air defense system for the United States. SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment) was the Air Force's answer to the new problem of potential nuclear bomber attack. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The computers weighed three hundred tons, took up twenty thousand feet of floor space, and were delivered in eighteen large vans apiece. Ultimately, the Air Force bought fifty-six of them.</font></p>

      <p>麻省理工学院在马萨诸塞州列克星敦设立了林肯实验室，以设计 SAGE。在大陆的另一端，位于圣莫尼卡（航空工业中心）的系统开发公司成立，为 SAGE 开发软件。该项目遇到的一些最棘手的问题与设计方法有关，即以人可读的形式提供大量信息，速度要足够快，以便人类能够快速对这些信息做出决策。在防空司令部决定是否正在进行空袭之前，您的计算机不可能花三天时间评估所有雷达和无线电传输的数据。</p><p>MIT set up Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, Massachusetts, to design SAGE. At the other end of the continent, System Development Corporation in Santa Monica (the center of the aircraft industry) was founded to create software for SAGE. Some of the thorniest problems that were encountered on this project had to do with devising ways to make large amounts of information available in human-readable form, quickly enough for humans to make fast decisions about that information. It just wouldn't do for your computers to take three days to evaluate all the radar and radio-transmitted data before the Air Defense Command could decide whether or not an air attack was underway.</p>

      <p>这些问题的一些答案是在麻省理工学院计算中心的“旋风”项目中提出的，该项目将高速计算与类似飞机控制的计算机控制相结合。其他答案来自人类感知专家（如利克莱德），他们设计了计算机向人们呈现信息的新方法。除了早期旋风项目的少数工作人员外，SAGE 操作员是第一批能够在视觉显示屏上看到信息的计算机用户；此外，操作员能够使用称为“光笔”的设备通过触摸屏幕来改变图形显示。系统甚至内置了一种原始的决策能力：计算机可以根据其发展情况的模型建议替代行动方案。</p><p>Some of the answers to these problems were formulated in the "Whirlwind" project at the MIT computing center, where high-speed calculations were combined with computer controls that resembled aircraft controls. Other answers came from specialists in human perception (like Licklider), who devised new ways for computers to present information to people. With the exception of the small crew of the earlier Whirlwind project, SAGE operators were the first computer users who were able to see information on visual display screens; moreover, operators were able to use devices called "lightpens" to alter the graphic displays by touching the screens. There was even a primitive decision-making capacity built into the system: the computer could suggest alternate courses of action, based on its model of the developing situation.</p>

      <p>显示屏问题开始从电子领域转向人类感知和认知领域，这也是利克莱德加入计算机制造商的契机。但早在林肯实验室于 1953-1954 年成立之前，利克莱德就曾被咨询过开发一种新技术的可能性，该技术用于向人类操作员显示计算机信息，以提高防空能力。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">毫无疑问，他未来关于人机共生的想法的种子是在他和当时被称为“演示小组”的其他成员考虑防空指挥中心需要哪种视觉显示时首次播下的。</font></p><p>The matter of display screens began to stray away from electronics and into the area of human perception and cognition which was Licklider's cue to join the computer builders. But even before Lincoln Laboratory was established in 1953-1954, Licklider had been consulted about the possibility of developing a new technology for displaying computer information to human operators for the purpose of improving air defense capabilities. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Undoubtedly, the seeds of his future ideas about human-computer symbiosis were first planted when he and other members of what was then called "the presentation group" considered the kinds of visual displays air defense command centers would need.</font></p>

      <p>在演讲小组，他第一次结识了麻省理工学院最杰出的计算机建造者之一韦斯利·克拉克。克拉克曾是 SAGE 项目之前最先进的计算机系统 Whirlwind 的主要设计师。Whirlwind 的目的是作为一种飞行模拟器，从许多方面来说，它是个人计算机的第一个硬件祖先，因为它被设计为由一名“试飞员”操作。它还用于模拟空气动力学方程。虽然 Whirlwind 只是 Licklider 所希望的那种勉强具有交互性，但它是第一台速度足够快的计算机，可以“实时”求解空气动力学方程——因为正在建模的事件实际上正在发生。实时计算不仅是设计高速喷气式飞机这一日益复杂的工作的实际需要；它还是创建火箭制导系统的必要先决条件，火箭是喷气式飞机的技术继承者。</p><p>The presentation group was where he first became acquainted with Wesley Clark, one of MIT's foremost computer builders. Clark had been a principle designer of Whirlwind, the most advanced computer system to precede the SAGE project. Whirlwind, the purpose of which was to act as a kind of flight simulator, was in many ways the first hardware ancestor of the personal computer, because it was designed to be operated by a single "test pilot." It was also used for modeling aerodynamic equations. While it was only barely interactive in the sense that Licklider desired, Whirlwind was the first computer fast enough to solve aerodynamic equations in "real time" -- as the event that was being modeled was actually happening. Real-time computation was not only a practical necessity for the increasingly complicated job of designing high-speed jet aircraft; it was a necessary prerequisite for creating the guidance systems of rockets, the technological successors to jet aircraft.</p>

      <p>讽刺的是，当 SAGE 于 1958 年全面投入使用时，整个地面防空轰炸机攻击的概念在 1957 年 10 月的一天被彻底淘汰，当时一颗名为“斯普特尼克”的奇怪小篮球发出哔哔声，让美国军事、科学和教育机构陷入了疯狂的行动之中。苏联人能够将炸弹送入轨道这一事实引发了历史上最密集的和平时期军事研究计划。当苏联人将尤里·加加林送入太空，重演了他们的胜利时，一个类似的动力也推动了美国载人航天事业走上了类似的道路。</p><p>Ironically, by the time SAGE became fully operational in 1958, the entire concept of ground-based air defense against bomber attack had been made obsolete on one shocking day in October, 1957, when a little beeping basketball by the odd name of "Sputnik" jolted the American military, scientific, and educational establishments into a frenzy of action. The fact that the Russians could put bombs in orbit set off the most intensive peacetime military research program in history. When the Soviets repeated their triumph by putting Yuri Gagarin into space, a parallel impetus started the U.S. manned space effort on a similar course.</p>

      <p>就像弹道计算的需求间接引发了通用数字计算机的发明一样，人造卫星的发射也开启了交互式计算机的发展，并最终直接导致了现在被称为个人计算机的设备。正如冯·诺依曼在 ENIAC 时代成为政治技术事件的中心一样，利克莱德在后来被称为“ARPA 时代”的时代中扮演了重要角色。</p><p>In the same way that the need for ballistics calculations indirectly triggered the invention of the general-purpose digital computer, the aftermath of Sputnik started the development of interactive computers, and eventually led directly to the devices now known as personal computers. Just as von Neumann found himself in the center of political-technological events in the ENIAC era, Licklider was drawn into a central role in what became known as "the ARPA era."</p>

      <p>“太空竞赛”导致美国国防研究机构发生彻底变革。最高层认为，阻碍太空相关研究步伐的因素之一是评估研究提案的陈旧、缓慢的方式，即提交给该领域知识渊博的科学家进行匿名审查（这种程序被称为“同行评审”，至今仍是研究资助机构的正统模式）。</p><p>The "space race" caused a radical shakeup in America's defense research bureaucracy. It was decided at the highest levels that one of the factors holding up the pace of space-related research was the old, slow way of evaluating research proposals by submitting them for anonymous review by knowledgeable scientists in the field (a ritual known as "peer review" that is still the orthodox model for research funding agencies).</p>

      <p>在越南战争前夕的美好岁月里，麦克纳马拉部长召集了来自智库、大学和工业界的新一代卡米洛特时代神童，他们决心利用后人造卫星恐慌的势头，将国防部的科技官僚机构带入太空时代。必须采取一些措施来简化对国家安全至关重要的领域的技术进步过程。NASA 就是答案之一，它从一个小型下属机构发展成为一个独立的官僚、科学和工程力量。国防部成立了高级研究计划局 (ARPA)。ARPA<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">的任务是寻找和资助那些有可能将美国国防相关技术提升几个数量级的大胆项目——通过让研究管理人员直接与研究人员联系，绕过同行评审过程。</font></p><p>The new generation of Camelot-era whiz kids from the think tanks, universities, and industry, assembled by Secretary McNamara in the rosier days before Vietnam, were determined to use the momentum of the post-Sputnik scare to bring the Defense Department's science and technology bureaucracy into the space age. Something had to be done to streamline the process of technological progress in fields vital to the national security. One answer was NASA, which grew from a tiny sub-agency to a bureaucratic, scientific, and engineering force of its own. And the Defense Department created the Advanced Research Projects Agency, ARPA. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">ARPA's mandate was to find and fund bold projects that had a chance of advancing America's defense-related technologies by orders of magnitude -- bypassing the peer review process by putting research administrators in direct contact with researchers.</font></p>

      <p>由于参与了之前的防空项目，利克莱德在林肯的几位朋友，如韦斯利·克拉克，也参与了向快速发展、前瞻性思维、资金充足、以结果为导向的 ARPA 工作方式的转变。克拉克在麻省理工学院和林肯设计了 TX-0 和 TX-2 计算机。第一台机器因成为“26 号楼”中“黑客”最喜欢的工具而闻名，这些黑客后来成为 MAC 项目的传奇核心。第二台机器专为高级图形显示研究而设计。</p><p>Because of their involvement with previous air defense projects, a few of Licklider's friends from Lincoln, like Wesley Clark, were involved in the changeover to the fast-moving, forward-thinking, well funded, results-oriented ARPA way of doing things. Clark designed the TX-0 and TX-2 computers at MIT and Lincoln. The first of these machines became famous as the favorite tool of the "hackers" in "building 26," who later became the legendary core of Project MAC. The second machine was designed expressly for advanced graphic display research.</p>

      <p>1960 年，图形显示器还是一种深奥的设备，只有某些实验室和国防设施才知道。除了 PDP-1，几乎每台计算机都通过电传打字机显示信息。但林肯周围流传着一个想法，即类似 SAGE 的显示器可能适用于多种类型的计算机，而不仅仅是用于监视防空系统的大型计算机。到 1961 年，图形显示器的心理学已成为利克莱德的专长。在 BB&amp;N 和林肯之间，他花在电气工程师身上的时间比花在心理学家身上的时间还多。</p><p>Graphic displays were esoteric devices in 1960, known only to certain laboratories and defense facilities. Aside from the PDP-1, almost every computer displayed information via a teletype machine. But there was an idea floating around Lincoln that SAGE-like displays might be adapted to many kinds of computers, not just the big ones used to monitor air defenses. By 1961, the psychology of graphic displays had become something of a specialty for Licklider. Between BB&amp;N and Lincoln, he was spending more time with electrical engineers than with psychologists.</p>

      <p>通过他的计算机专业同事，利克莱德结识了 20 世纪 60 年代初 ARPA 主任杰克·鲁伊纳。鲁伊纳希望在所有层面（不仅仅是防空）实现军事指挥和控制系统的计算机化，并希望在 ARPA 内部设立一个专门的办公室来开发新的信息处理技术。ARPA 的目标是通过资助实现根本性突破的尝试来超越传统的研究和开发。利克莱德的理念是创建一种能够通过键盘和显示屏界面直接与人类操作员交互的新型计算机（而不是依赖批处理甚至纸带输入），鲁伊纳相信利克莱德所说的少数计算机研究人员可能正是导致这种突破的因素。</p><p>Through his computer-oriented colleagues, Licklider became acquainted with Jack Ruina, director of ARPA in the early 1960s. Ruina wanted to do something about computerizing military command and control systems on all levels -- not just air defense -- and wanted to set up a special office within ARPA to develop new information processing techniques. ARPA's goal was to leapfrog over conventional research and development by funding attempts to make fundamental breakthroughs. And Licklider's notion of creating a new kind of computer capable of directly interacting with human operators via a keyboard and a display screen interface (instead of relying on batch processing or even paper-tape input) convinced Ruina that the minority of computer researchers Licklider was talking about might just lead to such a possible breakthrough.</p>

      <p>“我让杰克看到了交互式计算的重要性，它不仅与军事指挥和控制有关，而且与整个日常业务领域有关，”利克莱德回忆道。“因此，1962 年 10 月，我进入了五角大楼，成为信息处理技术办公室主任。”这一事件与那个时代的任何其他发展一样，标志着个人计算时代的开始。</p><p>"I got Jack to see the pertinence of interactive computing, not only to military command and control, but to the whole world of day-to-day business," Licklider recalls. "So, in October, 1962 I moved into the Pentagon and became the director of the Information Processing Techniques Office." And that event, as much as any other development of that era, marked the beginning of the age of personal computing.</p>

      <p>史无前例的技术革命始于人造卫星发射后的动员，并在十多年后尼尔·阿姆斯特朗首次踏上月球时达到高潮，而这在很大程度上是由计算机使用方式的革命促成的。太空时代最壮观的视觉表演是由巨大的火箭提供的。人类的故事集中在火箭顶部太空舱中的人们身上。但确保太空计划成功的无名英雄是由使用新型计算机的人们完成的。</p><p>The unprecedented technological revolution that began with the post-Sputnik mobilization and reached a climax with Neil Armstrong's first step on the moon a little more than a decade later was in a very large part made possible by a parallel revolution in the way computers were used. The most spectacular visual shows of the space age were provided by the enormous rockets. The human story was concentrated on the men in the capsules atop the rockets. But the unsung heroics that ensured the success of the space program were conducted by men using new kinds of computers.</p>

      <p>还记得任务控制中心的工作人员吗？他们在发射成功后欢呼雀跃，十九个小时后，当宇航员和任务取决于他们解决意外故障的解决方案时，他们看起来那么酷。当这些聪明的年轻人在卡纳维拉尔角首次发射时，电视上播放着他们坐在电脑显示器前的画面，美国看到的他们工作环境的画面反映了利克莱德和演示小组进行的研究结果。毕竟，北美防空司令部 (NORAD) 所需的计算机显示器与 NASA 所需的计算机显示器并没有太大区别——在这两种情况下，都是一群人使用计算机来跟踪太空中多个物体的路径。NASA 和 ARPA 共享计算机领域的成果——这种官僚合作在前人造卫星时代相对罕见。</p><p>Remember the crew at mission control, who burst into cheers at a successful launch, and who looked so cool nineteen hours later when the astronaut and the mission depended on their solutions to unexpected glitches? When the bright young men at their computer monitors were televised during the first launches from Cape Canaveral, the picture America saw of their working habitat reflected the results of the research Licklider and the presentation group had performed. After all, the kinds of computer displays you need for NORAD (North American Air Defense Command) aren't too different from the kind you need for NASA -- in both cases, groups of people are using computers to track the path of multiple objects in space. NASA and ARPA shared results in the computer field -- a kind of bureaucratic cooperation that was relatively rare in the pre-Sputnik era.</p>

      <p>由于苏联在巨型助推火箭的开发方面似乎远远领先于我们，美国决定集中精力开发制导系统和超轻（即超微型）部件，用于功率较小的火箭——这一政策植根于几年前冯·诺依曼时代洲际弹道导弹委员会制定的基本思想。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">因此，太空计划和导弹计划都需要快速开发非常小、非常可靠的计算机。</font></p><p>Because the Russians appeared to be far ahead of us in the development of huge booster rockets, it was decided that the United States should concentrate on guidance systems and ultralight (i.e., ultraminiature) components for our less powerful rockets -- a policy that was rooted in the fundamental thinking established by the ICBM committee a few years back, in the von Neumann days. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Therefore the space program and the missile program both required the rapid development of very small, extremely reliable computers.</font></p>

      <p>美国这个历史上最富有、最强大的国家决定将大部分资源投入到电子技术开发中，而这恰恰是电子技术发展史上一个极为有利的时刻。基础科学发现促成了小型化革命——半导体研究的新领域，它产生了晶体管和集成电路——明确表明，1960 年只是计算机快速发展的开始。20 世纪 40 年代末，电子管取代继电器，20 世纪 50 年代晶体管取代电子管，而现在集成电路即将在 20 世纪 60 年代取代晶体管，计算机基本开关元件的尺寸、速度、成本和能量要求发生了数量级的变化。在工程师数量几乎远远超过梦想家的实验室里，他们甚至在谈论“大规模集成”。</p><p>The decision of the richest, most powerful nation in history to put a major part of its resources into the development of electronic-based technologies happened at an exceptionally propitious moment in the history of electronics. The basic scientific discoveries that made the miniaturization revolution possible -- the new field of semiconductor research that produced the transistor and then the integrated circuit -- made it clear that 1960 was just the beginning of the rapid evolution of computers. The size, speed, cost, and energy requirements of the basic switching elements of computers changed by orders of magnitude when electron tubes replaced relays in the late 1940s, and again when transistors replaced tubes in the 1950s, and now integrated circuits were about to replace transistors in the 1960s. In the blue-sly labs, where the engineers were almost outnumbered by the dreamers, they were even talking about "large-scale integration."</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">当基础科学以如此快的速度取得突破，当对这些发现的技术开发如此刻意加强时，一个大问题就是能够预见<i>下一步可能做什么和最好做什么</i>。</font>能够看到长远目标，并鼓励所有有助于实现这一目标的子领域将大胆和务实结合起来，这就是利克莱德所展现的特殊才能。和利克莱德一起出现的是新一代设计师和工程师，他们将目光投向了前人造卫星计算机正统派会视为科幻小说的东西。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">突然之间，人机共生不再是技术期刊上的深奥假设，而是一个国家目标。</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">When basic science makes breakthroughs at such a pace, and when technological exploitation of those discoveries is so deliberately intensified, a big problem is being able to envision <i>what's possible and preferable to do next</i>.</font> The ability to see a long range goal, and to encourage the right combination of boldness and pragmatism in all the subfields that could contribute to achieving it, was the particular talent that Licklider brought onto the scene. And with Licklider came a new generation of designers and engineers who had their sights on something the pre-Sputnik computer orthodoxy would have dismissed as science fiction. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Suddenly, human-computer symbiosis wasn't an esoteric hypothesis in a technical journal, but a national goal.</font></p>

      <p>当利克莱德来到 ARPA 时，他得到的不是实验室，而是一间办公室、一笔预算和一项提升信息处理水平的任务。他首先支持了全国 13 个不同的研究小组，主要在麻省理工学院、系统开发公司 (SDC)、加州大学伯克利分校、圣巴巴拉分校和洛杉矶分校、南加州大学、兰德公司、斯坦福研究所（现为 SRI 国际）、卡内基梅隆大学和犹他大学。当他的办公室决定支持一个项目时，这意味着要提供研究人员习惯的预算的三四十倍，同时还要提供最先进的研究技术，并要求他们大胆思考、快速思考。</p><p>When Licklider went to ARPA, he wasn't given a laboratory, but an office, a budget, and a mandate to raise the state of the art of information processing. He started by supporting thirteen different research groups around the country, primarily at MIT; System Development Corporation (SDC); the University of California at Berkeley, Santa Barbara, and Los Angeles; USC; Rand; Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International); Carnagie-Mellon University; and the university of Utah. And when his office decided to support a project, that meant providing thirty or forty times the budget that the researchers were accustomed to, along with access to state-of-the-art research technology and a mandate to think big and think fast.</p>

      <p>利克莱德当时称之为“交互式计算”的一系列新功能<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">是最终目标，而第一步就是后来被称为<i>分时技术</i>的激动人心的新概念。</font>分时技术是从批处理过渡到个人计算（即一个人对一台机器）的第一步，也是最重要的一步。这个想法是创建能够同时与许多程序员交互的计算机系统，而不是强迫他们排队等待卡片或磁带。</p><p>A broad range of new capabilities that Licklider then called <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"interactive computing" was the ultimate goal, and the first step was an exciting new concept that came to be known as <i>time-sharing</i>.</font> Time-sharing was to be the first, most important step in the transition from batch processing to the threshold of personal computing (i.e., one person to one machine). The idea was to create computer systems capable of interacting with many programmers at the same time, instead of forcing them to wait in line with their cards or tapes.</p>

      <p>在 ARPA 介入之前，海军研究办公室和空军科学研究办公室已经资助了可以实现分时技术的探索性研究。利克莱德加强了对麻省理工学院剑桥实验室的支持，该实验室的人工智能研究人员正在研究他们自己的“多路访问计算”方法。MAC<a href="#OEBPS/Text/8.html">项目</a>（该分支的名称）是研究网络中的唯一节点，在接下来的几年里，人工智能和计算机系统设计是合作的，而不是分歧的。</p><p>Exploratory probes of the technologies that could make time-sharing possible had been funded by the Office of Naval Research and Air Force Office of Scientific Research before ARPA stepped in. Licklider beefed up the support to the MIT Cambridge laboratory where AI researchers were working on their own approach to "multi-access computing." <a href="#OEBPS/Text/8.html">Project MAC</a>, as this branch became known, was the single node in the research network where AI and computer systems design were, for a few more years, cooperative rather than divergent.</p>

      <p>MAC 创造了自己的传奇，从麦卡锡、明斯基、帕普特、弗雷德金和魏森鲍姆的开创性 AI 研究，到自称“黑客”的古怪新程序员，他们用一台 PDP-1 进行“太空大战”的深夜会议，他们把 PDP-1 安装在示波器屏幕上，让模拟火箭绕着示波器屏幕飞行，并向对方发射光点。MAC 是 20 世纪 70 年代 AI 天才和 80 年代软件设计师最重要的聚会场所之一。然而，在 ARPA 支持的鼎盛时期结束时，AI 人员和计算机系统人员不再在同一条轨道上。</p><p>MAC generated legends of its own, from the pioneering AI research of McCarthy, Minsky, Papert, Fredkin, and Weizenbaum, to the weird new breed of programmers who called themselves "hackers," who held late night sessions of "Spacewar" with a PDP-1 they had rigged to fly simulated rockets around an ocilloscope screen and shoot dots of light at one another. MAC was one of the most important meeting grounds of both the AI prodigies of the 1970s and the software designers of the 1980s. By the end of the ARPA-supported heyday, however, the AI people and the computer systems people were no longer on the same track.</p>

      <p>1962-1963 年，利克莱德的首批举措之一是在马萨诸塞州成立了麻省理工学院和博尔特、贝拉内克和纽曼团队，帮助圣莫尼卡的系统开发公司生产基于旧真空管技术的 SAGE 分时原型的晶体管版本。第一步是将一台机器提供给所有研究人员，该机器本身具有足够的交互性，可用于设计更具交互性的版本——这一“引导”过程成为利克莱德及其继任者的深思熟虑的政策。结果是，全国各地的大学实验室和智囊团开始研究系统的组件，该系统将依赖于尚未实现的工程和软件突破。</p><p>One of Licklider's first moves in 1962-1963 was to set up an MIT and Bolt, Beranek and Newman group in Massachusetts to help Systems Development Corporation in Santa Monica in producing a transistorized version of the SAGE-based time-sharing prototypes, which were based on the old vacuum tube technology. The first step was to get a machine to all the researchers that was itself interactive enough that it could be used to design more interactive versions -- the "bootstrapping" process that became the deliberate policy of Licklider and his successors. The result was that university laboratories and think tanks around the country began to work on the components of a system that would depend on engineering and software breakthroughs that hadn't been achieved yet.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">分时体验最终成为文化和技术的分水岭。正如利克莱德所预测的那样，这些新工具改变了信息处理的方式，但也改变了人们的思维方式。</font>许多后来参与个人计算机技术创造的研究人员在 ARPA 资助的第一批分时项目中首次体验了交互式计算机设计的高压艺术和科学。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The time-sharing experience turned out to be a cultural as well as a technological watershed. As Licklider had predicted, these new tools changed the way information was processed, but they also changed the way people thought.</font> A lot of researchers who were to later participate in the creation of personal computer technology got their first experience in the high-pressure art and science of interactive computer design in the first ARPA-funded time-sharing projects.</p>

      <p>利克莱德及其日益壮大的“追随者”所设想的交互式计算所面临的障碍之一是 1950 年代计算机内存组件速度慢、容量低；当 Whirlwind 项目主管杰伊·福雷斯特 (Jay Forrester) 发明“磁芯存储器”时，这一硬件问题得到了解决。晶体管计算机的出现预示着在不久的将来会有更大的内存容量和更快的访问时间。另一个问题，即批处理瓶颈，源于计算机接受人工操作员输入的方式；硬件和软件创新的结合正在汇聚到直接键盘到计算机的输入。</p><p>One of the obstacles to achieving the kind of interactive computing that Licklider and his growing cadre of "converts" envisioned lay in the slowness and low capacity of the memory component of 1950-style computers; this hardware problem was solved when Jay Forrester, director of the Whirlwind project, came up with "magnetic core memory." The advent of transistorized computers promised even greater memory capacity and faster access time in the near future. A different problem, characterized by the batch-processing bottleneck, stemmed from the way computers were set up to accept input from human operators; a combination of hardware and software innovations were converging on direct keyboard-to-computer input.</p>

      <p>实现交互式计算总体目标的另一个障碍不是计算机处理信息的方式（分时技术解决了这个问题），而是计算机向人类操作员显示信息的原始方式。林肯实验室是集中图形工作的自然场所。犹他大学成立了另一个以图形为重点的小组。演示小组的资深成员在晶体管计算机设计这一新兴技术专家的加入下得以扩充，开始集中精力研究显示设备问题。</p><p>Another one of the obstacles to achieving the overall goal of interactive computing lay not in the way computer processed information -- an issue that was addressed by the time-sharing effort -- but the primitive way computers were set up to display information to human operators. Lincoln Laboratory was the natural place to concentrate the graphics effort. Another graphics-focused group was started at the University of Utah. The presentation group veterans, expanded by the addition of experts in the infant technology of transistor-based computer design, began to work intensively on the problem of display devices.</p>

      <p>利克莱德还记得第一次关于交互式图形的正式会议，会上介绍了并讨论了第一批初步研究成果，旨在攻克将信息从新计算机内部传输到各种显示屏表面的主要问题。利克莱德回忆说，正是在这次会议上，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><a href="http://www.kzoo.edu/~abrady/CS400/bioW96/soulier.html">伊凡·萨瑟兰</a>首次以引人注目的方式登台亮相。</font></p><p>Licklider remembers the first official meeting on interactive graphics, where the first wave of preliminary research was presented and discussed in order to plan the assault on the main problem of getting information from the innards of the new computers to the surface of various kinds of display screens. It was at this meeting, Licklider recalls, that <font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><a href="http://www.kzoo.edu/~abrady/CS400/bioW96/soulier.html">Ivan Sutherland</a> first took the stage in a spectacular way.</font></p>

      <p>“萨瑟兰当时还是一名研究生，”利克莱德回忆道，“他还没有被邀请发表论文。”但由于他正在为自己的博士论文开发图形程序，因为他是克劳德·香农的得意门生，而且有传言说他正是 ARPA 正在寻找的那种天才，所以他被邀请参加会议。“在最后一场会议快结束时，”利克莱德说，“萨瑟兰站起来向一位发言者提问。”这个问题表明，这位不知名的年轻人可能会对这个高调的会议说些有趣的话。</p><p>"Sutherland was a graduate student at the time," Licklider remembers, "and he hadn't been invited to give a paper." But because of the graphics program he was creating for his Ph.D. thesis, because he was a prot�g� of Claude Shannon, and because of the rumors that he was just the kind of prodigy ARPA was seeking, he was invited to the meeting. "Toward the end of one of the last sessions," according to Licklider, "Sutherland stood up and asked a question of one of the speakers." It was the kind of question that indicated that this unknown young fellow might have something interesting to say to this high-powered assemblage.</p>

      <p>因此，利克莱德安排他第二天向大家演讲：“当然，他带来了一些幻灯片，当我们看到幻灯片时，房间里的每个人都意识到他的作品比正式会议上描述的要好得多。”萨瑟兰的论文是在林肯的 TX-2 上开发的一个程序，展示了一种处理计算机图形的创新方法——以及一种控制计算机操作的新方法。他把它叫做<i>Sketchpad</i>，在场的专家们清楚地看到，他已经超越了他们多年的研究成果，创造了一种即使是最雄心勃勃的人也不敢做的事情。</p><p>So Licklider arranged for him to speak to the group the next day: "Of course, he brought some slides, and when we saw them everyone in the room recognized his work to be quite a lot better than what had been described in the formal session." Sutherland's thesis, a program developed on the TX-2 at Lincoln, demonstrated an innovative way to handle computer graphics -- and a new way of commanding the operations of computers. He called it <i>Sketchpad</i>, and it was clearly evident to the assembled experts that he had leaped over their years of research to create something that even the most ambitious of them had not yet dared.</p>

      <p>Sketchpad 允许计算机操作员使用计算机在类似电视机的显示屏上快速创建复杂的视觉模型。视觉模式可以像其他数据一样存储在计算机内存中，并可以由计算机处理器进行操作。在某种程度上，这是对 Licklider 寻求快速模型构建器的一个戏剧性回答。但 Sketchpad 不仅仅是一个创建视觉显示的工具。它是一种模拟语言，使计算机能够将抽象概念转化为感知上具体的形式。它是全新计算机操作方式的典范；通过更改显示屏上的某些内容，可以通过 Sketchpad 更改计算机内存中的某些内容。</p><p>Sketchpad allowed a computer operator to use the computer to create, very rapidly, sophisticated visual models on a display screen that resembled a television set. The visual patterns could be stored in the computer's memory like any other data, and could be manipulated by the computer's processor. In a way, this was a dramatic answer to Licklider's quest for a fast model-builder. But Sketchpad was much more than a tool for creating visual displays. It was a kind of simulation language that enabled computers to translate abstractions into perceptually concrete forms. And it was a model for totally new ways of operating computers; by changing something on the display screen, it was possible, via Sketchpad, to change something in the computer's memory.</p>

      <p>“如果我知道这有多难，我可能不会做这个，”艾伦·凯记得萨瑟兰在谈到他现在的传奇程序时这样说。不仅技术理论大胆、创新、合理，而且程序确实有效。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">借助光笔、键盘、显示屏和在 1962 年相对粗糙的实时计算机上运行的 Sketchpad 程序，任何人都可以亲眼看到计算机除了数据处理之外还可以用于其他用途。</font>对于 Sketchpad 来说，眼见为实。</p><p>"If I had known how hard it was to do, I probably wouldn't have done it," Alan Kay remembers Sutherland saying about his now-legendary program. Not only was the technical theory bold, innovative, and sound, but the program actually worked. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">With a lightpen, a keyboard, a display screen, and the Sketchpad program running on the relatively crude real-time computers available in 1962, anyone could see for themselves that computers could be used for something else beside data processing.</font> And in the case of Sketchpad, seeing was truly believing.</p>

      <p>1964 年萨瑟兰离开 ARPA 时，利克莱德推荐他担任 IPTO 的下一任主任。“我有些犹豫是否要推荐这么年轻的人，”利克莱德回忆道，“但接替鲁伊纳担任 ARPA 主任的鲍勃·斯普劳尔说，如果萨瑟兰真的像人们所说的那样聪明，他并不介意他年轻。”那时，年仅二十出头的萨瑟兰已经为自己创造了记录，他做着 ARPA 最喜欢的事情——领先于技术，实现正统派认为不可能或完全没有考虑到的事情。</p><p>When he left ARPA in 1964, Licklider recommended Sutherland as the next director of the IPTO. "I had some hesitance about recommending someone so young," remembers Licklider, "but Bob Sproull, Ruina's successor as ARPA director, said he had no problem with his youth if Sutherland was really as bright as he was said to be." By that time, Sutherland, still in his early twenties, had established a track record for himself doing what ARPA liked best -- racing ahead of the technology to accomplish what the orthodoxy considered impossible or failed to consider altogether.</p>

      <p>当萨瑟兰接手时，各种分时、图形、人工智能、操作系统和编程语言项目正在如火如荼地开展，办公室的发展速度几乎与那些从太空时代研究热潮中衍生出来的行业一样快。萨瑟兰聘请了来自 NASA 研究资助部门的年轻人鲍勃·泰勒 (Bob Taylor) 担任他的助手，并在 1965 年离开 IPTO 后最终成为他的继任者。利克莱德于 1964 年前往 IBM 研究中心，然后于 1968 年回到麻省理工学院负责 MAC 项目。</p><p>When Sutherland took over, the various time-sharing, graphics, AI, operating systems, and programming language projects were getting into full swing, and the office was growing almost as fast as the industries that were spinning off the space-age research bonanza. Sutherland hired Bob Taylor, a young man from the research funding arm of NASA, to be his assistant, and ultimately his successor when he left IPTO in 1965. Licklider went to the IBM research center in 1964, and then back to MIT to take charge of Project MAC in 1968.</p>

      <p>1983 年，距离他决定观察自己日常活动的那个春天过去了二十五年，利克莱德仍然在积极地为那些构建信息处理技术的人提供咨询。在直接体验了“二元法则”三十年后，他不确定信息工程师是否已经接近了信息存储和处理的物理极限。</p><p>In 1983, over a quarter of a century since the spring day he decided to observe his own daily activities, Licklider is still actively counseling those who build information processing technologies. After three decades of direct experience with "the rule of two," he is not sure that information engineers have even approached the physical limits of information storage and processing.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">利克莱德指出，科学家和工程师现在知道了一件他们和其他人刚开始研究时不知道的事情，那就是“大自然对信息处理的适应性比 20 世纪 50 年代任何人想象的都要好得多。我们没有意识到分子生物学家已经为一种极其高效、可靠的信息处理机制——人类遗传系统的分子编码——提供了存在性证据。相当于全世界知识的信息量可以存储在不到一立方厘米的 DNA 中，这告诉我们，我们还没有开始接近信息处理技术的物理极限。”</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">One thing scientists and engineers know now that they didn't know when he and the others started, Licklider points out, is that "Nature is very much more hospitable to information processing than anybody had any idea of in the 1950s. We didn't realize that molecular biologists had provided an existence proof for a fantastically efficient, reliable, information processing mechanism -- the molecular coding of the human genetic system. The informational equivalent of the world's entire fund of knowledge can be stored in less than a cubic centimeter of DNA, which tells us that we haven't begun to approach the physical limits of information processing technology."</font></p>

      <p>分时社区以及随之而来的社区网络是另一个梦想的一部分——以计算机为媒介的社区遍布全球，从计算机专家扩展到思想家、艺术家和商人。利克莱德相信，他梦想的在线、互动的人机社区完全有可能在未来十年内实现技术可行性。他一直都知道，20 世纪 60 年代和 70 年代实现的思想框架和第一级硬件技术只是许多有待完成的工作的基础。</p><p>The time-sharing communities, and the network of communities that followed them, were part of another dream -- the prospect of computer-mediated communities throughout the world, extending beyond the computer experts to thinkers, artists, and business people. Licklider believes it is entirely possible that the on-line, interactive human-computer community he dreamed about will become technologically feasible sometime within the next decade. He knew all along that the frameworks of ideas and the first levels of hardware technology achieved in the 1960s and 1970s were only the foundation for a lot of work that remained to be done.</p>

      <p>当构建更好、更便宜、实验性的交互式信息处理系统的引导过程与电子能力的上升曲线和计算成本的下降曲线相交时，数百万人（而不是一两千人）将有可能体验到 ARPA 资助的信息航天员所了解的那种信息环境。</p><p>When the bootstrapping process of building better, cheaper, experimental interactive information processing systems intersects with the rising curve of electronic capabilities, and the dropping curve of computational costs, it will become possible for millions, rather than a thousand or two, to experience the kind of information environment the ARPA-sponsored infonauts knew.</p>

      <p>20 世纪 80 年代初，数百万人已经拥有了个人电脑，而当速度快上百倍、内存容量大上千倍、价格只有现在一半的电脑问世时，这些电脑就会过时。当数千万人拥有功能强大的设备，并拥有连接这些设备的手段时，利克莱德仍然认为这项工作才刚刚开始。</p><p>In the early 1980s, millions of people already own personal computers that will become obsolete when versions a hundred times as fast with a thousand times the memory capacity come along at half of today's prices. When tens of millions of people get their hands on powerful enough devices, and a means for connecting them, Licklider still thinks the job will only be in its beginning stages.</p>

      <p>展望他于 20 世纪 60 年代中期设想的“星际网络”成为现实的那一天，他仍然坚信，人类文化能力的预期提升将会发生，但前提是足够多的人使用该系统的早期版本，并想出一个<i>每个人</i>都可以使用的更强大的系统：“如果有足够多的人参与改进系统，新想法就会更容易诞生和传播，”他指出，也许他还记得那些年，一群特立独行的人认为交互式计算是一项大胆的冒险。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他仍然认为，最重要的问题是这种媒介是否会真正<i>普及</i>。</font></p><p>Looking toward the day when the "intergalactic network" he speculated about in the mid sixties becomes feasible, he remains convinced that the predicted boost in human cultural capabilities will take place, but only after enough people use an early version of the system to think up a more capable system that <i>everybody</i> can use: "With a large enough population involved in improving the system, it will be easier for new ideas to be born and propagated," he notes, perhaps remembering the years when interactive computing was considered a daring venture by a bunch of mavericks. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The most significant issue, he still believes, is whether the medium will become truly <i>universal</i>.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">“总人口中有多少比例的人能够加入这个社区？这仍然是一个重要的问题，”利克莱德总结道，他仍然不确定这种新媒介是否仍将是较小群体的专有财产，而这些群体最终可能会凭借对这些工具的使用权而对其他人施加不成比例的权力，或者它是否会成为整个文化的财产，就像识字一样。</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"What proportion of the total population will be able to join that community? That's still the important question," Licklider concludes, still not sure whether this new medium will remain the exclusive property of a smaller group who might end up wielding disproportionate power over others by virtue of their access to these tools, or whether it will become the property of the entire culture, like literacy.</font></p>

      </div>

      <p style="text-align:center">技术广场是麻省理工学院太空时代的科技殿堂。从前哨基地到技术等级制顶峰的地理转移反映了整个人机系统领域重要性的提升。MAC 最初由<a href="#OEBPS/Text/7.html">利克莱德</a>设立，后来由法诺、明斯基和帕普特在不同时期管理，这个缩写词的含义含糊不清是故意的。在黑客雇主的层面上，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">它既意味着“机器辅助认知”，也意味着“多路访问计算”，</font>因为在 20 世纪 60 年代初期，计算机系统设计和人工智能研究尚未分道扬镳。</p><p style="text-align: center;">Technology Square was MIT's space-age temple of sci-tech. The geographical move from outpost to the pinnacle of the technohierarchy reflected an elevation in the importance of the whole field of man-machine systems. MAC was set up originally by <a href="#OEBPS/Text/7.html">Licklider</a>, later administered at various times by Fano, Minsky, and Papert, and the ambiguity about the meaning of the acronym was deliberate. On the level of the hackers' employers, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">it meant both "machine-aided cognition" and "Multi-access computing,"</font> because in the early 1960s computer system design and AI research had not yet parted ways.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">26 号楼里，脏活累活都在干，这群才华横溢的程序员们把手指伸进机器的逻辑核心，让它们听从他们的命令，他们是疯子和小丑、反对计算机的人，以及许多无法发表的变种。他们是麦卡锡和明斯基等人指导、利克莱德资助的项目的不守规矩但不可或缺的雇佣工匠——正是他们开发了雇主向机器智能前沿推出的软件探测器。</p><p style="text-align: center;">Down in Building 26, where the dirty work went on, where this motley group of exceptionally gifted programmers got their fingers into the logical guts of machines and made them do their bidding, they were Maniacs And Clowns, Men Against Computers, and numerous unprintable variations. They were the unruly but indispensable hired craftsmen of the projects directed by the likes of McCarthy and Minsky and funded by Licklider -- the ones who built the software probes their employers launched into the frontiers of machine intelligence.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">就在大卫走进来的时候，一个名叫理查德·格林布拉特的年轻人正在向一群敬畏的仰慕者（其中包括一些雇佣他的计算机科学家）解释他打算编写一个足以打败人类的国际象棋程序。格林布拉特的论文导师马文·明斯基试图劝阻格林布拉特，告诉他国际象棋软件的开发希望不大。格林布拉特的生活就是喝软饮料、吃糖果、吃罗来达，他从不睡觉，更不用说洗澡换衣服了。</p><p style="text-align: center;">At the moment David walked in, a young man named Richard Greenblatt, who lived on the stereotypical hacker diet of soft drinks, candy bars, and Rolaids, and who didn't stop to sleep, much less to wash or change clothing, was explaining to a circle of awed admirers, which included some of the computer scientists who had hired him, how he intended to write a chess playing program good enough to beat a human. Greenblatt's thesis advisor, Marvin Minsky, tried to discourage Greenblatt, telling him there was little hope of making progress in chess playing software.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">第一次偶然发现 26 号楼的居民六年后，16 岁的大卫·罗德曼 (David Rodman) ——现在已经辍学、吸毒成瘾，并且拥有自己的专业人工智能程序员，尽管名气较小——与其他人一起观看了格林布拉特的“MacHack”程序在一场备受瞩目且具有高度象征意义的国际象棋比赛中击败了整个人工智能领域的头号批评家休伯特·德雷福斯 (Hubert Dreyfus)。MacHack 与 Dreyfus 的决斗已成为黑客传奇之一，MacHack 成为第一个获得美国国际象棋联合会荣誉会员资格的程序。</p><p style="text-align: center;">Six years after he first stumbled upon the inhabitants of building 26, sixteen-year-old David Rodman, by now a dropout, acidhead, and professional AI programmer of his own, albeit smaller, repute, was in the group that watched Greenblatt's "MacHack" program demolish Hubert Dreyfus, the number one critic of the whole AI field, in a much-heralded and highly symbolic game of chess. The MacHack versus Dreyfus duel has become one of the hacker legends, and MacHack became the first program to be granted honorary membership in the American Chess Federation.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">德雷福斯国际象棋比赛只是人工智能历史上几个历史性时刻之一，大卫从吉祥物、学徒到正式的受雇黑客，在 1960 年至 1967 年 MAC 的鼎盛时期见证了这些时刻。当时，他的同事们开始为 TX-0 和 PDP-1 计算机硬件编写程序和操作系统，从而创建了第一个进入交互式计算时代的软件，大卫也在场。后来，约瑟夫·魏森鲍姆 (Joseph Weizenbaum) 遗憾地发布了 ELIZA，这可能是历史上被引用最多、误解最多的程序——这个程序似乎是一个具有不可思议的洞察力的精神病医生，但实际上只是程序员的语义技巧。</p><p style="text-align: center;">The Dreyfus chess match was only one of several historic moments in AI history that David witnessed from his vantage point of mascot, then apprentice, then full-fledged hired hacker, during the heyday of MAC, between 1960 and 1967. He was there when his motley colleagues began to build the programming and operating systems for the TX-0 and PDP-1 computer hardware, thus establishing the first software thrust into the age of interactive computing. David was also there when Joseph Weizenbaum, to his later regret unveiled ELIZA, probably the most widely quoted and widely misunderstood program in history -- the program that seems to be an uncannily perceptive psychiatrist, but is actually a programmer's semantic trick.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">大卫在恶作剧和偶然事件的混合作用下结识了黑客。他是那些对自己的大脑被困在孩子的身体里八年感到愤怒的神童之一。从六岁起，他就是一个出色的音乐家，但十岁时他放弃了钢琴，因为他讨厌在成年人面前表演。他是一个孤独的人，一个流浪者，一个从门口偷看的人，一个城市洞穴探险者——一个窥探者，但不是小偷，除非你认为如何在复杂的系统中找到出路的知识是可以偷走的财产。到十五岁时，大卫和他的朋友们可以通过地下公用设施隧道系统进入麻省理工学院大楼中的任何建筑物。</p><p style="text-align: center;">David came upon the hackers through a mixture of mischief and happenstance. He was one of those prodigies who was angry about having a brain like his trapped for another eight years in the body of a child. Since he was six, he had been an exceptional musician, but he gave up the piano at ten because he despised performing for adults. He was a loner, a wanderer, a looker through doorways, an urban spelunker -- a snoop, but not a thief, unless you consider knowledge of how to find your way through a complicated system as a stealable property. By the age of fifteen, David and his friends could find their way into any building in the MIT complex, via the system of underground utility tunnels.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">漫步在麻省理工学院（他父亲在医学院工作）的走廊里是他最喜欢的消遣之一。他喜欢尝试打开门，看看没有锁的门后面有什么。当他看到那些奇怪的家伙围坐在一台外观怪异、电线从里面伸出的电视机旁，然后和他们一起玩一款名为“太空大战”的游戏时，他使用的是一个用雪茄盒做成的控制面板，似乎没有人注意到他已经十岁了——大卫知道他找到了新的知识家园。</p><p style="text-align: center;">Wandering through the halls of MIT, where his father worked in the medical school, was one of his favorite pastimes. He liked to try doors and see what was behind the unlocked ones. When he cast his eyes on those strange guys gathered around an odd-looking television set with wires coming out of it, and then joined them at a game called "Spacewar," using a control panel made out of a cigar box, and nobody seemed to notice that he was ten years old -- David knew he had found his new intellectual home.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">“他们对待我的方式很微妙。我认为这是一种认可。他们都经历过，但在我自己弄明白之前他们什么都不打算告诉我，”二十年后，大卫回忆道。他只是坐下来，旁边放着一个键盘，然后有人帮他开始学习，虽然他们是他遇到的第一个没有对他的聪明才智大惊小怪的人，但他们注意到他学东西的速度非常快，没错。</p><p style="text-align: center;">"They treated me with some subtlety. I think it was a kind of recognition. They had all been through it, but they weren't about to tell me anything before I figured it out for myself," David recalled, twenty years later. He just sat down and there was a keyboard and someone got him started, and although they were the first people he had met who didn't make a fuss over his intelligence, they noticed how quick he picked it up, all right.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">大卫回来过几次，并展示了他破解计算机的能力后，黑客们就把他做成了吉祥物。当他成为一名真正的黑客时（“当他们开始叫我‘罗德曼’而不是‘嘿，小子’时”），他们开始用机器语言给他布置一些小任务，最终向他展示了一种名为 LISP 的新编程语言的技巧。LISP 是由该项目的创始人之一约翰·麦卡锡专为人工智能程序员发明的。</p><p style="text-align: center;">After David returned a few times, and demonstrated his ability to find his way around the computer, the hackers made him a mascot, and when he was a full-blooded initiate ("when they started calling me 'Rodman' instead of 'hey, kid'"), they started giving him small tasks in machine language, eventually showing him tricks in the sexy new programming language known as LISP invented specifically for AI programmers by John McCarthy, one of the project's founders.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">马文·明斯基的秘书很喜欢这个聪明的十岁孩子，他似乎对编程的热爱就像一些孩子对国际象棋、网球或芭蕾舞的热爱一样，而明斯基一直是麻省理工学院计算机圈黑客的支持者，他让大卫使用他的密码。</p><p style="text-align: center;">Marvin Minsky's secretary took a liking to this wiseass ten-year-old who seemed to take to programming as some kids take to chess or tennis or ballet, and Minsky, who had always been the hackers' patron in MIT computer circles, let David use his password.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">如今，经历了黑客和人工智能研究的早期、ARPAnet 时代、咨询合同和安全审查、收入不断增长以及计算机程序员的社会地位从怪人外行转变为百万富翁文化英雄之后，大卫·罗德曼成为了一家微型计算机软件公司的总裁，该公司的主要产品是他自己编写的程序系统。他从人工智能黑客的密室到微型计算机行业混乱的资本主义的个人经历，可以说是交互式计算从实验室的好奇心到家用电器的整个奇特旅程的缩影。</p><p style="text-align: center;">Today, having grown up through the early days of the hackers and AI research, the ARPAnet years, the consulting contracts and security clearances, the regular escalation of his income, and the transformation of the social status of computer programmers from weirdo outsiders to millionaire culture heroes, David Rodman is the president of a microcomputer software company whose primary product is a system of programs he wrote himself. His personal odyssey from the inner sanctums of AI hackdom to the rough-and-tumble capitalism of the microcomputer industry is a kind of capsule history of the whole strange journey of interactive computing from laboratory curiosity to home appliance.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">但就像其他许多如今已年过三十几岁、不穿西装、不提公文包的人一样，早年的经历丰富多彩，也充满痛苦：“十岁的时候，我就像一根盘绕的弹簧——孤独、紧张、愤怒、愤世嫉俗。我无法平衡自己的智力与世界其他部分。然后突然间，出现了一些和我差不多的人，他们向我展示了一种设备，当我坐下来编程时，它会对我做出反应。那些人<i>知道</i>我发生了什么事，当我开始编程时，他们鼓励我这样做。”</p><p style="text-align: center;">But like many others who are now in their middle thirties and who didn't wear suits and carry briefcases, the early history was colorful and not a little painful: "At the age of ten, I was like a coiled spring inside -- lonely, uptight, angry, cynical. I was unable to balance my intelligence against the rest of the world. Then suddenly, here were people not unlike myself, who showed me a device that would respond to me when I sat down to program it. Those people <i>knew</i> what was happening to me, and when I began programming, they encouraged it."</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">MIT 最初是工程师学校中的工程师学校，本科生每年都会举行“校园最丑男人”比赛——这是一个毫无羞耻的、自诩为超级书呆子的全国天堂。校园人口主要由来自全国所有高中的学生组成，他们在其他人都参加舞会时呆在家里学习积分或制作业余无线电。在这种<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">自称拒绝传统青年文化和培养不时髦的氛围中，计算机狂热者甚至被其他被排斥者视为怪人。</font>他们的标准完全是他们自己的。他们和他们的电脑，以及 ARPA 中的少数人，是唯一知道顶级黑客实际上是内部人士的人。尽管他们被更广泛的社会、他们的同行技术人员甚至大多数其他计算机科学家排斥，但他们恰好是创造计算未来的人——第一个分时系统。</p><p style="text-align: center;">MIT, to begin with, was the engineers' school of engineers' schools, where the undergraduates hold an annual "ugliest man on campus" contest -- an unashamed, self-proclaimed, national haven for supernerds. The campus population was primarily composed of the people from all the high schools in the country who stayed home and learned integral calculus or built ham radios while everybody else was at the sock hop. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Amid all this self-styled rejection of conventional youth culture and the atmosphere of cultivated unfashionability, computer obsessives were considered oddballs even by the other outcasts.</font> Their standards were entirely their own. They and their computers, and a few people in ARPA, were the only ones who knew that the top hackers were really the insiders. Although they were outcasts from the wider society, from their fellow techies, and even from most other computer scientists, they happened to be the people who were creating the future of computing -- the first time-sharing systems.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">他们对自己都知道的未来热门技术如此着迷，似乎故意助长了他们令人讨厌的形象。你不能只是闯进来让自己成为一名黑客。你必须进行黑客攻击。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">这意味着让计算机做制造商从未预料到的事情。</font>（这种编程在黑客中被称为“黑魔法”。）这也意味着如果你不够聪明，无法阻止其他黑客对你所有工作的成果进行破坏，那么你就会幸存下来。</p><p style="text-align: center;">They were having so much fun with what they all knew to be the hot technology of the future that they seemed to deliberately encourage their unappetizing image. You don't just barge in and make yourself a hacker. You've gotta hack. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">And that means making a computer do things its manufacturers never expected it to do.</font> (This kind of programming is known among hackers as "black magic.") It also meant surviving what the other hackers could do to the results of all your work if you weren't clever enough to prevent them.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">这里有一个智力风格问题。在“编写代码”<i></i></font>（编写详细的机器语言或高级语言指令列表，使程序按照计算机用户的要求执行操作）时，大胆、速度和原始力量与优雅和效率同样重要（黑客的批评者会说比优雅和效率更重要）。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>当</i></font><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">局外人问“黑客”是什么意思时，一个常见的回答是“用斧头制作家具的人”。</font>正统的编程风格在这群人中几乎不合时宜。挑战在于想出一种巧妙的方法来做大多数普通计算机专家会以其他方式或根本不会做的事情。性能标准是独特而微妙的，但至关重要。这些人用世界其他人甚至不理解的标准来评判彼此，而黑客们并不介意保持这种风格。</p><p style="text-align: center;"><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">There was a matter of intellectual style. Boldness and speed and raw power were as important as (critics of hackers would say <i>more</i> important than) elegance and efficiency when it came to "cutting code"</font> (writing the detailed machine language or high-level language lists of instructions that make programs do what computer users want them to do.). <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">One common comeback when an outsider asked what "hacker" meant was "somebody who makes furniture with an axe."</font> Orthodox programming style was hardly de rigeur in this crowd. The challenge was to think of a clever way to do something that most normal computer experts would do some other way or not at all. The performance standards were idiosyncratic and subtle, but all-important. These people judged each other by criteria that the rest of the world didn't even understand, and the hackers didn't mind keeping it that way.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">他们除了被社会排斥之外，还是另一种类型的排斥者，无论是自我选择还是其他原因。他们的价值观完全是他们自己的：学术或商业上的成功太微不足道，不能被视为驱动力；与志同道合的同事一起在最先进的设备上工作的机会才是最重要的。他们有自己的文化、自己的道德观，甚至自己的方言。大卫·罗德曼想要效仿的 18 岁麻省理工学院辍学生与他们表面上相似的嬉皮士和激进分子不同，因为他们都恰好拥有当时特别重视的才能，现在仍然是——<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">编写代码的能力，使计算机对非程序员有用。</font></p><p style="text-align: center;">They were other kinds of outcasts besides social outcasts, self-selected or otherwise. Their values were entirely their own: academic or commercial success was too trivial to be considered a driving motivation; the opportunity to work with like-minded colleagues on state-of-the-art equipment was paramount. They had their own culture, their own ethic, even their own dialect. The eighteen-year-old MIT dropouts David Rodman wanted to emulate were distinguished from the hippies and radicals they superficially resembled because they all happened to have a talent that was particularly valued in those days, and still is -- <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">the ability to write code that makes computers useful to nonprogrammers.</font></p>

      <p style="text-align:center">当他们的同班同学都获得博士学位、担任助理教授并进入企业研究实验室时，这些格格不入的年轻人突然找到了他们传统意义上的成功同龄人，他们从事的工作不是开发工资系统或航空预订服务。即使其他人都不知道，这些黑客也知道，他们——而不是 IBM，甚至不是他们更直率的“FORTRAN 类型”计算机科学同事——是计算前沿的试验者，不断突破每一代新硬件的极限。</p><p style="text-align: center;">While all their former classmates were on to their doctorates and assistant professorships and corporate research laboratories, the misfits suddenly found their conventionally successful peers, at a job where they weren't relegated to working out a payroll system or an airline reservation service. The hackers knew, even if nobody else did, that they -- and not IBM, or even their straighter "FORTRAN type" colleagues in computer science -- were the test pilots of the computational frontier, pushing the limits of what could be done with each fresh generation of hardware.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他们的任务是为计算机设计新的东西，而在此过程中，他们发明了一种全新的计算机系统和以计算机为导向的社会，一种技术和社会秩序，在这个秩序中，他们自己这个由曾经的局外人组成的小团体，而不是传统的计算机类型，有幸了解内部的奥秘。</font>当世界其他地方赶上他们时，他们知道，他们将会发现一些对外行来说更加神秘、对黑客来说更加令人兴奋的东西。他们中没有人否认自己对计算机上瘾的指控。近四分之一世纪前，当大卫走进那个房间时，有些人还在那个房间里，现在他们仍然坐在 545 科技广场高层的某个地方的一台电脑终端前。</p><p style="text-align: center;"><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Their mandate was to dream up new things for computers to do, and in the process what they did was invent a whole new computer system and computer-oriented society, a technology and social order in which their own little fraternity of ex-outsiders, and not the conventional computer types, were privileged to know the inner mysteries.</font> When the rest of the world caught up with them, they knew they would be on to something even more mysterious to the outsider and more exciting to the hacker. None of them would deny the charges of addiction. Some of the same people who were in that room when David walked in, almost a quarter of a century ago, are still sitting in front of a computer terminal, somewhere on the upper floors of 545 Technology Square.</p>
    

    <div style="text-align:center">
      <font size="+2">太空大战</font>
    </div>

    
      <div style="text-align:center"><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">
        他们的上级非常聪明，知道</font></font><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">如果让最优秀的黑客独立完成任务，他们也能想出令人惊叹的东西。</font>太空大战从麻省理工学院传播到其他校园计算机中心，是任何黑客窝点的必经仪式和标志性特征之一。它是由一位名叫拉塞尔（绰号“Slug”）的 MAC 黑客发明的，经过几代人的共同努力才得以完善，它像某种抗生素耐药性生物一样，在任何地方都能存活下来，因为<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">全国每个计算机实验室经理都知道，当太空大战被禁止时，生产力会下降，而当游戏恢复时，生产力又会回升。</font>
      </div>

      <p style="text-align:center">正是《太空大战》启发了诺兰·布什内尔，让他在十多年后创作了一款简单得多的版本，名为<i>《Pong》</i>。这款商业游戏创造了雅达利公司的第一个化身，并催生了价值数十亿美元的视频游戏产业。然而，在《Pong》成功之前，布什内尔未能让人们对一款更复杂的游戏、一款更直接的《太空大战》衍生品产生兴趣。但在那个年代，那些在酒吧和游戏厅里往视频机里投硬币的人还没有受到 20 世纪 70 年代末和 80 年代初的《太空侵略者》和《吃豆人》现象的教育，培养了他们对视频游戏的敏感度。</p><p style="text-align: center;">It was Spacewar that influenced Nolan Bushnell to create, over a decade later, a much simpler version called <i>Pong</i>, a commercial venture that created the first incarnation of Atari Corporation and a billion-dollar video game industry. Before Pong succeeded, however, Bushnell had failed to get people interested in a more complex game, a more direct derivation of Spacewar. But in those days, the people who put quarters into video machines at bars and arcades hadn't yet been educated in their video game sensibilities by the Space Invaders and Pac-Man phenomena of the late 1970s and early 1980s.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">但娱乐和游戏只是娱乐和游戏的一部分。当大卫到达时，黑客们正在开发的东西之一是第一批分时系统的软件。他们正在编写一个分时操作系统，打算用它来创造黑客历史上最伟大的黑客、最大的恶作剧、最令人惊叹的编程技巧展示。他们开创了一种全新的计算机使用方式，最终将外部人群引入其中，这一事实并不是他们首先想到的事情。他们想自己动手使用这个系统，所以他们以创纪录的速度建造了它。</p><p style="text-align: center;">But fun and games were only part of the fun and games. One of the things the hackers were building when David arrived was the software for one of the first time-sharing systems. They were writing a time-sharing operating system that they intended to use to create the greatest hacks, the biggest pranks, the most amazing demonstrations of programming virtuosity in hacker history. The fact that they were pioneering a whole new way to use computers that would eventually bring the outside population in on it was not the first thing on their mind. They wanted to get their own hands on the system, so they built it in record time.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">实际上，麻省理工学院有两个分时项目。较为稳重的项目是 CTSS（兼容分时系统），之所以这样命名，是因为该系统的设计初衷是与其他地方正在构建的系统兼容。MAC 黑客正在设计一种操作系统，他们称之为 ITS（不兼容分时系统）。他们根本不在乎是否能让外人轻松使用。他们玩得太开心了，不想与那些在完成一个好的黑客之前可以忍受吃饭或睡觉的正直程序员分享它。</p><p style="text-align: center;">Actually, there were two MIT time-sharing projects. The more staid project was CTSS -- Compatible Time-Sharing System, so named because it was designed to be compatible with other systems that were being constructed elsewhere. The MAC hackers were designing an operating system they called ITS -- the Incompatible Time-sharing System. They couldn't care less about making it easy for outsiders to use. They were having too much fun to share it with the kind of straight-arrow programmers who could stand to eat or sleep before finishing a good hack.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">有黑客，也有元黑客。理查德·格林布拉特，因为他的程序对德雷福斯的所作所为，以及他能够在不完全理解代码编写过程的情况下即兴编写出优秀代码的能力，是黑客界的佼佼者。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他是一名辍学者，看起来像“百事可乐狂饮、不睡觉、一心一意的编程迷，只吃自动售货机里的食物，三年来皮肤除了荧光灯外什么都没吸收”，</font>罗德曼在三十年后深情地回忆道。但格林布拉特的同行们都认为他是 LISP 编程界的尼金斯基、弗兰克·劳埃德·赖特和约翰·塞巴斯蒂安·巴赫。</p><p style="text-align: center;">There were hackers and there were metahackers. Richard Greenblatt, because of what his program did to Dreyfus, and because of his ability to improvise great code without fully understanding how he did it, was at the top of the hacking order. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">He was a dropout and looked the part of the "Pepsi-guzzling, nonsleeping, single-minded programming addict who ate only food that came from a vending machine and whose skin had not absorbed anything but fluorescent light in three years,"</font> as Rodman fondly remembered him, three decades later. But Greenblatt's peers knew him as a Nijinsky, a Frank Lloyd Wright, a Johann Sebastian Bach of LISP programming.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">恶作剧，也就是黑客们所说的“车轮大战”——破坏彼此的文件，试图阻挠对方或“破坏”操作系统——是工作环境的一部分。破坏系统可以通过运行某种无法运行的自吞程序来实现，而设计系统的程序员并没有对此采取预防措施。当这种恶作剧成功时，连接到系统的每个人都会丢失重要数据。在 20 世纪 60 年代早期，在 MAC 这样的地方，人们都明白，尽管破坏会带来不良的副作用，但如果黑客发现了一个重要的系统漏洞，那么破坏系统是一种允许的测试。</p><p style="text-align: center;">The matter of pranks, of what the hackers called "wheel wars" -- mucking up each others files, trying to thwart each other or "crash" the operating system -- was part of the working environment. Crashing the system could be accomplished by running some kind of unrunnable self-swallowing program that the programmer who designed the system hadn't made precautions for. When such a prank succeeds, everybody connected to the system can lose important data. In the early sixties, at places like MAC, it was understood that, despite its unfortunate side effects, crashing was an allowable test of the system if the hack revealed an important system vulnerability.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">二十年后，当那些调皮捣蛋、有时甚至带有破坏性的青少年开始自称是“黑客”并通过电话破坏非黑客的文件时，他们所做的事情与 MAC 的第一批不法之徒所试图完成的事情相比，其最终效果（即使表面上如此）截然不同。他们借口说，他们“只是在探索”系统中一个有趣的漏洞，这在黑客创建和测试新的分时系统时确实有一定道理，当时他们的专业知识都是为了实现一个共同的目标。但是，当崩溃的系统（就像 1983 年差点发生的那样）是医院用来跟踪患者用药记录的运行计算机时，情况就有所不同了。在 20 世纪 60 年代，这种反传统的恶作剧具有一种含义，而在 20 世纪 80 年代，这种恶作剧具有另一种含义。</p><p style="text-align: center;">Two decades later, when mischievous and sometimes vandalistic teenagers with home computers started calling themselves "hackers" and crashed the files of nonhackers via the telephone, they were doing something quite different in its ultimate effect, if not in its outward appearance, from what the first such outlaws at MAC were trying to accomplish. The excuse was that they were "just exploring" an interesting vulnerability in the system had some real validity back when the hackers were creating and testing new time-sharing systems, and when their expertise was aimed toward a common goal. But when the system that crashes, as nearly happened in 1983, is an operational computer used by a hospital to keep track of patient medication records, it is a somewhat different matter. The same kind of iconoclastic mischief that had one meaning in the 1960s took on another meaning in the 1980s.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">“电话窃听”是另一种恶作剧，由 MAC 黑客在 20 世纪 60 年代早期开创，并在 20 世纪 70 年代催生出无政府主义的变体。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">自学掌握复杂技术是黑客痴迷的标志，坚信所有信息（和信息传递技术）都应该免费是黑客道德准则的核心原则，而全球电话网络是一种极为复杂的技术系统<i>，</i>是一种临时的全球计算机。</font>音调发生器和交换电路知识可以免费提供长途线路访问，这一事实导致了许多传奇的电话窃听事件。但神话并没有就此消亡。</p><p style="text-align: center;">"Phone-hacking" was another kind of prank pioneered by MAC hackers in the early 1960s that was to spawn anarchic variants in the 1970s. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The self-taught mastery of complex technologies is the hallmark of the hacker's obsession, the conviction that all information (and information delivery technologies) ought to be free is a central tenet of the hacker ethical code, and the global telephone network is a complex technological system <i>par excellence</i>, a kind of ad hoc worldwide computer.</font> The fact that a tone generator and a knowledge of switching circuits could provide access to long-distance lines, free of charge, led to a number of legendary phone hacks. But the mythology didn't die there.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">在加利福尼亚州，斯坦福人工智能实验室 (SAIL) 和靠近硅谷的地理位置导致了 20 世纪 70 年代另一个电话窃听亚文化“电话飞客”的兴起，他们的英雄是一个名叫<a href="http://www.well.com/user/crunch/">Crunch 船长</a>的家伙。Crunch 是一个牙齿缝隙大、眼神疯狂、大胡子的家伙，现在他编写软件，远离非法活动。20 世纪 60 年代末和 70 年代初，他开着一辆装满电子设备的货车在公路上穿梭，在路边的电话亭里玩弄高超的恶作剧——直到他被抓、起诉、判刑和监禁。Crunch 的电话窃听伙伴之一<a href="http://www.woz.org/">史蒂夫·沃兹尼亚克 (Steve Wozniak</a> ) 在发明第一台苹果电脑后声名鹊起。Crunch 船长，又名约翰·德雷珀 (John Draper)，现在以“Cap'n Software”的身份合法赚取了相当可观的收入，他是同名微型计算机软件公司的唯一程序员。</p><p style="text-align: center;">In California, the Stanford AI Laboratory (SAIL) and the proximity to Silicon Valley led to the growth of another phone-hacking subcult of "phone Phreaks" in the 1970s, whose hero was a fellow who went by the name of <a href="http://www.well.com/user/crunch/">Captain Crunch</a>. A gap-toothed, crazy-eyed, full-bearded fellow who now writes software and stays away from illegal activities, Crunch traveled the highways in the late sixties and early seventies with a van full of electronic equipment, playing virtuoso pranks from roadside phone booths -- until he was caught, prosecuted, sentenced, and jailed. One of Crunch's phone hacking buddies from the outlaw days, <a href="http://www.woz.org/">Steve Wozniak</a>, went on to bigger fame when he invented the first Apple computer. Captain Crunch, also known as John Draper, now makes very decent legitimate money as "Cap'n Software," the sole programmer for the microcomputer software company of the same name.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">在 MAC 项目、斯坦福的亚文化同行（他们开始将加州品牌的一些疯狂融入黑客公式）和其他地方，你必须忍受痛苦才能被允许进入更有趣的黑客智慧层面。与任何封闭的亚文化一样，黑客们不放过任何人他们自己的成年礼。大卫是最年轻的入会者，但他们对他并不比其他新来者宽容。在遇到现在传奇的“饼干怪兽”及其一些更卑鄙的亲戚之前，你只是 MAC 的一部分。</p><p style="text-align: center;">At Project MAC, and at the subcultural counterparts at Stanford (where they began to blend some of their California brand of craziness into the hacker formula) and elsewhere, you had to suffer in order to be admitted to the more interesting levels of hacker wisdom. As in any closed subculture, the hackers spared no one their own kind of rites of passage. David was the youngest initiate, but they didn't go any easier on him than any other newcomer. You just weren't part of things at MAC until you met the now-legendary "cookie monster" and some of its nastier relatives.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">系统崩溃是生活中的常态，也是黑客界高层面临的一个隐性挑战——如果你足够聪明，能够想出系统程序员没有防备的办法，那么让计算机停止运行，将某人数小时或数周的工作成果付诸东流，这与其说是一种罪行，倒不如说是一种荣誉。相比之下，饼干怪兽相对温和。与操作系统崩溃不同，饼干怪兽只会袭击特定的受害者，而不是所有在系统崩溃时不幸使用系统的人。</p><p style="text-align: center;">Crashing the system was a fact of life and an implicit challenge at the higher reaches of hackdom -- if you were smart enough to come up with something that the system programmers hadn't guarded against, it was more of an honor than a misdemeanor to bring the computer to a halt, dumping hours or weeks of someone's work. By comparison, the cookie monster was relatively mild. Unlike an operating system crash, the cookie monster struck only selected victims, rather than everybody who was unfortunate enough to be using the system when a crash was perpetrated.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">饼干怪兽最常在凌晨四点出击。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">（通宵黑客活动始于分时系统，这不仅是因为它符合黑客奇怪的自我形象，还因为分时系统在晚上运行速度更快，因为所有非黑客都在外面约会、学习诗歌、睡觉，或者做现实世界中非黑客晚上会做的事情。）</font>你可能在程序的第 2000 行中寻找错误。突然，毫无预兆地，显示器屏幕上出现了“我想要一个饼干！”的字样——你精心编写的所有代码都被“饼干！”这个词无情地吞噬，不断重复，直到你终于弄明白，或者（最可怕的是）有人必须告诉你：你必须在键盘上输入“饼干！”这个词。</p><p style="text-align: center;">The cookie monster would strike most often at four in the morning. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">(All-night hacking began with time-sharing systems, not only because it fit in with the hacker's weird self-image, but because time-shared systems run faster at night, when all the nonhackers are out having dates or studying poetry or sleeping or whatever nonhackers do at night in the real world.)</font> You would be looking for a bug somewhere in the two-thousandth line of your program. Suddenly, without warning, the words "I WANT A COOKIE!!" appear on your monitor screen -- and all your painstakingly crafted code is relentlessly munched into oblivion by the word COOKIE!!, multiplied over and over until you finally figure out or (horror of horrors) somebody has to tell you: you have to type the word COOKIE!! on your keyboard.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">以他们自己的方式，MAC 黑客是 20 世纪 60 年代出现在大学校园的其他类型的通灵亡命徒的先驱。对中产阶级价值观的蔑视和对自己思维运作方式的持久兴趣是黑客与后来与计算机无关的亚文化群体共有的两个特征。20 世纪 60 年代末，大卫·罗德曼是一名坚定的黑客，当时他开始涉足一种非常不同但又出奇相似的非法亚文化，这种亚文化正在剑桥学生社区中兴起。</p><p style="text-align: center;">In their own way, the MAC hackers were the forerunners of other kinds of psychic desperadoes who appeared on college campuses in the 1960s. A contempt for middle-class values and an abiding interest in the workings of their own mind were two characteristics that hackers were to share with later subcultures who had nothing to do with computers. David Rodman was a confirmed hacker in the late 1960s, when he began to dabble in a very different yet strangely similar outlaw subculture that was springing up in the Cambridge student community.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">“我认为第一次服用迷幻药是一次进入我内心深处的飞跃，”大卫今天回忆道。“突然间，我进入了我自己。我不知道进入的路径，但我进入了我自己。我可以观察自己弹吉他或写代码，并在即兴创作时自言自语。‘我要去哪里，我怎么知道怎么去那里，我真正表达的是什么？’这是所有旅行中最难忘的一次。”</p><p style="text-align: center;">"I would characterize my first acid trip as a quantum leap into the innards of my own psychology," David recalls today. "Suddenly, there I was -- inside myself. I didn't know the path to get in, but there I was. I could observe myself playing the guitar or writing code, and think to myself while improvising. 'Where am I going and how do I know how to go there and what am I really expressing?' It was the trip of all trips."</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">大卫认为，“对于我独特的认知方式来说，编程是服用迷幻药的完美准备，因为它让我可以在机器中塑造出我的一小部分个性，并与之互动。老黑客会告诉我‘别管主程序做什么，我们想让你写一个程序，在棋盘上移动棋子’，所以我写了一个小巧玲珑的实用程序部分，将其放入一个国际象棋程序中。下一次，在我第一次服用迷幻药时，我发现自己身处其中一个宝石般的结构中。”</p><p style="text-align: center;">David thinks that "for my peculiar cognitive style, programming was a perfect preparation for psychedelics, because it allowed me to model a little piece of my personality in the machine, and interact with it. The older hackers would tell me 'never mind what the main program does, we want you to write a program that moves a chess piece on a chessboard,' so I wrote a small, gemlike part of the utility package that went into one of the chess programs. The next time I found myself in one of those gemlike structures on my first acid trip."</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">大卫创造的小型“宝石状结构”被纳入格林布拉特的 MacHack 的早期版本，当 MacHack 于 1967 年与德雷福斯会面时，该程序最终成为人工智能社区内黑客主权的象征。这一切都始于休伯特·德雷福斯竟然大胆质疑人工智能研究的成功几率，甚至质疑其合法性。整个人工智能领域都被质疑为欺诈，人们正在采取非常严肃的措施，这些措施超出了学术界通常的激烈争论，旨在切断对明斯基等人的愚蠢尝试的资助。德雷福斯事件始于 1965 年夏天，当时休伯特·德雷福斯——一位哲学家，而不是计算机科学家——在兰德公司待了几个月。德雷福斯在那个夏天末撰写的论文题为“炼金术与人工智能”，非正式地作为兰德报告流传。</p><p style="text-align: center;">The small "gemlike structures" that David created were incorporated into early versions of Greenblatt's MacHack, the program that eventually became an emblem of the hackers' sovereignty within the AI community when MacHack met Dreyfus in 1967. It all started when Hubert Dreyfus had the temerity to question not only the chances of success but the very legitimacy of AI research. The entire field of artificial intelligence had been challenged as a fraud, and very serious efforts that went beyond the usual acrimony of academic debate were being made to cut off funding for the foolishness Minsky et al. were attempting. The Dreyfus affair began in the summer of 1965, when Hubert Dreyfus -- a philosopher, not a computer scientist -- spent a few months at the Rand Corporation. The paper that Dreyfus wrote at the end of that summer, entitled "Alchemy and Artificial Intelligence," was informally circulated as a Rand report.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">德雷福斯认为人工智能是骗人的。他特别抨击了人工智能爱好者对其领域未来的一些说法。他声称人工智能人士所说的“进步”是一种幻觉，并试图证明他们的目标是一种妄想。IBM 研究员亚瑟·塞缪尔斯 (Arthur Samuels) 最近创建了一个相当不错的跳棋程序，即将成为冠军。对德雷福斯来说，说跳棋程序代表着向真正的类人机器智能迈出了一步，就像说一只能够爬到树顶的猿猴正在向飞向月球的方向迈进一样。</p><p style="text-align: center;">Dreyfus thought that AI was a crock. He specifically attacked some of the claims AI enthusiasts had made about the future of their field. He claimed that the "progress" the AI folks had been citing was an illusion, and attempted to prove that their goal was a delusion. An IBM researcher, Arthur Samuels, had recently created a pretty decent checkers program that was on its way to becoming a champion. To Dreyfus, saying that the checkers program represented a step toward a true human-like machine intelligence was like saying that an ape who could climb to the top of a tree was making progress toward flying to the moon.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">德雷福斯质疑任何有意义的国际象棋程序是否能够被开发出来，并指出赫伯特·西蒙在 1957 年曾预测十年内会出现一个不可战胜的国际象棋程序，并指出这个时间已经不多了。格林布拉特突然出现，带来了他精心构建的国际象棋破解程序，而当时的 MAC 联合主任西摩·帕普特则将德雷福斯引入了一场公开比赛。</p><p style="text-align: center;">Dreyfus challenged the idea that a chess playing program of any significance could ever be built, pointed out that in 1957 Herbert Simon had predicted an unbeatable chess playing program within ten years, and noted that the time was about up. Greenblatt came out of nowhere with his carefully constructed chess hack, and Seymour Papert, then codirector of MAC, maneuvered Dreyfus into a public match.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">戴维和其他目击者都记得，这场比赛充满戏剧性，而且难以预测——悬念迭起，比他们预想的要紧张刺激、巧妙得多，而且没有那么机械。这不仅仅是一场友好的竞争。他们的资金来源受到了攻击，而这个……这个……<i>哲学家</i>可能会让人们如此激动，以至于他们会拿走他们珍贵的终端。毫无疑问，这是一场恩怨之战。</p><p style="text-align: center;">David and other witnesses remember the game as a dramatic and unpredictable match -- a cliff-hanger that was far more suspenseful and ingenious and less mechanical than what any of them had expected. This was more than a friendly rivalry. The source of their funds was being attacked, and it was just possible that this . . . this . . . <i>philosopher</i> might manage to get people so stirred up that they would take their precious terminals away. It was a grudge match, no question about it.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">MacHack 赢了。计算机协会人工智能特别兴趣小组 (SIGART) 的公告欣喜地报道了比赛结果，标题取自 Dreyfus 的论文：“十岁小孩可以打败机器——Dreyfus。”SIGART 的编辑们用他们自己的副标题修改了它：“但机器可以打败 Dreyfus。”SIGART 的文章引发了一系列致编辑的信函、指控和反指控，Dreyfus 最终写了一本书，名为《计算机不能做什么》，<i>他</i>在书中承认：“人工智能工作者对我揭露他们的热情和结果之间的差距感到尴尬，最终制作了一个相当称职的程序。R. Greenblatt 的程序 MacHack 确实击败了作者，一个业余爱好者。”</p><p style="text-align: center;">MacHack won. Gleefully, the bulletin of the Special Interest Group in Artificial intelligence (SIGART) of the Association for Computing Machinery reported the results of the match under a headline taken from Dreyfus' paper: "A Ten-Year-Old Can Beat the Machine -- Dreyfus." The SIGART editors amended it with a subhead of their own: "But the Machine Can Beat Dreyfus." The SIGART article touched off a series of letters to editors, accusations, and counteraccusations, and Dreyfus ended up writing a book, <i>What Computers Can't Do</i> in which he admitted: "Embarrassed by my expose of the disparity between their enthusiasm and their results, AI workers finally produced a reasonably competent program. R. Greenblatt's program called MacHack did in fact beat the author, a rank amateur."</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">麦克哈克后来成为美国国际象棋联合会的荣誉会员，德雷福斯与人工智能之争已经持续了几十年，尽管没有 1967 年那样激烈的肉搏战，当时一名黑客以一次传奇的黑客行为出色地捍卫了自己的艺术，然后回到了他的终端，而其他人则争论他所做的事情的意义。这一事件的意义不仅仅在于象征意义：格林布拉特撰写的关于该计划的正式论文对那些仍​​然希望实现图灵、冯·诺依曼和香农与真正的国际象棋大师对战的梦想的人来说具有历史价值</p><p style="text-align: center;">MacHack went on to become an honorary member of the U. S. Chess federation, and the Dreyfus-versus-AI controversy has dragged on for decades, albeit without the hand-to-hand fury of 1967, when a hacker rose brilliantly to the defense of his art with a legendary hack, then retreated back to his terminal while others argued the significance of what he had done. The event had more than symbolic significance: the formal paper Greenblatt wrote about the program was of historical value to those who still hope to fulfill Turing's, von Neumann's, and Shannon's dreams of playing against a true master chess-machine</p>

        MacHack 实际上是 David Rodman 在 MAC 学徒期间见证的两次历史性软件诞生中的第二次。Joseph Weizenbaum 于 1963 年来到麻省理工学院，当他在 1964 年至 1966 年间创建</font></font><a href="http://www-ai.ijs.si/eliza/eliza.html">ELIZA</a>时，他改变了所有人对计算机不能做什么的看法——这也包括改变了他对整个计算机人工智能企业发展方向的看法。ELIZA<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">是一种通过计算机中介对话模仿人类互动的巧妙方式；发明者没有预料到的是，人们愿意被这种模仿所欺骗</font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">——即使是那些本应更了解的人。当 Weizenbaum 从看到人们对他的程序的反应的震惊中恢复过来时，他确信在这场备受瞩目的计算机革命中隐藏着一些非常危险的东西。
      </font></font></div>

      <p style="text-align:center">对 ELIZA 的反应最终导致魏森鲍姆开始质疑计算机为大众带来的变化的最终价值——他认为我们以后可能会后悔这些变化。他还宣称，我们很快就会面临关于计算机应该做什么和不应该做什么的重要决定。他特别指出黑客是计算机界疾病的症状。魏森鲍姆在 1976 年出版的《计算机<i>力量与人类理性</i>》一书中对计算机文化的一些最基本前提进行了攻击，引发了魏森鲍姆和人工智能界之间持续不断、激烈的公开辩论。</p><p style="text-align: center;">The reaction to ELIZA eventually led Weizenbaum to question the ultimate value of the changes that computers were introducing to the general population -- changes he felt we might all later regret. He also declared that we would soon be faced with important decisions about what computers ought and ought not to do. He specifically cited the hackers as a symptom of a sickness in the heart of computerdom. Weizenbaum's assault on some of the most fundamental premises of the computer culture with the 1976 publication of <i>Computer Power and Human Reason</i> set off a continuing, oft-heated public debate between Weizenbaum and the AI community.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">德雷福斯与人工智能的争论主要是技术争论，这也让麦克哈克的技术胜利如此甜蜜。魏森鲍姆的争论是道德争论，其热情与休伯特·德雷福斯截然不同，后者从加利福尼亚飞来，发表现象学理论。这位是麻省理工学院计算机科学荣誉教授约瑟夫·魏森鲍姆，他说人工智能可能不是骗局，但我们最好对计算机更加小心，并提防黑客。</p><p style="text-align: center;">The Dreyfus-AI debate had been largely a technical argument, which helped make MacHack's technical victory so sweet. Weizenbaum's was a moral argument, and it carried a passionate force far different in effect from that of Hubert Dreyfus, flying in from California with his phenomenology. This was Joseph Weizenbaum, honored professor of computer science at MIT, saying that AI might not be a crock, but we better be a lot more careful with computers, and watch out for the hackers in the process.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">还记得 20 世纪 60 年代初支票底部开始出现那些看起来很奇怪的“计算机字母”吗？那是约瑟夫·魏森鲍姆在进入麻省理工学院之前的工作之一。作为通用电气的软件专家，他主要参与了美国银行的 ERMA 项目，该项目是世界银行系统计算机化的里程碑。魏森鲍姆后来谈到使用计算机的道德问题，这可能会改变数百万人的生活，他是根据自己的经验说的。他创建了一个程序，给人一种智慧、无所不知、计算机化的精神病医生的幻觉——他惊讶地发现，即使是他的计算机高手同事也心甘情愿地被这种幻觉所欺骗——这引发了魏森鲍姆的反对。</p><p style="text-align: center;">Remember when those funny-looking "computer letters" started appearing on the bottom of checks, in the early 1960s? That was part of Joseph Weizenbaum's work in the days before he came to MIT. As a software expert for General Electric, he was centrally involved in Bank of America's ERMA project, a milestone in the computerization of the world's banking system. When Weizenbaum later spoke about the morality of using computers in ways that might change millions of people's lives, he was speaking from experience. His creation of a program that gave the illusion of a wise, all-knowing, computerized psychiatrist -- and his shock at seeing how willingly even his computer-sophisticated colleagues were taken in by the illusion -- triggered Weizenbaum's dissension.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center">魏森鲍姆在麻省理工学院开始学习时，他认为对使用简单编程技巧回答英语问题的程序的兴趣只是一种抽象。他编写了一个工作版本，黑客们对此很感兴趣，这似乎是迈向真正的语言理解程序的一步，尽管这只是非常原始的第一步。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">黑客们喜欢假装自己在与计算机“交谈”，尽管他们知道该程序只是在解析非常简单的句子，并没有真正理解这些句子的含义。</font></p><p style="text-align: center;">Weizenbaum started out at MIT with what he thought would be an abstract interest in programs that used simple programming tricks to answer questions posed in English. He put together a working version that the hackers had fun with, and which seemed to be a step, albeit a very primitive first step, toward a genuine language-understanding program. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The hackers enjoyed the pretense that they were "conversing" with a computer, even though they knew that the program was parsing very simple sentences with no real underlying understanding of their meaning.</font></p>

      <p style="text-align:center">在开发一个比第一个版本更复杂的问答程序（其句子解析能力更强）时，魏泽鲍姆遇到了斯坦福大学的一位名叫肯尼斯·科尔比的精神病学家，科尔比对使用计算机模拟心理状态和精神障碍很感兴趣，以便找到更有效的心理治疗方法。科尔比帮助魏泽鲍姆创建了一个特殊版本的 ELIZA，称为 DOCTOR。在 1976 年出版的一本书的前言中，魏泽鲍姆描述了这个最成功、最令人不安的 ELIZA 版本是如何诞生的，并传达了一些“ELIZA 效应”的味道：</p><p style="text-align: center;">While he was working on a more elaborate question-answering program, with greater sentence-parsing capabilities than his first version, Weizenbaum met a psychiatrist from Stanford named Kenneth Colby, who was interested in using computers to model mental states and mental disorders in order to find clues to more effective forms of psychotherapy. Colby helped Weizenbaum create a special-case version of ELIZA, known as DOCTOR. In the introduction of his 1976 book, Weizenbaum described how this most successful and disturbing version of ELIZA came into being, and conveyed a little of the flavor of the "ELIZA effect":</p>

      
        <div style="text-align:center">
          <span style="font-size:small">这项工作是在 1964 年至 1966 年间完成的，并于 1966 年 1 月和 1967 年 8 月在计算机科学文献中进行了报道。简而言之，我编写了一个计算机程序，人们可以用英语“交谈”。人类对话者会在连接到计算机的打字机上输入他的部分对话，而计算机在我的程序的控制下，会分析传输给它的信息，用英语撰写回复，并将回复打印在计算机的打字机上。</span>
        </div>

        <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1">我为该语言分析程序选择了 ELIZA 这个名字，因为就像皮格马利翁 (Pygmalion) 中的伊丽莎 (Eliza) 一样，它可以被教导越来越好地“说话”......</font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1">I chose the name ELIZA for the language analysis program because, like the Eliza of Pygmalion fame, it could be taught to "speak" increasingly well. . . .</font></p>

        <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1">在我的第一个实验中，我给了 ELIZA 一个脚本，让它扮演（我真的应该说是模仿）罗杰斯派心理治疗师的角色，与患者进行初次面谈。罗杰斯派心理治疗师相对容易模仿，因为他的大部分技术都是通过将陈述反射给他来引出他的患者。以下是一位年轻女士和扮演医生的 ELIZA 之间的对话，说明了鼓励患者继续说话的罗杰斯技术以及计算机程序 ELIZA 的操作。第一个“说话”的是这位年轻女士。计算机的回答全部用大写字母打印出来。</font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1">For my first experiment, I gave ELIZA a script designed to permit it to play (I really should say parody) the role of a Rogerian psychotherapist engaged in an initial interview with a patient. The Rogerian psychotherapist is relatively easy to imitate because much of his technique consists of drawing his patient out by reflecting the statements back to him. The following conversation betwen a young lady and ELIZA playing doctor illustrates both the Rogerian technique of encouraging a patient to keep talking and the operation of the computer program ELIZA. The first to "speak" is the young lady. The computer's responses are printed entirely in capitals.</font></p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">让魏泽鲍姆感到震惊的第一件事是，那些对计算机有足够了解的人开始与计算机进行严肃的对话，谈论他们的生活！甚至连他的秘书也养成了与计算机交谈的习惯！人们要求与计算机独处，倾诉他们最私密的想法！魏泽鲍姆非常震惊，他开始重新思考他所相信的一切。但这只是我们所有人都很容易轻信他所知道的只是一个聪明的黑客行为的一个症状。</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">The first thing that alarmed Weizenbaum was the way people who knew enough about computers to know better began to get drawn into serious conversations with it about their lives! Even his own secretary had fallen into the habit of conversing with it! People were asking to be left alone with the machine to spill out their most intimate thoughts! Weizenbaum was so horrified that he started rethinking everything he believed. But that was just a symptom of how gullible we all might be to what he knew was just a clever hack.</font></font></p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1"><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">更严重的是，在魏森鲍姆看来，科尔比和其他人认为“计算机治疗师”可能很快就会被应用于某种形式的“自动心理治疗”——魏森鲍姆认为这个想法“很下流”。</font>魏森鲍姆的伦理争论虽然起源于催生了人工智能和计算机系统设计领域众多重要创新的实验室，但本文不会详细讨论。他的书以及魏森鲍姆和他的批评者所表达的思想本身就值得考虑。</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1"><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">More serious, to Weizenbaum's way of thinking, was the fact that Colby and others thought that "computer-therapists" might soon be applied to some form of "automatic psychotherapy" -- an idea Weizenbaum considered "obscene."</font> Weizenbaum's ethical debate, although it originated in the same laboratory that spawned so many important innovations in AI and computer systems design, will not be discussed at length here. His books and the ideas expressed by Weizenbaum and his critics deserve consideration on their own accord.</font></font></p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">大卫·罗德曼 (David Rodman) 是那些花时间与 ELIZA 交谈的人之一，当时 ELIZA 还处于起步阶段，他在同一实验室担任研究助理。大卫最早的一些 LISP 黑客行为就是试图模仿 ELIZA。尽管魏森鲍姆不知道，但大卫早期的一些迷幻之旅就是在与 ELIZA “交谈”中度过的。</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">David Rodman was one of those who spent time conversing with ELIZA when it was still in its infancy, while he was employed as a research assistant in the same laboratory.

And although Weizenbaum didn't know it, some of David's early acid trips were spent in "conversation" with ELIZA.</font></font></p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">虽然明斯基是黑客界的守护神，格林布拉特是蓬头垢面的英雄，麦卡锡也有自己的人工智能天才品牌，但魏森鲍姆并不怎么喜欢和他共用工作空间的一些黑客，这只能说是客气一点。在他的书中，他直接抨击了铁杆黑客的核心圈子：</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">While Minsky was a kind of patron saint of hackdom, and Greenblatt was an unkempt hero, and McCarthy had his own brand of AI prodigies, Weizenbaum was not very fond of some of the hackers who shared his working quarters, to put it mildly. In his book, he mounted a direct assault on the inner circle of hard-core hackers:</font></font></p>

      
        <font size="-1"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">计算机中心建立的地方，也就是美国无数地方，以及世界上几乎所有其他工业区，都可以看到衣冠不整、眼窝深陷、目光炯炯的聪明年轻人坐在计算机控制台前，他们的手臂紧绷着，等待着开动，手指随时准备敲击按钮和按键，他们的注意力似乎像赌徒专注于掷骰子一样全神贯注。当他们不那么专注时，他们经常坐在摆满计算机打印件的桌子前，像着了魔的神秘文本学生一样仔细阅读。他们工作到筋疲力尽，一次工作二十、三十个小时。如果他们能安排食物，会有人送上：咖啡、可乐、三明治。如果可能的话，他们会睡在计算机旁边的小床上。但只睡几个小时——然后回到控制台或打印件旁。他们衣衫褴褛，脸色苍白，头发凌乱，这一切都表明他们对自己身体和所处的世界毫不在意。他们只存在于电脑中，至少在如此投入的时候。他们是电脑迷，是强迫性程序员。他们是一个国际现象。</font></font></font>
      

      <div style="text-align:center">
        <font size="-1"><font size="-1">魏森鲍姆攻击那些被他称为“强迫性程序员”的特别痴迷的黑客，理由除了他们不寻常的外表和饮食习惯之外，还有几个。但他也小心翼翼地指出（附带地）：（必须指出，并非所有黑客都是病态强迫性程序员。事实上，如果没有那些自豪地自称“黑客”的人经常以高度创造性的方式工作，那么当今复杂的分时系统、计算机语言翻译器、计算机图形系统等将很少存在。）”</font></font>
      </div>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">根据魏森鲍姆的标准，强迫性程序员花在玩电脑上的时间远远多于用电脑解决他们被雇佣来解决的问题的时间。他承认，他们往往是出色的技术人员，但他也指责他们在记录自己编写的程序时非常马虎，以至于其他程序员在后来使用或修改这些程序时无法理解他们所做的事情。</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">The compulsive programmers, according to Weizenbaum's criteria, spend far more time playing with their computers than using them to solve the problems they are being paid to solve. They are often superb technicians, he admitted, but he also charged that they are very often so sloppy when they document the programs they have written that other programmers, when they later have to use or modify them, are unable to make sense of what they did.</font></font></p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">痴迷的黑客的动机并非解决问题，而是与计算机互动的原始快感，而魏森鲍姆认为，这不是天才的标志，而是病态的标志。他坚持认为：“强迫性程序员只不过是众所周知的疯狂科学家，他被赋予了一座剧院——计算机，他可以在其中实现自己的幻想，而且确实如此。”</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">The obsessed hacker's motivation is not problem-solving, but the raw thrill of interacting with the computer, and that, Weizenbaum charged, was a sign, not of prodigy, but of pathology. "The compulsive programmer," he insisted, "is merely the proverbial mad scientist who has been given a theater, the computer, in which he can, and does, play out his fantasies."</font></font></p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">明斯基和其他人为黑客辩护，指出他们应该被看作是社会对待艺术家时所保留的正常标准。正如眼神空洞的辍学者看起来并不特别令人愉快，而且许多人觉得与机器打交道比与其他人打交道更容易这一指控或许也是事实；他们是否也有可能受到不公平的诽谤？</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">Minsky and others rose to the hackers' defense, pointing out that they should be considered with some of the same suspension of normal standards that society reserves for artists. And just as it is true that a hollow-eyed dropout is not a particularly pleasant sight, and perhaps there is truth to the charge that many of them find it easier to relate to the machine than to other people; isn't there also a chance that they are being unfairly maligned?</font></font></p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">黑客们更愿意根据他们的创造而不是他们的行为来评判他们，没有人关心梵高的穿衣习惯，或者莫扎特是否曾连续几天不睡觉。明斯基谴责公众对那些恰好热衷于编程而不是拉小提琴、打篮球或赚钱的人抱有成见和指责。</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">Hackers would rather be judged by their creations than by their behavior, and nobody cares about van Gogh's habits of dressing, or whether Mozart went without sleep for days at a time. Minsky deplored public stereotyping and scapegoating of people who happen to be passionate about programming instead of violin playing or basketball or making money.</font></font></p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1"><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">毫无疑问，魏森鲍姆关于使用计算机来激发人们对无所不能的幻想而不是对奇妙可控世界的幻想的说法是正确的。</font>痴迷地将复杂的计算机转换成玩具和游戏对社会的价值一直是人们争论不休的问题。没有人会否认黑客喜欢幻想。自从威尔·克劳瑟和唐·伍兹创作的名为“矮人迷雾大厅、XYZZY 和臭名昭著的仓库”的黑客程序（现在更广为人知的名字是“冒险”）在 MAC 和 SAIL 上出现以来，这些幻想也能吸引非黑客多年来一直是一个秘密。</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1"><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Weizenbaum was undoubtedly right about the temptation to use computers for stimulating fantasies of omnipotence over fantastically controllable worlds.</font> The value to society of obsessively converting sophisticated computers into toys and games has been a matter of extended debate. Nobody would deny that hackers love fantasy. That these fantasies can be fascinating to nonhackers as well has been an inside secret for years, ever since the hack known as "Dwarf Hall of Mists, XYZZY and the Infamous Repository," created by Will Crowther and Don Woods, now more commonly known as "Adventure," surfaced at MAC and SAIL.</font></font></p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">在向你介绍 ELIZA 之后，当你问黑客为什么沉迷于计算时，他们会向你展示“<a href="http://www.winternet.com/~radams/adventure/history.html">冒险</a>”。他们敲击几个键，让你坐在显示器和键盘前，几个小时后再回来强行拔掉你的电源。即使在这个计算机生成的效果更加令人眼花缭乱的时代，探索<a href="http://tjwww.stanford.edu/adventure/">计算机存储的幻想的</a>纯粹诱惑仍然很强烈。</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">After they introduce you to ELIZA, "<a href="http://www.winternet.com/~radams/adventure/history.html">Adventure</a>" is what hackers show you when you ask them why they are addicted to computing. They hit a few keys, sit you down in front of a monitor and a keyboard, and come back in a few hours to forcibly unplug you. Even in this age of more dazzling computer-generated effects, the sheer temptation to <a href="http://tjwww.stanford.edu/adventure/">explore the computer-stored fantasy</a> remains strong.</font></font></p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">在被告知你可以给出一些简单的指令，如“放下剑”，“上去”，“过桥”之后，屏幕上会出现以下几个字，这些字在每个计算机中心仍然很常见：“你正站在一条路的尽头，前面有一座小砖砌的建筑。你周围是一片森林。一条小溪从建筑物中流出，流经一条沟壑……”</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">After you are told you can give simple instructions like "drop sword," "go up," "cross bridge," the following words, still famous at every computer center, appear on the screen: "You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">没有任何预兆，也没有任何高分辨率图像或音效，你被带入了巨大的洞穴，那里有迷宫般的房间，里面有宝藏、矮人、魔法、策略和危险，等待着你的指挥。通关一局游戏可能需要数周时间。不止一位评论员用“冒险”来比喻黑客：这是一条隐藏在计算机内部的复杂通道，黑客必须用尽自己的所有技能、知识和魔法来找到宝藏并将其带回来。</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">Without warning, and without any high-resolution graphics or sound effects, you are drawn into Colossal Cave, where a labyrinth of chambers containing treasure, dwarfs, magic, strategy and dangers awaits your command. It can take weeks to finish a game. More than one commentator has used "Adventure" as a metaphor for hacking: This is a complex pathway hidden inside the computer, and it is up to the hacker to use all his or her skill, knowledge, and magic to find the treasure and bring it back.</font></font></p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1"><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">随着黑客文化的传播，以及太空战争和冒险的兴起，对编程技能的高度重视、顽皮的倾向和对玩游戏的偏爱似乎也随之而来。</font>魏森鲍姆可能是第一个，但他并不是最后一个对这种思维方式可能带来的危险副作用表示担忧的计算机科学家。</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1"><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">A high regard for programming skill, a mischievous bent, and a predilection for playing games seemed to accompany the spread of the hacker culture, along with Spacewar and Adventure.</font> Weizenbaum might have been the first, but he wasn't the last computer scientist to voice concern over the possible dangerous side effects of this way of thinking.</font></font></p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">魏森鲍姆最初的长篇大论发表数年后，斯坦福大学爆发了一场著名的辩论。自 20 世纪 60 年代中期以来，斯坦福大学一直是黑客在西海岸的总部，尽管加州大学伯克利分校、洛杉矶分校、圣地亚哥分校和圣巴巴拉分校、斯坦福研究所，甚至在艾尔斯伯格事件发生前的兰德公司早已存在重要的前哨基地。但斯坦福大学的低开销分时系统 (LOTS) 才是本科生黑客们聚集的地方。正是在这里，另一场更近期的重大黑客争议浮出水面，以 20 世纪 70 年代中期被称为“电子邮件”的媒介对话的形式出现。LOTS 上的每个人都可以选择通过邮件程序的“公告板”部分向特定个人或团体或任何感兴趣的人发布和阅读消息。人们只要登录计算机就可以阅读和添加消息。</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">One famous debate erupted at Stanford, years after Weizenbaum's original diatribe. Stanford has been a West Coast headquarters for hackers since the mid-1960s, although significant outposts have long existed at UC Berkeley, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Santa Barbara, at Stanford Research Institute, and even at Rand before the Ellsberg affair. But LOTS -- Stanford's Low Overhead Time-sharing System -- is where the undergraduate hackers hang out. It was here that another, more recent major hacker controversy surfaced, in the form of a dialogue on the medium that was known by the mid-1970s as "electronic mail." It was the option of everybody on LOTS to post and read messages, either to specific individuals or groups, or to anyone who was interested, via the "bulletin board" sector of the mail program. People could read and add messages whenever they were logged onto the computer.</font></font></p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">有时，人们以这种方式讨论严肃的问题，有时，人们针对各种目标（从深刻到完全无关紧要）发表长篇大论（称为“火焰”）。有时，严肃的问题被伪装成火焰，反之亦然。这种交流的分支和子分支可能会持续数月，形成一种电子嵌入的临时文献。这就是“黑客论文”的由来。</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">Sometimes serious issues were discussed in this manner, and sometimes long impassioned graffiti (known as "flames") were launched against a variety of targets ranging from the profound to the utterly inconsequential. Sometimes serious issues were disguised as flames, and vice versa. Branches and subbranches of such exchanges could continue for months, making up a kind of electronically embedded ad hoc literature. That was where the "hacker papers" came from.</font></font></p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">这篇由黑客撰写的关于黑客主题的激烈争论之所以受到“现实世界”的关注，是因为一位名叫<a href="http://www-ctl.stanford.edu/lectures/awtts95/zimbardo.html">菲利普·津巴多 (Philip Zimbardo)的斯坦福大学心理学教授发现了这篇对话，并于 1980 年在</a><i>《今日心理学》</i>杂志上发表了它及其评论。二十年后，罗德曼在 26 号楼遇到了格林布拉特等人。</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">This particular counterpoint of flames on the subject of hackers, written by hackers, came to the attention of the "real world" because a Stanford professor of psychology named <a href="http://www-ctl.stanford.edu/lectures/awtts95/zimbardo.html">Philip Zimbardo</a> discovered the dialogue and published it, with commentary, in <i>Psychology Today</i> magazine in 1980, twenty years after Rodman met Greenblatt et al. in Building 26.</font></font></p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">这场争执始于黑客版本的路德 95 条论纲，这被比喻为钉在电子圣殿的大门上。一位自称是前黑客的自称“G. Gandalf”（传统上在公共邮件渠道上给自己起一个假名，就像公民电台亚文化中使用的“昵称”）的人发布了一篇题为“黑客随笔”的公告，其中包括：</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">The exchange of flames began with a hacker's version of Luther's 95 theses, nailed, metaphorically, to the door of the electronic temple. A self-sworn ex-hacker who called himself "G. Gandalf" (the tradition is to give oneself a pseudonym on the public mail channel, like the "handles" used in the citizen's-band radio subculture) posted a bulletin entitled "Essay on Hacking," that said, among other things:</font></font></p>

          <font size="-1"><font size="-1"><span style="font-size:small">斯坦福大学中心有一座巨大的混凝土和玻璃建筑，里面装满了计算机终端。当你从玻璃门进入这座建筑时，你就进入了一种不同的文化。五十个人盯着终端屏幕。五十张脸连接着五十具身体，身体又连接着五十组手指，这些手指敲击着最终连接到计算机的五十个键盘……这些亚文化的成员对于大多数局外人来说是如此陌生，以至于它不仅将自己与外界隔绝，而且还被那些无法理解它的人所隔绝。这堵墙是从两边同时修建的。</span></font></font>

        <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">这些人值得描述。他们很少显得平庸。首先，他们都很聪明，事实上，他们聪明到在对计算机产生兴趣之前就遇到了社会问题。其次，他们自给自足。他们的整个社会生活通常以彼此为中心。……第三，他们生活的各个方面都相互促进。他们上学是为了学习计算机，他们从事编程和计算机维护工作，他们与黑客一起过着社交生活。无论是在学术上、社交上还是在金钱世界中，计算机都是他们生活的中心。</font></font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">These people deserve a description. In very few ways do they seem average. First they are all bright, so bright, in fact, that they experienced social problems even before they became interested in computers. Second, they are self-contained. Their entire social existence usually centers around one another. . . . Third, all aspects of their existence reinforce one another. They go to school in order to learn about computers, they work at jobs in programming and computer maintenance, and they lead their social lives with hackers. Academically, socially, and in the world of cash, computers are the focus of their existence.</font></font></font></p>
      

      <div style="text-align:center">
        <font size="-1"><font size="-1">正如人们所料，这篇长篇大论并没有被忽视。像往常一样，人们的意见分歧很大。有些人——当然是少数人——完全同意这种异端邪说。黑客作为一个群体，热衷于异端邪说、偶像破坏主义，喜欢争论某件事是否是异端邪说，即使——尤其是——话题与黑客本身有关。</font></font>
      </div>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">在那些反驳甘道夫的人中，一位被称为“匿名者”的人提出了西海岸版本的“明斯基辩护”：</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">Of those who rebutted Gandalf, the one known as "A. Anonymous" offered the West Coast version of the "Minsky defense":</font></font></p>

      
        <div style="text-align:center">
          <font size="-1"><font size="-1"><span style="font-size:small">我们正在处理一种具有无限可塑性的工具。选择开发和使用该工具的人，无论是为了工作、娱乐还是两者兼而有之，都有这种选择，这是不可否认的。选择成为音乐家的人必须投入大量时间来获得足够的专业知识。但你会认为计算机黑客的创造力不如这样的人吗？我当然不会。计算机不仅是一台主力机，也是锻炼创造力的画架。因此，在我看来，黑客并没有限制自己。相反，他拓展了自己的知识视野，因为他现在拥有了无限的工具。</span></font></font>
        </div>

        <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">至于有人指责它扰乱了人们的社交生活，我在某种程度上倾向于同意这一点。但这取决于个人的控制程度。在任何时候，他都可以回到更正常的时间表。他为什么不这样做呢？原因很明显。这个不受任何限制的无限工具的可访问程度要高得多，因此他可以投入更多时间。为什么这是错误的？我认为这绝对是一个好处，因为通常朝九晚五的限制被消除了，人们可以超越界限去做他想做的事。</font></font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">As for the charge that it disrupts one's social life, I would tend to agree with this to a point. But it depends on how controlled the individual is. At any time, he can withdraw to a more normal schedule. Why doesn't he? The reason is obvious. The infinite tool that knows few boundaries is accessible to a much higher degree, and thus he can devote more time to it. Why is this wrong? I think it is definitely a bonus, since the usual restraints of 9-to-5 are eliminated and the person is allowed to expand beyond boundaries to do what he wants.</font></font></font></p>

        <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">现在我们来谈谈人机因素。甘道夫强调人机互动的必要性和机器固有的邪恶性。你会强调管弦乐队的乐器、实验室的仪器或作家的打字机的邪恶性吗？所有这些职业都需要投入大量时间才能取得卓越成就。但我认为这些领域中的人机互动没有比计算机更甚的了。我觉得那些因为计算机似乎减少了人机互动而贬低计算机的人根本不了解计算机的真正意义。它不仅是无限的工具，而且是一种极其流畅的交流媒介。</font></font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">Now we come to the human versus the machine factor. Gandalf stresses the necessity of human interaction and the inherent evil of the machine. Would you stress the evil of instruments in an orchestra, or the instruments in a laboratory, or the typewriter of an author? All of these occupations demand extraordinary amounts of time for excellence. But I see no greater human interaction in these fields than in computers. I feel that people who disparage computers for a seemingly decreased human interaction are not at all familiar with the true import of the computer. Not only is it the infinite tool, it is also an extremely fluid medium of communication.</font></font></font></p>
      

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">争议的发表在 ARPAnet 和当地计算机中心引发了电子邮件的狂潮。到 1983 年，黑客之争已经蔓延到业余“公告板计算机”领域，当时电影<i>《战争游戏》和随后出现的现实生活中的年轻计算机系统“破解者”让“</i><i>黑客”</i>一词受到了公众的广泛关注，而黑客一词则以这种较新的、令人不快的受限含义出现。</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">The publication of the controversy set off an avalanche of electronic mail over the ARPAnet and at local computer centers. The hacker debates had spread to the amateur "bulletin board computers" by 1983, when the movie <i>WarGames</i> and the real-life young computer-systems "crackers" who subsequently surfaced brought the word <i>hacker</i> to widespread public attention, in this newer, unpleasantly restricted sense.</font></font></p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">游戏最古老的规则之一是“你不得对普通计算机用户做你对其他黑客所做的事情。”几乎所有老牌黑客都谴责年轻的计算机入侵者和破坏者所做的事情——“黑暗黑客”——尽管无政府主义者少数派仍然坚持认为最终的自由是弄清楚通信计算系统如何工作的自由，并宣称保护非法入侵的责任应该由需要保护文件的系统程序员承担，而不是由可能在半夜通过网络窃听的探险者承担。</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">One of the oldest rules of the game is "thou shalt not do unto ordinary computer users what thou hast done to other hackers." Almost all of the old-time hackers deplore what the young computer trespassers and crashers did -- "dark-side hacking" -- although the anarchist minority still insist that the ultimate freedom is the freedom to figure out how the communication-computing system works, and declare that the burden of protection against trespassing ought to be on the system programmer who has files to protect, not on the explorer who might tap in during some midnight jaunt through the network.</font></font></p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1"><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">除了真正的计算机罪犯之外，非计算机界人士对黑客争议的关注确实看起来有点奇怪。</font>毕竟，这些人并没有被指控犯有破坏或纵火罪——只是在知道如何操作计算机方面非常聪明。在一个大多数人被引导相信计算机要么比他们更聪明，要么对普通人来说太复杂而无法使用的文化中，寻找替罪羊的能力非常高。斯坦福大学津巴多的同事詹姆斯·米洛伊科维奇 (James Milojkovic) 正在撰写有关微型计算机对认知和动机影响的心理学博士论文，他为黑客辩护。</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1"><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Real computer criminals aside, the concern of the noncomputing public over the hacker controversy does seem a bit strange.</font> After all, these people aren't accused of mayhem or arson -- just of being very smart when it comes to knowing how to operate computers. The capacity for scapegoating is very high in a culture where most people have been led to believe that computers are either smarter than they are or too complicated for ordinary people to use. James Milojkovic, an associate of Zimbardo's at Stanford who was writing his psychology doctoral thesis about the cognitive and motivational impact of the microcomputer, came to the hackers' defense.</font></font></p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">在 1982 年的一次采访中，米洛科维奇说他花了很多时间与黑客打交道，并没有发现他们所做的事情有什么病态。对于公众对黑客（非犯罪）可能构成威胁的担忧，他说：“这显然是无稽之谈。我认为现在的情况是，人们有某种恐惧，担心他们对机器所做的事可能是为了针对我们。”和“匿名者”一样，米洛科维奇认为学习方面有点强迫性没什么不好：“我认为没有什么比爱上知识更自然的了，”他说，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">“而黑客对计算机知识的热爱是如此之深，以至于他们完全被迷住了。”</font></font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">In a 1982 interview, Milojkovic said he spent plenty of time around hackers, and saw nothing pathological about what they were doing. In regard to all the public concern about what threat (noncriminal) hackers might pose, he said "clearly it's nonsense. I think what's happening is that there's some sort of fear that maybe what they're doing with the machines is aimed against us." Like "A. Anonymous," Milojkovic sees nothing wrong with a little compulsiveness in regard to learning: "I can think of nothing more natural than to fall in love with knowledge," he said, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"and hackers are so deeply in love with knowledge of the computers that they're just swept off their feet."</font></font></font></p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">举个例子：大卫·罗德曼。我们上次见到他时，他潜伏在 MacHack 与 Dreyfus 比赛的幕后，是一名瘾君子、辍学的青少年黑客，几乎可以肯定，他未来会成为眼窝深陷的电脑迷。事实上，事实恰恰相反。即使只有 16 岁，他作为一名自由程序员也过得相当不错。他收到了一些为社会服务官员建立计算机系统的工作邀请，因此他在 20 岁出头的时候搬到了华盛顿特区。</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">A case in point: David Rodman. When last we saw him, lurking in the background of the MacHack versus Dreyfus match, an acidhead teenage dropout hacker, he was almost certainly headed for a sunken-eyed, computer-nut future. In fact, quite the opposite turned out to be the case. He was doing quite well for himself, even at sixteen, as a freelance programmer. He got some offers to set up computer systems for social service bureaucrats, so he moved to D.C. in his early twenties.</font></font></p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">到了 1972 年，大卫发现自己陷入了困扰赫尔曼·霍勒瑞斯的同一个问题——处理庞大的数据库。事实上，设计美国人口普查信息（现在存储在磁带上）的探测器是大卫的专长。他回到剑桥，为一家软件智库工作，为几家他不愿透露姓名的机构工作过，1978 年，他决定是时候将他所知道的东西变成可销售的产品了。</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">By 1972, David found himself up to his ears in the same problem that plagued Herman Hollerith -- handling huge data bases. In fact, designing probes of the U.S. Census information, now stored on magnetic tape, was David's specialty. He moved back to Cambridge to work for a software think tank, did more than a few jobs for agencies he doesn't want to name, and in 1978 he decided it was time to turn what he knew into a marketable product.</font></font></p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">大卫·罗德曼最终创建并营销了一种数据库管理工具，他设计的这个程序是供微型计算机所有者使用的。因此，他是众多在消费计算繁荣初期加入软件行业的前隐居程序员之一，当时程序员转型为企业家仍有可能迅速走得更远。1978 年，另外几位年长的麻省理工学院黑客推出了 VisiCalc——一种允许用户对数字数据提出“假设”问题的“电子表格”——数百万从未接触过键盘的人开始解决以前只有大型机程序员才能解决的问题。</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">David Rodman ended up creating and marketing a tool for managing data bases, a program that he designed to be usable by microcomputer owners. Thus he was one of many formerly sequestered programmers who joined the software business at the beginning of the consumer computing boom, when it was still possible for a programmer-turned-entrepreneur to go far and fast. A couple of other, older, MIT hackers put out VisiCalc in 1978 -- the "electronic spreadsheet" that allows users to ask "what-if" questions about numerical data -- and millions of people who had never touched a keyboard before began tackling problems that had formerly been reserved for mainframe programmers.</font></font></p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">我第一次见到大卫·罗德曼是在 20 世纪 80 年代初，因为他那奇怪的笑容。我知道他的名字，因为这个名字印在他翻领上的塑料卡片上。他皱巴巴的西装和会议徽章并不能完全表明他是一个豪赌客，但他的笑容却表现出一种近乎疯狂的自信。我们站在宏伟的赌场里，它位于希尔顿大堂和拉斯维加斯会议中心的室内走道之间，位置便利。每天，有五万多人参加 Comdex，这是微型计算机行业的全国性会议，他们成群结队地穿过赌场。到达的计算机专家们并不介意花钱，他们是一群和蔼可亲的人。他们中的很多人看起来非常<i>开心</i>。例如，大卫·罗德曼在离开骰子桌后仍然面带微笑。</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">I first met David Rodman in the early 1980s, because of his strange grin. I knew his name because it was stamped onto the plastic card that was pinned to his lapel. His rumpled suit and convention badge didn't exactly mark him as a high roller, but his smile projected a self-assurance of almost demented intensity. We were standing in the magnificent casino that is conveniently located between the Hilton lobby and the indoor walkway to the Las Vegas convention center. Upward of fifty thousand people attending Comdex, a national convention for the microcomputer industry, trooped through the casino every day. The arriving computerists didn't mind spending their money, and they were an amiable group. A lot of them seemed downright <i>happy</i>. David Rodman, for example, was still smiling after he turned away from the craps table.</font></font></p>

        <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">“我对骰子的判断是错误的，”他回答道，“但我已经领先很多了，没有理由抱怨。”</font></font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">"I was wrong about the dice," he replied, "but I'm too far ahead to complain."</font></font></font></p>

      <div style="text-align:center">
        <font size="-1"><font size="-1">考虑到他刚刚在不到十秒钟的时间里输掉了一百美元，他在大会上赚钱的速度比在赌场输钱的速度快，他肯定做得非常好。他脸上的歪嘴笑，与我在赌桌上看到的那种略带疯狂的表情相似，清楚地表明他并不介意谈论他的生意。</font></font>
      </div>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">我们互相认识，最终我了解到他在成为一家软件公司的主力和主要资产之前做过什么。没有任何迹象表明他曾是 MAC 黑客、瘾君子和未具名情报机构的前顾问。他满脸雀斑，秃顶，仅剩的头发又短又梳理整齐。他的胡子刮得很干净，他的装扮和会计师或小部件销售员的装扮相差无几。但在他内心深处，他仍然是一名黑客，而且是一名福音传道者。</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">We got to know each other, and eventually I learned about what he did before he was the prime mover and chief asset of a software corporation. There was no sign that he was an ex-MAC hacker, ex-acidhead, ex-consultant to unnamed intelligence agencies. He was freckled, balding, and what hair he had left was short and neatly combed. He was clean-shaven, and his attire wouldn't have been out of place on an accountant or a widget salesman. But in his heart, he was still a hacker, and an evangelistic one at that.</font></font></p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1"><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">当我们讲完这个故事并谈到他现在的产品时，很明显他并没有放弃编程事业，而只是想扩大它，为了自己的利益，让数百万人直接体验到让他重返 26 号楼的相同体验。</font></font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1"><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">By the time we got through the story to the point of talking about his current product, it was clear that he had not turned his back on the programming priesthood, but was merely interested in expanding it, to his own profit, by giving millions of people a direct taste of the same experience that hooked him back in Building 26.</font></font></font></p>

      <p style="text-align:center"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">“我记得我学习爵士即兴演奏的方式，以及这对我的编程的影响。当我第一次学习时，我对自己说，‘我现在处于这个和弦中，我必须达到这个和弦。’过渡，从一个音符跳到另一个音符或将变量从一个过程传递到另一个过程的方式——这就是音乐家或程序员的个人风格所在。很多时候什么都没有发生。但是当我的老师向我展示一些我以前没有意识到的东西时，指出某个音符会以我意想不到的方式工作，例如，我会感到有点震惊，下一次我遇到过渡时，我会放松对有意识的努力，试图重新获得那种震惊，然后就会出现我需要的音符或代码行。</font></font></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font size="-1"><font size="-1">"I remember the way I learned jazz improvisation, and how that affected my programming. When I was first learning, I said to myself, 'Here I am in this chord, and I've got to get to that chord.' The transition, the way you hop from note to note or pass a variable from procedure to procedure -- that's where the individual style of the musician or the programmer comes in. Nothing happened, a lot of the time. But when my teacher showed me something I hadn't realized before, pointed out that a certain note would work in a way I wasn't expecting, for instance, I would get a little shock of understanding, and the next time I came to a transition I'd loosen my grip on my conscious effort and try to recapture that shock, and there would be the note or the line of code I needed.</font></font></p>

      1945 年夏末，日本投降后不久，恩格尔巴特是一名 20 岁的美国海军雷达技术员，正在等待从菲律宾回国的船。一个闷热的日子，他走进了一座红十字图书馆，这座图书馆建在高架上，就像一个土著小屋。
    </font></font><font size="+2">范尼瓦尔布什</font>

    <font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">
      “里面很安静、凉爽、通风，有很多抛光的竹子和书籍。在那里我偶然看到了范尼瓦尔·布什的那篇文章，”恩格尔巴特回忆道。三十多年后，他仍然深情地记得他第一次遇到那个占据了他大部分人生的梦想的房间。当时，广岛的新闻仍然新鲜而刺眼。他发现自己想知道，制造核弹的相同创造力是否可以用来防止未来发生此类破坏。恩格尔巴特于 1951 年开始设计基于计算机的问题解决系统。他至今仍未停止。

      </font></font><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">最早、最清晰地阐述了信息处理技术可用于增强人类记忆和思维的观点的是道格在 1945 年那天发现的一篇题为《<a href="http://www.isg.sfu.ca/~duchier/misc/vbush/">正如我们所想</a>》的文章，该文章发表于战争末期的<i>《大西洋月刊》</i>。作者是美国战争行动中级别最高的科学管理人员万尼瓦尔·布什 (Vannevar Bush)。</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The earliest and one of the clearest articulations of the idea that information processing technology could be used to amplify human memory and thinking was the one Doug found that day in 1945, in an article entitled "<a href="http://www.isg.sfu.ca/~duchier/misc/vbush/">As We May Think</a>," published toward the end of the war in <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>. The author was the highest-ranking scientific administrator in the U.S. war effort, Vannevar Bush.</font></p>

      <p>布什是美国海军的儿子和孙子，他也是 20 世纪 30 年代在麻省理工学院制造模拟计算机的数学家。在第二次世界大战期间，他还担任研究与发展办公室主任，负责管理 6000 多名美国科学家。他最重要的两个目标是启动曼哈顿计划和找到阻止德国轰炸的方法，这两个目标都直接加速了计算机的发明。讽刺的是，布什在撰写文章时并没有提到早期计算机作为信息处理设备的潜力。但他确实提出了一个多年后结出硕果的想法——一种类似科幻小说的通用工具的描述，可以帮助我们跟踪我们所知道的内容。</p><p>Bush, the son and grandson of Yankee seafarers, was the same mathematician who had constructed analog computers at MIT in the 1930s. He was also in charge of over 6000 U.S. scientists during World War II, as director of the Office of Research and Development. His two most important goals were starting the Manhattan project and finding a means to stop German bombing, goals that both directly hastened the invention of computing machinery. Ironically, Bush didn't mention the potential of the early computers as information-handling devices when he wrote his article. But he did present an idea that was to bear fruit many years later -- a description of a science-fiction-like general-purpose tool to help us keep track of what we know.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">展望战后世界，布什预见到，最近在科学技术方面取得的突破将带来自身的问题。所有这些科学家以前所未有的速度创造了所有这些知识，人们如何才能跟踪所有这些知识？如果没有人知道如何获取所需的信息，那么这些迅速扩展的知识体系又将如何使人们受益呢？</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Looking toward the postwar world, Bush foresaw that recent breakthroughs in science and technology were going to create problems of their own. With all these scientists producing all this knowledge at an unprecedented rate, how was anyone to keep track of it all? How would this rapidly expanding body of knowledge benefit anybody if nobody knew how to get the information they needed?</font></p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">布什写道：“人类经验的积累正以惊人的速度扩展，我们用来穿越随之而来的迷宫找到当前重要事项的方法与横帆船时代的方法是一样的。”</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"The summation of human experience is being expanded at a prodigious rate, and the means we use for threading through the consequent maze to the momentarily important item is the same as was used in the days of square-rigged ships," Bush wrote.</font></p><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">他敦促科学家们致力于使日益庞大的人类知识积累更容易被个人所利用。

      </font></font><p>但布什预见的未来技术超出了科学的范畴，延伸到了普通民众。有一天，不仅科学家，普通民众也需要探索越来越复杂的信息领域。布什在《大西洋月刊》上<i>提出</i>，应该开发一种装置，提高人类思维质量的装置。由于这种机器的功能之一是扩展人类记忆，所以布什将他假想的机器称为 memex <i>。</i>但布什是第一批看到快速获取大量信息的作用远不止简单扩展记忆的人之一。尽管他用 20 世纪 40 年代的原始信息技术来描述它，但 memex 的功能与现在的个人计算机非常相似 — — 甚至更多。</p><p>But the future technology that Bush foresaw extended beyond the borders of science to the ordinary citizenry. The day was coming when not only scientists but ordinary citizens would be required to navigate through ever-more complicated realms of information. In the pages of the <i>Atlantic</i>, Bush proposed that a certain device should be developed, a device to improve the quality of human thinking. Because one of its functions was to extend human memory, Bush called his hypothetical machine a <i>memex</i>. But Bush was one of the first to see that rapid access to large amounts of information could serve as much more than a simple extension of memory. Although he described it in terms of the primitive information technologies of the 1940s, the memex was functionally similar to what is now known as the personal computer -- and more.</p>

      <p>有些想法就像种子，或者病毒。如果它们在合适的时间传播开来，就会感染那些最容易将生命投入到这些想法中的人。知识扩展技术的概念就是其中之一。布什在《<i>大西洋</i>月刊》上发表文章 15 年后，<a href="#OEBPS/Text/7.html">JCR Licklider</a>发表了关于将计算机变成通信媒介的文章。但就在布什发表文章 5 年后，道格·恩格尔巴特 (Doug Engelbart) 受到创造思维扩展工具的想法的影响，萌生了自己关于如何使用机器增强人类智能的想法。</p><p>Some ideas are like seeds. Or viruses. If they are in the air at the right time, they will infect exactly those people who are most susceptible to putting their lives in the idea's service. The notion of a knowledge-extending technology was one of those ideas. Fifteen years after Bush published his <i>Atlantic</i> article, <a href="#OEBPS/Text/7.html">J. C. R. Licklider</a> published his article about making computers into a communication medium. But only five years after Bush's article, Doug Engelbart, infected by the idea of creating a mind-extending tool, incubated his own ideas about how to use machines to augment human intelligence.</p>

      <p>战后，恩格尔巴特凭借电气工程学位和雷达经验，在加利福尼亚州的艾姆斯实验室找到了一份工作，为 NASA 的前身之一——美国国家航空咨询委员会工作。在艾姆斯实验室工作了几年后，他向在那里遇到的一位女士求婚。</p><p>After the war, with an electrical engineering degree and his experience with radar, Engelbart found a job at Ames Laboratory in California, working on contracts for one of NASA's ancestors, the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics. After a couple of years at Ames, he asked a woman he met there to marry him.</p>

      <p>“订婚后的那个星期一，”恩格尔巴特今天回忆道，“我开车上班时突然意识到，<i>我不再有任何目标了</i>。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">作为一个在大萧条中长大的孩子，我被灌输了三个目标：接受教育、找到一份稳定的工作、结婚。现在我实现了它们。什么都不剩了。”</font></p><p>"The Monday after we got engaged," Engelbart remembers today, "I was driving to work when I was hit with the shocking realization that <i>I no longer had any goals</i>. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">As a kid who had grown up in the depression, I was imbued with three goals -- get an education, get a steady job, get married. Now I had achieved them. Nothing was left."</font></p>

      <p>当道格·恩格尔巴特发现值得思考的事情时，他往往会认真思考。当然，他自己的生活也不容忽视。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">当他沿着一条双车道铺装道路（现已成为高速公路）行驶时，他估计自己一生中还剩下大约 550 万分钟的工作时间。他真正想从这项投资中获得什么价值？</font> 1950 年 12 月，25 岁​​的他开始思考可以为自己设定哪些新目标。</p><p>Doug Engelbart tends to think seriously about things when he finds something worth thinking about. And his own life is certainly not exempt from being an object of serious thinking. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">While he drove along a two-lane paved road that is now a freeway, he reckoned that he had about five and a half million working minutes remaining in his life. What value did he really want from that investment?</font> At the age of twenty-five, in December of 1950, he started to think about what new goals he might set for himself.</p>

      <p>“在做决定的早期，我就放弃了把钱当作目标的想法。在我的成长经历中，如果你有足够的钱过日子，那就没问题；我从未见过有钱人。但到了 1950 年，我发现世界变化太快，我们的问题越来越大，所以我决定寻找一个能给人类带来最大回报的人生目标。”</p><p>"I dismissed money as a goal fairly early in the decision process. The way I grew up, if you had enough money to get by, that was okay; I never knew anybody who was rich. But by 1950, it looked to me like the world was changing so fast, and our problems were getting so much bigger, that I decided to look for a goal in life that would have the most payoff for mankind."</p>

      <p>在决定投身于一个适当的人道主义事业后的几个月里，道格一直在寻找合适的事业。他仔细考虑了自己的处境和技能，思考了自己可能参加的各种运动。凭借雷达训练和开始学习的计算机知识，恩格尔巴特也在寻找一项不需要他重读工程学教育或搬离新家太远的事业。他的工作很有挑战性，上班的车程也很愉快。圣克拉拉谷仍然是世界上最大的梅子园，电子行业最近才从帕洛阿尔托的几个车库里搬出来。开车让他有时间思考。</p><p>For several months after he made the decision to commit himself to an appropriately humanitarian enterprise, Doug searched for the right one. He contemplated his situation and skills and thought about the various kinds of crusades he might join. With his radar training, and what he was beginning to learn about computers, Engelbart was also looking for a cause that wouldn't require him to retread his engineering education, or move too far away from his new home. He had a challenging job and a pleasant drive to work. Santa Clara Valley was still the world's largest prune orchard, and the electronics industry had only recently moved out of a couple of garages in Palo Alto. The drive gave him time to think.</p>

      <p>最终，他所吸引的那种十字军东征仍然不能满足他的需求：没有明确的方法来组织一个人的思想来开展十字军东征。他是一名工程师，而不是一名政治组织者，这个世界变得太复杂了，除了最有组织的十字军东征之外，其他任何事情都无法进行。突然间，道格意识到他一次又一次地遇到同样的根本问题。</p><p>Ultimately, the kinds of crusades that appealed to him still didn't satisfy his needs: there weren't clear-cut ways of organizing one's thoughts to run a crusade. He was an engineer, not a political organizer, and the world was becoming too complicated for anything but the most well-organized crusades. Suddenly, Doug recognized that he was running into the same fundamental issue over and over again.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">恩格尔巴特和万尼瓦尔·布什都意识到，人类正在进入一个新时代，全球问题的复杂性和紧迫性超越了处理问题的传统工具。</font>几年后，利克莱德也开始明白，处理解决问题所产生的信息副产品本身已成为解决所有其他问题的关键。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">最重要的任务不再是设计新方法来扩大我们的知识积累，而是知道在哪里寻找已经存储在某个地方的答案。</font> “如果你能提高我们处理复杂问题的能力，你就对帮助人类产生了重大影响。这就是我想要的回报，所以我开始这么做。”</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Engelbart realized, as had Vannevar Bush, that humankind was moving into an era in which the complexity and urgency of global problems were surpassing time-honored tools for dealing with problems.</font> He also began to understand, as did Licklider a few years later, that handling the informational by-products of problem-solving had itself become the key to all the other problems. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The most important task no longer lay in devising new ways to expand our accumulation of knowledge, but in knowing where to look for the answers that were already stored somewhere.</font> "If you can improve our capacity to deal with complicated problems, you've made a significant impact on helping humankind. That was the kind of payoff I wanted, so that's what I set out to do."</p>

      <p>尽管许多细节问题花了几十年才解决，但他想要实现的目标的主要要素一下子就浮现在他的脑海里：“当我第一次听说计算机时，根据我的雷达经验，我明白，如果这些机器可以向你显示穿孔卡片和纸质打印件上的信息，它们就可以在屏幕上书写或绘制这些信息。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">当我看到阴极射线屏幕、信息处理器和向人表示符号的媒介之间的联系时，大约半个小时后，一切都理清了。</font></p><p>Although many of the details took decades to work out, the main elements of what he wanted to achieve came to him all at once: "When I first heard about computers, I understood, from my radar experience, that if these machines can show you information on punchcards and printouts on paper, they could write or draw that information on a screen. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">When I saw the connection between a cathode-ray screen, an information processor, and a medium for representing symbols to a person, it all tumbled together in about half an hour.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">“我开始设计一个系统，在这个系统中，计算机在屏幕上为你绘制符号，你可以用旋钮、杠杆和传感器操纵它穿越不同的领域。如果你有一个像 Vannevar Bush 建议的那样的系统，你可能会想做各种各样的事情——例如，如何将它扩展到一个类似剧院的环境，在那里你可以和同事坐在一起交换信息。天哪！想想看，这会让你在解决问题时多么轻松自在！”</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"I started sketching a system in which computers draw symbols on the screen for you, and you can steer it through different domains with knobs and levers and transducers. I was designing all kinds of things you might want to do if you had a system like the one Vannevar Bush had suggested -- how to expand it to a theater-like environment, for example, where you could sit with a colleague and exchange information. God! Think of how that would let you cut loose in solving problems!"</font></p>

      <p>道格·恩格尔巴特 (Doug Engelbart) 追求梦想已三十年，但梦想却一直被计算机行业所忽视。当他谈起自己 25 岁时预见并一直追求的前景时，他仍然无法抑制自己柔和声音中的兴奋和眼神中的茫然。但他不确定，拥有各种花哨硬件的当今一代计算机专家是否更接近真正的问题。</p><p>After thirty often-frustrating years of pursuing a dream that the computer industry has long ignored, Doug Engelbart still can't keep the excitement out of his soft voice and the faraway look out of his eyes when he talks about the prospects he foresaw at twenty-five, and has pursued ever since. But he's not sure whether today's generation of computerists, with all their fancy hardware, are getting any closer to the real issues.</p>

      <p>尽管历史证明道格·恩格尔巴特在许多方面都是一位准确的梦想家，但或许在项目和人事管理方面并不理想，甚至他的朋友也用“固执”这个词来形容他对理论的态度，但道格·恩格尔巴特仍然拥有一个安静的人的力量。他长期设想的目标对他来说仍然具有强大的吸引力，强大到当他谈论它时，仍然散发出很大的吸引力。1971 年，他的朋友尼洛·林德格伦在<i>《创新》</i>杂志上这样描述他：</p><p>Although history has proved him to be an accurate visionary in many ways, but perhaps a less-than-ideal manager of projects and people, and even his friends use the word "stubborn" in describing his attitudes about his theories, Doug Engelbart still wields the power of a quiet person. The magnetism of his long-envisioned goal is still strong for him, so strong that a good deal of it still radiates when he talks about it. In 1971, his friend Nilo Lindgren described him in <i>Innovation</i> magazine:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">当他微笑时，他的脸上充满着忧郁和孩子气，但一旦他向前移动的精力停止并停下来思考，他那双淡蓝色的眼睛似乎流露出悲伤或孤独。道格·恩格尔巴特问候你时的声音低沉而柔和，仿佛长途跋涉后变得沉闷，仿佛他的话语被层层冥想所减弱。这个人身上有一种羞怯而温暖的感觉，他的性格中有一种温柔而固执的感觉，赢得了人们的尊重。</font>
      

      <p>“他让我想起了摩西分开红海的情景，”<a href="#OEBPS/Text/1.html1">艾伦·凯</a>这样描述恩格尔巴特的温和魅力。当然，最初的摩西从未踏上应许之地。他也从来都不是一个容易共事的人。</p><p>"He reminds me of Moses parting the Red Sea," is the way <a href="#OEBPS/Text/1.html1">Alan Kay</a> describes Engelbart's gentle charisma. Of course, the original Moses never set foot in the promised Land. And he never had the reputation of being an easy man to work with.</p>

      <p>1951 年，恩格尔巴特辞去了艾姆斯研究所的工作，前往加州大学伯克利分校攻读研究生，当时第一台冯·诺依曼架构计算机正在该校制造。就在那时，他开始注意到，人们不仅不知道他在说什么，而且一些本应“客观”的科学家也对他抱有过度的敌意。他开始对那些可能影响他职业生涯的人说错话，而这些话在其他电子工程师看来简直是奇怪。</p><p>In 1951, Engelbart quit his job at Ames and went to graduate school at the University of California at Berkeley, where one of the first von Neumann architecture computers was being built. That was when he began to notice that not only didn't people know what he was talking about, but some presumably "objective" scientists were overly hostile. He started saying the wrong things to people who could affect his career, things that simply sounded strange to the other electrical engineers.</p>

      <p>“当我们制造出计算机时，”这位年轻的工程师不断问道，“我可以用它来<i>教</i>人吗？我可以把它连接到键盘上，让人与计算机互动吗？也许教人打字？”心理学家认为这很棒，但计算机几乎不是他们的部门。工程人员说：“这种想法不可能实现。”</p><p>"When we get the computer built," this young engineer kept asking, "would it be okay if I use it to <i>teach</i> people? Could I hook it up to a keyboard and get a person to interact with the computer? Maybe teach the person typing?" The psychology people thought it was great, but computers were hardly their department. The engineering people said, "There's no way that kind of idea is going to fly."</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">互动的东西太疯狂了，以至于了解计算机的人都不想听。</font>那时候，即使你是一名程序员，你也不会与计算机互动。你以一盒打孔卡的形式向它提出你的问题，如果你非常努力地正确地陈述问题，你就会得到答案。计算机不是用来直接互动的。而用它们来帮助人们<font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>学习</i></font><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">的想法简直是亵渎。<i></i></font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The interactive stuff was so wild that the people who knew about computers didn't want to hear about it.</font> Back then, you didn't interact with a computer, even if you were a programmer. You gave it your question, in the form of a box of punched cards, and if you had worked very hard at stating the question correctly, you got your answer. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Computers weren't meant for direct interaction. And this idea of using them to help people <i>learn</i> was downright blasphemy.</font></p>

      <p>获得博士学位后，恩格尔巴特又一次遭遇了人生中由内心触发的决策点，而他的梦想继续引领着他。他所在部门的所有人都不愿意听他谈论如何建立一种更好的方法来解决复杂的问题，他觉得在开始他真正想做的研究之前，他必须建立一个全新的学科。恩格尔巴特认为，大学是他获得熟练工证的地方，而不是实现他的梦想的地方。</p><p>After he got his doctorate, Engelbart came to another one of those internally triggered decision points in his life that his dream continued to bring his way. Nobody in his department wanted to listen to talk about building a better way to solve complex problems, and he felt that he would have to construct a whole new academic discipline before he could begin the research he really wanted to do. The university, Engelbart decided, was a place to get his journeyman's card, but not a place to follow his vision.</p>

      <p>于是，年轻的恩格尔巴特博士走向了商界，寻找开发电子系统的机会，这些电子系统最终将帮助他实现增强人类智力的梦想，而且，当他为市场化设备的开发做出贡献时，他也能获得食宿费用。恩格尔巴特将他的一些想法带到了帕洛阿尔托一家年轻的进步公司。这里的人都着眼于未来，这改变了一切。比尔·休利特、大卫·帕卡德和巴尼·奥利弗（他们的研发主管）都是电气工程学校毕业没十年的人，他们对道格的提议很感兴趣。他们提出了交易。恩格尔巴特兴高采烈地开车回家。在回家的路上，道格以典型的恩格尔巴特方式开始思考这件事。</p><p>Thus, young Doctor Engelbart went to the commercial world, looking for an opportunity to develop electronic systems that would eventually help him do what he wanted in terms of augmenting human intellect, and would pay his room and board as he contributed to the development of marketable devices as well. Engelbart brought some of his ideas to a progressive young company down the road in Palo Alto. For a change, here were some people looking to the future. Not too much more than a decade out of electrical engineering school themselves, Bill Hewlett, David Packard, and Barney Oliver (their head of research and development) were enthusiastic about Doug's proposal. A deal was offered. Engelbart drove home, elated. On the way home, in typical Engelbart fashion, Doug started thinking about it.</p>

      <p>“我把车停在第一个电话亭前，打电话给巴尼·奥利弗，说我只是想验证一下我的假设，他们是否看到了数字技术和计算机的未来——我认为这是他们的电子仪器公司应该走的一条自然道路。我以为他们知道我那天下午向他们提出的想法只是通往数字电子的桥梁。巴尼回答说不，他们没有任何进入计算机领域的计划。所以我说‘好吧，这很遗憾，因为我想这会让这笔交易变得冷淡。我必须走数字路线来追求我想做的其他事情。’”</p><p>"I pulled the car over to the first phone booth and called Barney Oliver and said that I just wanted to check my assumption that they saw a future in digital technology and computers -- which I thought was a natural path for their electronic instrumentation company to follow. I had assumed that they knew that the ideas I proposed to them that afternoon were only a bridge to digital electronics. And Barney replied that no, they didn't have any plans for getting into computers. So I said 'Well, that's a shame, because I guess it cools the deal. I have to go the digital route to pursue the rest of what I want to do.'"</p>

      <p>“因此我与<a href="http://www.hp.com/abouthp/history.html">惠普</a>的交易被取消了，”道格说着，脸上露出了他著名的苦笑，并补充道：“上次我看的时候，惠普在计算机领域排名第五。”</p><p>"So my deal with <a href="http://www.hp.com/abouthp/history.html">Hewlett-Packard</a> was called off," Doug says, wrapping up the reminiscence with one of his famous wry smiles, adding: "the last time I looked they were number five in the world of computers."</p>

      <p>道格一直在寻找合适的机构基础。1957 年 10 月，也就是人造卫星发射的那个月，他收到了门洛帕克一家机构的邀请，该机构当时被称为斯坦福研究所，与帕洛阿尔托“隔河相望” <a href="http://www.sri.com/">。</a>他们有兴趣研究计算机的科学、军事和商业应用。面试他 SRI 职位的其中一位面试官比道格早一两年就读伯克利的博士学位，道格向他讲述了他让计算机与人互动的想法，以增强他们的智力。</p><p>Doug kept looking for the right institutional base. In October, 1957, the very month of Sputnik, he received an offer from an organization in Menlo Park, "across the creek" from Palo Alto, then known as the <a href="http://www.sri.com/">Stanford Research Institute</a>. They were interested in conducting research into scientific, military, and commercial applications of computers. One of the people who interviewed him for the SRI job had been a year or two ahead of Doug in the Ph.D. program at Berkeley, and Doug told him about his ideas of getting computers to interact with people, in order to augment their intellect.</p>

      <p>他问道格：“你已经告诉了多少人这件事了？”</p><p>"How many people have you already told about that?" he asked Doug.</p>

      <p>“没有，你是第一个我告诉的人，”道格说。</p><p>"None, you're the first one I've told," said Doug.</p>

      <p>“很好。现在<i>别</i>告诉任何人。这听起来太疯狂了。这会引起人们对你的偏见。”</p><p>"Good. Now <i>don't</i> tell anybody else. It will sound too crazy. It will prejudice people against you."</p>

      <p>所以道格对此保持沉默。大约一年半的时间里，他靠自己谋生，熟悉了智库业务，并考虑将自己的想法写成一份书面提案。然后他告诉上级，他愿意努力工作以支付研究所的费用，但他确实需要一个框架来培养他的想法——一个增强实验室，人们和机器可以在那里尝试创造和分享知识的新方法，或者至少有一个项目来准确描述增强实验室可能是什么样子。虽然有些摩擦，但最终他得到了批准。</p><p>So Doug kept quiet about it. For about a year and a half, he earned his living and learned the ropes in the think-tank business and thought about putting his ideas into a written proposal. Then he told his superiors that he was willing to work hard to pay his way at the institute but he really had to have a framework to cultivate his idea -- an augmentation laboratory where people and machines could experiment with new ways of creating and sharing knowledge, or at least a project to describe exactly what an augmentation laboratory might be. There was some friction, but eventually he was given the go-ahead.</p>

      <p>美国空军科学研究办公室一直对人类如何操作机器的新知识保持警惕，因此提供了一笔小额资助。道格终于得到了他想要的东西——自由探索一个他仍然没有同事的领域。“这是一份孤独的工作，没有人可以交流想法，但我最终把它写在了一篇论文中，我在 1962 年完成了这篇论文，并于 1963 年发表了它。”</p><p>The U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research, ever vigilant for new knowledge about how humans operate machines, provided a small grant. Doug finally got what he wanted -- the freedom to explore a field in which he still had no colleagues. "It was lonely work, not having anybody to bounce the ideas off, but I finally got it written down in a paper I finished in 1962 and published in 1963."</p>

      <p>当恩格尔巴特宣布他十多年来一直在思考和努力阐明的概念框架时，整个社区一片寂静。但碰巧听到的少数人恰好是合适的人选。<a href="#OEBPS/Text/10.html">鲍勃·泰勒 (Bob Taylor)</a>是 NASA 的一名年轻人，他是后人造卫星时代的杰出技术先锋之一，也是不惧怕创新的新一代研究资助者之一，他推动了道格项目的一些早期资助。</p><p>Total silence from the community greeted the announcement of the conceptual framework Engelbart had thought about and worked to articulate for over a decade. But the few people who happened to be listening happened to be the right people. <a href="#OEBPS/Text/10.html">Bob Taylor</a>, a young fellow at NASA who was one of the bright technological vanguard of the post-Sputnik era, one of the new breed of research funders who didn't fear innovation as a matter of reflex, pushed some of the earliest funding of Doug's project.</p>

      <p>幸运的是，当时能够理解恩格尔巴特愿景的少数人之一 JCR Licklider 正在推进 ARPA 资金攻势。在 Licklider 的支持下，分时技术迅速发展起来。到 20 世纪 60 年代初，一些用于构建道格梦想的高级方法和概念结构的低级硬件和软件工具正在接受测试。Licklider<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">和 Taylor 认为恩格尔巴特正是他们想要招募的那种前瞻性研究人员，可以为他们的研究团队正在创建的计算工具寻找新的强大用途。</font>他们对道格的论文特别感兴趣，而计算机科学的主流却选择忽略这篇论文。</p><p>Fortunately, by that time another one of the few people who were able to understand Engelbart's vision, J. C. R. Licklider, was moving ahead with his ARPA funding blitz. As a result of Licklider's support, time-sharing was coming along rapidly. By the early sixties, some of the low-level hardware and software tools to build Doug's dreamed-of high-level methodological and conceptual structures were being tested. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Licklider and Taylor thought Engelbart was just the kind of forward-thing researcher they wanted to recruit for the task of finding new and powerful uses for the computational tools their research teams were creating.</font> They were particularly interested in the same paper of Doug's that the mainstream of computer science had chosen to ignore.</p>

      <p>1963 年，一篇引起 ARPA 关注、却遭到计算机理论界广泛沉默的论文被命名为《增强人类智力的概念框架》。在论文导言中，恩格尔巴特提出了一份宣言，他打算借此开创一个全新的人类知识领域：</p><p>The paper that attracted the attention of ARPA and met such a thundering silence from the wider community of computer theorists in 1963 was entitled "A Conceptual Framework for the Augmentation of Man's Intellect." In its introduction, Engelbart presented the manifesto by which he meant to launch an entire new field of human knowledge:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">“增强人的智力”是指增强人处理复杂问题情况、获得适合其特定需要的理解力以及找到问题解决方案的能力。在这方面，能力的增强是指以下各项的结合：可以更快地获得理解力；可以获得更好的理解力；在以前过于复杂的情况中可以获得有用的理解力；可以更快地产生解决方案；可以产生更好的解决方案；可以找到以前人类无法找到的解决方案。我们所说的“复杂情况”包括外交官、高管、社会科学家、生命科学家、律师、设计师的专业问题——无论问题情况存在 20 分钟还是 20 年。我们说的并不是在特定情况下有用的孤立巧妙技巧。我们指的是一种综合领域的生活方式，其中直觉、反复尝试、无形资产和人类的“对情况的感觉”与强大的概念、精简的技术和符号、复杂的方法和高性能的电子辅助设备有效地共存。</font>
      “直觉、反复尝试、无形资产”被列在最前面，而“高性能电子辅助设备”被列在最后，这并非偶然。尽管恩格尔巴特知道，数字计算机的广泛普及是我们社会利用增强知识系统的唯一手段，但他也明白，硬件只是他想要增强的整个系统的低级组件。人类智力<i>使用</i><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">工具，但人类思维的力量本身并不局限于人类大脑自动提供的工具。

      </font></font><p>我们的文化赋予了我们处理问题的复杂程序，这些程序通过让我们受益于前人所学，增强了我们学习新事物的先天能力。这些做事方式是创造文明的软件。例如，遥远的新几内亚高地的未识字文化的成员拥有与西方城市居民相同的先天智力，但新几内亚高地人还必须掌握一些其他技能，才能驾驶汽车、从图书馆借阅书籍或写信。</p><p>Our culture has given us sophisticated procedures for dealing with problems, procedures that augment our innate capacity for learning new things by giving us the benefit of what others before us have learned. These ways of doing things are the software that creates civilization. A member of a preliterate culture of the remote New Guinea highlands, for example, possesses the same innate mental capabilities as a Western city-dweller, but something else must be added to the repertoire of what that New Guinea highlander knows how to do before he can drive a car, check out a book from a library, or write a letter.</p>

      <p>恩格尔巴特强调的“额外的东西”不是工具的属性。个体的神经系统并不是区分“文明人”和“原始人”的因素。对于我们认为是原始的某些文化来说，最成熟的城市人显然缺乏必要的生存技能。如果上一段中的文化情况反过来，流离失所者同样无知的情况就会很明显：​​如果你把一个纽约人带到新几内亚高地，不要指望他或她知道如何搭建草屋或在热带风暴中该怎么做。知道在那种情况下该怎么做的人必须向新来者传授生存技能，从而增强他或她的先天能力。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">正是在这里，人类智力的最初增强才得以实现——文化为个人提供的工具和程序：</font></p><p>The "something extra" Engelbart emphasized, is not a property of the tool. It isn't the nervous system of the individual that separates the "civilized" person from the "primitive." To certain cultures that we deem primitive, the most sophisticated urbanite is decidedly lacking in the necessary survival skills. If the cultural situation of the previous paragraph were reversed, the same ignorance on the part of the displaced person would be evident: If you drop a lifelong New Yorker into the New Guinea Highlands, don't expect him or her to know how to build a grass shelter or what to do in a tropical storm. Somebody who knows what to do in those situations has to teach survival skills to the newcomer, thus augmenting his or her innate capacities. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">It is here that the original augmentation of human intellect comes in -- the tools and procedures that cultures make available to individuals:</font></p>

      
        <font size="-1">我们的文化已经发展出了一些手段，让我们能够组织和利用我们的基本能力，以便我们能够理解真正复杂的情况，并完成设计和实施问题解决方案的过程。人类能力得到扩展的方式在这里被称为<i>增强手段</i>，我们将其定义为四个基本类别：</font>
      

      
        <font size="-1">1.<i>人工制品</i>——为人类提供舒适感、对事物或材料的操纵以及对符号的操纵而设计的物理对象。</font>

        <p><font size="-1">2.<i>语言</i>——个人将他所认识的世界的图景分为他的大脑用来模拟世界的概念，以及他附加在这些概念上并用于有意识地操纵这些概念（“思考”）的符号的方式。</font></p><p><font size="-1">2. <i>Language</i> -- the way in which the individual classifies the picture of his world into the concepts that his mind uses to model that world, and the symbols that he attaches to those concepts and uses in consciously manipulating the concepts ("thinking").</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">3.<i>方法论</i>——个人组织以<i>目标为中心</i>（解决问题）的活动的方法、程序和策略。</font></p><p><font size="-1">3. <i>Methodology</i> -- the methods, procedures, and strategies with which an individual organizes his <i>goal-centered</i> (problem-solving) activity.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">4.<i>训练</i>——个人需要进行调节，以便将其使用增强手段 1、2 和 3 的技能提高到可有效操作的程度。</font></p><p><font size="-1">4. <i>Training</i> -- the conditioning needed by the individual to bring his skills in using augmentation means 1, 2, and 3 to the point where they are operationally effective.</font></p>
      

      
        <font size="-1">因此，我们希望改进的系统可以想象为由受过训练的人及其人工制品、语言和方法组成。我们设想的明确新系统将涉及人工制品计算机和计算机控制的信息存储、信息处理和信息显示设备。这里讨论的概念框架的各个方面主要与个人在集成系统中充分利用此类设备的能力有关。</font>
      

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">前文字文化的公民与能够进行长除法或拨打电话的工业世界居民之间的最大区别不在于大脑的“硬件”——高地人或城市人的神经系统——而在于文化赋予的思维工具。阅读、写作、在丛林或城市中生存，都是文化传递的人类软件的例子。恩格尔巴特指出，假设的移居本地人可以通过有组织的程序一步一步地学习，通过该程序，他或她可以学会<i>开车</i>或从图书馆借阅书籍。</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The biggest difference between the citizen of preliterate culture and the industrial-world dweller who can perform long division or dial a telephone is not in the brain's "hardware" -- the nervous system of the highlander or the urbanite -- but in the thinking tools given by the culture. Reading, writing, surviving in a jungle or a city, are examples of culturally transmitted human software. The hypothetical transplanted native, Engelbart points out, can move step by step through an organized program by which he or she may <i>learn</i> to drive a car or check out a book from a library.</font></p>

      <p>我们如何适应新的思维方式？恩格尔巴特用工具包来比喻<i>，</i>并建议我们按照层次结构来组织我们的智力解决问题的工具：</p><p>How do we adapt to new ways of thinking? Engelbart used the metaphor of a <i>toolkit</i>, and proposed that we organize our intellectual problem-solving tools in a hierarchy:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">每个人都可能开发出一套特定的流程能力库，从中选择和调整那些将组成他所执行的流程的能力。这个库就像一个工具包。正如技工必须知道他的工具能做什么以及如何使用它们一样，脑力劳动者也必须知道他的工具的功能，并有适当的方法、策略和经验法则来利用它们。个人库中的所有流程能力最终都取决于他或他的工件中的基本能力，整个库代表一个集成的层次结构（我们通常称之为<i>库层次结构</i>）。</font>
      

      <p>恩格尔巴特举了发布备忘录的流程作为例子——这项任务涉及将具体信息放入正式文件并分发给其他人。撰写备忘录的原因、备忘录撰写人在组织中的角色、目标受众、备忘录主题对组织目标的重要性——这些都是层次结构的较高级别组成部分。</p><p>As an example, Engelbart offered the process of issuing a memorandum -- a task that involves putting specific information in a formal package and distributing it to other people. The reason for writing the memo, the memowriter's role in the organization, the intended audience, the importance of the subject matter of the memo to the organization's goals -- these are the higher level components of the hierarchy.</p>

      <p>中级水平包括整理事实、征求意见、思考、构思想法、权衡备选方案、预测、做出判断等技能，这些技能都用于起草备忘录，而所有沟通技能都用于将备忘录整理成文。最底层是用于准备备忘录的物品和沟通备忘录的媒介——打字机、铅笔、纸张、办公室间邮件。</p><p>At an intermediate level are the skills of marshaling facts, soliciting opinions, thinking, formulating ideas, weighing alternatives, forecasting, making judgments, that go into framing the memo, and all the communication skills that go into putting the memo into form. Toward the bottom of the hierarchy are the artifacts used to prepare the memo and the medium by which it is communicated -- typewriter, pencil, paper, interoffice mail.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">恩格尔巴特提出了一种假想方法，即在层级结构相对较低的地方引入创新技术，以提高整个系统的效率。“假设你有一台新的打字机，”他写道，“一台具有一些非常特殊功能的高速电动打字机。”他用几句话描述了今天被称为“文字处理器”的东西。</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Engelbart proposed a hypothetical method for boosting the effectiveness of the whole system by introducing an innovative technology into a relatively low level of the hierarchy. "Suppose you had a new writing machine," he wrote, "a high-speed electric typewriter with some very special features." In a few words, he proceeded to describe what is known today as a "word processor."</font></p>

      <p>这种机器会对备忘记录过程产生什么影响？恩格尔巴特 1963 年的推测听起来就像 20 世纪 80 年代文字处理系统的广告文案——甚至更多：</p><p>What might be the effect of such a machine on the memo-writing process? Engelbart's 1963 speculations sound like advertising copy for word processing systems of the 1980s -- and more:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">这种假设的写作机器允许你使用一种新的方法来撰写文本。例如，可以快速地从重新排列的旧稿摘录以及你通过手写输入插入的新单词或段落中编写试验稿。你的初稿可能代表以任何顺序自由流露的想法，对先前想法的检查不断刺激新的想法和想法的产生。如果草稿所代表的思想纠结变得过于复杂，你可以快速编写一份重新排序的草稿。在你为寻找适合自己需要的路径而构建的思路中容纳更多的复杂性对你来说将是切实可行的。</font>

        <p><font size="-1">如果你能快速灵活地改变你的工作记录，你就能更轻松地融入新思想，从而更持续地发挥你的创造力。如果你能更轻松地更新工作记录的任何部分以适应思想或环境的新发展，你就会发现在你的做事方式中融入更复杂的程序会更容易。……</font></p><p><font size="-1">You can integrate new ideas more easily, and thus harness your creativity more continuously, if you can quickly and flexibly change your working record. If it is easier to update any part of your working record to accommodate new developments in thought or circumstance, you will find it easier to incorporate more complex procedures in your way of doing things. . . .</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">这里需要注意的重要一点是，一项特定能力的直接创新可能会对整个能力层级产生深远影响。变化可以通过能力层级<i>向上</i>传播，高阶能力现在可以重组以特别利用这一变化和中间更高能力的变化。由于高级别的新功能和低级别的潜在修改可能性，变化可以通过层级<i>向下</i>传播。这些潜在能力可能以前在层级中无法使用，但由于更高级别的新功能而变得可用。</font></p><p><font size="-1">The important thing to appreciate here is that a direct new innovation in one particular capability can have far-reaching effects throughout the rest of your capability hierarchy. A change can propagate <i>up</i> through capability hierarchy, higher-order capabilities can now reorganize to take special advantage of this change and of the intermediate higher-capability changes. A change can propagate <i>down</i> through the hierarchy as a result of new capabilities at the high level and modification possibilities latent in lower levels. These latent capabilities may have been previously unusable in the hierarchy and become usable because of the new capability at the higher level.</font></p>
      

      <p>虽然恩格尔巴特实际上是在建议使用计算机来自动化打字等低级任务，但他想要表达的观点与整个系统的变化有关——这种人工制品将为以更有效、更广泛、更清晰、更快速、格式更好的方式<i>思考提供能力。这就是为什么他使用术语</i><i>“增强”</i>而不是更广泛使用的“<i>自动化”</i>来区分他提出的新计算机应用程序类别。</p><p>While Engelbart was, in fact, suggesting that computers could be used to automate a low-level task like typewriting, the point he wanted to make had to do with changes in the overall system -- the capabilities such an artifact would open up for <i>thinking</i> in a more effective, wider-ranging, more articulate, quicker, better-formatted manner. That is why he distinguished his proposed new category of computer applications by using the term <i>augmentation</i> rather than the more widespread word <i>automation</i>.</p>

      <p>从恩格尔巴特的角度来看，文字处理花了十五年多的时间才流行起来，但这并不重要，重要的是人们继续目光短浅地专注于低级自动化，而忽略了它在更高层次上可能发挥的更重要的作用。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他在 1963 年框架中提出的假设是，计算机代表了人类智力能力进化的新阶段。</font>概念<i>操纵阶段是最早的阶段，基于大脑的生物能力，其次是基于语音和书写的</i><i>符号操纵</i>阶段，以及基于印刷的<i>手动外部符号操纵</i>阶段。</p><p>From Engelbart's point of view, the fact that it took over fifteen more years for word processing to catch on was not as important as the fact that people continue to myopically concentrate on the low-level automation and ignore the more important leverage it makes possible at higher levels. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The hypothesis he presented in the 1963 framework was that computers represent a new stage in the evolution of human intellectual capabilities.</font> The <i>concept manipulation</i> stage was the earliest, based in biological capabilities of the brain, followed by the stage of <i>symbol manipulation</i> based on speech and writing, and the stage of <i>manual external symbol manipulation</i>, based on printing.</p>

      <p><i>基于计算机的打字机是即将到来的第四阶段自动化外部符号处理</i>的例子，它将由计算机在思考和交流过程中的应用而实现，但不限于此：</p><p>The computer-based typewriter was an example of the coming fourth stage of <i>automated external symbol manipulation</i>, to be brought about by, but not limited to, the application of computers to the process of thinking and communicating:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">在这个阶段，人类用来表示他所操纵的概念的符号可以在他眼前排列、移动、存储、调用，并根据极其复杂的规则进行操作——所有这些都可以通过协作技术设备对人类提供的最少信息做出非常快速的反应。在我们现在所能想象的极限范围内，这可能是一台计算机，人们可以用它来快速轻松地进行通信，它与三维彩色显示器相连，可以在其中构建<i>极其复杂的图像</i>，计算机能够根据人类的指示对这些图像的部分或全部执行各种各样的处理。这些显示和过程可以提供有用的服务，并可能涉及迄今为止无法想象的概念（例如，前图形思维者无法预测条形图、长除法过程或卡片文件系统）。</font>

        <p><font size="-1">……我们可以设想一些相对简单的方法来提高我们处理外部符号的能力，并试着描绘出我们的语言和思维方式可能随之发生的变化。例如，想象一下我们几代人之前萌芽的技术已经开发出一种人工制品，它本质上是一种高速、半自动的查表设备，价格便宜到几乎每个人都买得起，体积小到可以随身携带。假设制造商（出版商）出售的单个磁带盒包含查找信息，一个磁带盒可以容纳相当于一本完整词典的内容，一般人总能在三秒钟内找到一段定义。这可能会导致语言和方法论的哪些变化？<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">如果查找东西如此容易，我们的词汇量将会如何发展，我们探索他人知识领域的习惯将会如何转变，实际组织的复杂性将会如何成熟（如果每个人都可以如此快速和容易地查找适用的规则），我们的教育系统将如何利用学生、教师和管理人员这种新的外部符号操作能力？</font></font></p><p><font size="-1">. . . we might imagine some relatively straightforward means of increasing our external symbol-manipulation capability and try to picture the consequent changes that could evolve in our language and methods of thinking. For instance, imagine that our budding technology of a few generations ago had developed an artifact that was essentially a high-speed, semiautomatic table-lookup device, cheap enough for almost everyone to afford and small enough to be carried on the person. Assume that the individual cartridges sold by manufacturers (publishers) contained the lookup information, that one cartridge could hold the equivalent of an unabridged dictionary, and that a one-paragraph definition could always be located by the average practices individual in less than three seconds. What changes in language and methodology might not result? <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">If it were so easy to look things up, how would our vocabulary develop, how would our habits of exploring the intellectual domains of others shift, how might the sophistication of practical organization mature (if each person could so quickly and easily look up applicable rules), how would our education system take advantage of this new external symbol-manipulation capability of students and teachers and administrators?</font></font></p>
      

      <p>在 1963 年的论文结尾，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">恩格尔巴特提出，应该通过构建一个增强实验室来检验这一假设，在这个实验室中，人类可以使用新的信息处理工具来探索当时在剑桥、列克星敦、伯克利和圣莫尼卡出现的计算机系统所带来的新语言、方法和培训。</font>由于最终产品是面向所有人，而不仅仅是计算机专家，因此必须招募从事编辑、设计和其他知识相关领域的人员加入电气工程师和程序员的行列。因为目标是增强人类思维的力量，并学习如何将这种增强引入人类组织，所以还需要一名心理学家。</p><p>At the end of the 1963 paper, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Engelbart proposed that the hypothesis should be tested by constructing an augmentation laboratory in which humans could use new information processing artifacts to explore the new languages, methods, and training made possible by the computer systems then coming into existence in Cambridge, Lexington, Berkeley, and Santa Monica.</font> Since the ultimate product was to be for everyone, not just computer experts, people who were involved in editing, designing, and other knowledge-related fields would have to be recruited to join the electrical engineers and programmers. Because the goal was to enhance the power of the human mind, and to learn how to introduce such enhancements to human organizations, a psychologist would also be needed.</p>

      <p>实验室本身必须是一个精心设计的引导工具，因为这个团队首先要构建的工具正是他们更好地完成自己工作所需的工具。在他们希望增强他人的任务之前，他们必须先增强自己的工作。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">引导——构建工具以构建更好的工具，并在过程中自己测试它们，是恩格尔巴特战略的核心组成部分，旨在跟上计算机技术预期发展的步伐。SRI</font>管理层对获得实施此类计划所需的资金几乎不抱幻想。</p><p>The laboratory itself would have to be a consciously designed bootstrapping tool, because the very tools this team would be constructing first were the tools needed to do their own jobs better. Before they could hope to augment other people's tasks, they had to augment their own jobs. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Bootstrapping -- building the tools to build better tools, and testing them on yourself as you go along, was a central component of Engelbart's strategy, intended to match the pace of anticipated developments in computer technology.</font> SRI management had few illusions about obtaining the funding necessary to implement such a scheme.</p>

      <p>1964 年，当时已从 NASA 调至 ARPA 的 Bob Taylor 告诉 Engelbart 和 SRI，信息处理技术办公室准备先出资 100 万美元，用于提供一台新的分时计算机系统，并每年出资约 50 万美元，用于支持增强研究。这让 Engelbart 的上司大吃一惊，因为他们渴望获得政府合同来开发新的计算机技术，但他们并不认为 Engelbart 的宏伟心智扩展实验室计划是最有希望获得大规模资助的项目。可以想象，在 ARPA 资助者离开后，SRI 高层会拿出组织结构图，以了解 Doug Engelbart 是谁以及在哪里。</p><p>In 1964, Bob Taylor, who by that time had moved from NASA to ARPA, told Engelbart and SRI that the Information Processing Techniques Office was prepared to contribute a million dollars initially to provide one of the new time-sharing computer systems, and about a half a million dollars a year to support the augmentation research. It came as a surprise to Engelbart's superiors, who were eager to procure government contracts for developing new computer technologies, but who didn't exactly regard his grandiose plans for a mind-extending laboratory as their most promising candidate for large-scale funding. One can imagine the SRI brass pulling out the organization chart after the ARPA funders left, to find out who and where Doug Engelbart happened to be.</p>

      <p>这正是恩格尔巴特多年来一直在寻求的支持，此时系统的概念框架已经成型，他所需要的技术也已可用。下一步是组建团队来构建第一个原型。</p><p>Here was the support Engelbart had been seeking for years, coming right at the point where the conceptual framework for the system had already been worked out and the technology he needed was becoming available. The next step was to assemble the team who would build the first prototype.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">增强研究中心对未来几代计算机文化的最大影响或许在于，一批批杰出的人才通过该实验室进入其他著名研究项目。十年间，数十位才华横溢的人才致力于将恩格尔巴特和利克莱德早年梦想的系统付诸实践。许多恩格尔巴特的前弟子现在已成为大学研究团队或商业计算机制造商研发部门的领导者。</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Perhaps the Augmentation Research Center's greatest effect on computer culture for generations to come was in the succession of remarkable people who passed through that laboratory and on to other notable research projects. Dozens of gifted individuals over the span of a decade dedicated themselves to putting into action the system Engelbart and Licklider had dreamed about in previous years. Many of those former Engelbart prot�g�s are now leaders of their own research teams at universities or the R &amp; D divisions of commercial computer manufacturers.</font></p>

      <p>增强研究中心 (ARC) 由一个“引擎室”组成，新的分时计算机放在那里，一个硬件车间，不断升级的计算机系统和实验性的输入输出设备在这里建造和维护，还有一个模范的“智力工作室”，由一个类似圆形剧场的空间组成，十几个人坐在大型显示终端前，开发系统软件，相互通信，并通过所谓的<i>NLS</i>（在线系统）在信息维度中导航。</p><p>The Augmentation Research Center (ARC) consisted of the "engine room," where the new time-sharing computers were located, a hardware shop where the constantly upgraded computer systems and experimental input-output devices were built and maintained, and a model "intellectual workshop" that consisted of an amphitheater-like space in which a dozen people sat in front of large display terminals, creating the system's software, communicating with each other, and navigating through dimensions of information by means of what was known as <i>NLS</i> (for oNLine System).</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">NLS 是一种奇特而又令人陶醉的新事物，它融合了 ARPA 提供的小工具、自制的软件魔法和全新的智力技能，</font>这些技能部分是提前设计的，部分是实验设计者在进行实验时拼凑起来的。经过四年的跌跌撞撞、反复回溯、飞跃，然后更加自信地探索这个新领域，经历了硬件危机和软件危机，以及关于如何去做大家都同意应该做的事情的无休止的争论，NLS 开始实现其建造者对它的期望。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">是时候冒险了。</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">NLS was an exotic and intoxicating new brew of ARPA-provided gadgetry, homebrewed software wizardry, and altogether new intellectual skills</font> that were partially designed in advance and partially thrown together as the designer-subjects of the experiment went along. After four years of stumbling, backtracking, leaping forward, then more confidently exploring this new territory, after hardware crises and software crises and endless argumentation about how to go about doing what they all agreed ought to be done, NLS was beginning to fulfill the hopes its builders had for it. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">It was time to gamble.</font></p>

      <p>每当道格·恩格尔巴特扪心自问，他都毫不怀疑这是一场赌博。他独自坐在旧金山的舞台上，看着他的支持团队在平台底座周围匆忙编织的一堆电缆和摄像机周围忙碌，面对着数千名计算机专家的观众，道格很清楚，任何可能发生的事故——一场雷雨、一条故障电缆、一连串的软件故障——都可能扼杀他们未来获得研究资金的机会。</p><p>Whenever he consulted the feeling in his stomach, Doug Engelbart had no doubt that it was a gamble. Sitting all alone on that stage in San Francisco, watching his support team scramble around the hastily woven nest of cables and cameras surrounding the base of the platform, facing an audience of several thousand computer experts, it was all too evident to Doug that any number of possible accidents -- a thunderstorm, a faulty cable, a concatenation of software glitches -- could effectively kill their future chances of obtaining research funds.</p>

      <p>但他开始失去耐心，等了几十年才等到世界其他地方意识到增强技术这么重要。他的同事们也打击了恩格尔巴特对 NLS 系统这一由人、电子设备、软件和创意组成的微妙组合的信心。</p><p>But he had begun to lose his patience, waiting for decades for the rest of the world to catch on to something as important as augmentation. And his colleagues shrared Engelbart's confidence in the delicate coalition of people, electronic devices, software, and ideas they called the NLS system.</p>

      <p>道格精心构思的概念框架、原型硬件、他和比尔·英格利什开发的系统，以及他由系统程序员、计算机工程师、心理学家和媒体专家组成的自举实验室，都只是证实了道格多年来所知道的事实——计算机可以帮助脑力劳动者更好地<i>思考</i>。到 20 世纪 60 年代末，问题在于如何将他的想法和他的团队的成就传达给更广泛的计算机世界的人们。</p><p>Doug's painstakingly thought-out conceptual framework, the prototype hardware, systems he and Bill English developed, and his bootstrapping laboratory of systems programmers, computer engineers, psychologists, and media specialists were only corroborating what Doug had known for years -- computers can help intellectual workers <i>think</i> better. By the late 1960s, the problem lay in getting his ideas and the meaning of his team's accomplishments across to people in the wider computer world.</p>

      <p>到 1968 年，增强中心已按计划发展到 17 人。他们使用的是第三次升级的计算机系统，软件也从最初的粗糙实验版本发展成为信息专家的真正工作工具包。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">几个月后，SRI 增强研究中心将成为 ARPA 远程计算机连接实验的网络信息中心——传说中的 ARPAnet。</font></p><p>The augmentation center, as planned, had grown to seventeen people by 1968. They were on their third upgraded computer system, and the software was evolving from the first crude experimental versions to a real working toolkit for information specialists. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">In a matter of months, the SRI Augmentation Research Center was due to become the Network Information Center for ARPA's experiment in long-distance linking of computers -- the fabled ARPAnet.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">1968 年秋天，当一次名为秋季联合计算机会议的计算机家族大型聚会定于旧金山附近举行时，道格决定将他长期寻求的门洛帕克增强实验室的声誉（当时这实际上是他一生的心血）押上去，进行一次如此大胆而直接的演示，</font>以便经过这么多年，计算机科学家们终于能够理解并接受这个困扰他们很久的重要线索。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">In the fall of 1968, when a major gathering of the computer clans known as the Fall Joint Computer conference was scheduled in nearby San Francisco, Doug decided to stake the reputation of his long-sought augmentation laboratory in Menlo Park -- literally his life's work by that time -- on a demonstration so daring and direct</font> that finally, after all these years, computer scientists would understand and embrace that vital clue that had eluded them for so long.</p>

      <p>那天下午在市政礼堂的观众都记得，道格平静的声音在近两个小时内温柔而不可抗拒地吸引了数千名高级黑客的注意，之后观众做出了在那个竞争激烈、批判性极强的亚文化中罕见的事情——他们起立鼓掌，为道格和他的同事们鼓掌。</p><p>Those who were in the audience at Civic Auditorium that afternoon remember how Doug's quiet voice managed to gently but irresistibly seize the attention of several thousand high-level hackers for nearly two hours, after which the audience did something rare in that particularly competitive and critical subculture -- they gave Doug and his colleagues a standing ovation.</p>

      <p>几年后，第一次面向微型计算机自制爱好者的“计算机博览会”在同一个房间里举行，观众们见证了<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">计算机界前所未有的媒体演示。</font>演示团队从世界各地收集了最先进的视听设备，其中包括<a href="http://www.well.com/user/sbb/">斯图尔特·布兰德 (Stewart Brand)</a>，他在令人大开眼界的多媒体演示方面的经验来自于几年前他制作的聚会，这些聚会就在离这个礼堂不远的地方举行，被称为“酸性测试”。</p><p>The audience, in the same room where the first "computer faire" for microcomputer homebrew hobbyists was held some years later, witnessed <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">a kind of media presentation that nobody in the computer milieu had ever experienced before.</font> State-of-the-art audiovisual equipment was gathered from around the world at the behest of a presentation team that included <a href="http://www.well.com/user/sbb/">Stewart Brand</a>, whose experience in mind-altering multimedia shows was derived from his production of get-togethers a few years before this, held not too far from this same auditorium, known as "Acid Tests."</p>

      <p>道格的控制面板和屏幕通过他们在门洛帕克山上架设的临时微波天线与主机和 SRI 的其他团队成员相连。当道格独自坐在驾驶舱里时，比尔·英格利什 (Bill English) 指挥下的十几个人在幕后疯狂工作，以确保他们精心移植的系统能够正常运行，以完成这次至关重要的试飞。这一次，命运站在他们这一边。就像一次完美的太空发射，所有微小的随机事故都相互抵消了。十七年前的两个小时里，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">道格·恩格尔巴特终于有机会带着他的同行——增强技术的先驱和数字计算专家——在信息空间中飞行。</font></p><p>Doug's control panel and screen were linked to the host computer and the rest of the team back at SRI via a temporary microwave antenna they had set up in the hills above Menlo Park. While Doug was up there alone in the cockpit, a dozen people under the direction of Bill English worked frantically behind the scenes to keep their delicately transplanted system together just long enough for this crucial test flight. For once, fate was on their side. Like a perfect space launch, all the minor random accidents canceled each other. For two hours, seventeen years ago, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Doug Engelbart finally got his chance to take his peers -- augmentation pioneers and number crunchers as well -- on a flight through information space.</font></p>

      <p>幸运的是，历史记录中拍摄了该活动的影片。那些参加过原始活动的人说，这部 16 毫米胶片无法反映原始表演的水平。在原始演示过程中，先进的电子投影系统在大型屏幕上提供了清晰聚焦的图像，其大小是真人的 20 倍。道格独自一人站在舞台上，屏幕在他上方和身后若隐若现，他坐在 CRT 显示器前，戴着雷达操作员和喷气式飞机飞行员使用的耳机麦克风耳机，双手放在与椅子相连的外观奇特的控制台上。</p><p>Fortunately for the historical record, a film of the event was made. Those who were at the original event say that the sixteen-millimeter film is a poor shadow of the original show. During the original presentation, an advanced electronic projection system provided a sharply focused image, twenty times life sized, on a large screen. Doug was alone on the stage, the screen looming above and behind him as he sat in front of his CRT display, wearing the kind of earphone-microphone headsets that radar operators and jet pilots use, his hands resting on an unusual-looking control console connected to his chair.</p>

      <p>专门设计的输入控制台可以旋转，因此他可以把它拉到膝盖上。中央是标准的打字机键盘，两边各有两个小平台，突出约六英寸。左边的平台上是他用来输入命令的五键设备，右边<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">的平台上是著名的“鼠标”，</font>这种设备现在才开始进入个人电脑市场——一种香烟包大小的设备，顶部有按钮，用电线连接到控制台上。道格用右手移动它。</p><p>The specially designed input console swiveled so he could pull it onto his lap. A standard typewriter keyboard was in the center, and two small platforms projected about six inches on either side. On the platform to his left was a five-key device he used for entering commands, and <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">on the platform to the right was the famous "mouse"</font> that is only now beginning to penetrate the personal computing market -- a device the size of a pack of cigarettes, with buttons on the top, attached to the console with a wire. Doug moved it around with his right hand.</p>

      <p>他面前是一块显示屏。他身后的大屏幕可以交替显示或共享 Doug 的手、脸、显示屏上的信息以及他在门洛帕克的同事和他们的显示屏的图像等多个视图。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">屏幕可以分成多个“窗口”，</font>每个窗口都可以显示文本或图像。通过他在五键设备上的指尖命令和鼠标移动，大屏幕上显示的变化信息开始在 Doug 的控制下动起来。在此之前，房间里的每个人都参加过数百次幻灯片演示，但从 Doug 第一次让屏幕上的视图动起来的那一刻起，很明显，这与以前任何人尝试过的视听演示都不一样。</p><p>In front of him was the display screen. The large screen behind him could alternate, or share, multiple views of Doug's hands, his face, the information on the display screen, and images of his colleagues and their display screens at Menlo Park. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The screen could be divided into a number of "windows,"</font> each of which could display either text or image. The changing information displayed on the large screen, activated by his fingertip commands on the five-key device and his motions of the mouse, began to animate under Doug's control. Everyone in the room had attended hundreds of slide presentations before this, but from the moment Doug first imparted movement to the views on the screen, it became evident that this was like no audiovisual presentation anyone had attempted before.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">恩格尔巴特是一位新型飞行器的试飞员，这种飞行器不飞越地理区域，而是穿越计算机科学家称之为“信息空间”的抽象空间。</font>他不仅看起来像试飞员，而且表现得像：计算机世界的查克·耶格尔，冷静地测试新系统，并用平静、安静的声音向惊讶的地球观众汇报。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Engelbart was the very image of a test pilot for a new kind of vehicle that doesn't fly over geographical territory but through what was heretofore an abstraction that computer scientists call "information space."</font> He not only looked the part, but acted it: The Chuck Yeager of the computer cosmos, calmly putting the new system through its paces and reporting back to his astonished earthbound audience in a calm, quiet voice.</p>

      <p>想象一下，你乘坐的是一种新型交通工具，其空间和时间范围几乎是无限的。这辆车里有一扇神奇的窗户，它能让你从非常广泛的可能视野中进行选择，并迅速筛选出大量的可能性——从微观到银河系，从某个图书馆某本书中的某个单词，到整个知识领域的摘要。</p><p>Imagine that you are in a new kind of vehicle with virtually unlimited range in both space and time. In this vehicle is a magic window that enables you to choose from a very large range of possible views and to rapidly filter a vast field of possibilities -- from the microscopic to the galactic, from a certain word in a certain book in a certain library, to a summary of the entire field of knowledge.</p>

      <p>透过新车的增强型车窗，你看到的不是平原、树木和海洋的普通景观，而是一个<i>信息景观</i>，其特征是文字、数字、图表、图像、概念、段落、论据、关系、公式、图表、证明、文献和批评流派。起初，这种效果令人眼花缭乱。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">用道格的话来说，我们所有组织信息的旧习惯都因接触一个不是以铅笔和印刷机为模型，而是以人类大脑处理信息的方式为模型的系统而“被彻底颠覆”。</font></p><p>The territory you see through the augmented window in your new vehicle is not the normal landscape of plains and trees and oceans, but an <i>informationscape</i> in which the features are words, numbers, graphs, images, concepts, paragraphs, arguments, relationships, formulas, diagrams, proofs, bodies of literature and schools of criticism. The effect is dizzying at first. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">In Doug's words, all of our old habits of organizing information are "blasted open" by exposure to a system modeled, not on pencils and printing presses, but on the way the human mind processes information.</font></p>

      <p>当阿拉伯数字这种新的思维载体被引入西方时，数学家们发现他们再也不用在计算中摸索罗马数字了，这种精神上的自由一开始一定令人眼花缭乱。但远没有这么令人眼花缭乱。信息景观的活力不需要解释，只需要亲身体验就能理解。从这个意义上说，道格知道他别无选择，只能冒险把它放在大屏幕上，让观众自己判断。</p><p>When the new vehicle for thought known as Arabic numbers was introduced to the West, and mathematicians found that they didn't have to fumble with Roman numerals in their calculations anymore, the mental freedom must have been dizzying at first. But not nearly as dizzying as this. There is a dynamism of the informationscape that needs no explanation, that needs only to be experienced to be understood. In that sense, Doug knew he had no choice but to take the risk of putting it up on the big screen and letting his audience judge for themselves.</p>

      <p>即使是 Doug 于 1968 年试图实现的口香糖和打包线版本，也能将新<i>结构</i>强加到您透过窗口看到的内容上。符号域，从细节到最宏大的特征，都可以由信息驾驶员随意安排，他驾驶车辆时透过车窗观看，观众在大屏幕上目睹一切。信息特征被重新排序、并列、删除、嵌套、链接、链式化、细分、插入、修改、引用、扩展、总结 - 所有这些都可以通过指尖命令完成，可以完整调用文档，也可以将视图限制为仅显示每段的第一行或第一个单词，或每页的第一段。</p><p>Even the chewing-gum-and-bailing-wire version Doug was attempting to get off the ground in 1968 had the ability to impose new <i>structures</i> on what you could see through its windows. The symbolic domain, from minutiae to the grandest features, could be arranged at will by the informationaut, who watched through his window while he navigated his vehicle and the audience witnessed it all on the big screen. Informational features were reordered, juxtaposed, deleted, nested, linked, chained, subdivided, inserted, revised, referenced, expanded, summarized -- all with fingertip commands, A document could be called up in its entirety, or the view could be restricted to only the first line or first word of each paragraph, or the first paragraph of each page.</p>

      <p>他演示的其中一个示例任务涉及他目前正在进行的演讲的创建，从演讲大纲到将设备移至市政礼堂的后勤工作。屏幕上显示的信息内容指的是他目前正在进行的讲座，而讲座则指的是屏幕上的信息——这是程序员称之为“递归”的自引用过程的一个示例。</p><p>One of the example tasks he demonstrated involved the creation of the presentation he was giving at the moment, from the outline of the talk to the logistics of moving their setup to the Civic Auditorium. The content of the information displayed on the screen referred to the lecture he was giving at the moment, and the lecture referred to the information on the screen -- an example of the kind of self-referential procedure that programmers call "recursion."</p>

      <p>道格通过操纵观众对信息的“看法”，将观众的注意力转移到大纲中。他的操纵通过信息类别来操纵屏幕显示和观众的意识，缩小到子类别，将它们分解成原子组件，重新排列它们，然后放大层次结构以在故事的关键点与语音叙述相遇，此时屏幕上的文字和来自叙述者的文字融合在一起，然后再次分支。这是对当时新颖的计算机用途的恰当戏剧化呈现。虽然对于许多观众来说，这似乎是一项突然的创新，但它是 ARC 近十年来精心实验的顶峰。</p><p>Doug moved his audience's attention through the outline by the way he manipulated their "views" of the information. His manipulations maneuvered the screen display and the audience's consciousness through categories of information, zoomed down to subcategories, broke them into their atomic components, rearranged them, then zoomed back up the hierarchy to meet the vocal narration at a key point in the story, when the words on the screen and the words coming from the narrator merged before branching off again. It was an appropriately dramatic presentation of a then-novel use of computers. While it appeared to be a radically sudden innovation to many of those in the audience, it was the culmination of careful experimentation at ARC that had already spanned most of a decade.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">令人震惊的是，在 1968 年，看到有人使用计算机将文字输入到屏幕上是一种新奇的体验，而在文字处理广泛普及的时代，今天很难想象很少有人能够从 Doug 的演示中看出一个行业的先锋。</font>当分时系统首次允许程序员直接与计算机交互时，在 20 世纪 60 年代初，程序员开发了称为“文本编辑器”的工具来帮助他们编写编程代码。（麻省理工学院的第一个文本编辑器有一个手写标志，称其为“昂贵的打字机”。）但尽管 Engelbart 展示了其潜力，但对于非程序员来说，“文字处理”仍然遥不可及。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">It is almost shocking to realize that in 1968 it was a novel experience to see someone use a computer to put words on a screen, and in this era of widespread word processing, it is hard to imagine today that very few people were able to see in Doug's demonstration the vanguard of an industry.</font> When time-sharing systems first allowed programmers to interact directly with computers, in the early 1960s, the programmers developed tools known as "text editors" to help them write programming code. (The first one at MIT had a hand-lettered sign that dubbed it "expensive typewriter.") But "word processing" for non-programmers was still far in the future, despite Engelbart's demonstration of its potential.</p>

      <p>以今天的标准来看，1968 年的视频显示技术的质量也非常低劣。Doug 屏幕上的字母和数字看起来就像手写的一样——更像是“画”在雷达屏幕上的粗糙线条，而不是我们今天在视频显示终端上看到的清晰像素。</p><p>The quality of video display technology in 1968 was also amazingly primitive by today's standards. The letters and numbers on Doug's screen looked as if they were handwritten -- closer to crude swaths "painted" onto a radar screen than the crisp pixels we are accustomed to seeing today on video display terminals.</p>

      <p>在寻找一个领域时，小的成功意味着效率的大幅提升，成功将吸引大规模的研究和开发工作，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">道格选择增强“单调但实用且重要的任务”，这些任务占据了我们社会中越来越多的人：准备、编辑和发布文件。</font>文件准备和交流这一领域只是他设想的广泛应用的一小部分，但它是增强团队本身立即需要的工具，也是世界上每个实验室和办公室都想要的工具——只要人们明白计算机不仅仅是计算器。</p><p>In seeking a domain where a small success would mean a large boost in effectiveness, and where success would attract a large-scale research and development effort, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Doug chose to augment the "humdrum but practical and important sorts of tasks" that occupy an increasing proportion of the people in our society: preparing, editing, and publishing documents.</font> This area of document preparation and communication was but a small slice from the grand range of applications he envisioned, but it was one tool that the augmentation team itself needed immediately, and one that every laboratory and office in the world would want -- as soon as people understood that computers weren't just calculators.</p>

      <p>恩格尔巴特在 1968 年的节目中解释说，增强研究中心的 17 名成员试图创建一种媒介，这种媒介对其他 ARPA 计算机研究人员有用，最终对任何从事信息工作的人都有用。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">与此同时，这既是行为科学实验，也是计算机系统实验，因为项目团队既是研究的对象，也是研究的设计者。让计算机做他们想做的事只是一个开始。真正困难的工作是调整自己适应新的工作和思维方式。</font></p><p>The seventeen members of the Augmentation Research Center, Engelbart explained during their 1968 show, were attempting to create a medium that would be useful to the other ARPA computer researchers and eventually to anyone who works with information. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">At the same time, this was a behavioral science experiment as well as a computer systems experiment, because the project team would be the subjects as well as the architects of the research. Making computers do what they wanted was only the beginning. The really difficult work was adjusting themselves to new ways of working and thinking.</font></p>

      <p>因此，首批项目之一就是创建一个系统，使研究团队成员（最终也包括其他脑力劳动者）能够轻松地编写、存储和检索、编辑和交流文字、数字和图形。“文本编辑”必须更适合非程序员，更适合表达思想和撰写散文。</p><p>Consequently, one of the first projects was to create a system to make it easy for the members of the research team -- and eventually for other intellectual workers -- to compose, store and retrieve, edit, and communicate words, numbers, and graphics. "Text editing" had to become more amenable to non-programmers and more suited for the expression of thoughts and composition of prose.</p>

      <p>他们需要发明显示设备、改造计算机并编写程序；然后他们必须使用他们发明的东西来编写系统描述。硬件和软件专家致力于在屏幕上显示符号并将其存储在计算机内存中。然后，通信专家使用文本编辑器编写手册，指导不断发展的项目的未来成员使用新工具。</p><p>They needed to invent display devices and adapt the computer and write the programs; then they had to use what they had invented to compose a description of the system. The hardware and software specialists worked on representing symbols on screens and storing them in the computer's memory. Then the communications specialists used the text editors to write the manuals to instruct future members of the growing project in the use of new tools.</p>

      <p>文本编辑系统是 Doug 长期计划的第一阶段。实际使用该系统来设计和描述下一代是第二阶段。这两个阶段均在 1968 年完成。早在 1968 年，NLS 就不仅限于我们现在所说的文字处理系统。第三阶段的目标是构建一整套用于智力任务的工具包，并开发这些工具可以单独和集体使用的程序和方法，以提高从事信息相关工作的人员的绩效。然后，该工具包将用于开发新的计算机辅助人机协作模式。</p><p>The text-editing system was the first stage of Doug's long-term plan. The actual use of the system to design and describe the next generation was the second stage. Both stages were accomplished by 1968. Even as early as 1968, NLS was not limited to what we now call a word processing system. The third-stage goal was to build an entire toolkit for intellectual tasks, and develop the procedures and methods by which those tools could be used, individually and collectively, to boost the performance of people who did information-related work. The toolkit would then be used to develop new modes of computer-aided human collaboration.</p>

      <p>软件的开发是为了将文本编辑系统与一种特殊的电子文件格式连接起来，这种格式将作为个人努力的统一记忆、记录和媒介。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">软件<i>日志</i>自 1965-1966 年以来一直在开发中，个人和团体可以通过它访问共享的思考和交流空间</font>；它使个人能够在增强实验的小组记录中插入评论（或浏览它们），并使程序员能够跟踪系统功能的演变方式。日志以及用于增强实时一对一通信的<i>共享屏幕电话是整体</i><i>对话支持系统</i>的一部分，旨在帮助提高群体沟通和决策的效率。</p><p>Software was created to connect the text-editing system with a special kind of electronic filing arrangement that would serve as a unifying memory, record, and medium for their individual efforts. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The software <i>journal</i> through which individuals and groups could have access to a shared thinking and communicating space</font> had been in development since 1965-1966; it enabled individuals to insert comments into the group record of the augmentation experiments (or browse through them), and enabled programmers to trace the way system features had evolved. The journal, along with <i>shared screen telephoning</i> to enhance real-time, one-to-one communications, was part of the overall <i>dialogue support system</i> designed to help increase effectiveness of group communication and decision making.</p>

      <p>期刊的想法早于计算机网络和电话会议的发展，它起源于十几个终端连接到一台多路访问计算机。这是首次尝试“通过”工具包与系统的另一个人类用户进行交流。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">它是“电子邮件”媒介的理论先驱</font>，该媒介在 20 世纪 70 年代初 ARPA 网络投入运营时发展起来。当 ARPAnet 出现时，它将不同位置的许多计算机连接到一个共享的计算“空间”，这对那些多年来一直在研究较小、本地化版本的少数 ARC 先驱来说并不是一个令人震惊的新媒介。</p><p>The idea of the journal predated the development of computer networks and teleconferencing, originating as it did with a dozen terminals connected to a single multiaccess computer. It was an important first try at "reaching through" the toolkit to engage in communication with another human user of the system. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">It was a theoretical precursor to the "electronic mail" medium</font> that was to evolve when the ARPA network became operational in the early 1970s. When ARPAnet came along, connecting many computers in different locations into a shared computational "space," it wasn't such a shocking new medium to those few ARC pioneers who had been working on a smaller, localized version for years.</p>

      <p>该期刊旨在整理在构建系统和探索系统运作方式过程中产生的一系列对话、笔记和出版物。除了作为一本对人为因素专家和系统程序员有用的电子日志之外，该期刊还旨在成为用户之间进行正式对话的媒介，其作用与当今的传统图书馆和专业期刊相同——但其作用更为广泛，成为一种独特而强大的知识传播方式。</p><p>The journal was designed to bring order to a stream of dialogues, notes, and publications generated in the process of building the system and finding out how to work it. Besides serving as an electronic logbook that would be useful to human factors specialists and systems programmers, the journal was meant to be a medium for a formal dialogue among users that would serve the same purpose as today's traditional libraries and professional journals -- but would do so in such an amplified manner that it would become a uniquely powerful method of transmitting knowledge.</p>

      <p>例如，每个领域的科学期刊都遵循一种形式，即描述研究结果的论文经过评审，然后发表，之后的论文可以引用前一篇论文。任何科学知识领域的记录——以及讨论研究发现重要性的论坛——都由不断增长的期刊引文和附文列表组成。新的创新和评论需要时间才能传播开来，个人也需要相对较长的时间才能找到引文分支历史。在 NLS 版本中，可以非常轻松地从任何一篇文章直接快速跳转到所引用文章的文本并返回——将即使在最高效的图书馆/期刊系统中也需要数小时或数月才能完成的过程缩短到几秒钟或几分钟。</p><p>For example, scientific journals in every field follow a form in which a paper describing research results is refereed, then published, after which subsequent papers can cite the previous paper. The record in any field of scientific knowledge -- and the forum in which the significance of findings is debated -- consists of a growing list of journal citations and accompanying text. It takes time for new innovation and comments to circulate, and it takes a relatively long time for individuals to thread their way through a branching history of citations. In the NLS version, it is very easy to jump directly and quickly from any article to the text of cited articles and back -- reducing to seconds or minutes procedures that would take hours or months in even the most efficient library/journal system.</p>

      <p>计算机系统彻底改变了出版和发行方式，因为现在可以轻松地自动通知特定阅读列表上的每个人，符合他们兴趣的材料现已可用。分发列表可以是分发列表的成员 - 您可以指定一个列表作为通知的收件人，并且指定列表的每个成员都会收到您的消息。消息和文章可以包含引文列表，目录和索引可以是它们自己的消息形式。可以通过告诉社区中感兴趣的成员按特定顺序阅读特定的引用文章列表来传达想法和假设。</p><p>Publication and distribution are radically changed by a computerized system, since it is so easy to automatically notify everybody on a certain kind of reading list material matching their interest profile is now available. Distribution lists can be members of distribution lists -- you can designate a list to be the recipient of an announcement, and every member of the designated list will receive your message. Messages and articles can contain lists of citations, and catalogs and indices can be message forms of their own. Ideas and hypotheses could be conveyed by telling interested members of the community to read a certain list of cited articles in a particular order.</p>

      <p>这种更为正式和高度结构化的智力话语对于科学至关重要，但并不是普通公民日常事务中常用的交流方式。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">正如道格的长期同事和主要资助者利克莱德和泰勒在 1968 年指出的那样，新的交互式计算机和新的计算机间网络将使使用 NLS 等工具构建<a href="#OEBPS/Text/command?stat+vcc+vc">计算机辅助<i>社区</i></a>成为可能，在这个社区中，不仅可以增强智力，还可以增强<i>交流。</i></font></p><p>This more formal and highly structured kind of intellectual discourse is essential to science, but is not the usual mode of communication used in the day-to-day affairs of ordinary citizens. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">As Licklider and Taylor, Doug's long-time colleagues and principal funders, pointed out in 1968, the new interactive computers and new intercomputer networks would make it possible to use tools like NLS to construct a <a href="#OEBPS/Text/command?stat+vcc+vc">computer-aided <i>community</i></a> in which not only intellect but <i>communication</i> could be augmented.</font></p>

      <p>从最基本的层面上讲，当两个或多个人需要共享信息、进行业务往来、做出决策、解决分歧、达成协议、解决问题、沟通计划时，沟通就开始了。NLS 软件杠杆、滑轮和天钩系列的早期创作之一将系统的其他功能带入了通信领域。ARC 开发了一种“电话会议模式”，其中：</p><p>At the most fundamental level, communication begins when two or more people need to share information, transact business, make decisions, resolve differences, reach agreements, solve problems, communicate plans. One of the early creations in the NLS collection of software levers and pulleys and skyhooks brought the other capabilities of the system to bear on communications. ARC developed a "mode of teleconferencing" whereby:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">... 两个或多个人分别坐在不同的显示控制台前，可以连接他们的显示器，这样所有人都可以看到相同的图像，而且任何人都可以选择进行控制。同时通过电话交谈时，产生的对话可以具有独特的效果——相当于围绕他们的便笺簿、工作记录和个人支持设施的集体集合举行的面对面会议。...</font>

        <p><font size="-1">但请考虑一下，当一些参与者——甚至单个参与者——能够有效地使用计算机工具处理相关材料和流程时，已经存在的巨大潜力。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">仅仅表现得像聚集在一块神奇的黑板前一样，就具有很大的价值——每个人都可以轻松地从自己的笔记或熟悉的参考资料中取出材料，将对方提供的任何材料复制到自己的私人工作场所。</font></font></p><p><font size="-1">But consider the great potential already existing when some of the participants -- or even a single participant -- can effectively use computer tools to work with the relevant materials and processes. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">There is a great value in merely conducting themselves as though they were congregated at a magic blackboard -- each easily able to pull forth materials from his notes or familiar reference sources, copy across into his private workplace any material offered from what the other brings forth.</font></font></p>
      <font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">1969 年，ARC 成为 ARPAnet 系统的原始节点之一，该系统将全国各地的国防相关研究计算机连接成一个网络。该网络是 Bob Taylor 的创意，使用公共运营商通信线路将全国各地的计算机连接起来。当各个分时社区忙于交换数据、程序和消息时，ARC 人员将他们参与网络视为一个充分运用知识的机会，并将他们的实验扩展到 SRI 实验室之外，覆盖全国所有连接到网络的人。

      </font></font><p>随着网络的发展，ARC 从其不断重新设计自身的主要活动领域中分道扬镳。它开始充当网络信息中心，为 ARPAnet 用户组成的分布式社区提供参考和组织服务。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">增强实验室不再是 SRI 庞大场地上半被遗忘的半圆拱形活动房，而是配备了最新的分时硬件，到 1970 年，它成为了 VIP 参观的骄傲主题。</font></p><p>As the network grew, ARC branched out from its primary activity of continually redesigning itself. It began serving as the Network Information Center, offering referencing and organizing services for the distributed community of ARPAnet users. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">No longer languishing in a half-forgotten Quonset somewhere on the huge SRI grounds, the augmentation laboratory, equipped with the latest time-sharing hardware, was by 1970 the proud subject of VIP tours.</font></p>

      <p>经过这么多年的孤独想象，恩格尔巴特对他们事业的最终意义比刚开始时更加乐观。1970 年春天，他在多路访问计算机网络跨学科会议上告诉同事们：</p><p>After so many years of solitary envisioning, Engelbart had become even more optimistic about the ultimate significance of their enterprise than he had been when he started. In the spring of 1970 he told his colleagues at the Interdisciplinary conference on multi-access Computer Networks:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">...二十年来，我一直在与这些概念作斗争，我所看到的迹象至少告诉我，我们的思维方式和工作方式的变化将比我们任何人想象的更为普遍和极端——一场像写作和印刷机的发展一样的革命。...</font>

        <p><font size="-1">甚至要绘制出该领域的目前可见的规模，勘探者也需要几十年的时间。真正的热潮尚未开始：这次会议是寻求勘探者贸易的供应商的会议；我们还没有真正关注勘探之后的发展。</font></p><p><font size="-1">It will take explorers of this domain decades even to map its currently visible dimensions. The real rush hasn't begun: this Conference is a meeting of suppliers looking for the prospector trade; we haven't really been giving attention to the developments that will follow the prospecting.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">我的研究小组现在正进入下一个阶段的工作，我们称之为<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">“团队增强”。在这里，我们不仅仅是让个人按照办公室提供的条件，方便地进行私人领域的搜索、学习、思考和制定，我们还在探索如何为一个由“增强个人”组成的团队做点什么，这些个人共同拥有一些终端、一套计算机工具、工作文件等（就像我们一样），以促进他们的团队合作。</font></font></p><p><font size="-1">My research group is now moving into a next stage of work that we call <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"team augmentation." Here, instead of just the individual facilitating his private domain searching, studying, thinking and formulating, as his office place provides for him, we are exploring what can be done for a team of "augmented individuals" who have in common a number of terminals, a set of computer tools, working files, etc. (as we do), to facilitate their team collaborations.</font></font></p>
      

      <p>恩格尔巴特在 20 世纪 50 年代独自梦想的解决问题的帮助，变成了他在 1963 年提出的“集成工作环境”，而这又发展成为工具制造者的工具包，他和他的一小群同事在接下来的七年里用它建造了一个“智力工作室”。到 20 世纪 70 年代初，更广泛的 ARPA 资助的计算机研究人员和商界代表也加入了引导过程。矛盾的是，就在他们领导决定“团队扩充”是他们的目标时，他自己的团队开始对日益增长的压力——技术、心理和社会——做出负面反应。</p><p>The problem-solving assistance Engelbart had dreamed about alone in the 1950s became the "integrated working environment" he proposed in 1963, which in turn grew into the toolbuilders' toolkit that he and his small group of colleagues used to build an "intellectual workshop" throughout the remaining seven years of the decade. By the early 1970s, the wider community of ARPA-funded computer researchers and representatives of the business world were joining the bootstrapping process. Paradoxically, just when their leader decided that "team augmentation" would be their goal, his own team began to react negatively to growing pressures -- technological, psychological, and social.</p>

      <p>道格一直警告说：“大型增强系统比它所依赖的技术‘子系统’复杂得多”，而 20 世纪 70 年代正是 ARC 开始实践恩格尔巴特所宣扬的理念的时代。在实验室成立的第一个十年里，计算机技术以惊人的速度发展，SRI 团队竭尽全力尽快利用这些创新技术。</p><p>Doug had always warned that "the larger augmentation system is much more complex than the technological 'subsystem' upon which it depends," and the 1970s were the era when ARC began to practice what Engelbart had preached. During the first decade of the laboratory's existence, computer technology had progressed at an astonishing pace, and the SRI crew were doing their utmost to use the innovations as quickly as they came along.</p>

      <p>“二元法则”（即计算机性能每两年翻一番）和恩格尔巴特激发的增强团队的热情使他们有动力努力引导并不断调整自己以适应升级后的工具的功能——这是一项需要非凡努力的工作。引导和重新调整以不减的热情继续进行，至少直到 20 世纪 70 年代初，当建立一个旨在“每六到八个月超越自我”以跟上硬件和软件进步的系统的想法被证明是令人愉快而不是可行时。建立这个用于增强思维的新系统是一项挑战，令人兴奋——但以强行行进的速度增强一个人的工作习惯并不那么有趣。</p><p>The "rule of two" (that computer power would double every two years) and the Engelbart-induced zeal of the augmentation team kept them fueled for an effort to bootstrap and continually adjust themselves to the capabilities of their upgraded tools -- an effort that required extraordinary intensity. The bootstrapping and readjusting continued with unabated enthusiasm, at least until the early 1970s, when the idea of building a system that was meant to "transcend itself every six to eight months" to keep pace with hardware and software advances turned out to be more pleasant to contemplate than to carry out. It had been a challenging and exhilarating to build this new system for augmenting thought -- but it wasn't as much fun having one's work habits augmented at a forced-march pace.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">当这个不断发展的项目的老手和新人都面临着定期学习新角色、改变旧态度、采用不同方法的任务时，仅仅因为系统使他们能够这样做，这项伟大的冒险就变得比任何 ARC 先驱/实验对象所预料的都要艰巨。</font>因此，一位心理学家被请来咨询系统中那些不在电路或软件中，而是在构建和使用系统的人的思想和关系中发现的部分。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">When both the old-timers and newcomers to the growing project faced the task of learning new roles, changing old attitudes, adopting different methods, on regular basis, just because the system enabled them to do so, the great adventure became more arduous than any of the ARC pioneers/experimental subjects had anticipated.</font> So a psychologist was brought in to consult about those parts of the system that weren't found in the circuitry or software, but in the thoughts and relationships of the people who were building and using the system.</p>

      <p>詹姆斯·法迪曼博士以观察员、催化剂和治疗师的身份加入了 ARC。法迪曼对人类意识和行为在新情况下的变化方式特别感兴趣，他很快就意识到“增强”的过程实际上是一种新的、非化学形式的意识改变。</p><p>Dr. James Fadiman joined ARC as an observer-catalyst-therapist. Fadiman was particularly interested in the ways human consciousness and behavior change in new situations, and it didn't take him long to realize that the process of "being augmented" was in fact a new, nonchemical form of altered consciousness.</p>

      <p>费迪曼花了十多年时间才了解到“增强体验”的几个方面，这些方面是为非专业人士设计计算机的人们所了解的。他几乎立刻就了解到的一件事是，大多数人都抗拒改变，尤其是在工作场所，而且抗拒是双向的——抗拒学习增强系统的人，一旦采用了它，同样也抗拒放弃它。最初的抗拒部分源于对未知事物的普遍恐惧。</p><p>Several of the things Fadiman learned about the "augmentation experience" have taken more than a decade to filter out to people who design computers for nonexperts. One thing he learned almost immediately was that most people resist change, especially in the workplace, and resistance works both ways -- people who are resistant to learning an augmentation system are equally resistant to giving it up once they have adopted it. The initial resistance is partially grounded in a general fear of the unknown.</p>

      <p>当然，道格·恩格尔巴特 (Doug Engelbart) 以自己的视角和工程师的眼光看待这些事情。当然，这其中会存在一些困难、软件和人际缺陷、争论和冲突——但考虑到他多年来一直独自工作，总体规划进展顺利。工具包已经成为一个车间，他们知道这个车间确实有效，因为他们已经做了十年的实验鼠。</p><p>Doug Engelbart, of course, saw these things on his own scale, and through the eyes of an engineer. There would be rough spots, software and interpersonal bugs, arguments and conflicts, to be sure -- but the master plan was progressing nicely, considering all those years he had worked alone. The toolkit had become a workshop, and they knew the workshop indeed worked because they had been their own guinea pigs for a decade.</p>

      <p>恩格尔巴特在 1970 年的一次演讲中将多路访问计算社区称为“关注勘探者贸易的供应商会议”，他<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">还预测未来将“有越来越多的人将大量的工作时间花在终端上”，并推测未来分散的个人增强系统将连接在一起形成网络社区，从而创造出新型的社会机构：“特别是，将会出现一个新的‘市场’，代表着知识、服务、信息、处理、存储等商品的巨大财富。”</font></p><p>In the same 1970 address in which he referred to the multiaccess computing community as a "meeting of suppliers looking at the prospector trade," <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Engelbart also predicted that the future would see "a steadily increasing number of people who spend a significant amount of their professional time at terminals," and speculated that the future of dispersed personal augmentation systems linked together into network communities would create new kinds of societal institutions: "In particular, there will emerge a new 'marketplace,' representing fantastic wealth in commodities of knowledge, service, information, processing, storage, etc."</font></p>

      <p>恩格尔巴特一如既往地积极进取，他已经将商界人士带入了 ARC 实验。业务经理和管理科学家一直在 ARC 工作，尝试使用 NLS 工具来管理稳步发展的 ARC 项目。他们以适当的引导方式，将尝试将该系统应用于自己的研究管理视为又一次实验。理查德·沃森和詹姆斯·C·诺顿与 ARC 密切合作，将他们的实验发现开发成一个系统，供非计算机专家但工作涉及信息处理的人使用。</p><p>In his usual forge-ahead manner, Engelbart was already bringing members of the business community into the ARC experiment. Business managers and management scientists had been working at ARC, experimenting with using NLS tools to manage the steadily growing ARC project. In proper bootstrapping style, they looked at their attempts to apply the system to their own research management as yet another experiment. Richard Watson and James C. Norton worked closely with ARC to develop their experimental discoveries into a system that would be usable by people who were not computer experts but whose occupations involved the manipulation of information.</p>

      <p>20 世纪 70 年代初，恩格尔巴特受到一本书的启发，就像他多年来对布什和利克莱德的杂志文章充满热​​情一样。这一次，这本书是企业管理专家<a href="http://www.mag.keio.ac.jp/~derick/drucker.html">彼得·德鲁克</a>在 20 世纪 60 年代末提出的理论。根据德鲁克的定义，知识是信息的系统组织；<font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><a href="http://www.pangea.ca/~dayre/kwork.html">知识工作者</a>是创造知识并将其应用于生产目的的人。德鲁克预测，以知识为基础的经济的迅速崛起将是 20 世纪最后 25 年最重要的社会变革。</font></p><p>Sometime in the early 1970s, Engelbart was inspired by a book, just as he had been enthused by magazine articles by Bush and Licklider in years past. This time, it was the theory proposed by business management expert <a href="http://www.mag.keio.ac.jp/~derick/drucker.html">Peter Drucker</a> in the late 1960s. Knowledge, by Drucker's definition, is the systematic organization of information; <font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><a href="http://www.pangea.ca/~dayre/kwork.html">a knowledge worker</a> is a person who creates and applies knowledge to productive ends. The rapid emergence of an economy based primarily on knowledge, Drucker predicted, would be the most significant social transformation of the last quarter of the twentieth century.</font></p>

      <p>德鲁克注意到，美国经济中知识产业的未来似乎与恩格尔巴特在第二个十年之初为增强计划规划的路线趋于一致，虽然方向出乎意料，但并非不可预测。德鲁克是越来越多社会科学家中最早声称，对劳动力统计数据的考察可以揭示知识工作在每个人未来中所扮演的角色的科学家之一。</p><p>Drucker noted something about the future of knowledge in the American economy that seemed to converge, from an unexpected but not unpredictable direction, with the course Engelbart had plotted for the augmentation project at the beginning of its second decade. Drucker was one of the first of a growing number of social scientists who have claimed that an examination of labor statistics reveals a great deal about the role of knowledge work in everybody's future.</p>

      <p>1973 年，在他独创的“框架……”发表十年后，恩格尔巴特、沃森和诺顿在全国计算机会议上提交了一篇关于“增强知识研讨会”的论文。作者承认他们从德鲁克的思想中受益匪浅，并指出 ARC 开发的特殊计算机系统旨在缓解“知识和知识工作正在加速主导我们社会的工作活动”所带来的问题：</p><p>In 1973, ten years after his solo "Framework . . . ," Engelbart, Watson, and Norton presented a paper on "The Augmented Knowledge Workshop" to the National Computer Conference. Acknowledging their debt to Drucker's ideas, the authors pointed out that the special computer systems that had been evolving at ARC were designed to alleviate the problems associated with "the accelerating rate at which knowledge and knowledge work are coming to dominate the working activity of our society':</p>

      
        <font size="-1">1900 年，大多数美国人和最大的单一群体靠农场谋生。到 1940 年，最大的单一群体是产业工人，尤其是半熟练的机器操作员。到 1960 年，最大的单一群体是专业、管理和技术人员，也就是知识型工人。到 1975-80 年，这个群体将涵盖大多数美国人。德鲁克认为，知识生产力已经成为国家生产力、竞争力和经济成就的关键。知识，而不是土地、原材料或资本，已经成为生产的核心因素。</font>
      

      <p>恩格尔巴特、沃森和诺顿注意到德鲁克使用了“知识组织”和“知识技术”等术语，他们提出了增强知识工作室的概念，即为“知识部门”的每个人重新设计工作环境。作者承认，普通<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">的知识工作室——办公室、会议室、图书馆、大学、工作室——已经存在了几个世纪。然而，增强知识工作室仅作为原型存在，直到 ARC（当时在河对岸的一个新地方，称为<a href="#OEBPS/Text/10.html">PARC</a>）率先采用的技术变得足够经济，可以作为办公设备出售时，它才得到广泛使用。</font>这个想法后来被其他人改编成一个精简版，被称为“未来办公室”。</p><p>Noting Drucker's use of terms such as "knowledge organizations" and "knowledge technologies," Engelbart, Watson, and Norton specified an augmented knowledge workshop that was nothing less than a totally redesigned working environment for everybody in the "knowledge sector." The authors acknowledged that <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">ordinary knowledge workshops -- offices, boardrooms, libraries, universities, studios -- have existed for centuries. Augmented knowledge workshops, however, existed only as prototypes, and would not come into widespread usage until the technologies pioneered at ARC (and by then, at a new place across the creek, called <a href="#OEBPS/Text/10.html">PARC</a>) grew economical enough to sell as office equipment.</font> This was the origin of an idea that was later adapted by others in a truncated version known as "The Office of the Future."</p>

      <p>作者描述了他们为个人和团体增强自身知识而开发和使用的技术，但强调这些工具只是系统全面变革的第一步——包括方法、态度、角色、生活方式和工作习惯的变化。他们从自己的经验中知道，心理和社会调整将是将这些系统引入现有组织所引发的最强烈和最剧烈的变化。</p><p>The authors described the technology they had built and used for augmenting their own knowledge as individuals and in groups, but emphasized that the tools were only the first part of a total transformation of the system -- including changes in methods, attitudes, roles, lifestyles, and working habits. They knew from their own experience that the psychological and social adjustments would be the most intense and volatile changes set off by the introduction of these systems into existing organizations.</p>

      <p>1975 年，在持续支持了 12 年之后，ARPA 放弃了 ARC。员工人数迅速从 35 人减少到 12 人，然后又减少到几个人，最后只剩下 Doug Engelbart 和一大批软件。在软件技术飞速发展的世界中，十年的有用工作是闻所未闻的时间长度，但引导过程让 NLS 不断发展，因为它扩大了实用性，随着它升级到具有更大内存和更快处理器的机器，随着社区思考如何利用它做新事情。</p><p>In 1975, after twelve years of continuous support, ARPA dropped ARC. The staff quickly shrank from a high of thirty-five to a dozen, then down to a few, and finally down to Doug Engelbart and a large amount of software. A decade of useful work is an unheard of length of time in the hyperaccelerated world of software technology, but bootstrapping had kept NLS continually evolving as it expanded its usefulness, as it moved up to machines with larger memories and faster processors, and as the community thought of new things to do with it.</p>

      <p>甚至在 ARPA 大幅削减资金之前，ARC 就已经开始为几家想要尝试使用增强系统服务的公司提供订阅服务。在 Engelbart 看来，经过长时间的酝酿后，是时候将系统从研究领域中推出，在现实世界的用户社区中进行测试了。SRI 则认为，整个项目显然已经完成了，可以吸引研究资金，他们不妨将其出售。1977 年，SRI 将整个增强系统出售给 Tymshare Corporation，Engelbart 也随之而去。该系统更名为“Augment”，现在由 Tymshare 作为其办公自动化服务之一进行营销。</p><p>Even before ARPA drastically reduced its funding, ARC had started a subscription service to several corporations who wanted to experiment with using the services of the augmentation system. The way Engelbart saw it, it was time to bring the system out of the research world, after its extended gestation, to test it on a community of real-world users. The way SRI saw it was that the whole project was obviously finished as a magnet for research funds, and they might as well sell it. In 1977, SRI sold the entire augmentation system to Tymshare Corporation, and Engelbart went with it. The system, renamed "Augment," is now marketed by Tymshare as one of their office automation services.</p>

      <p>没有人会质疑，恩格尔巴特的远见是计算机科学领域在二十年最动荡的岁月中保持稳定的唯一因素，那些知道恩格尔巴特对计算机发展的重要性的少数同事也不愿说他的坏话，但人们<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">心照不宣的共识是，道格·恩格尔巴特这位有远见的人让自己对过时的远见着迷。NLS 功能强大但非常复杂，在恩格尔巴特的学生创造的不那么复杂但更平等的个人计算机世界中，学习复杂而困难的语言来操作信息载体的知识精英的概念并不那么流行。</font></p><p>Nobody disputes that Engelbart's vision was the single factor that stayed stable through twenty of the most turbulent years of computer science, and those few colleagues who know of his importance to the evolution of computing are loathe to speak unkindly of him, yet <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">the tacit consensus is that Doug Engelbart the visionary allowed himself to remain fascinated by an obsolescent vision. NLS was powerful but very complex, and the notion of a kind of knowledge elite who learned complex and difficult languages to operate information vehicles is not as fashionable in the world of less sophisticated but more egalitarian personal computers created by Engelbart's students.</font></p>

      <p>ARC 在 SRI 的 12 年鼎盛时期，即 1963 年至 1975 年，是技术狂野的时期。那段时期也是历史、社会和文化发生巨大变革的时期。项目始于肯尼迪政府时期，持续了数年，经历了越南战争、校园暴动、暗杀、反主流文化兴起、妇女解放运动兴起、水门事件，并于卡特政府时期结束，在项目实施过程中，错误、冲突、死胡同和其他陷阱是不可避免的。</p><p>The twelve years of ARC's heyday at SRI, from 1963 to 1975, were technologically wild years. That period was one of enormous historical, social, and cultural upheavals, as well. Mistakes, conflicts, blind alleys, and other pitfalls were unavoidable during the course of a project that began in the Kennedy administration and continued throughout the years of the Vietnam war, campus revolts, assassinations, the emergence of the counterculture, the advent of women's liberation, Watergate, and ended during the Carter administration.</p>

      <p>无论是个人还是团体，ARC 都无法免受影响其他文化的冲突的影响，尽管它了解自己的变异形式。在反主流文化引起媒体轰动、成千上万的富裕美国子孙开始行为怪异、留长发之前，拥有<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">强大计算机的地方已经催生出自己的怪人品牌——黑客。计算机亚文化中这种新亚文化的出现并不是 ARC 衰落的直接原因，但它是恩格尔巴特在 20 世纪 70 年代面临的问题的征兆。</font></p><p>As individuals, and as a group, ARC wasn't immune to the conflicts that affected the rest of the culture, although it was privy to its own mutated forms of it. Before the counterculture made its media splash and thousands of affluent American offspring started acting weird and growing their hair long, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">places where powerful computers were to be found had already spawned their own brand of weirdo -- the hacker. The advent of this new subculture within the computer subculture was not the direct cause of ARC's downfall, but it was symptomatic of the problems Engelbart faced in the 1970s.</font></p>

      <p>恩格尔巴特发现自己陷入了雇主的保守主义和最优秀学生的激进主义之间。ARC 对 SRI 的老派数据处理人员来说似乎有点陌生，而这些在 Doug 实验室里混在一起的新人让原本就紧张的关系更加恶化，文化和技术也更加不同。说 SRI 保守一点也不过分。尽管他们的研究人员研究的一些课题可能不合常规，但他们的客户都是一些严谨的机构，如国防部、情报界和百强企业。</p><p>Engelbart found himself caught between the conservatism of his employers and the radicalism of his best students. ARC had seemed a bit strange to the old-line data-processing types at SRI, and these new people hanging out at Doug's lab added cultural as well as technological differences to an already strained relationship. To say that SRI is conservative is an understatement. Although some of the subjects their researchers pursue can be unorthodox, their clients are such straitlaced institutions as the Defense Department, the intelligence community, and the top one hundred corporations.</p>

      <p>在 SRI 狭长、干净、高度安全的大厅里，黑客几乎是无法容忍的。但当反主流文化开始渗透，谣言四起，说一些黑客以多种方式增强自己的意识时，SRI 高层变得非常不安。</p><p>Hackers were barely tolerated in the long, clean, high-security halls of SRI. But when the counterculture started to infiltrate, and the rumors started about some of the hackers augmenting their consciousness in more ways than one, SRI brass became extremely uncomfortable.</p>

      <p>内部和上层都出现了问题。在恩格尔巴特本人的鼓励下，ARC 组织开展了一些“新时代”社会组织实验，威胁到将其分裂为两个阵营——一部分人内心仍然是技术人员，只关心计算机技术的进步；另一部分人将增强技术视为他们周围正在发生的更广泛的反文化革命不可或缺的一部分。还有一些人认为，道格的技术理念虽然曾经激进而具有未来感，但现在也过时了。增强团队和高级分时系统的想法开始对那些正在探索个人电脑可能性的年轻人来说显得有些过时了。</p><p>There was trouble from within, as well as from above. Some of the experiments in "new-age" social organization, encouraged by Engelbart himself, threatened to split the ARC group into two camps -- those who were still techies at heart, concerned only with the advancement of the state of computing art, and those who saw augmentation as an integral part of the wider countercultural revolution that was going on around them. And there were those who felt that even Doug's technological ideas, although they might have once been radical and futuristic, were becoming outmoded. The idea of augmentation teams and high-level time-shared systems began to seem a bit old-hat to the younger folks who were exploring the possibility of personal computers.</p>

      <p>20 世纪 70 年代初，恩格尔巴特招募的一些首批也是最重要的员工（他们曾帮助他创建了第一个 NLS 系统）离开 SRI，转而加入施乐公司正在组建的新研究中心 PARC。施乐公司的新设施是增强导向思想的温床，但有一个重大区别——大规模集成电路的出现使人们能够梦想甚至设计出可以放在个人办公桌上的高性能计算机。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">这种对一人一台计算机的强调与恩格尔巴特的方法在哲学和技术上存在重大差异。</font></p><p>In the early 1970s, some of Engelbart's first and most important recruits, who had helped him create the first NLS system, left SRI for PARC, the new research center Xerox was putting together. The new Xerox facility was a hotbed of augmentation-oriented thought, but with a major difference -- the advent of large-scale integrated circuitry made it possible to dream of, and even design, high-powered computers that could fit on an individual's desk. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">This emphasis on one person, one computer made for important philosophical and technical differences with Engelbart's approach.</font></p>

      <p>有一段时间，斯坦福研究院的恩格尔巴特和他在施乐公司的前学生一直在合作，但最终 PARC 和 ARC 还是分道扬镳了。道格仍然梦想着在大学和行业中建立增强中心，为任何从事信息工作的团队提供服务。ARC 的前成员期待着更广泛的潜在计算机用户。施乐公司的想法是利用新的集成电路技术制造比前几代小型计算机更强大的计算机——并将整台计算机分配给每个人，而不是在三四十个用户之间共享。</p><p>For a while, Engelbart at SRI and his former students at Xerox were engaged in collaboration, but eventually PARC and ARC drifted apart. Doug still dreamed of creating augmentation centers in universities and industries, providing a service for any team of people who worked with information. The former ARC members were looking forward to an even wider potential computer-using population. The idea at Xerox was to use the new integrated circuit technology to create computers more powerful than the previous generations of minicomputers -- and to devote an entire computer to each person, instead of sharing it among thirty or forty users.</p>

      <p>我们将会看到，PARC 后来成为那些将计算机视为增强人类智力工具的人的新圣地。ARC 似乎从未到达应许之地，而这位前激进技术的领军人物似乎越来越孤立于一个有趣但影响力不大的穷乡僻壤。随着恩格尔巴特早期的梦想越来越多地在其他机构成为现实，这种判断似乎不太公平。如果没有 ARC，就不可能知道是否会有 PARC，虽然小型化革命在技术意义上使个人计算机成为必然，但有充分的理由质疑，如果没有恩格尔巴特和他的同事们所做的开创性工作，今天的个人计算是否永远不会被开发出来。</p><p>PARC, as we shall see, went on to become the new mecca for those who saw the computer as a tool for augmenting the human intellect. ARC never seemed to make it to the promised land, and the former point-man for radical technology seemed to be more and more isolated in an interesting but less than influential backwater. As more and more of Engelbart's earlier dreams became realities in other institutions, this judgment seemed to be less than fair. It is impossible to tell if there would have been a PARC if there hadn't been an ARC, and while the miniaturization revolution made personal computers inevitable in a technical sense, there is good reason to question whether the kind of personal computing that exists today would ever have been developed if it had not been for the pathfinding work accomplished by Engelbart and his colleagues.</p>

      <p>道格·恩格尔巴特和帮助他建立 ARC 的人未能成功建立知识工作者的乌托邦。一些黑客似乎对计算机有病态的依赖。这些事实可能与其他人使用他们创建的工具的后代的方式关系不大。事实上，如果你仔细想想，MAC 和 ARC 黑客中一些最狂野、最糊涂的人继承了并非普通公民的悠久传统——从巴贝奇和洛夫莱斯到图灵和冯·诺依曼。</p><p>Doug Engelbart and the people who helped him build ARC did not succeed in building a knowledge workers' utopia. Some hackers do seem to be pathologically attached to computers. These facts might have very little to do with the way other people will use the descendants of the tools they created. In fact, if you think about it, some of the wildest and woolliest of the MAC and ARC hackers were following in a long tradition of people who weren't exactly run-of-the-mill citizens -- from Babbage and Lovelace to Turing and von Neumann.</p>

      <p>必须记住，MAC 和 ARC 只是将计算提升到全新水平的更大努力的一部分，黑客并不是参与这项工作的唯一科学家兼工匠。无论未来的历史学家如何评价参与实施这一前所未有的有计划突破的行动的人的个性，他们都必须考虑<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">黑客在 20 世纪 60 年代和 70 年代初创造分时、计算机网络和个人计算机的作用，他们不是出于病态的痴迷或团体内的轻浮，而是出于构建人类交流新媒介的强烈愿望。</font></p><p>It must be remembered that MAC and ARC were only part of a larger effort to raise computing to a whole new level, and hackers weren't the only scientist-artisans involved in that effort. Whatever future historians decide about the personalities of the people involved in carrying out this unprecedented exercise in planned breakthrough, they will have to consider <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">the role of the hackers who created time-sharing, computer networks, and personal computers in the 1960s and early 1970s, not out of sick obsession or in-group frivolity, but out of a serious desire to construct a new medium for human communication.</font></p>

      <p>目前，道格·恩格尔巴特仍在努力实现他最初的目标，将 NLS 的核心应用于 20 世纪 80 年代开始使用的新型计算机。对于 Tymshare Corporation 的客户来说，Augment 系统似乎不那么科幻，在这个办公自动化时代更实用。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">商界人士开始关注道格所说的话，这是几十年前他第一次这么说。</font></p><p>For the time being, Doug Engelbart still works away at his original goals, adapting the core of NLS to the new kind of computers that have come to use in the 1980s. To Tymshare Corporation's customers, the Augment system seems less science-fiction-like and more practical in this age of office automation. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">People in the business world are beginning to pay attention to what Doug is saying, for the first time since he started saying it, decades ago.</font></p>

      <p>然而，道格既不富有，也不出名，更不强大——这些从来都不是他的目标。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他似乎只渴望一个他一直渴望的世界——一个愿意接受他想要给予的帮助的世界。讽刺的是，他在加利福尼亚州库比蒂诺 Tymshare 的办公室距离苹果公司总部只有几个街区，而图标、鼠标、窗口、位图屏幕和其他恩格尔巴特发起的创意现在都是一家价值数十亿美元的企业的一部分。</font></p><p>Still, Doug is neither rich nor famous nor powerful -- not that these were ever his goals. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">All he seems to hunger for is all he ever hungered for -- a world that is prepared for the kind of help he wants to give. Ironically, his office at Tymshare in Cupertino, California, is merely blocks away from the headquarters of Apple Corporation, where icons and mice and windows and bit-mapped screens and other Engelbart-originated ideas are now part of a billion-dollar enterprise.</font></p>

      <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">1983 年，看到一位高管，尤其是计算机研究机构的经理，在办公室使用个人电脑并不稀奇。<i>这台</i>个人电脑的独特之处在于它是<i>Alto——</i><i>第一台</i>个人电脑。泰勒和他的团队从 1974 年起就一直在使用它。一条小电缆将 Alto 连接到以太网<i>——</i>一种将 PARC 的研究人员彼此以及与世界各地的同事联系起来的媒介。</font>

      <p>该屏幕比大多数计算机显示器都要高，而且即使从房间的另一边看，它看起来也与其他计算机屏幕不同。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">它不是单一的屏幕大小的框架，上面布满了数字、字母或图形，而是有许多不同大小的方块，用施乐的说法就是<i>窗口</i></font>，看起来就像桌子上重叠的纸张。符号和图像也明显比我习惯在计算机屏幕上看到的要清晰。</p><p>The screen was taller than most computer displays, and it looked different from other computer screens, even when seen from across the room. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Instead of a single screen-sized frame filled with numbers or letters or graphs, there were a number of squares of various sized, known in Xerox parlance as <i>windows</i></font>, that looked like overlapping pieces of paper on a desk. The symbols and images were also distinctly sharper than what I was accustomed to seeing on a computer screen.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">鼠标是恩格尔巴特创新的升级版，通过一根细线与 Alto 相连。当泰勒将鼠标在靠近屏幕的桌面上滑动时，一个箭头形状的小黑色指针会在屏幕上移动。</font>当他点击鼠标顶部的按钮之一或将指针移到边缘时，指针会改变形状，屏幕上会出现一些变化。1984 年，苹果公司的 Macintosh 电脑向大众市场推出了这种处理电子桌面的方式。对泰勒来说，这并不是特别具有未来感。Alto 和以太网自 1974 年以来就已在这里运行。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The mouse, an update of Engelbart's innovation, was connected to the Alto with a thin wire. As Taylor slid the mouse around the desk surface next to the screen, a small dark pointer shaped like an arrow moved around the screen.</font> When he clicked one of the buttons on top of the mouse or moved the pointer into a margin, the pointer changed shape and things happened on the screen. In 1984, Apple corporation's Macintosh computer introduced a mass market to this way of handling an electronic desktop. To Taylor, it wasn't particularly futuristic. Altos and Ethernets had been in operation since 1974 around here.</p>

      <p>到 1983 年，鲍勃·泰勒 (Bob Taylor) 对他和其他几个人 20 年前设定的目标的进展只感到一半满意，因为他认为新技术只完成了一半。尽管他所在的办公室、触手可及的电子工作站以及他周围的研究机构都是增强社区几十年前梦想的现实范例，但泰勒认为，布什和利克莱德预言的<font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><a href="#vc.book">交互式信息社区</a></font><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">可能还需要十年或二十年的艰苦努力才能真正影响更广泛的人群。<a href="#vc.book"></a></font></p><p>By 1983, Bob Taylor was only half-satisfied with his progress toward what he and a few others set out to achieve twenty years ago, because he believed that the new technology was only halfway built. Despite the fact that the office he was sitting in, the electronic workstation at his fingertips, and the research organization around him were functioning examples of what the augmentation community dreamed about decades ago, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Taylor thought that it might take another ten or twenty years of hard work before <a href="#vc.book">the interactive informational communities</a> foretold by Bush and Licklider would truly affect the wider population.</font></p>

      <p>1965 年，33 岁的罗伯特·泰勒在五角大楼的办公室里工作，先是担任 ARPA 信息处理技术办公室的副主任，后来又担任主任。他的工作是寻找和资助涉及分时、人工智能、编程语言、图形显示、操作系统和其他计算机科学关键领域的研究项目。“我们的经验法则，”他回忆道，“是资助那些很有可能将信息处理水平提高一个数量级的人。”</p><p>In 1965, at the age of thirty-three, Robert Taylor worked out of his office in the Pentagon, as deputy director, then as director, of the ARPA Information Processing Techniques Office. His job was to find and fund research projects involving time-sharing, artificial intelligence, programming languages, graphic displays, operating systems, and other crucial areas of computer science. "Our rule of thumb," he remembers, "was to fund people who had a good chance of advancing the state of information processing by an order of magnitude."</p>

      <p>鲍勃·泰勒还负责发起创建 ARPAnet，这是美国国防部创建的计算机（和思维）原型网络社区，该项目始于 1966 年，并成为仍在推动计算机技术发展的核心人员的非正式成年礼。1969 年泰勒离开 ARPA 后，负责建立和运行网络的拉里·罗伯茨接替了泰勒。在犹他大学工作一年后，泰勒加入了施乐公司在斯坦福附近组建的研究项目。</p><p>Bob Taylor was also responsible for initiating the creation of the ARPAnet -- the prototype network community of computers (and minds) created by the Department of Defense, an effort that began in 1966 and became an informal rite of passage for the nucleus of people who are still advancing the state of the computing art. Larry Roberts, who was responsible for getting the network up and running, succeeded Taylor when Taylor left ARPA in 1969. After a year at the University of Utah, Taylor joined the research effort Xerox Corporation was assembling near Stanford.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">1970 年，由于反对越南战争的呼声日益高涨，以及 ARPA 所有研究都被军事化，一批计算机网络和交互式计算等新领域的杰出人才正在寻找更加广阔的天地，而此时，有一家公司决定为他们提供最广阔的天地。</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">In 1970, a combination of growing opposition to the Vietnam war, and the militarization of all ARPA research, meant that an extraordinary collection of talent in the new fields of computer networks and interactive computing were looking for greener pastures at a time when one corporation decided to provide the greenest pastures imaginable.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">1969 年，施乐公司首席执行官彼得·麦考洛宣布，他打算让施乐成为未来的“信息架构师”。</font>为此，20 世纪 70 年代初，一个研究机构在帕洛阿尔托成立。麦考洛任命乔治·帕克负责。帕克做的第一件事就是聘请他能找到的最好的长期计算机远见者、研究组织者和人才收集者——鲍勃·泰勒。起初，新招募的工程师、黑客和远见者在位于帕洛阿尔托平原、斯坦福大学校园附近的临时住所工作。20 世纪 70 年代中期，在惠普公司上方、Syntex 旁边的一块黄金地段开始建设，这片肥沃的飞地被称为“斯坦福工业园”。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">In 1969, Peter McColough, CEO of Xerox Corporation, announced his intention to make Xerox "the architect of information" for the future.</font> To that end, a research organization was assembled in Palo Alto, in the early 1970s. McColough put a man named George Pake in charge. One of the first things Pake did was hire the best long-term computer visionary, research organizer, and people-collector he could find -- Bob Taylor. At first, the newly recruited engineers, hackers, and visionaries worked in temporary quarters located in the Palo Alto flatlands, near the Stanford University campus. In the mid 1970s construction began on a prime piece of ground above Hewlett-Packard, next to Syntex, in that fertile enclave known as "The Stanford Industrial Park."</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">如果说“知识领域”的技术前沿有一个模范环境，那么 PARC 就是其中之一。</font>从激光实验室的物理学家和定制微芯片商店的工程工匠到计算机语言设计师、人工智能程序员、认知生理学家、视频主持人、音响工程师、机械师、图书管理员、秘书、厨师、看门人和保安，你遇到的每个人都会给你一种美好的、模范乌托邦的感觉。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">If there was ever a model environment for the technological cutting edge of the "knowledge sector," PARC was it.</font> From the physicists in the laser laboratories and the engineer-artisans in the custom microchip shops to the computer language designers, artificial intelligence programmers, cognitive physiologists, video jockeys, sound engineers, machinists, librarians, secretaries, cooks, janitors, and security guards, you got a nice, model-utopian feeling from everybody you encountered.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">实体工厂本身就是一项不可避免的创新活动。我花了一段时间才不再认为这个地方是颠倒的。</font>由于梯田式玻璃和混凝土结构是半嵌在土狼山中的，是祖尼普韦布洛风格，因此主入口位于顶层。要从一楼到二楼，您需要走下去<i>。</i>办公室、实验室和会议室相连的四合院环绕着中庭和花园。自助餐厅俯瞰帕洛阿尔托；您可以将托盘带到露台，从这个二十一世纪悬崖住宅的有利位置俯瞰海湾。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The physical plant itself is an inescapable exercise in innovation. It took me a while to stop thinking of the place as being upside down.</font> Since the terraced glass-and-concrete structure was built halfway embedded in Coyote Hill, Zuni Pueblo style, the main entrance is on the top floor. To get to the second floor from the ground floor, you go <i>down</i>. The linked quadrangles of offices, laboratories, and meeting rooms wind around atriums and gardens. The cafeteria overlooks Palo Alto; you can take your tray out to the terrace and look down on the bay from the vantage of this twenty-first-century cliff dwelling.</p>

      <p>环绕四合院的走廊外是办公室隔间，许多隔间的门都敞开着。在敞开的隔间里，各种各样的人打电话或盯着他们独特的长方形 Alto 屏幕。有些隔间里有植物、海报、<a href="http://www.thebeanbagchairoutlet.com/">豆袋椅</a>（广告）、立体声音响、自行车。它们都有书架，上面放着一排排书，还有 PARC 向外界发布的报告所用的亮蓝白色活页夹。许多隔间里的人都很年轻。其中女性的比例比你想象的要大。这群人一直都是跨国人士。</p><p>Off the corridors that wind around the quadrangles are office cubicles, many with their doors open. Inside the open cubicles, various people talk on telephones or stare at their distinctively oblong Alto screens. Some cubicles have plants, posters, <a href="http://www.thebeanbagchairoutlet.com">bean-bag chairs</a> (advertisement), stereos, bicycles. They all have bookshelves with rows of books and the bright blue and white binders used on the reports PARC publishes for the outside world. Many of the cubicle dwellers are young. A larger proportion of them than you might expect are women. It has always been a multinational-looking crowd.</p>

      <p>我很容易就将泰勒与他周围的科学家、工程师、教授、黑客、长发少年、天才少年和天才少女区分开来。尽管如此，风格上的少数差异虽然微妙，但却显而易见。他的许多同事都选择穿凉鞋、羽绒服、扎着科技嬉皮马尾辫、穿蓝色牛仔裤和有或没有自行车夹的皱巴巴的灯芯绒裤子，但泰勒很可能穿着熨烫过的粗花呢夹克和没有皱巴巴的休闲裤。他的金发随意而整洁。当他试图看看你是否跟上他的思路时，他会把额头朝着你，用淡蓝色的眼睛盯着你，如果他的衬衫是牛仔布而不是牛津棉的话，那双眼睛就像老奶奶眼镜。他经常微笑，有时作为一种标点符号。有时，他的声音中会飘来一丝德克萨斯的气息。</p><p>I had no problem distinguishing Taylor from the assorted scientists, engineers, professors, hackers, longhairs, and boy and girl geniuses around him. The few differences in style were subtle but visible, nevertheless. While many of his colleagues opt for sandals, down jackets, techno-hippie ponytails, blue jeans, and rumpled cords with or without bicycle clips, Taylor is likely to be found in a pressed tweed jacket and unrumpled slacks. His blond hair is casual but neat. When he's trying to see if you are following his line of thought, he tilts his forehead in your direction and targets you with pale blue eyes over what would pass for granny glasses if his shirt were denim instead of oxford cotton. He smiles often, sometimes as a form of punctuation. A trace of Texas drifts into his voice at times.</p>

      <p>泰勒认为，个人计算的概念是利克莱德在 20 世纪 60 年代初开始的分时研究的直接产物。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">分时，就像第一种高级语言一样，是计算机科学和增强方法的分水岭。它还在计算世界中创造了一个新的子社区，一个跨越军事、科学、学术和商业计算界限的利益共同体。</font>它是计算机科学家和计算机系统构建者大社区中一个相对较小的亚文化。他们因共同的愿望而团结在一起，希望拥有某种类型的计算机供自己使用，并因十年来作为 ARPA 研究工作的一部分而共同经历，以构建他们当时使用的那种计算机。许多分时老手最初是<a href="#OEBPS/Text/8.html">MAC 项目的</a>本科黑客，或者在伯克利和圣莫尼卡担任 ARPA 资助的工程师，后来在贝尔、SRI、兰德和（主要是）PARC 的研究圣殿中相遇。</p><p>It is Taylor's belief that the idea of personal computing was a direct outgrowth of what Licklider started in the early 1960s with time-sharing research. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Time-sharing, like the first high-level languages, was a watershed for computer science and for the augmentation approach. It also created a new subcommunity within the computation world, a community of interests that cut across the boundaries of military, scientific, academic, and business computing.</font> It was a relatively small subculture within the larger community of computer scientists and computer systems builders. They were bonded by a common desire for a certain kind of computer they wanted for their own use, and by a decade of common experiences as a part of the ARPA research effort to build the kind of computers they were then using. Many of the time-sharing veterans who started out as undergraduate hackers at <a href="#OEBPS/Text/8.html">project MAC</a> or as ARPA-funded engineers in Berkeley and Santa Monica were to meet later, in the research sanctums of Bell, SRI, Rand, and (mostly) at PARC.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">分时技术是这一理念的早期有效应用，即现有的计算机使用方式应根据人们的工作方式量身定制，而不是强迫想要使用计算机的人遵守机械约束。如果没有 20 世纪 60 年代早期多路访问计算的发展，个人计算的概念就永远只是一个梦想。</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Time sharing was an early and effective application of the philosophy that the existing means of using computers should be tailored to the way people function, rather than forcing people who want to use them to conform to mechanical constraints. Without the development of multiaccess computing in the early sixties, the idea of personal computing would never have been more than a dream.</font></p>

      <p>在 20 世纪 60 年代初期，人们通常用计算机处理数据，但很少直接处理。首先，程序及其原始数据必须转换成装满打孔卡的鞋盒。这些卡被送到数据处理中心，系统管理员决定如何以及何时将它们输入主计算机。（这些人过去是、现在仍然是支持“编程祭司”神话的丰富轶事来源。）一个小时、一天或一周后，你回来时会收到一份厚厚的打印件和一张巨额账单。打孔-提交-等待-检索的仪式被称为“批处理”。</p><p>In the early 1960s, data processing was what one was expected to do with a computer, and one hardly ever did it directly. First, a program and its raw data had to be converted to a shoebox full of punched cards. The cards were delivered to a data processing center, where a system administrator decided how and when they were to be fed into the main computer. (These fellows were, and still are, a rich source of anecdotes in support of the "programming priesthood" mythology.) You came back an hour or a day or a week later and retrieved a thick printout and a hefty bill. The keypunch-submit-wait-retrieve ritual was called "batch processing."</p>

      <p>到 1966 年，加利福尼亚州和马萨诸塞州的团队已经将计算机编程技术提升到足够高的水平，可以用计算机做一些真正有趣的事情。<a href="#OEBPS/Text/7.html">利克莱德</a>和其他一些人认为，如果他们能让编写和运行程序的人更直接地利用计算机的功能，程序员可能能够以比以往更快的速度构建新的、更好的软件。</p><p>By 1966, groups in California and Massachusetts were well on the way toward raising the art of computer programming to a high enough level to do some truly interesting things with computers. <a href="#OEBPS/Text/7.html">Licklider</a> and a few others suspected that if they could make the power of computers more directly accessible to people writing and running programs, programmers might be able to construct new and better kinds of software at far greater speed than heretofore possible.</p>

      <p>电子硬件和软件日益复杂，随之而来的功能包括建模、表示和搜索大量信息的能力。有了足够的速度和内存容量，计算机就有能力协助通信的创造性方面。但要将这种能力发挥到人们可以使用的程度，必须克服严重的障碍。</p><p>Among the capabilities that came with the increasingly sophisticated electronic hardware and software were powers to model, represent, and search through large collections of information. With sufficient speed and memory capacity, computers were gaining the power to assist the creative aspects of communication. But serious obstacles had to be overcome to bring that power out where people could use it.</p>

      <p>当你必须将一盒盒穿孔卡放入阅读器，然后解读一盒盒打印输出时，几乎不可能与你的程序进行动态交互。由于构建程序的大部分过程是追踪复杂指令列表中的细微错误，批处理程序实际上限制了程序员可以做多少事情、他们能做多快以及他们能编写的程序的质量。</p><p>It is hardly possible to interact dynamically with your program when you have to dump boxes of punchcards into readers, then decipher boxes of printout. Since a large part of the process of building a program is a matter of tracking down subtle errors in complex lists of instructions, the batch processing ritual put an effective limit on how much programmers could do, how fast they could do it, and the quality of the programs they could produce.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">批处理产生了两个问题：</font>计算机一次只能处理一个程序（和一个程序员），而程序员在程序运行时无法直接与计算机交互。由于计算机操作速度与与人交流所需的信息传输速率之间存在巨大差距，因此分时技术成为可能。例如，即使是打字速度最快的人，在计算机执行数百万次操作所需的时间内也只能输入一次按键。分时技术让使用计算机的 20、50 或 100 人或更多人产生一种错觉，以为自己始终拥有计算机的独家“注意力”，而实际上，计算机每隔几百万分之一秒就会从一个用户的任务切换到另一个用户的任务。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Batch processing created two problems:</font> The computers could handle only one program (and one programmer) at a time, and programmers weren't able to interact directly with the computer while their programs were running. Time-sharing was made possible because of the enormous gap between the speed of computer operations and the rate of information transfer needed to communicate with a human. Even the fastest typist, for example, can enter only a single keystroke in the length of time it would take the computer to perform millions of operations. Time-sharing gives each of the 20, 50, or 100 or more people who are using the computer the illusion that he or she has the computer's exclusive "attention" at all times, when in reality the computer is switching from one user's task to another's every few millionths of a second.</p>

      <p>当第一批程序员能够交互式地访问计算机时，他们也获得了新的自由，可以编写功能更强大的程序，并比以前更快地看到结果。20 世纪 60 年代第一批多路访问计算机的程序员能够一次提交一个程序，一次接收一个响应，而不是试图让整个编程工作（无论好坏）在一个批处理中完成。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">通过消除批处理的“等待”方面，分时技术使程序员能够将他们的手艺视为一门表演艺术。</font></p><p>When the first programmers gained interactive access to the computer, they also gained a new freedom to create ever more powerful programs and see the results more quickly than ever before. Programmers of the first multiaccess computers of the sixties were able to submit programs a piece at a time and receive responses a piece at a time, instead of trying to make the whole programming job work, for better or worse, in a single batch. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">By eliminating the "wait and see" aspect of batch-processing, time-sharing made it possible for programmers to treat their craft as a performing art.</font></p>

      <p>“当我成为 ARPA 信息处理技术办公室主任时，分时程序已在运行，”泰勒回忆道，“但尚未完成，因此在我担任主任期间，这项工作仍在继续。但很明显，这是信息处理技术的一个重要突破，因此我参与了不同实验系统之间的技术转移，并最终将其转移到军用和民用计算机应用。</p><p>"When I became director of the ARPA Information Processing Techniques Office, the time-sharing programs were already running," Taylor recalls, "but they weren't complete, so the work continued while I was director. It was clear, though, that this was an important breakthrough in information processing technology, so I became involved in the technology transfer between the different experimental systems, and eventually to military and civilian computer applications.</p>

      <p>“当我们与业内许多人交谈时，我们遇到了一些僵化的态度。IBM 起初对 ARPA 的事情不以为然。他们根本没有认真对待这件事。后来，通用电气同意与麻省理工学院和贝尔实验室合作开发和销售大型分时系统。IBM 说，‘哎呀，这里出事了’，于是他们开始着手一个紧急项目，将他们的一个 360 系统改造成分时系统。他们接了一些订单，但系统失败了。他们无法让软件正常运行，因为他们没有走过 ARPA 资助的团体几年前走过的路。”</p><p>"We came up against some rigid attitudes when we talked to many people in the industry. IBM ignored the ARPA stuff at first. They simply didn't take it seriously. Then GE agreed to cooperate with MIT and Bell Laboratories to develop and market a large time-sharing system. IBM said, 'Whoops, something's happening here,' and they went off with a crash project to retrofit one of their 360 systems to time-sharing. They took orders for a few and the system bombed. They couldn't make the software work because hadn't been down the same roads that the ARPA funded groups had been down years before."</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">分时研究在企业研究领域引起了某种分裂。</font>第一代神职人员似乎错过了内部行动的机会，这改变了一切。那些关注分时体验的公司从长远来看获得了好处。它使数字设备公司成为该行业的“第二名”。DEC 关注 ARPA 资助的工作，并在人们毕业时雇用他们，并从分时中获利。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Time-sharing research caused a kind of schism in the corporate research field.</font> The first-generation priesthood seemed to be missing out on the inside action, for a change. Companies that paid attention to the time-sharing experience gained in the long run. It made Digital Equipment the "second name" in the industry. DEC paid attention to the ARPA-funded work and hired people when they got out of school, and profited from time-sharing.</p>

      <p>分时项目即将完成时，泰勒首先要做的就是找到一种将分时社区连接起来的方法。他对当时四分五裂的计算机研究世界有着独特的了解，因为他的大部分时间都花在了前往大学和智库、寻找和资助研究人员上。20 世纪 60 年代初，计算机研究各个子领域的进展正在加速。到 1966 年，拼图碎片即将组装完毕，各个团队必须保持密切沟通。</p><p>The first thing Taylor went after, once the time-sharing project was on its way to completion, was a way of interconnecting the time-sharing communities. He had a privileged overview of the then-fragmented computer research world, since a good deal of his time was spent traveling to universities and think tanks, finding and funding researchers. Progress in the separate subfields of computer research was accelerating through the early 1960s. By 1966, the time was approaching when the pieces of the puzzle would be ready for assembly, and the separated teams would have to be in close communication.</p>

      <p>“在每个分时社区中，人们都在进行各种不同类型的计算机研究，”泰勒说，“因此，使分时系统本身发挥作用的总体项目比分时社区不同成员正在探索的任何单个研究领域都更具全球化色彩——人工智能研究、计算机硬件架构、编程语言、图形等等。</p><p>"Within each one of the time-sharing communities people were doing a variety of different kinds of computer research," says Taylor, "so the overall project of making the time-sharing system itself work was much more global than any one of the individual research fields that were being explored by different members of the time-sharing community -- AI research, computer hardware architecture, programming languages, graphics, and so forth.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">“我们一次又一次地被分时系统的应用所震惊，虽然没有人计划过，但有人发明了。</font>在分时系统中拥有文件和资源的能力是一个需要解决的难题。在解决这个问题的过程中，人们发现了一种新的相互交流方式——这是意料之外的事情，并成为研究界一种独特的媒介。”自从电脑骑手开始享受这种乐趣以来，十五年过去了，这种媒介已经成为商业版本，被称为“电子邮件”。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"We were surprised time and time again by applications of the time-sharing system that nobody planned but somebody invented anyway.</font> The ability to have files and resources within a time-sharing system was one difficult problem to be solved. On the way to solving it, people discovered a new way of communicating with each other -- something that was unexpected and became a unique medium in the research community." Fifteen years since computer jockeys started having fun with it, that medium has become the commercial version known as "electronic mail."</p>

      <p>泰勒认为有必要将利克莱德所创立和萨瑟兰所培育的那些孤立的研究团体联系起来。许多从事相关领域但来自不同机构的人彼此认识，但更多的人却不认识。到 1956-1966 年，ARPA 支持了该国大部分非工业系统研究，因此鲍勃·泰勒和他的同事比任何单个研究人员都更了解计算机研究的最新情况和更全面的情况。</p><p>Taylor saw the necessity of connecting to one another those isolated research communities that Licklider had seeded and Sutherland had nurtured. Many of the people in related fields but different institutions knew of each other, and many more did not. By 1956-1966, ARPA was supporting most of the nonindustrial systems research in the country, and thus Bob Taylor and his colleagues had a more up-to-date and comprehensive picture of the state of computer research than any individual researchers.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">泰勒资助的人员随后开始规划和创建一个计算机<i>网络</i>，这些计算机位于全国各地，通过公共运营商通信线路连接，能够共享资源并与日益壮大的计算机研究人员社区进行远程互动。那些</font>将要建立并最终使用该系统的人开始亲自聚在一起，讨论以他们设想的方式链接资源所需的技术。一小群来自分时研究工作的领导者不再各自为政，而是开始齐心协力设计第一个在线互动社区。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The people Taylor funded then undertook the planning and creation of a <i>network</i> of computers, located in different parts of the country, linked by common-carrier communication lines, capable of sharing resources and interacting remotely with the growing community of computer researchers.</font> The people who were to build and ultimately make use of the system began to get together in person to talk about the technology needed to link resources in the manner they envisioned. Instead of working in isolation, a small group of leaders from the time-sharing research effort began to work in concert to design the first on-line, interactive communities.</p>

      <p>一个真正能够跨越个人机器或地理位置界限自由共享资源的互操作社区，其实现难度远大于通过电话线将计算机连接在一起这一简单概念。必须解决非常严重的硬件和软件问题，人机交互的“用户界面”必须更加人性化。</p><p>A truly interoperating community capable of freely sharing resources across the boundaries of individual machines or geographical locations was more difficult to bring into existence than is suggested by the simplified general idea of plugging computers together via telephone lines. Very serious hardware and software problems had to be solved, and the "user interface" where the person meets the machine had to be further humanized.</p>

      <p>从 1966 年开始，泰勒每年都会按照利克莱德和萨瑟兰建立的传统，召集所有项目的主要研究人员开会。会议地点远离剑桥、伯克利或帕洛阿尔托等常见地点，是一个引人注目的地方。在所有这些会议上，既不<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">是工程师也不是程序员的泰勒（事实上，他是哲学专业的学生，​​受过实验心理学家的训练），</font>开始进行至关重要的思想融合和筛选，他知道，这些思想对于如此庞大、分散且雄心勃勃的项目的凝聚力是必不可少的。</p><p>Every year, starting in 1966, following a tradition established by Licklider and Sutherland, Taylor called a meeting of all the principal investigators of all his projects. It would be held in a dramatic place far removed from the usual locales of Cambridge, Berkeley, or Palo Alto. With all these meetings, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Taylor, who was neither an engineer nor a programmer (he was, in fact, a philosophy major and an experimental psychologist by training),</font> began the all-important mixing and sifting of ideas he knew would be necessary to the cohesion of such a large, dispersed, and ambitious project.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">“我安排会议时，他们必须相互了解，并在我面前进行技术辩论，”泰勒回忆道。“我会问一些问题，迫使大家在技术问题上站队。持久的友谊就是在这种互利互惠中建立起来的。我问他们一些难题。然后，当他们回到实验室和校园后，他们的交流在质量和数量上都有所提高，因为他们彼此了解。”</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"I constructed the meetings so they all had to get to know one another and argue with one another technically in my presence," Taylor recalls. "I would ask questions that would force people to take sides on technical issues. Lasting friendships were built from the give and take. I asked them difficult questions. Then, after they went back to their laboratories and campuses, their communications increased in both quality and quantity, because they knew each other."</font></p>

      <p>泰勒还发起了研究生年度会议。ARPA 前研究人员的优秀研究生会举行自己的会议，远离像泰勒这样的“老”人，毕竟他已经三十几岁了。就像规划欧洲哥特式大教堂的流动建筑工人队伍一样，参加 ARPA 研究生会议的许多计算机系统建造者后来在 SAIL（斯坦福人工智能实验室）和 PARC 再次会面，后来又在苹果和微软会面。</p><p>Taylor also initiated annual conferences of graduate students. The best graduate students of the old ARPA researchers had meetings of their own, away from the "older" folks like Taylor, who was, after all, in his midthirties. Like the bands of roving builders who planned the Gothic cathedrals of Europe, many of the computer-system builders who participated in the ARPA grad students' meetings were to meet again later at SAIL (Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory) and PARC, and later still at Apple and Microsoft.</p>

      <p>泰勒通过连接计算机来连接研究人员的想法，是受到他在利克莱德 1966 年的一篇论文中读到的一句话的启发，在这篇论文中，他提出了一个非常大规模的分时系统的想法，他称之为“星际网络”。泰勒更进一步说：如果你可以建立一个通信网络，为什么不能建立一个计算机网络呢？</p><p>Taylor's idea of connecting the researchers by connecting their computers was inspired by a phrase he read in one of Licklider's 1966 papers, in which he proposed the idea of a very large-scale time-sharing system that he called "an intergalactic network." Taylor took it a step farther: If you could build a communication network, why not a computer network?</p>

      <p>泰勒没有在终端和分时系统之间建立大量长距离通信线路，而是看到了为不同的分时系统创建长距离通信技术的潜在更大好处。泰勒向 ARPA 推销了他的想法，然后聘请了一位名叫拉里·罗伯茨的年轻林肯实验室研究员担任项目经理。会议和单独的研究项目持续了三年，直到 1969 年第一批数据通过 ARPAnet 发送。此时，泰勒对越南战争的反对情绪日益高涨，他相当确定他发起的项目即将完成，因此他离开了 ARPA。</p><p>Instead of building larger numbers of longer-range communication lines between terminals and their time-sharing systems, Taylor saw potentially greater benefits in creating technology for different time-sharing systems to communicate with each other over long distances. Taylor sold ARPA on he idea, then hired a young Lincoln Lab researcher named Larry Roberts as project manager. The meetings and separate research projects continued for three years, before the first bits were sent over the ARPAnet in 1969. By this time, Taylor's opposition to the Vietnam war was growing, and he was reasonably certain that the project he had initiated was nearing completion, so he left ARPA.</p>

      <p>当数字计算器、批处理器和电子簿记员继续统治着计算机行业时，交互式计算社区的核心成员开始通过这个独特的新型互联计算机社区原型，对他们的计算机和他们自己进行实验。结果<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">很快证明，实验网络正在演变成一个令人兴奋的环境，用于交流和共享研究信息，甚至用于传输和借用计算机程序，这让所有参与者感到高兴，也并不令人意外。</font></p><p>While the number crunchers, batch processors, and electronic bookkeepers continued to hold sway over the computer industry, the core members of the interactive computing community were beginning to experiment with their computers-and with themselves -- through this unique new prototype of an interconnected computer community. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">It quickly turned out, to the delight of all participants and to nobody's surprise, that the experimental network was evolving into a stimulating environment for communicating and sharing research information and even for transporting and borrowing computer programs.</font></p>

      <p>1968 年 4 月发表的一篇题​​为《计算机作为通信设备》的文章讨论了计算机连接研究社区的经验对人类通信的影响。主要作者正是 JCR Licklider 和 R. Taylor。</p><p>The implications for human communication that were beginning to emerge from the experience of this computer-connected research community were discussed in an article published in April, 1968, titled "The Computer as a Communication device." The principal authors were none other than J.C.R. Licklider and R. Taylor.</p>

      <p>尽管国防部显然有兴趣促进他们最初创造的技术的发展，而且计算机互联互通无疑已成为开展先进武器研究的必要条件，但<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">利克莱德和泰勒并没有将网络理念应用于战略空军司令部或核武器研究，而是应用于平民的日常通信。</font></p><p>Although the Department of Defense had an obvious interest in fostering the development of the technology they created in the first place, and the interconnection of computers had certainly become a necessity in conducting advanced weapons research, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Licklider and Taylor were not applying the network idea to the Strategic Air Command or nuclear weapons research, but to the everyday communications of civilians.</font></p>

      <p>作者强调，通信和计算技术的融合可以将人类通信的性质提升到一个新的水平。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他们提出，社区成员之间共享信息的能力和个人手中拥有强大的计算能力是他们为中期未来设想的新通信和思维环境的同等组成部分。</font>他们认为，其影响是深远的，而且并非完全可以预见：<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">“当思想互动时，新的想法就会出现，”他们写道。</font></p><p>The authors emphasized that the melding of communication and computation technologies could raise the nature of human communication to a new level. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">They proposed that the ability to share information among the members of a community and the presence of significant computational power in the hands of individuals were equal components of a new communicating and thinking environment they envisioned for the intermediate future.</font> The implications were profound, they felt, and not entirely foreseeable: <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"when minds interact, new ideas emerge," they wrote.</font></p>

      <p>作者并没有在文章的开头谈论计算机的功能；相反，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他们研究了他们希望增强的人类功能，特别是群体决策和解决问题的功能。</font>他们敦促根据人类功能的特殊要求来构建实现这种增强的工具。为了将计算机用作人群的通信放大器，需要一种新的通信媒介：“创造性的交互式通信需要一种可建模的可塑性或可塑性媒介，一种前提将流入后果的动态媒介，最重要的是，一种所有人都可以贡献和试验的通用媒介。”</p><p>The authors did not begin the article by talking about the capabilities of computers; instead, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">they examined the human function they wished to amplify, specifically the function of group decision-making and problem-solving.</font> They urged that the tool to accomplish such amplification should be built according to the special requirements of that human function. In order to use computers as communication amplifiers for groups of people, a new communication medium was needed: "Creative, interactive communication requires a plastic or moldable medium that can be modeled, a dynamic medium in which premises will flow into consequences, and above all a common medium that can be contributed to and experimented with by all."</p>

      <p>对可塑性、动态媒介的需求以及对所有人都可用的要求源于作者的信念，即信息<i>模型</i>的构建和比较是人类交流的核心。“迄今为止，数量最多、最复杂、最重要的模型，”在利克莱德和泰勒看来，“是那些存在于人类头脑中的模型。”</p><p>The need for a plastic, dynamic medium, and the requirement that it be accessible to all, grew out of the authors' belief that the construction and comparison of informational <i>models</i> are central to human communication. "By far the most numerous, most sophisticated, and most important models," in Licklider's and Taylor's opinion, "are those that reside in men's minds."</p>

      <p>事实、记忆、感知、图像、联想、预测和偏见的集合是我们心智模型的组成部分，从这个意义上说，心智模型与制定它们的人一样具有个体性。我们在头脑中构建的模型本质上具有隐私性和可变性，因此需要制作可以被他人感知和认可的外部版本。由于社会作为一个集体实体不信任仅由一个人完成的建模，因此它坚持要求人们在模型被接受为事实之前就模型达成一致。</p><p>Collections of facts, memories, perceptions, images, associations, predictions, and prejudices are the ingredients in our mental models, and in that sense, mental models are as individual as the people who formulate them. The essential privacy and variability of the models we construct in our heads create the need to make external versions that can be perceived and agreed upon by others. Because society, a collective entity, distrusts the modeling done by only one mind, it insists that people agree about models before the models can be accepted as fact.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">因此，沟通的过程就是外化心理模型的过程。</font>口语、书面文字、数字和印刷媒介都是人类外化和达成一致模型能力的重大进步。这些发展中的每一个反过来又改变了人类文化，增强了我们对环境的集体控制。在本世纪，电话系统为人类沟通工具包增加了一种强大的新建模媒介。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">利克莱德和泰勒宣称，如果计算机和通信技术的结合能够让个人使用，那么它有可能成为有史以来最强大的建模工具。</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The process of communication, therefore, is a process of externalizing mental models.</font> Spoken language, the written word, numbers, and the medium of printing were all significant advances in the human ability to externalize and agree upon models. Each of those developments, in their turn, transformed human culture and increased collective control over our environment. In this century, the telephone system added a potent new modeling medium to the human communication toolkit. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Licklider and Taylor declared that the combination of computer and communication technologies, if it could be made accessible to individuals, had the potential to become the most powerful modeling tool ever invented.</font></p>

      <p>作为原型计算机通信系统如何用于促进决策过程的一个例子，利克莱德和泰勒描述了一次在该系统上召开的实际会议。这是一次计算机科学研究团队成员参与的项目会议。尽管所有与会者都在同一个房间里，但他们在交谈时都会盯着显示屏。各种图表、文本块、数字和图形通过这些屏幕在他们眼前闪过。</p><p>As an example of how a prototype computer communication system could be used to boost the process of decision-making, Licklider and Taylor described an actual meeting that had taken place on just such a system. It was a project meeting involving the members of a computer-science research team. Although all the participants in the meeting were in the same room, they spent their time looking at their display screens while they talked. A variety of diagrams, blocks of text, numbers, and graphs passed before their eyes via those screens.</p>

      <p>这个设施其实是<a href="#OEBPS/Text/9.html">道格·恩格尔巴特的增强研究中心</a>，另一个房间里的机器是过去几年分时研究开发的最新型多路访问计算机，它让这次会面成为可能。</p><p>The facility was, in fact, <a href="#OEBPS/Text/9.html">Doug Engelbart's Augmentation Research Center</a>. The machine in another room that made the meeting possible was the latest kind of multiaccess computer that the time-sharing research of the last few years had produced.</p>

      <p>利克莱德和泰勒以项目会议为模型，展示了计算机如何处理与小组过程相关的信息管理活动。更重要的是，他们展示了这种微妙的通信增强如何增强发生的创造性信息活动。从微观细节切换到天文视角、组装和重新组装模型、查找和替换文件、剪切、粘贴和随机播放、公开查看某些信息并同时做私人笔记、在演讲者讲话时翻阅他的文件或检查他的参考资料，这些能力使得人们能够通过计算机系统相互交流，而这在非增强会议中是不可能实现的。</p><p>Using the project meeting as a model, Licklider and Taylor showed how computers could handle the informational housekeeping activities involved with a group process. More importantly, they demonstrated how this subtle kind of communication augmentation could enhance the creative informational activity that took place. The ability to switch from microscopic details to astronomical perspectives, to assemble and reassemble models, to find and replace files, to cut and paste and shuffle, to view some information publicly and make private notes at the same time, to thumb through the speaker's files or check his references while he is talking, made it possible for people to communicate with each other through the computer system in a way not possible in a nonaugmented meeting.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">“几年后，”作者在文章的开篇就预测道，“人类将能够通过机器比面对面更有效地进行交流。”</font>利克莱德和泰勒在谈到他们在 SRI 的模拟技术会议时估计，“在两天内，该小组借助计算机完成了通常需要一周才能完成的工作。”</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"In a few years," the authors predicted, in the very first words of their article, "men will be able to communicate more effectively through a machine than face to face."</font> Referring to their model technical meeting at SRI, Licklider and Taylor estimated that "In two days, the group accomplished with the aid of a computer what normally might have taken a week."</p>

      <p>这一小组——人员以及多路访问计算机的硬件和软件——构成了利克莱德和泰勒所称的大型地理分布计算机网络的一个节点。泰勒和利克莱德现在回忆说，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">关键想法</font><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">是由韦斯利·克拉克在</font>1966 年乘坐出租车前往杜勒斯机场时提出的，当时他们参加了一场关于泰勒试图组建的网络的会议。问题在于决定现有计算机和通信系统的哪些级别必须进行更改，以将不兼容的机器和软件结合起来。</p><p>This small group -- the people together with the hardware and software of a multiaccess computer -- constituted what Licklider and Taylor identified as one node of a larger, geographically distributed computer network. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The key idea,</font> Taylor and Licklider now recall, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">had been proposed by Wesley Clark in a cab ride to Dulles Airport,</font> after a 1966 meeting about the network Taylor was trying to put together. The problem lay in deciding which levels of the existing computer and communication systems had to be changed to couple incompatible machines and software.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">许多规划者认为，位于国家中心的一台巨大的“主机”计算机必须经过专门设计和编程，才能充当翻译器。克拉克建议，每个节点上的一台小型通用计算机可以变成“信息处理器”。</font>通过长距离公共运营商通信，这些“接口信息处理器”（最终称为“imps”）及其本地多路访问计算机社区可以整合成一种超级社区。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Many of the planners believed that a huge "host" computer in the center of the country would have to be specially designed and programmed to act as a translator. Clark suggested that a small, general-purpose computer at each node could be turned into a "message processor."</font> Through long distance common-carrier communications, these "interface message processors" (known eventually as "imps") and their local multiaccess computer communities could be integrated into a kind of supercommunity.</p>

      <p>小鬼会负责所有幕后的流量控制和错误检查功能，以确保数据的准确传输——这本身就是一项重要任务——因此个人用户不必担心他们想要读取的文件或需要使用的程序是否在千里之外或在走廊尽头。</p><p>The imps would take care of all the behind-the-scenes traffic controlling and error-checking functions needed to ensure accurate transmission of data -- a significant task in itself -- so the individual users wouldn't have to worry about whether the files they want to read or the programs they need to use are a thousand miles away or down the hall.</p>

      <p>由此产生的通信系统成为一种新型计算系统的一部分，这种系统并不局限于任何一台计算机。ARPA 资助的科学家团队发现，他们可以调用位于加利福尼亚州伯克利的计算机中的程序，将存储在洛杉矶的数据输入该程序，然后在马萨诸塞州剑桥显示结果。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">网络突然变得比单个计算机更重要，因为计算机成为了地理上分散的超级计算机中的“节点”。</font></p><p>The resulting communication system became part of a new kind of computing system that was not confined to any single computer. Teams of ARPA-supported scientists found that they could invoke the use of a program residing in a computer located in Berkeley, California, feed the program with data stored in Los Angeles, then display the result in Cambridge, Massachusetts. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The network was suddenly more important than the individual computers, as the computers became "nodes" in a geographically distributed supercomputer.</font></p>

      <p>人们开始可以设想一个不受任何一处集中控制的计算机网络，其中所需的流量控制、数据通信和幕后数字运算都由软件而非硬件完成。不再有一台巨大的主机位于网络的中心，接收来自一台计算机的信息流，将其转换为另一台计算机可以解码的形式，并将转换后的信息转发给接收计算机，而是每个节点上的小型“小精灵”会接受并传递已由连接到源计算机的小精灵转换为通用格式的信息包。</p><p>It began to be possible to think of a computer network that was not centrally controlled from any one place, in which the traffic control and data communication and behind-the-scenes number crunching required were invested in the software instead of the hardware. Instead of a huge host computer in the center of it all that received a stream of information from one computer, translated the stream into a form that could be decoded by another computer, and relayed the translated information to the receiving computer, the smaller imps at each node would accept and pass along information packets that had been translated into a common format by the imp connected to the originating computer.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">像 ARPAnet 这样的“分组交换”网络中的控制代理</font>并不连接到某个中央计算机，甚至也不连接到在计算机之间进行中介的“消息处理器”，而是连接到<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">信息包，也就是消息本身。</font>就像信件上的地址一样，信息打包传输的代码将信息从源头传送到目的地以及在不同类型的计算机和计算机语言之间进行翻译所需的所有信息放入每个数据包中。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The controlling agent in a "packet switched" network like the ARPAnet was</font> not connected to a central computer somewhere, nor even the "message processors" that mediated between the computers, but <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">the packets of information, the messages themselves.</font> Like the addresses on letters, the code by which information was packaged for transmission put into each packet all the information necessary for getting the message from origin to destination, and for translating between different kinds of computers and computer languages.</p>

      <p>随着网络技术的快速发展，计算机终端的数量也随之激增，人们接受的计算机使用方式也开始发生变化。到 1968 年，1960 年的穿孔卡和打印件已被更具交互性的计算机通信方式所取代：键盘和电传打印机，以及在某些特殊领域，图形显示屏正成为程序员的标准输入和输出设备。</p><p>While the networking technology was evolving rapidly the number of computer terminals proliferated and the accepted way of using computers was beginning to change. By 1968, the punchcards and printouts of 1960 were being replaced by ever-more interactive means of communicating with the computer: a keyboard and teletype printer and, in some exotic quarters, a graphic display screen were becoming standard input and output devices for programmers.</p>

      <p>对于习惯于提交打孔卡并从行式打印机上接收机器代码打印输出的老派人来说，能够在键盘上输入命令并在自己的打印机上看到计算机的即时响应简直就是奇迹。通过分时技术的快速普及，许多人能够使用个人终端直接与大型计算机交互。对于那些知道将<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他们的分时社区连接成超级社区的计划的人来说，</font> 1968 年是一个激动人心且快速变化的时期，而这个领域当时几乎还不为外界所知。</p><p>To old-liners who were used to submitting punched cards and receiving machine code printouts on huge fanfolds from line printers, the ability to type a command on a keyboard and see the computer's immediate response on their own printer was nothing short of miraculous. Through the rapidly spreading use of time-sharing, many people were able to use individual terminals to directly interact with large computers. To these who knew about the <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">plans to connect their time-sharing communities into a supercommunity,</font> 1968 was a time of exciting and rapid change in a field that was still virtually unknown to the outside world.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">通过构建一种新型计算机系统来创建<i>社区</i>的想法</font>可能是 1968 年论文中最激进的提议。ARPAnet直到 1969 年才上线，但那时分时小组已经构建了足够多的上层结构，新网络的轮廓已经为人所知和可见。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The idea of a <i>community</i> that could be brought into existence by the construction of a new kind of computer system was perhaps the most radical proposal in the 1968 paper.</font> The ARPAnet was not on-line until 1969, but at that point the time-sharing groups had constructed enough of the superstructure for the outlines of the new network to be known and visible.</p>

      <p>泰勒和利克莱德更关心的是这个先进通信和思维放大试验台的进一步发展，而不是致力于将该网络用作进行武器研究的运营实体。利克莱德和泰勒在撰写本文时指出，ARPAnet 将在一年内开始运营，国防或计算机科学界以外的人可能并不了解它：</p><p>Taylor and Licklider were more concerned about the further development of this test-bed for advanced communications and thought amplification than they were dedicated to the use of the network as an operational entity for conducting weapons research. Writing with the knowledge that ARPAnet was to begin operation within a year, and would probably be unknown outside defense or computer science circles, Licklider and Taylor pointed out:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">...虽然目前正在提供更多的交互式多路访问计算机系统，并且虽然更多的团体计划在明年使用这些系统，但目前可能只有大约六个交互式多路访问计算机<i>社区</i>。</font>

        <p><font size="-1">这些社区是社会技术的先驱，在多个方面领先于计算机世界的其他领域：是什么让他们如此呢？首先，他们的一些成员是计算机科学家和工程师，他们了解人机交互的概念和交互式多路访问系统技术。其次，他们的其他成员是其他领域和学科的富有创造力的人，他们认识到交互式多路访问计算的实用性，并感受到了它对他们工作的影响。第三，这些社区拥有大型多路访问计算机，并学会了使用它们。第四，他们的努力具有再生性。</font></p><p><font size="-1">These communities are socio-techno pioneers, in several ways out ahead of the rest of the computer world: What makes them so? First, some of their members are computer scientists and engineers who understand the concept of man-computer interaction and the technology of interactive multiaccess systems.

Third, the communities have large multiaccess computers and have learned to use them. and fourth, their efforts are regenerative.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1"><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">对于社会而言，影响可能是好是坏，主要取决于一个问题：“上网”是一种特权还是权利？如果只有少数受优待的人有机会享受“智力放大”的优势，网络可能会加剧智力机会范围的不连续性。</font></font></p><p><font size="-1"><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">For the society, the impact will be good or bad, depending mainly on one question: Will "to be on-line" be a privilege or a right? If only a favored segment of the population gets a chance to enjoy the advantage of "intelligence amplification," the network may exaggerate the discontinuity in the spectrum of intellectual opportunity.</font></font></p>

        <p><font size="-1"><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">另一方面，如果网络理念能够像少数人所希望的那样（即使没有具体的详细计划）为教育带来好处，并且如果所有人的思想都能够做出反应，那么对人类的益处肯定是无法估量的。</font></font></p><p><font size="-1"><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">On the other hand, if the network idea should prove to do for education what a few have envisioned in hope, if not in concrete detailed plan, and if all minds should prove to be responsive, surely the boon to humankind would be beyond measure.</font></font></p>
      <font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">两位五角大楼计算机研究组织者发表了这样一篇抒情而浪漫的奇文。但到了 1971 年，当泰勒为 PARC 的计算机科学实验室招募了五六十名该领域最优秀的人才时，这些最优秀的交互式计算机设计师已经从分时和 ARPAnet 项目中获得了足够的工程和软件研究经验，使他们相信这种乌托邦式的情景是有可能实现的——尤其是如果一家拥有施乐公司资源的公司愿意冒这个高风险的赌注的话。

      </font></font><p>建造了第一台交互式多路访问计算机、第一台智力增强系统和第一台分组交换计算机网络的人们第一次齐聚一堂，以便尽快将这些梦想变成原型。巴特勒·兰普森、查克·萨克、吉姆·米切尔、埃德·麦克雷特、鲍勃·斯普劳尔、吉姆·莫里斯、查克·格什克、艾伦·凯、鲍勃·梅特卡夫、彼得·多伊奇、比尔·英格利什——对于那些了解深奥的计算机设计世界的人来说，PARC 计算机科学创始人构成了一个前所未有的人才集合。</p><p>The people who built the first interactive, multiaccess computers, the first intellectual augmentation systems, and the first packet-switching computer networks were gathering under the same roof for the first time, in order to turn those dreams into prototypes as soon as possible. Butler Lampson, Chuck Thacker, Jim Mitchell, Ed McCreight, Bob Sproull, Jim Morris, Chuck Geschke, Alan Kay, Bob Metcalfe, Peter Deutsch, Bill English -- to those who knew anything about the esoteric world of computer design, the PARC computer science founders constituted an unprecedented collection of talents.</p>

      <p>在这种公司里，旧式的等级制度和等级制度毫无用处。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">经营这样的公司，更多的是调解</font>——鲍勃·泰勒就是在这种公司里出现的。他们所打造的东西，以及打造它所需要的人才，需要在远见和实用主义之间取得平衡，这种平衡是人为强加的权威无法实现的。</p><p>It wasn't the kind of shop where old-style hierarchies and pecking orders would do any good. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">You don't run an outfit like that as much as you mediate it</font> -- which is where Bob Taylor came in. The kind of thing they were building, and the kind of people it took to build it, required a balance between vision and pragmatism, the kind of balance that couldn't be enforced by artificially imposed authority.</p>

      <p>他们一致同意，他们想要得到一流的研究设施。计算机作为个人使用工具的潜力，以及通过连接计算机而开启的通信可能性，是 PARC 团队的动机。是时候证明使用个人计算机管理个人通信的理论可以在像他们这样的办公室中发挥作用了。如果他们能够证明这种设备可以加快自己的工作速度，那么他们就有望向世界其他国家推销他们在分时时代所持有的愿景。</p><p>What they all agreed upon was what they wanted to get their hands on, in the way of a first-rate research facility. The potential of computers as tools to be used by individuals, and the communications possibilities opened by linking computers, were what motivated the PARC team. It was time to demonstrate that the theories about using personal computers to manage personal communications could work in an office like theirs. If they could demonstrate that such devices could speed their own work, they would be on the way to selling the rest of the world on the vision they held form the time-sharing days.</p>

      <p>为了重新改造信息工作的世界，他们首先需要的是一台专为单人使用而设计的计算机，这远远超出了以前的尝试。因为他们知道视觉是人类能够输入最复杂信息的感觉，所以 PARC 的计算机专家知道他们想要一个复杂的图形屏幕来将计算机的功能带给用户。复杂、动态的视觉模型需要大量的计算机能力，因此<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">强调视觉显示的决定意味着硬件将拥有比计算机世界中任何其他人迄今为止提供给任何个人的更多的内存和速度。</font></p><p>The first thing they needed in order to retool the world of information work was a computer designed for one person to use, something that went far beyond previous attempts. Because they knew that vision was the human sense capable of the most sophisticated informational input, the PARC computerists knew they wanted a sophisticated graphic screen to bring the computer's power to the user. Complex, dynamic, visual models required a large amount of computer power, so <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">the decision to emphasize the visual display meant that the hardware would have a great deal more memory and speed than anyone else in the computer world had heretofore put at any one individual's command.</font></p>

      <p>“我们希望硬件的性能尽可能强大，”泰勒回忆道，“因为我们需要强大的计算工具来设计整个软件架构，而世界上还没有人知道如何制作这种架构。我们想要的是我们自己使用的东西，我们认为其他信息工作者最终也会需要它。我们需要计算能力和研究环境来构建昂贵但非常灵活且可扩展的东西，将来有一天它会便宜得多，但性能更强。当我们计划 Alto 时，我们都明白，我们想要的主内存在 1974 年生产时可能要花费 7000 美元，但十年后会降到 35 美元左右。”</p><p>"We wanted hardware as capable as we could afford to build," Taylor recalls, "because we needed capable computing tools to design an entire software architecture that nobody in the world yet knew how to make. We wanted for our own use what we thought other information workers would eventually want. We needed the computing power and the research environment to build something expensive but very flexible and growable that would someday be much less expensive but even more capable. We all understood when we planned the Alto that the main memory of what we wanted might cost $7000 by the time it was produced, in 1974, but would drop to about $35 ten years later."</p>

      <p>PARC 的硬件车间最初只为 PARC 软件设计师生产小批量产品，但最终为施乐高管和研究人员、SAIL 和 SRI 的同事以及美国参议院、众议院、其他某些政府机构甚至白宫工作人员制造了 1500 台 Altos。这是第一台旨在将强大的计算能力放在个人办公桌上的机器。</p><p>The hardware shop at PARC was only set up to produce small batches for the PARC software designers, but eventually 1500 Altos were built for Xerox executives and researchers, for associates at SAIL and SRI, as well as for the U.S. Senate, House of Representatives, certain other government agencies, and even the White House Staff. It was the first machine designed to put significant computing power on a person's desk.</p>

      <p>与外界多年后才知道的第一批“个人电脑”相比，Alto 设计师所做的工作更加了不起。1975 年的 Altair 是自制电脑的鼻祖，其主内存只有 1/4K（也称为 RAM，这表示计算机用于“工作内存”的存储空间量，因此表示它可以以合理的速度完成多少工作的粗略极限）。1977 年出售的第一批 Apple 型号有 8K。当 IBM 于 1981 年推出其个人电脑时，标准型号有 16K。1974 年的 Alto 最初有 64K，很快升级到 256K。直到 1983 年 Apple 生产 Lisa 时，才在非施乐产品上看到独特的位图屏幕和鼠标指针设备。</p><p>The job the Alto designers did was all the more remarkable when compared with the first "personal computers" the outside world was to learn about years later. The 1975 Altair, the granddaddy of the homebrew computers, had all of 1/4K main memory (also known as RAM, this represents the amount of storage space the computer devotes to "working memory," and thus indicates the rough limit of how much work it can do with reasonable speed). The first Apple models sold, in 1977, had 8K. When IBM introduced its personal computer, in 1981, the standard model had 16K. The Alto, in 1974, started with 64K and was soon upgraded to 256K. The distinctive bit-mapped screen and the mouse pointing device weren't to be seen on a non-Xerox product until 1983, when Apple produced Lisa.</p>

      <p>当然，硬件只是故事的一部分。这些设备是为那些以创造同样出色的软件创新为职业的人制造的。而个人电脑本身还不足以满足那些渴望加入 ARPAnet 那样的社区的人的需求。</p><p>The hardware, of course, was just a part of the story. These devices were built for the people whose job it was to create equally spectacular software innovations. And the personal computers themselves weren't enough for those who longed for the kind of community they had known with the ARPAnet.</p>

      <p>“我们直到谈到我们个人想要用这种系统做什么时才开始讨论硬件和软件，”泰勒回忆道。“我们知道有技术问题需要解决，我们会在适当的时候挑战它们。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">首先，我们必须考虑我们想要增强的人体功能。</font>例如，人们大量使用眼睛来吸收信息，因此我们需要一种特别强大的显示屏。然后，所有分时系统的老手都坚持说他们想要一台在晚上运行速度不会更快的计算机。”</p><p>"We didn't start talking about the hardware and software until we talked about what we wanted to do personally with such a system," Taylor remembers. "We knew there were technical problems to solve, and we would challenge them in due time. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">First we had to consider the human functions we wanted to amplify.</font> For example, people use their eyes a great deal to assimilate information, so we wanted a particularly powerful kind of display screen. Then all the time-sharing veterans insisted they wanted a computer that didn't run faster at night."</p>

      <p>泰勒的意思是，20 世纪 60 年代中期，分时程序员们都习惯于在半夜进行严肃的计算，那时中央计算机上的流量足够小，可以毫不拖延地完成真正庞大的信息处理任务。他们一致同意的第一个激进想法是，每台 Alto 必须拥有与几年前分时系统中的中央计算机一样多的主内存。而且它必须运行速度快。</p><p>What Taylor meant was that the time-sharing programmers had all been accustomed in the mid 1960s to doing their serious computing in the middle of the night, when the amount of traffic on the central computer was light enough to perform truly large information processing tasks without delay. The first radical idea they agreed upon was that each Alto had to have as much main memory as one of the central computers from the time-sharing systems of only a few years back. And it had to be fast.</p>

      <p>“与记忆和打字相比，人们通过观察和指向可以更快速、更轻松地向计算机发出命令，因此我们采用并改进了鼠标，”泰勒补充道。“人们很难学习人工语言，机器学习自然语言就更难了。现有的计算机语言没有给初次使用者和实验程序员同等的能力来与计算机交互，所以我们创造了新类型的语言。”</p><p>"People can give commands to a computer much more rapidly and easily by seeing and pointing than by remembering and typing, so we adopted and then adapted the mouse," added Taylor. "It is hard for people to learn artificial languages and even harder for machines to learn natural languages. The existing computer languages didn't give first-time users and experimental programmers equal power to interact with the computer, so we created new kinds of languages."</p>

      <p><i>“最重要的是，人们经常需要集体</i>做事。有时我们想把 Alto 用作个人工具，有时我们想把它用作交流媒介，有时我们想两者兼而有之。我们将所有计算能力带给个人的目的并不是让他们孤立自己。我们希望同时<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">提供通往新交流空间的门户、在其中飞翔的方式以及社区创造力的媒介。”</font></p><p>"Most importantly, people often need to do things in <i>groups</i>. There are times when we want to use the Alto as a personal tool, and times when we want to use it as a communication medium, and times when we want to do both. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Our purpose in bringing all that computing power to individuals was not to allow them to isolate themselves. We wanted to provide the gateway to a new communication space,</font> and ways to fly around in it, and a medium for community creativity, all at the same time."</p>

      <p>当分时系统刚刚开始流行，黑客们开始在深夜潜伏在大学计算机系的角落里，计算机专家们发现，虽然他们都能同时与中央计算机通信，但他们不一定能相互通信，或共享彼此的程序或文件。这需要一些努力，但分时系统程序员最终解决了这个问题。</p><p>When time-sharing first got going, and hackers began to proliferate late at night in the corners of university computer departments, the subcult of computerists found that while they could all communicate with the central computer at the same time, they couldn't all necessarily communicate with each other, or share each other's programs or files. It took some effort, but the time-sharing systems programmers eventually solved the problem.</p>

      <p>当多路访问计算机的不同用户之间共享资源这一难题必须转化为多台性能相同、地理位置分散且通常不兼容的计算机（如 ARPAnet）之间共享资源的问题时，该难题的解决方案就变得同样困难。精心设计的分时连接无法修补到新系统上。</p><p>The solution to the difficult problem of sharing resources among different users of a multiaccess computer became no less difficult when it had to be translated to the problem of sharing resources between many equally powerful, geographically separated, often incompatible computers (as with ARPAnet). The carefully designed connectivity of time-sharing could not be patched onto the new system.</p>

      <p>PARC 网络必须从头开始构建，同时还要构建个人工作站和用于归档、打印和邮件的共享<i>服务器</i>。服务器概念意味着某些原本普通的 Altos 将被编程来控制这些网络服务，而不是构建单独的设备来执行这些任务。由此产生的以太网的概念源于将网络本身打造成个人用户可控制的工具的决心。</p><p>The PARC network had to be built from the ground up, along with the personal workstations and shared <i>servers</i> for filing, printing, and mail. The server notion meant that certain otherwise stock-model Altos would be programmed for the tasks of controlling these network services, instead of building separate devices to perform these tasks. The concept of the resulting Ethernet, as it was called, stemmed from the determination to make the network itself a tool at the command of the individual user.</p>

      <p>PARC 的人们渴望获得个人计算能力，但他们不想放弃他们刚刚开始在 ARPAnet 上了解的来之不易、不断努力的社区。SRI 校友 Dan Swinehart 在早期加入 PARC，他记得“从 Alto 被提出的那一天起，Butler Lampson 和 Bob Metcalfe 就指出，如果我们要为 PARC 的每个人提供一台独立的计算机，而不是将他们全部连接到一个中央分时系统中，我们就需要一个具有足够通信和资源共享能力的连接网络，以便个人工作站上的人们不会彼此孤立。”</p><p>The PARC folks were hungry for personal computing power, but they didn't want to give up that hard-won and effort-amplifying community they were just beginning to know on the ARPAnet. Dan Swinehart, an SRI alumnus who joined PARC early in the game, remembers that "From the day the Alto was proposed, Butler Lampson and Bob Metcalfe pointed out that if we were going to give everybody at PARC a self-contained computer instead of hooking them all into a central time-sharing system, we'd need a connecting network with enough communicating and resource-sharing capability that the people at the personal work stations wouldn't be isolated from each other."</p>

      <p>因此，与 ALTO 配套的是以太网，即第一个“局域网”。随着网络技术的出现，硬件变得不那么重要，而软件变得更加重要，因为这样的网络由一个相对简单的硬件层（一个小盒子将单个计算机插入网络）和一系列更复杂的软件层（称为<i>协议）</i>组成，这些软件层使不同的设备能够通过通信通道进行互操作。</p><p>Thus, the companion to the ALTO was the Ethernet, the first of the "local area networks." With the advent of network technology, the hardware became less important and the software became more important, because such a network consists of a relatively simple hardware level, where a small box plugs the individual computer into the network, and a series of more sophisticated software levels known as <i>protocols</i> that enable the different devices to interoperate via a communication channel.</p>

      <p>在公共运营商网络中（青少年黑客使用电话访问国防部计算机的网络），这个小盒子被称为调制解调器，其<i>工作</i>原理是将计算机数据位转换为公共电话系统用于传递信息的音调模式。局域网使用另一种小盒子，它将计算机数据转换为电脉冲，通过短电缆在计算机之间传输，而不是通过公共运营商通信线路发送音频音调。</p><p>With common-carrier networks -- the kind where teenage hackers use their telephones to gain access to Defense Department computers -- the small box is known as a <i>modem</i> and works by translating computer bits into a pattern of tones that the public telephone system uses to communicate information. A local area network uses a different kind of small box that converts computer data into electrical impulses that travel from computer to computer via a short cable, rather than the audio tones that are sent over common-carrier communication lines.</p>

      <p>局域网适用于 PARC 之类的环境——任何校园、实验室或办公区，其中许多机器分布在一小片地理区域内。多个本地网络也可以通过“消息处理器”（称为<i>网关</i>）远距离连接到公共运营商连接的互联网。这种方案将本地网络嵌入到更全球化的超级网络中。</p><p>Local area networks are meant for environments like PARC -- any campus or laboratory or group of offices where many machines are distributed over a small geographical area. Several local networks can also be linked over long distances via "message processors" known as <i>gateways</i> to the common-carrier-linked internetwork. This scheme embeds local networks in more global supernetworks.</p>

      <p>当今的网络技术采用最初在 ARPAnet 创建期间开发的<i>分组交换技术，这种技术正是</i><font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><a href="#OEBPS/Text/6.html">香农</a><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">在 1948 年预测的</font></font><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">信息编码类型<a href="#OEBPS/Text/6.html"></a></font>。信息以信息包的形式传输和处理，信息包是编码的开关脉冲串，除了消息的核心数据外，还携带有关如何发送和接收消息的信息。如果您的计算机使用正确的硬件和软件转换器，您的数据将根据数据包中嵌入的控制和路由信息，自行找到通过网络的路径。</p><p>Today's network technologies use the <i>packet-switching</i> techniques originally developed during the creation of the ARPAnet -- <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">exactly the kind of coding of information that <a href="#OEBPS/Text/6.html">Shannon</a> predicted in 1948.</font> Information is transported and processed in packets of information -- bursts of coded on-off pulses -- that carry, in addition to the core data of the message, information on how the message is to be transmitted and received. If your computer uses the right kind of hardware and software translators, your data will find its own way through the network according to the control and routing information embedded in the packets.</p>

      <p>分组交换的技术细节对于未来使用网络系统的绝大多数人来说并不重要，但“分布式计算”的概念标志着计算演进新阶段的重要变化。分布式系统由许多人组成，每个人都拥有功能强大的个人计算机，他们联合起来组成功能更强大的计算社区，这与早期集中控制和高度受限的计算机完全不同。</p><p>The technical details of packet switching won't matter to the vast majority of the people who will end up using network systems in the future, but the notion of "distributed computing" signals an important change to a new phase in the evolution of computation. Distributed systems, in which a number of people, each with their own significantly powerful personal computers, join together into even more powerful computational communities, are altogether different from the centrally controlled and highly restricted computers of the early days.</p>

      <p>一旦我们能够使用这样的系统，我们将选择去哪里，或者被人性或历史环境所迫而去哪里，这是一个悬而未决的问题，一旦我们超越了革命性的但相对简单的办公室工作应用。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">现在，几乎所有的增强先驱都用汽车早期的类比来描述系统的现状。</font>恩格尔巴特和泰勒都认为，数百万爱好者今天使用的个人电脑甚至还没有达到汽车行业通过 T 型车达到的阶段。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">更重要的是，目前还没有一个广泛的传输支持结构来支持个人之间的信息传递。</font></p><p>Where we will all choose to go, or be forced to go by human nature or historical circumstances, once we are given access to such a system, is a wide-open question, once you get beyond the revolutionary but relatively simple applications to office work. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Almost all the augmentation pioneers now use the analogy of the early days of automobiles to describe the present state of the system.</font> Engelbart and Taylor agree that the personal computers millions of enthusiasts are using today are not even at the stage the automobile industry reached with the model T. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">More important, there is not yet a widespread transportation support structure for the messages between individuals.</font></p>

      <p>目前还没有标准方法来制造或驾驶最近才发明的信息汽车。现有的大规模高带宽信息传输高速公路甚至没有覆盖到乡村的一小部分。没有服务站或道路地图。知识时代的轮胎工业和石油工业还不存在。在 PARC 这样的地方可能有扩展思维技术的原型，但目前还没有支持它们在更广泛社会中使用的基础设施。</p><p>There are no standard ways to build or drive the informational vehicles that have been devised only recently. The existing highways for large-scale, high-bandwidth information transportation don't even cover a fraction of the countryside. There are no service stations or road maps. The tire industry and the petroleum industry of the knowledge age don't exist yet. There may be prototypes of mind-extending technologies at places like PARC, but there is not yet an infrastructure to support their use in wider society.</p>

      <p>PARC 的研究人员在开发功能强大的个人电脑方面取得了巨大成功，这比商界和消费者群体愿意接受它们早了很多年，但施乐的营销管理部门未能利用其研发团队取得的先机，迅速将原型转化为产品。施乐未能利用 PARC 的研究成果，部分原因是缺乏汽车类比所描述的那种基础设施。在微电子设备这样一个快速发展的领域，技术转让是一项相当艰难的赌博。当这些设备旨在影响人们的思维方式时，问题就变得更加复杂。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">从头开始建立一个系统并证明其有效，与说服大多数员工改变他们一贯的工作方式还有很长的路要走。</font></p><p>The researchers at PARC were wildly successful in their efforts to build powerful personal computers, years before the business and consumer communities were prepared to accept them, but Xerox marketing management failed to take advantage of the head start achieved by their research and development teams by quickly turning the prototypes into products. The failure of Xerox to exploit the research at PARC was partially a result of the lack of the kind of infrastructure described by the automobile analogy. Technology transfer in such a fast-moving field as microelectronic devices is a tough enough gamble. The problem gets more complicated when those devices are intended to affect the way people think. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Building a system from scratch and showing that it works is still a long way from convincing most of the people in the work force to change the way they've always done things.</font></p>

      <p>到 20 世纪 70 年代中期，美国最聪明的计算机研究人员意识到，PARC 开发的 Alto、以太网和 Smalltalk（一种同样先进的计算机语言）原型已经将交互式计算推向了前所未有的高度，远远超过了 10 年前 ARPA 资助的分时项目所达到的水平，而这些项目曾彻底改变了计算机。到 20 世纪 70 年代末，施乐管理层已准备好考虑将 PARC 的成功转化为产品。</p><p>By the mid 1970s, the nation's smartest computer researchers realized that the Alto, Ethernet, and Smalltalk (an equally advanced computer language) prototypes created at PARC had advanced the state of interactive computing far beyond the level achieved by the ARPA-sponsored time-sharing projects that had revolutionized computers a decade previously. By the late 1970s, Xerox management was ready to think about turning PARC's successes into a product.</p>

      <p>当 PARC 的天才们竞相在数十项信息相关科学和技术的先进研究上取得进展时，Star<i>和</i>以太网<i>已</i>做好了上市准备。Star 的设计远不止是量产版 Alto：主内存为 512K，是增强型 Alto 的两倍，而 Star 的处理器运行速度是 Alto 的三倍。Star 的软件包括一种名为 Mesa 的语言（由 Taylor 的实验室创建），以及一整套用于编辑、归档、计算、计算、创建图形、分发电子邮件的应用程序工具包。</p><p>While the PARC whiz kids raced ahead on advanced research into dozens of information-related sciences and technologies, the <i>Star</i> and the <i>Ethernet</i> were readied for market. Star was designed to be much more than a production-model Alto: The main memory was 512K, twice as much as the enhanced Alto, and the Star's processor was built to run three times as fast as the Alto. The Star's software included a language named Mesa (created in Taylor's lab), along with a whole toolkit of application programs for editing, filing, calculating, computing, creating graphics, distributing electronic mail.</p>

      <p>20 世纪 80 年代初期，计算机行业有句老话：“如果施乐公司在 Star 技术成熟时就将其推向市场，他们就会从 IBM 和苹果手中抢走一个行业。”事实上，1981 年 4 月，Star 8010 信息系统发布时，大部分办公专业人员还未意识到自己是信息工作者。施乐公司营销管理层坚持认为，工作站不仅是为个人提供工具的突破，而且是集成办公系统的一部分，该系统由共享邮件、打印和归档服务的互连组件组成。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">但除了少数特权测试站点之外，没有人知道这意味着什么。</font></p><p>One of the clich�s of the computer industry in the early 1980s was that "if Xerox had marketed the Star when it was technically ready to go, they would have stolen an industry out from under IBM and Apple." As it happened, April, 1981, when the Star 8010 Information System was announced, was still too early for the larger segments of office professionals to realize that they were information workers. Xerox marketing management insisted that the workstation was not only a breakthrough in providing tools for individuals, but a part of an integrated office system of interconnected components that shared mail, printing, and filing services. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">But nobody outside a few privileged test sites knew what that meant.</font></p>

      <p>直到 20 世纪 80 年代初期文字处理软件的出现（就办公室人员而言）取代了大部分打字工作，为公司购买办公设备的人才意识到，计算机和办公室人员一定会很快熟悉起来。对于航空航天公司的第一批知识工作者来说，这些机器与他们以前称为计算机的设备之间存在着巨大的差异，这是显而易见的。</p><p>Until word processing came out of nowhere (as far as the people in offices were concerned) to replace most of the typing pools in the early 1980s, it wasn't clear to the people who bought office equipment for corporations that computers and office workers were bound to get acquainted rapidly. To the first knowledge workers at aerospace firms, it was very clear that there was a major difference between these machines and the devices they had formerly known as computers.</p>

      <p>大脑与机器的交汇点是计算机开发领域长期被忽视的前沿，ARC 和 PARC 的研究人员将这一领域提升到了一个新的高度，他们创造了部分心理学、部分计算机化的<font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>用户界面</i></font><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">工程。<i></i></font>增强先驱们的梦想最终在他们的学生的产品中得以实现，他们迈出了 Star 的第一步，将机器设计成符合潜在用户的思维。Star 设计师重申了复杂的视觉表现与放大思维能力之间的联系：</p><p>The place where the mind meets the machine, the long-neglected frontier of computer development, was advanced to a new high level by those at ARC and PARC who created <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">the partially psychological, partially computational engineering of the <i>user interface</i>.</font> The dreams of the augmentation pioneers were finally materialized in the products of their students, who took the first steps with the Star to engineer the machine to the minds of the potential users. The Star designers reiterated the connection between sophisticated visual representation and the ability to amplify thought:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">在有意识的思考过程中，大脑会利用多个层次的记忆，其中最重要的是“短期记忆”。许多研究分析了短期记忆及其在思考中的作用。得出了两个突出的结论。（1）有意识的思考处理短期记忆中的概念……（2）<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">短期记忆的容量是有限的……当计算机系统中处理的所有内容都是可见的时，显示屏会通过充当一种“视觉缓存”来减轻短期记忆的负担。思考变得更容易、更富有成效。设计良好的计算机系统实际上可以提高您的思考<i>质量</i></font>……</font>

      <font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">十年之后，PARC 不仅实现了其技术目标，而且还取得了更多成就。Mesa 和 Smalltalk 语言都是软件艺术的重大进步。如果一家公司的成功完全取决于大胆而富有想象力的研究，那么施乐公司甚至有能力挑战信息行业的主导力量。但 Peter McCollough 不再是首席执行官，施乐公司的高层管理人员未能理解他们的研究部门给予他们十年的技术领先优势。

      </font></font><p>20 世纪 80 年代初，PARC 的几位重要成员离开了 PARC，加入其他公司或创办自己的公司。在电子和计算机行业的高层，这种职位变动在硅谷并不鲜见；事实上，PARC 多年来一直与同类机构不同，因为它的首席科学家投入的时间异常长。但当施乐未能成为行业领头羊，个人电脑爱好者的热情也发展到这样的地步：一些最初的爱好者开始招募 PARC 科学家，建立自己的个人电脑帝国时，第一批<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">高层 PARC 叛逃者开始用 Star 所体现的用户界面概念向整个行业播下种子。</font></p><p>Some of the most important members of the starting team left PARC in the early 1980s to join other companies or to start their own firms. Such job changes at the higher levels of the electronics and computer industries were far from unknown in Silicon Valley; in fact PARC was distinguished from similar institutions for many years because of the unusual lengths of time put in by its principal scientists. But when Xerox failed to become the first name in the industry, and the hobbyist side of personal computing had grown to the point where some of the original hobbyists were recruiting PARC scientists and building their own personal computer empires, the first <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">high-level PARC defectors began to seed the rest of the industry with the user interface concepts embodied in the Star.</font></p>

      <p>以太网的发明者鲍勃·梅特卡夫 (Bob Metcalfe) 离开公司，创办了 3-Com，一家专门从事局域网技术的公司。<a href="#OEBPS/Text/1.html1">艾伦·凯 (Alan Kay</a> ) 的 Smalltalk 团队为 Star 接口做出了令人瞩目的贡献，他离开公司，成为雅达利 (Atari) 的首席科学家。帮助重新设计 Alto 2 的约翰·埃伦比 (John Ellenby) 成为 Grid 的董事长。1983 年秋天，鲍勃·泰勒 (Bob Taylor) 辞职，此前他领导了他组建的实验室团队十三年。</p><p>Bob Metcalfe, the man responsible for the creation of the Ethernet, left to start 3-Com, a company specializing in local area network technology. <a href="#OEBPS/Text/1.html1">Alan Kay</a>, whose Smalltalk team made impressive contributions to the Star interface, left to become the chief scientist at Atari. John Ellenby, who helped reengineer the Alto 2, became the chairman of Grid. In the fall of 1983, Bob Taylor resigned, after thirteen years leading the laboratory team he had built.</p>

      <p>PARC 的几位校友与那些从自制计算机时代涌现出来的行业新人建立了联系。PARC 的一些前神童正在与下一代神童结盟。当时 30 岁出头的查尔斯·西蒙尼负责为 Alto 开发文字处理软件，他离开 PARC 加入了比尔·盖茨，后者是 27 岁的微软董事长。微软最初是 1975 年 Altair 时代的计算机爱好者的软件供应商，现在是全球第二大微型计算机软件公司。</p><p>Several of the PARC alumni became associated with those industry newcomers who had emerged from the homebrew computer days. Some of the former whiz kids from PARC were making alliances with the next generation of whiz kids. Charles Simonyi, by then in his early thirties, who was in charge of producing the word processing software for the Alto, left PARC to join Bill Gates, the twenty-seven-year-old chairman of Microsoft, a company that started out as a software supplier to the computer hobbyists in the Altair days of 1975, and is now the second-largest microcomputer software company in the world.</p>

      <p>1979 年，时年 30 多岁的苹果公司董事长史蒂夫·乔布斯访问了 PARC。他观看了 Alto 的演示。为乔布斯进行演示的 PARC 团队成员拉里·特斯勒于 1980 年离开 PARC，加入了苹果公司的新秘密项目，乔布斯承诺该项目将重新定义个人电脑的最新技术。1983 年，苹果公司推出了 Lisa — — 这款机器使用鼠标、位图屏幕、窗口和其他基于 Star-Alto-Smalltalk 界面的功能。该系统的价格约为 10,000 美元。这比功能更强大的 Star 便宜了 6,000 美元，但仍远远超出了消费市场的承受范围。1984 年，苹果公司推出了 Lisa 的缩小版、更便宜的版本 — — Macintosh，使用相同的用户界面，彻底改变了个人电脑市场。</p><p>Steve Jobs, chairman of Apple, then in his late twenties, visited PARC in 1979. He was given a demonstration of the Alto. Larry Tesler, the member of the PARC team that gave Jobs that demonstration, left PARC in 1980 and joined Apple's new secret project that Jobs promised would redefine the state of the art in personal computers. In 1983 Apple unveiled Lisa -- a machine that used a mouse, a bit-mapped screen, windows, and other features based on the Star-Alto-Smalltalk interface. The price for the system was around $10,000. This was $6000 less than the more powerful Star, but still hardly in the range of the consumer market. In 1984, Apple brought out a scaled-down, cheaper version of Lisa, the Macintosh, with the same user interface, and revolutionized the personal computer market.</p>

      <p>如果说分时研究是非正式的入会仪式，ARPAnet 是通行仪式，那么<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">PARC 时代则是增强社区学徒时代的结束。</font>新一代研究人员和企业家通过新生的计算机行业进入软件领域。到 20 世纪 80 年代初，随着大众市场开始意识到个人计算的潜力，无需计算机预言家就能看到，巨大的变化将继续发生。尽管首批数千万台个人计算机的硬件和软件远远达不到 PARC 老将们所追求的目标，但随着大众市场的<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">出现，游戏的赌注已经发生了变化。</font></p><p>If time-sharing research had been the unofficial initiation ceremony and the ARPAnet was the rite of passage, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">the PARC era was the end of the apprenticeship era for the augmentation community.</font> New generations of researchers and entrepreneurs were entering the software fray through the infant computer industry. By the early 1980s, it didn't take a computer prophet to see that big changes were going to continue to happen as the mass market began to awaken to the potential of personal computing. Although the hardware and the software of the first tens of millions of personal computers fell far short of what the PARC veterans were working toward, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">the stakes of the game had changed with the emergence of a mass market.</font></p>

      <p>计算机使用群体的扩大也意味着晦涩难懂的专业术语和需要与计算机进行复杂交互的软件设计的终结。Star 和 Lisa 所展示的设计原则为未来的计算机设计师指明了方向。在 PARC，他们已经着手设计 Dorado、Dolphin 和其他后 Star 时代的计算机。现在，真正强大的计算机器已经面世，人们越来越普遍地认识到，未来商业上成功的程序将是那些成功将计算机的功能带给需要使用它的人的程序。</p><p>The beginnings of a much wider computer-using community also meant the end of arcane jargon and software designs that required complex interactions with the computer. The design principles demonstrated by the Star and the Lisa pointed the way for the future computer designers. At PARC, they were already onto the Dorado, the Dolphin, and other post-Star computers. Now that truly capable computing machinery was becoming available, it was becoming more widely known that the commercially successful programs of the future would be those that succeeded in bringing the power of the computer out to the person who needs to use it.</p>

      <p>令人难以置信的是，“二元法则”仍然有效，它预示着 20 世纪 80 年代末计算机硬件将更加强大、价格更加低廉。1984 年，现就职于数字设备公司的鲍勃·泰勒开始做他最擅长的事情——组建一个计算机系统研究团队，为实现目标发起最后的冲击。他的团队中的一些关键成员在 ARPA 资助分时系统时还是研究生，并且曾参与过 ARC 和 PARC 时代。他们不断努力将交互式计算技术推向真正强大的个人计算的门槛，而他们最新的舞台被命名为“系统研究中心”——或 SRC，发音为“circ”（“马戏团”）。</p><p>The "rule of two" is, incredibly, still in effect, promising even more powerful and less expensive computer hardware in the late 1980s. In 1984, Bob Taylor, now with Digital Equipment Corporation, started doing what he does best -- assembling a computer systems research team for a final assault on the objective. Some of the key members of his team were graduate students when ARPA funded time-sharing, and had been involved in the ARC and PARC eras. The latest arena for their ongoing effort to bootstrap interactive computation technology to the threshold of truly powerful personal computing was named "Systems Research Center" -- or SRC, pronounced "circ" ("as in circus").</p>

      <p>在增强任务的这场激烈较量开始时，泰勒向我发起挑战，“五年后到我办公室来，我会给你展示一台比当今最大、最昂贵的超级计算机快两倍的台式机。然后，我们就可以开发出能够利用我们早已知道的功能的软件了。”</p><p>"Come to my office in five years," Taylor challenged me, at the beginning of this gun-lap in the augmentation quest, "and I'll show you a desktop machine twice as fast as the biggest, most expensive supercomputer made today. Then it will become possible to create the software that can take advantage of the capabilities we've known about for a long time."</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">泰勒现在认为，有三个因素将导致信息处理达到迄今为止我们所见过的最令人惊奇的平台期：</font>首先，新水平的系统软件将能够利用<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">计算机设计，使每个个人工作站成为一种微型分布式网络，</font>内部有多个并行处理器协同工作；其次，大规模集成处理器将足够小、足够便宜，可以将<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">快速、大容量的内存装入台式机；</font>第三，也是最重要的一点，创建分时、图形、网络、个人计算机、智能用户界面和分布式计算的人现在正处于他们能力的巅峰，他们投入了数十万个小时来学习如何构建新水平的计算机技术。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Taylor now believes that three factors will lead to the most astonishing plateau in information processing we've seen yet:</font> first, a new level of systems software will be able to take advantage of <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">computer designs that make each personal workstation into a kind of miniature distributed network,</font> with multiple parallel processors inside working in coordination; second, large scale integration processors will be small and cheap enough to put <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">fast, vast memory into desktop machines;</font> third, and most important, the people who built time-sharing, graphics, networks, personal computers, intelligent user interfaces, and distributed computing are now at the height of their powers, and they have put hundreds of thousands of person-hours into learning how to build new levels of computer technology.</p>

      <p>网络技术、图形、编程语言、用户界面和廉价的大规模信息存储介质的进步意味着，第一台个人电脑设计者所梦想的基本功能很可能在本世纪初之前得到广泛应用。我们希望我们能够明智地使用这些功能。如果我们最终创造了一个过于复杂而我们无法独自管理的世界，却没有意识到我们自己的一些发明可以帮助我们应对自身的复杂性，那将是一个可悲的讽刺。</p><p>Advances in network technologies, graphics, programming languages, user interfaces, and cheap, large-scale information storage media mean that the basic capabilities dreamed of by the designers of the first personal computers are likely to become widely available before the turn of the century. One hopes that we will be ready to use them wisely. It would be a sad irony if we were to end up creating a world too complicated for us to manage alone, and fail to recognize that some of our own inventions could help us deal with our own complexity.</p>

      名声、财富，甚至顶尖软件专业人士的深奥职业抱负似乎都无法激励凯博士，他现在是苹果公司的“研究员”，曾是雅达利公司的“首席科学家”。</font></font><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">成为另一位硅谷百万富翁或接受麻省理工学院的捐赠教席都没有引起他的兴趣，他更感兴趣的是将想象力<i>交到</i>每个被赶出教室的聪明孩子手中。</font>

      <p>自从艾伦·凯两岁半学会阅读以来，他就习惯了按照自己的方式做事，让其他人日后跟上他的步伐。尽管他差点因为不服从命令而从八年级辍学，但他还是电视上最早的“智力竞赛小子”之一。在他创造“个人电脑”一词的十年前，在雅达利或 PARC 出现之前，在另一对聪明的不服从命令的沃兹尼亚克和乔布斯为这个古老的美国词“苹果”赋予新含义之前，艾伦·凯就在 ARPA 研究生会议上展示了 FLEX，这是一款名副其实的个人电脑。</p><p>Ever since he learned to read at the age of two and a half, Alan Kay has been accustomed to doing things his own way and letting the rest of the world catch up later. At the same time he was close to flunking out of the eighth grade, primarily for insubordination, he was one of television's original "Quiz Kids." Ten years before he coined the term "personal computer," before Atari or PARC existed, and before another pair of bright insubordinates named Wozniak and Jobs created a new meaning for that good old American word "Apple," Alan Kay was demonstrating FLEX, a personal computer in all but name, to the ARPA graduate students' conference.</p>

      <p>艾伦现在四十多岁了，他的同行（尽管还未得到公众的认可）都认为他是<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">当代个人电脑革命的先驱之一。现在他的目标是打造一台“幻想放大器”，一种“创造性思维的动态工具”，它足够强大、足够小巧、足够易用、价格足够便宜，可以让世界上的每个小学生都拥有一台。他拥有足够的资源和过往的业绩，让你相信他能做到。</font></p><p>Alan is now in his early forties, and is acknowledged by his peers, if not yet the general public, as <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">one of the contemporary prophets of the personal computer revolution. Now his goal is to build a "fantasy amplifier," a "dynamic tool for creative thought" that is powerful enough, small enough, easy enough to use, and inexpensive enough for every schoolkid in the world to have one. He has the resources and the track record to make you believe he'll do it.</font></p>

      <p>艾伦·凯不符合人们普遍的印象，即傲慢、不爱交际的黑客、快车道上的新晋百万富翁或象牙塔里的计算机科学家。他穿着跑鞋和灯芯绒裤。他留着一小撮一丝不苟的胡子，留着一头短短的、略带凌乱的黑发。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他毫无形象可言，即使他是老板，你也可能从他工作的大厅里走过而没有注意到他。这并不是说他无私或谦虚。他喜欢引用自己的话，经常在布道前加上这样的话：“凯的第一条定律说……”</font></p><p>Alan Kay doesn't fit the popular image of the arrogant, antisocial hacker, the fast-lane nouveau micromillionaire, or the ivory tower computer scientist. He wears running shoes and corduroys. He has a small, meticulous moustache and short, slightly tousled dark hair. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">He's so imageless you could pass him in the halls of the places he works and not notice him, even though he's the boss. Which isn't to say that he's egoless or even modest. He loves to quote himself, and often prefaces his homilies with phrases like "Kay's number one law states . . . ."</font></p>

      <p>我第一次遇到他时，凯博士曾担任施乐帕克研究中心传奇的“学习研究小组”主任，现在担任苹果公司的“远见卓识者”。凯博士和他在雅达利精心挑选的团队在严密的保密下工作，据传预算在 5000 万到 1 亿美元之间，他们要生产出公司内部从未向外部任何人描述过的产品。但任何与他交谈过或读过他写的关于梦想的东西的人，都能猜出凯博士的雅达利项目的主要内容，以及他目前在苹果公司工作的可能方向。自从读研究生以来，他就一直在朝着实现梦想的方向前进，一个项目一个项目地前进，一个原型一个原型地前进，一个创新一个创新地前进。</p><p>When I first encountered him, between his stint as director of the legendary "Learning Research Group" at Xerox PARC, and his present position as a kind of "visionary at large" for Apple, Dr. Kay and his handpicked team at Atari were working under tight secrecy, with a budget that was rumored to be somewhere between $50 million and $100 million, to produce something that nobody in the corporation ever described to anybody outside the corporation. But anybody who has ever talked to him, or read something he has written about his dreams, can guess the general thrust of Kay's Atari project, and the probable direction of his current work at Apple. He has been moving toward realizing his dream, project by project, prototype by prototype, innovation by innovation, ever since he was a graduate student.</p>

      <p>艾伦的性格让他接受教育并不容易。一开始，他比所有同学和大多数老师都懂得多，而且他不介意大声展示自己的才华——这种性格让他被赶出教室，在操场上挨打。</p><p>Being the kind of person he is didn't make it easy for Alan to get an education. At the beginning, he knew more than all of his classmates and most of his teachers, and he didn't mind demonstrating it aloud -- a trait that got him thrown out of classrooms and beaten up on playgrounds.</p>

      <p>幸运的是，对于艾伦以及我们所有可能在未来从他的作品中受益的人来说，当他的老师和同学们找到他时，艾伦的头脑和想象力已经得到了充分的武装，而这才是真正重要的。对于艾伦来说，领先于其他人一开始是一种乐趣，但很快就变成了一种生存特质——这意味着他在学校或其他地方的表现都不太好，直到他 15 岁那年夏天，“纽约奥尼昂塔的一个音乐营改变了我的一生。”</p><p>Fortunately for him and for all of us who may benefit from his creations in the future, Alan was already well armored in his mind and imagination, where it really counted, by the time his teachers and classmates got ahold of him. For Alan, being ahead of everybody else started out as a pleasure and quickly turned into a survival trait -- which meant he didn't do too well in school, or anyplace else, until the summer of his fifteenth year, when "a music camp in Oneonta, New York, changed my entire life."</p>

      <p>音乐成了他生活的中心。从很多方面来说，现在依然如此。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他从 300 英里外的布伦特伍德的家通勤到硅谷，主要是因为他不想离开自制的管风琴太久。</font>而且他每年夏天仍会去音乐营。他从来不明白为什么他最喜欢的两个玩具——书籍和乐器——不能结合成一种既能处理声音又能处理符号的单一媒介。他曾担任职业爵士乐和摇滚吉他手十年。当凯即将被征召入伍时，他加入了美国空军，成为一名导航学员。在空军，他“因为执行不服从命令的任务而把一双鞋磨破了”，但他也发现自己擅长计算机编程。</p><p>Music became the center of his life. In many ways, it still is. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">He commutes to Silicon Valley from his home in Brentwood, 300 miles away, mostly because he doesn't want to be away from his homemade pipe organ for too long.</font> And he still goes to music camp every summer. He never understood why his two favorite toys -- books and musical instruments -- could not be combined into a single medium capable of dealing with both sounds and symbols. He worked as a professional jazz and rock guitarist for ten years. When it looked like he was about to be drafted, Kay joined the U.S. Air Force as a navigational cadet. In the Air Force, he "wore out a pair of shoes doing insubordination duty," but he also learned that he had a knack for computer programming.</p>

      <p>在他结束空军服役后，美国国家大气研究中心迫切希望利用凯的编程才能支付他在科罗拉多大学的费用。他获得了生物学学位，但由于他习惯只专注于自己感兴趣的事情，他的大学成绩一如既往地参差不齐。艾伦现在称之为“纯粹的运气”，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他引起了某个聪明人的注意，这个人真的能教艾伦·凯这样的自作聪明的人一些东西——而且他有足够的勇气录取一个本科记录更像是犯罪记录而不是成绩单的学生。</font></p><p>After he finished his Air Force duty, the National Center for Atmospheric Research was eager to use Kay's programming talent to pay his way through the University of Colorado. He earned a degree in biology, but his college grades were as mixed as they had always been, because of his habit of concentrating intently on only those things that interested him. Through what Alan now calls "sheer luck," <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">he came to the attention of somebody smart enough to actually teach something to a smartass like Alan Kay -- and bold enough to admit a student with an undergraduate record that read more like a rap sheet than a transcript.</font></p>

      <p>那个利用凯在学术界的曲折历史下赌注的人是犹他大学计算机科学系主任大卫·埃文斯，而犹他大学在 20 世纪 60 年代中期成为了增强社区的中心之一。和许多其他在交互式计算机系统设计领域担任领导职务的人一样，埃文斯参与了早期的商业计算机研究，并参与了 ARPA 资助的创建分时技术的团队。</p><p>The man who gambled on Kay's checkered history in academia was David Evans, the chairman of the computer science department at the University of Utah, a place that was to become one of the centers of the augmentation community by the mid-1960s. Like so many others who assumed positions of leadership in the field of interactive computer systems design, Evans had been involved in early commercial computer research and with the ARPA-funded groups that created time-sharing.</p>

      <p>“ARPA 项目负责人和他们的研究生的职业道路反复交织在一起，”凯回忆道。“多年来，少数人一直在不同的地方重复出现，完成了大量的工作。人们经常在 ARPA 的一个项目和另一个项目之间来回迁移。ARPA 资助的是人而不是项目，而且他们长期不干预。利克莱德和鲍勃·斯普劳尔的天才之处在于这种流动促进了社区的发展。”</p><p>"Those career pathways of ARPA project leaders and their graduate students repeatedly intertwined," Kay recalls. "An enormous amount of work was done by a few people who kept reappearing in different places over the years. People frequently migrated back and forth from one ARPA project or another. ARPA funded people rather than projects, and they didn't meddle for an extended period. Part of the genius of Licklider and Bob Sproull was the way this moving around contributed to the growth of a community."</p>

      <p>埃文斯成功招募到犹他州部门的人员之一伊万·<a href="http://www.kzoo.edu/~abrady/CS400/bioW96/soulier.html">萨瑟兰 ( Ivan Sutherland) 不仅对艾伦·凯伊 (Alan Kay) 产生了影响，而且对整个个人计算进程也产生了影响。萨瑟兰是克劳德·</a><a href="#OEBPS/Text/6.html">香农 (Claude Shannon)</a>和JCR·利克莱德 ( <a href="#OEBPS/Text/7.html">JCR Licklider)</a> 的研究生和门生<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">，他在麻省理工学院的博士论文中独自创建了计算机图形学领域</font>- 这个现在被称为“Sketchpad”的传奇程序。</p><p>One of the people Evans managed to recruit for the Utah department who had an impact, not only on Alan Kay but on the entire course of personal computing was <a href="http://www.kzoo.edu/~abrady/CS400/bioW96/soulier.html">Ivan Sutherland</a>, the graduate student and prot�g� of <a href="#OEBPS/Text/6.html">Claude Shannon</a> and <a href="#OEBPS/Text/7.html">J. C. R. Licklider</a> <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">who single-handedly created the field of computer graphics as a part of his MIT Ph.D. thesis</font> -- the now legendary program known as "Sketchpad."</p>

      <p>艾伦·凯等人在谈论 Sketchpad 时仍然激动不已：“Sketchpad 除了是第一个真正的计算机图形程序之外，还有很多奇妙之处。它不仅仅是一个绘图工具。它是一个遵循你希望遵循的法则的程序。因此，要在 Sketchpad 中绘制一个正方形，你需要用光笔画一条线，然后说：‘复制-复制-复制，连接-连接-连接。该角度为 90 度，这四个东西要相等。’Sketchpad 会发出咔哒声！然后你就得到了一个正方形。”</p><p>People like Alan Kay still get excited when they talk about Sketchpad: "Sketchpad had wonderful aspects, besides the fact that it was the first real computer graphics program. It was not just a tool to draw things. It was a program that obeyed laws that you wanted to be held true. So to draw a square in Sketchpad, you drew a line with a lightpen and said: 'Copy-copy-copy, attach-attach-attach. That angle is 90 degrees, and these four things are to be equal.' Sketchpad would go zap! and you'd have a square."</p>

      <p>另一位预见到 Sketchpad 和其他个人电脑神秘奇迹的计算机预言家是<a href="#OEBPS/Text/1.html4">特德·尼尔森 (Ted Nelson)</a>，他是一位不敬的、非正统的反主流文化人士，他长期以来一直习惯于自行出版关于计算机未来的古怪、古怪但极其准确的评论。在《<i>家庭计算机革命》</i>一书中，尼尔森在题为“有史以来最重要的计算机程序”的一章中这样评价萨瑟兰的开创性程序：</p><p>Another computer prophet who saw the implications of Sketchpad and other heretofore esoteric wonders of personal computing was an irreverent, unorthodox, counterculture fellow by the name of <a href="#OEBPS/Text/1.html4">Ted Nelson</a>, who has long been in the habit of self-publishing quirky, cranky, amazingly accurate commentaries on the future of computing. In <i>The Home Computer Revolution</i> Nelson had this to say about Sutherland's pioneering program, in a chapter entitled "The most important computer Program Ever Written":</p>

      
        <p><font size="-1">你可以用光笔在屏幕上画图——然后将图片存档在计算机内存中。事实上，你可以用这种方式保存大量图片。</font></p><p><font size="-1">You could draw a picture on the screen with the lightpen -- and then file the picture away in the computer's memory. You could, indeed, save numerous pictures in this way.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">例如，你可以制作一张兔子的图片和一张火箭的图片，然后把小兔子放在大火箭上。或者，把小火箭放在大兔子上。</font></p><p><font size="-1">For example, you could make a picture of a rabbit and a picture of a rocket, and then put little rabbits all over a large rocket. Or, little rockets all over a large rabbit.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">显示图片的屏幕不一定会显示所有的细节；重要的是细节在计算机中；当你将图片放大到足够大时，它们就会出现在视野中<i>。</i></font></p><p><font size="-1">The screen on which the picture appeared did not necessarily show all the details; the important thing was that the details were <i>in</i> the computer; when you magnified a picture sufficiently, they would come into view.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">您可以将图片放大或缩小到惊人的程度。您可以用兔子图片填充火箭图片，然后将其缩小，直到只剩下一个小火箭；然后您可以复制<i>它</i>，并将它们点缀在兔子图片的大副本上。这样，当您将大兔子放大到只显示一小部分时（如果屏幕足够大，它将是一所房子的大小），屏幕上每枚一英尺长的火箭上都会有一只一角硬币大小的兔子。</font></p><p><font size="-1">You could magnify and shrink a picture to a spectacular degree. You could fill a rocket picture with rabbit pictures, then shrink that until all that was visible was a tiny rocket; then you could make copies of <i>that</i>, and dot them all over a large copy of the rabbit picture. So that when you expanded the big rabbit till only a small part showed (so it would be the size of a house, if the screen were large enough), then the foot-long rockets on the screen would each have rabbits the size of a dime.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">最后，如果你改变了主图片——比如，给大兔子放上第三只耳朵——所有的副本都会相应改变。</font></p><p><font size="-1">Finally, if you changed the master picture -- say, by putting a third ear on the big rabbit -- all the copies would change correspondingly.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">因此，Sketchpad 让您在做出决定之前先尝试一下。它不会让您以某种特定方式定位线条，而是允许您以多种不同的位置和排列方式定位线条，并且可以轻松地在桌子上移动剪纸。</font></p><p><font size="-1">Thus Sketchpad let you try things out before deciding. Instead of making you position a line in one specific way, it was set up to allow you to a number of different positions and arrangements, with the ease of moving cut-outs around on a table.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">它为人类的模糊性和判断留出了空间。它不会强迫用户将事物划分为明确的类别，也不会要求数据从一开始就精确无误——所有这些严格的限制都被人们称为“计算机要求的”——它让你可以随心所欲地随意移动事物。你可以重新排列，直到得到你想要的东西，不管你出于什么原因想要它。</font></p><p><font size="-1">It allowed room for human vagueness and judgment. Instead of forcing the user to divide things into sharp categories, or requiring the data to be precise from the beginning -- all those stiff restrictions people say "the computer requires" -- it let you slide things around to your heart's content. You could rearrange till you got what you wanted, no matter for what reason you wanted it.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">以前，军队中也曾使用过光笔和图形计算机屏幕，但 Sketchpad 的历史意义在于它的简单性——必须补充的是，这种简单性是由狡猾的智力精心打造的——并且它不涉及任何特定领域。事实上，它缺乏通常与人们实际工作相关的任何复杂性。简而言之，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">它是一个无害的程序，展示了如果计算机被设置为真正有用，人类的工作可以变得多么容易。</font></font></p><p><font size="-1">There had been lightpens and graphical computer screens before, used in the military, but Sketchpad was historic in its simplicity -- a simplicity, it must be added, that had been deliberately crafted by a cunning intellect -- and its lack of involvement with any particular field. Indeed, it lacked any complications normally tangled with what people actually do. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">It was, in short, an innocent program, showing how easy human work could be if a computer were set up to be really helpful.</font></font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">正如这里所述，这似乎不太有用，而这正是问题的一部分。Sketchpad 是一款非常富有想象力的新颖程序，Sutherland 在其中发明了许多新技术；只有富有想象力的人才能理解它的意义。</font></p><p><font size="-1">As described here, this may not seem very useful, and that has been part of the problem.

      萨瑟兰 26 岁时接替利克莱德担任 ARPA 信息处理技术办公室主任。20 世纪 60 年代中期，鲍勃·泰勒离开哈佛，接替他的职位，从事 3D 头戴式显示器（如眼镜框中的微型电视）和其他奇特的图形系统的研究。当大卫·埃文斯试图引诱他前往犹他州时，萨瑟兰说，只要埃文斯同意成为商业伙伴，他就会这么做——因此，开创性的计算机化飞行模拟和图像生成公司<a href="http://www.es.com/">Evans &amp; Sutherland</a><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">诞生了。

      </font></font><p>1966 年 11 月，凯来到犹他州。他的第一项任务是阅读埃文斯给他的一堆手稿——伊万·萨瑟兰的论文。按照埃文斯管理研究生课程的方式，你不应该在校园里待太久或太久。你应该成为一名专业人士，然后进入工业界从事高级咨询工作。他为艾伦·凯找到的工作是与一位名叫埃德·钱德尔的硬件天才合作。埃德有个做台式电脑的想法。凯从 1967 年到 1969 年致力于 FLEX——他的第一个个人电脑软件设计。当当今个人电脑行业的一些创始人还在上高中时，凯正在学习如何设计个人电脑。</p><p>Kay showed up at Utah in November of 1966. His first task was to read a pile of manuscript Evans gave him -- Ivan Sutherland's thesis. The way Evans ran the graduate program, you weren't supposed to be around campus very long or very much. You were supposed to be a professional and move on to high-level consulting jobs in industry. The job he found for Alan Kay was with a hardware genius named Ed Cheadle. Ed had an idea about doing a tabletop computer. Kay worked on FLEX -- his first personal computer software design -- from 1967 to 1969. While some of the founders of today's personal computer industry were still in high school, Kay was learning how to design personal computers.</p>

      <p>从技术上讲，Cheadle 和 Kay 并不是第一个尝试制造个人计算机的人。几年前，Whirlwind 和林肯实验室的 TX-2 和“imps”的 Wes Clark 制造了一台办公桌大小的机器，称为“LINC”。FLEX 是一种尝试，它使用最近出现的更先进的电子元件，将计算机的更多功能发挥到个人用户可以与之交互的地方。FLEX 在技术上是一项重大创新，但它复杂而微妙，用 Kay 的话来说，“用户觉得学习它很困难”。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">问题不在于机器，而在于用户必须掌握特殊语言才能控制机器的功能来完成有用的任务。</font>正是在那时，Kay 第一次发誓要确保他的个人计算机至少能部分地走向使用它的人，并且他意识到软件设计将是实现这一愿望的领域。</p><p>Technically, Cheadle and Kay were not the first to attempt to build a personal computer. Wes Clark, from Whirlwind and Lincoln Lab's TX-2 and "imps," had constructed a desk-size machine a few years before, known as "LINC." FLEX was an attempt to use the more advanced electronic components that had recently become available to bring more of the computer's power out where the individual user could interact with it. FLEX was a significant innovation technically, but it was complicated and delicate, and in Kay's words, "users found it repellent to learn." <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The problem wasn't in the machinery as much as it was in the special language the user had to master in order to command the power of the machine to accomplish useful tasks.</font> That was when Kay first vowed to make sure his personal computer would come at least part of the way toward the person who was to use it, and when he realized that software design would be the area in which this desire could be fulfilled.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">虽然艾伦·凯还没有完全意识到这一点，但他已经开始考虑设计一种新的编程语言。他开始渴望的语言是一种将计算机用作通用模拟器的工具。</font>问题是编程语言非常深奥。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">“有两种方法可以考虑制造一种乐器，”凯断言。“你可以制造一把只有少数有才华的艺术家才能演奏的小提琴。或者你可以制造一支铅笔之类的东西，可以快速轻松地用于学习字母、绘画和编写计算机程序等任何事情。”</font>他确信，在开发真正可用的个人计算机程序时要解决的问题中有 99% 是软件问题：<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">“到 1966 年，每个人都知道硅片的发展方向。”</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Although he didn't fully realize it yet, Alan Kay was beginning to think about designing a new programming language. The kind of language he began to yearn for would be a tool for using the computer as a kind of universal simulator.</font> The problem was that programming languages were demonically esoteric. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"There are two ways to think about building an instrument," Kay asserts. "You can build something like a violin that only a few talented artists can play. Or you can make something like a pencil that can be used quickly and easily for anything from learning the alphabet to drawing to writing a computer program."</font> He was convinced that 99 percent of the problem to be solved in making a truly usable personal computer program were software problems: <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"By 1966, everyone knew where the silicon was going."</font></p>

      <p>除了 FLEX，Kay 在犹他州的另一个项目是让一些软件运行起来。他的办公桌上放着一堆磁带盒，还有一张纸条，上面写着这些磁带应该包含一种名为 Algol 60 的科学编程语言，但它们不起作用。这是一个令人抓狂的软件难题，当 Kay 发现它不是 Algol 60，而是一种来自挪威的语言<i>Simula</i>时，它仍远未解决。在 1984 年的一次采访中，Kay 描述了当他最终将存储在这些神秘磁带盒中的程序列表打印在纸上并弄清楚这些磁带上的内容时发生的事情：</p><p>Besides FLEX, Kay's other project at Utah was to make some software work. He got a pile of tape canisters on his desk, along with a note that the tapes were supposed to contain a scientific programming language known as Algol 60, but they didn't work. It was a maddening software puzzle that was still far from solved when Kay figured out that it wasn't Algol 60 but a language from Norway, of all places, called <i>Simula</i>. In a 1984 interview, Kay described what happened when he finally printed out on paper the program listings stored in those mysterious canisters and figured out what was on those tapes:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">我们看不懂任何一篇论文，它们有点像是从挪威语音译过来的……我们展开程序清单，仔细查看机器代码，试图弄清楚发生了什么——我突然意识到 Simula 是一种编程语言，可以做 Sketchpad 所做的事情。我从来没有真正理解过 Sketchpad 是什么。现在想起来，我都浑身发抖。它把我的观点从一个不同的维度旋转到另一个维度，从那以后一切都不一样了。我突然明白了高级语言的用途。</font>
      <a href="#OEBPS/Text/9.html">艾伦是恩格尔巴特 1968 年媒体秀</a>上着迷的观众之一。他对此感到兴奋，因为它展示了计算机增强表示系统可以做什么。它也让艾伦明白他<i>不想</i>做什么。“恩格尔巴特机组人员都是 NLS 系统的王牌飞行员，”凯回忆道。他们几乎可以立即做出反应——就像一个非常棒的视频游戏。你可以驾驶飞机穿越巨大的信息领域。不幸的是，对我来说，这些专家学会了如何玩这种优雅而复杂的游戏。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">它太复杂了</font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">，不符合我的口味，而且我对读写能力作为一种流利程度的整个概念不感兴趣。

      在准备博士论文的过程中，艾伦开始探索人工智能研究领域，这使他与另外两位对他的研究产生重大影响的计算机科学家——</font></font><a href="http://brainop.media.mit.edu/people/minsky.html">马文·明斯基</a>和<a href="http://www.multimedia.hosting.ibm.com/mmtoday/magazine/papert-1.html">西摩·派普特</a>建立了更密切的联系，他们当时是麻省理工学院开创性人工智能研究项目的联合主任。20 世纪 60 年代末，派普特正在做的事情对艾伦的目标产生了不可逆转的影响。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">派普特正在创建一种新的计算机语言。专为儿童设计。</font>

      <p><a href="#OEBPS/Text/8.html">派普特是一位数学家，也是充满神话色彩的Mac 计划</a>的早期英雄之一，他曾在瑞士工作了五年，与发展心理学家让·皮亚杰一起工作。皮亚杰花费数年甚至数十年的时间观察儿童的学习情况，从而引发了学习理论的革命。他得出结论，学习不仅仅是成年人通过教师和课堂强加给子女的东西，而是儿童天生具备的对世界做出反应的能力的深层部分，儿童根据他们掌握的材料，在一定的阶段构建他们对世界运作方式的观念。</p><p>Papert, a mathematician and one of the early heroes of the myth-shrouded <a href="#OEBPS/Text/8.html">Project Mac</a>, had spent five years in Switzerland, working with the developmental psychologist Jean Piaget. Piaget had triggered his own revolution in learning theory by spending time -- years and decades -- watching children learn. He concluded that learning is not simply something adults impose upon their offspring through teachers and classrooms, but is a deep part of the way children are innately equipped to react to the world, and that children construct their notions of how the world works, from the material available to them, in definite stages.</p>

      <p>皮亚杰对儿童如何获得不同类型的<i>知识</i>特别感兴趣，并得出结论，儿童是<i>科学家</i>——他们进行实验，提出理论，并通过更多实验来检验他们的理论。对于我们其他人来说，这个过程被称为“玩耍”，但对孩子来说，这是一种重要的研究形式。</p><p>Piaget was especially interested in how different kinds of <i>knowledge</i> are acquired by children, and concluded that children are <i>scientists</i> -- they perform experiments, formulate theories, and test their theories with more experiments. To the rest of us, this process is known as "playing," but to children it is a vital form of research.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1"></font> <a href="http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/logo-foundation/">派</a><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">普特认识到，计算机的响应能力和表示能力可能使儿童能够以沙箱或黑板上不可能达到的规模进行研究。LOGO是由派普特、他的同事 Wallace Fuerzing 以及麻省理工学院和 Bolt、Bernack &amp; Newman 咨询公司的其他人员共同开发的，其创建目的与之前的计算机语言创建目的截然不同。FORTRAN 使科学家更容易编写计算机程序。COBOL 使会计师更容易编写计算机程序。有人可能会说，LISP 使计算机更容易编写计算机程序。然而，LOGO 却是为了让</font><i>儿童</i>更容易编写计算机程序而做出的努力。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Papert recognized that the responsiveness and representational capacity of computers might allow children to conduct their research on a scale never possible in a sandbox or on a blackboard.</font> <a href="http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/logo-foundation/">LOGO</a>, the computer language developed by Papert, his colleague Wallace Fuerzing, and others at MIT and at the consulting firm of Bolt, Bernack &amp; Newman, was created for a purpose that was shockingly different from the purposes that had motivated the creation of previous computer languages. FORTRAN made it easier for scientists to program computers. COBOL made it easier for accountants to program computers. LISP, some might say, made it easier for computers to program computers. LOGO, however, was an effort to make it easier for <i>children</i> to program computers.</p>

      <p>尽管 LOGO 实验的创始人知道它对人工智能、计算机科学以及教育都有着深远的影响，但该项目的主要目的是创建一个工具，用于向儿童传授思考和解决问题的技能。其目的是激发而不是抑制儿童以他们觉得有趣和有益的方式解决问题的自然欲望。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">“目的不是让计算机编程学生，而是让学生编程计算机”，这</font>是 LOGO 小组的说法。</p><p>Although its creators knew that the LOGO experiment could have profound implications in artificial intelligence and computer science as well as in education, the project was primarily intended to create a tool for teaching thinking and problem-solving skills to children. The intention was to empower rather than to suppress children's natural desire to solve problems in ways they find fun and rewarding. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"The object is not for the computer to program the student, but for the student to program the computer,"</font> was the way the LOGO group put it.</p>

      <p>从 1968 年开始，八到十二岁的儿童开始接触编程，方法是使用精美的图形和一种新方法，将学习的权力交到学习者手中。通过学习如何使用 LOGO 来享受电脑带来的乐趣，学生们会自动练习可以推广到他们生活其他方面的技能。</p><p>Beginning in 1968, children between the ages of eight and twelve were introduced to programming through the use of attractive graphics and a new approach that put the power to learn in the hands of the people who were doing the learning. By learning how to use LOGO to have fun with computers, students were automatically practicing skills that would generalize to other parts of their lives.</p>

      <p>帕普特从他的计算机科学和发展心理学经验中观察到，这些技能中的某些是“强大的想法”，可以在任何年龄、任何学科领域使用，因为它们与<font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>知道如何学习</i></font>有关。这是将 LOGO 与之前的“计算机辅助教学”项目区分开来的关键因素。LOGO 方法不是将教育视为将知识从教师传授给学生的任务，而是帮助学生加强自己发现知识的能力。</p><p>Papert had observed from both his computer science and developmental psychology experience that certain of these skills are "powerful ideas" that can be used at any age, in any subject area, because they have to do with <font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>knowing how to learn</i></font> . This is the key element that separated LOGO from the "computer assisted instruction" projects that had preceded it. Instead of treating education as a task of transferring knowledge from the teacher to the student, the LOGO approach was to help students strengthen their ability to discover knowledge on their own.</p>

      <p>例如，这些技能中最重要的一项就是“bug”的概念——程序员用这个词来描述计算机程序中不可避免地出现的小错误，必须在程序运行之前找到这些错误。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">学习 LOGO 的任务不是让学生自尊心受挫地寻找“正确”的答案，而是鼓励孩子们大胆尝试新程序，然后调试程序直到它们运行，从而解决问题。</font></p><p>One of the most important of these skills, for example, is the idea of "bugs" -- the word that programmers use to describe the small mistakes that inevitably crop up in computer programs, and which must be tracked down before the program will work. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Instead of launching students on an ego-bruising search for the "right" answer, the task of learning LOGO was meant to encourage children to solve problems by daring to try new procedures, then debugging the procedures until they work.</font></p>

      <p>LOGO 中引入的第一个革命性学习工具是“海龟”，这是一种既是机器又是隐喻的设备。最初的 LOGO 海龟是一个小型机器人，由计算机控制，由儿童编程，可以指示它四处移动，在移动时拉动笔，在纸上画出有趣的图案。艾伦·凯是几位软件设计师之一，他们意识到这个过程不仅仅是练习画画，因为操纵符号的能力——无论符号是海龟画、文字还是数学方程式——都是用于增强人类思维的每一种媒介的核心。</p><p>The first revolutionary learning instrument introduced in LOGO was the "turtle," a device that is part machine and part metaphor. The original LOGO turtle was a small robot, controlled by the computer and programmed by the child, that could be instructed to move around, pulling a pen as it moved, drawing intriguing patterns on paper in the process. Alan Kay was one of several software designers who realized that this process was more than just practice at drawing pictures, for the ability to manipulate symbols -- whether the symbols are turtle drawings, words, or mathematical equations -- is central to every medium used to augment human thinking.</p>

      <p>如今，更先进的显示技术中的抽象乌龟是一个三角形图形，它会在显示屏上留下视频轨迹。无论它是用金属制成并在纸上作画，还是用电子制成并在视频屏幕上作画，乌龟都是教育心理学家所说的<i>过渡对象</i>——也是 Papert 所说的“思考对象”。</p><p>The abstract turtle of today's more advanced display technology is a triangular graphic figure that leaves a video trail behind it on a display screen. Whether it is made of metal and draws on paper, or made of electrons and draws on a video screen, the turtle is what educational psychologists call a <i>transitional object</i> -- and what Papert calls an "object-to-think-with."</p>

      <p>孩子们不必“编程让电脑”画出图案，而是被鼓励“教乌龟”如何画。他们首先“假装自己是乌龟”，并试着猜测乌龟会怎么做才能画出正方形、三角形、圆形或螺旋线。然后他们给乌龟输入一系列类似英语的命令，通过键盘输入，以“教乌龟一个新单词”。</p><p>Instead of "programming the computer" to draw a pattern, children are encouraged to "teach the turtle" how to draw it. They start by "pretending to be the turtle" and trying to guess what the turtle would do in order to trace a square, a triangle, a circle, or a spiral. Then they give the turtle a series of English-like commands, typed in through a keyboard, to "teach the turtle a new word."</p>

      <p>如果乌龟按照输入的命令所采取的程序没有达到预期的图形效果，下一步就是系统地追踪阻碍成功的“错误”。在这个过程中，对犯错的恐惧被自己发现强大想法的即时反馈所取代。</p><p>If the procedure followed by the turtle in response to the typed commands doesn't achieve the desired graphic effect, the next step is to systematically track down the "bug" that is preventing success. The fear of being wrong is replaced in this process by the immediate feedback of discovering powerful ideas on one's own.</p>

      <p><i>经过数十年的研究，派普特在《头脑风暴：儿童、计算机和强大的思想》一</i>书中向广大读者总结了他的 LOGO 工作成果。在这个已发展成为教育界和计算机界国际运动的宣言中，派普特重申了在底层技术的复杂性中很容易被忽视的重要一点 ——<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">任何工具的目的都应该是帮助人类变得更人性化：</font></p><p>After decades of research, Papert summarized the results of his LOGO work for a general audience in <i>Mindstorms: Children, computers, and powerful ideas</i>. In this manifesto of what has grown into an international movement in both the educational and computing communities, Papert reiterated something important that is easy to lose in the complexities of the underlying technology -- that <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">the purpose of any tool ought to be to help human beings become more human:</font></p>

      
        <font size="-1">在我看来，计算机充当着一个过渡对象，调解人与人之间的关系……</font>

        <p><font size="-1">我谈论的是思想革命，这种革命不能简单地归结为技术，就像物理学和分子生物学不能简单地归结为实验室使用的技术工具，诗歌不能简单地归结为印刷机一样。在我看来，技术有两个作用。一个是启发性的：计算机的存在催化了思想的出现。另一个是工具性的：计算机将把思想带到一个比迄今为止孵化思想的研究中心更大的世界。</font></p><p><font size="-1">I am talking about a revolution in ideas that is no more reducible to technologies than physics and molecular biology are reducible to the technological tools used in laboratories or poetry to the printing press. In my vision, technology has two roles. One is heuristic: The computer presence has catalyzed the emergence of ideas. The other is instrumental: The computer will carry ideas into a world larger than the research centers where they have incubated up to now.</font></p>
      <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">当他偶然发现 LOGO 作品时，他正思考自己花了两年时间研制的 FLEX 机器，却发现它并不适合人类使用，艾伦·凯回忆说，“当时我突然灵光一闪。我知道我永远不会再设计另一个不适合儿童的程序了。”</font>

      <p>他首先意识到的一件事就是，儿童能够学习的程序或编程语言不一定是“玩具”。玩具也可以作为工具。但这种转变并不是自然发生的——它需要语言设计者的大量工作才能实现。凯伊已经知道，创建个人计算的最重要工具是软件，但现在他意识到，这些工具所增强的力量将是学习能力<i>——</i>无论用户是儿童、计算机系统设计师还是人工智能程序。</p><p>One of the first things he understood was that a program or a programming language that can be learned by children doesn't have to be a "toy." The toy can also serve as a tool. But that transformation doesn't happen naturally -- it comes about through a great deal of work by the person who designs the language. Kay already knew that the most important tools for creating personal computing were to be found in the software, but now it dawned on him that the power those tools would amplify would be the power to <i>learn</i> -- whether the user is a child, a computer systems designer, or an artificial intelligence program.</p>

      <p>虽然他知道，如果要创造一种连孩子都可以使用计算机作为模拟工具的方法，他将面临一项艰巨的软件任务，但他的 FLEX 经验和对 LOGO 的了解使 Kay 相信，这不仅仅是制造一台易于操作的计算机和创建一种新型计算机语言那么简单。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">这类似于制造一种工具的问题，儿童可以使用这种工具来建造沙堡，但对于想要建造摩天大楼的建筑师来说，这种</font>工具同样有用。他所设想的是一种全新的人工制品：如果他最终设计出一种八岁儿童可以一手拿着并用来传递音乐、文字、图片以及查阅博物馆和图书馆的东西，那么这种设备会被视为<i>工具</i>还是<i>玩具</i>？</p><p>Although he knew he had a monstrous software task ahead of him if he was to create a means by which even children could use computers as a simulation tool, his FLEX experience and his exposure to LOGO convinced Kay that there was far more to it than just building an easy-to-operate computer and creating a new kind of computer language. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">It was something akin to the problem of building a tool that a child could use to build a sandcastle, but would be equally useful to architects who wanted to erect skyscrapers.</font> What he had in mind was an altogether new kind of artifact: If he ended up with something an eight-year-old could carry in one hand and use to communicate music, words, pictures, and to consult museums and libraries, would the device be perceived as a <i>tool</i> or as a <i>toy</i>?</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">凯开始明白，他想要创造的是一种全新的<i>媒介</i></font>——一种与历史上所有静态媒介截然不同的媒介。这将是第一个<i>动态</i>媒介——一种表达、交流和激活思想、梦想和幻想以及文字、图像和声音的手段。他认识到恩格尔巴特的系统作为知识工作者（如编辑和建筑师、科学家、股票经纪人、律师、设计师、工程师和立法者）的工具包的强大功能。信息专家迫切需要像 NLS 这样的工具。但凯追求的是一种更普遍、也许更深刻的力量。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Kay began to understand that what he wanted to create was an entirely new <i>medium</i></font> -- a medium that would be fundamentally different from all the previous static media of history. This was going to be the first <i>dynamic</i> medium -- a means of representing, communicating, and animating thoughts, dreams, and fantasies as well as words, images, and sounds. He recognized the power of Engelbart's system as a toolkit for knowledge workers like editors and architects, scientists, stockbrokers, attorneys, designers, engineers, and legislators. Information experts desperately needed tools like NLS. But Kay was after a more universal, perhaps more profound power.</p>

      <p>在帕普特的 LOGO 项目中发挥重要作用的概念之一，也因此影响了艾伦·凯和其他人，源自约翰·杜威的思想，杜威的工作鼓舞了一代又一代的进步教育家。杜威提出了一个理论，皮亚杰后来对其进行了阐述——<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">成年人经常误认为富有想象力的游戏是“无目的的”，但实际上它是一种了解世界的有力工具。</font>凯希望将探索幻想的自然欲望与从实验中学习的先天能力联系起来，他知道计算机模拟任何可以清晰描述的东西的能力是建立这种联系的关键之一。</p><p>One of the concepts that played a big part in Papert's LOGO project, and thus influenced Alan Kay and others, was derived from the thinking of John Dewey, whose work encouraged generations of progressive educators. Dewey developed a theory that Piaget later elaborated -- that the <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">imaginative play often mistakenly judged by adults to be "aimless" is actually a potent tool for learning about the world.</font> Kay wanted to link the natural desire to explore fantasies with the innate ability to learn from experimentation, and he knew that the computer's power to simulate anything that could be clearly described was one key to making that connection.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">艾伦想要创造一种媒介，既是<i>幻想的放大器</i></font>，又是智力的增强器。首先，他必须设计一种比 LOGO 更适合他目的的语言，一种“新的编程系统，试图将简单性和易用性与专家级成人编程的质量改进结合起来”。有了正确的编程语言，再加上他预见到的不久的将来会出现的高性能计算机硬件，凯认为，一种全新的计算机——个人<i>计算机</i>——可能是可能的。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Alan wanted to create a medium that was a <i>fantasy amplifier</i></font> as well as an intellectual augmentor. First he had to devise a language more suited for his purposes than LOGO, a "new kind of programming system that would attempt to combine simplicity and ease of access with a qualitative improvement in expert-level adult programming." With the right kind of programming language, used in conjunction with the high-powered computer hardware he foresaw for the near future, Kay thought that an entirely new kind of computer -- a <i>personal</i> computer -- might be possible.</p>

      <p>Kay 设想的软件进步只能通过使用 1969 年尚不存在的硬件来实现，因为每个单元所需的计算能力必须是 20 世纪 60 年代最复杂的分时计算机的数百倍。但在 20 世纪 60 年代末，这种以前无法想象的计算能力似乎是可能的，甚至即将实现。1969 年是个人计算发展的关键一年，也是 Alan Kay 职业生涯的关键一年。这一年，ARPAnet 分时社区开始发现他们都接入了一种新型的社会信息实体，并开始热情地使用他们的新媒介来设计下一代硬件和软件。</p><p>Such a software advance as the kind Kay envisioned could only be accomplished by using hardware that didn't exist yet in 1969, since the computing power required for each individual unit would have to be several hundred times that of the most sophisticated time-sharing computers of the 1960s. But at the end of the 1960s, such previously undreamed-of computing power seemed to be possible, if not imminent. The year 1969 was pivotal in the evolution of personal computing, as well as in Alan Kay's career. It was the year that the ARPAnet time-sharing communities began to discover that they were all plugged into a new kind of social-informational entity, and enthusiastically began to use their new medium to design the next generations of hardware and software.</p>

      <p>完成 FLEX 论文后，Kay 开始追求自己的目标：在斯坦福人工智能实验室（Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory）设计一种新的计算机语言。斯坦福<a href="http://www.cs.stanford.edu/profile/ai.html">人工智能实验室</a>是为数不多的拥有硬件、软件和大量人才的地方之一，可以支持他的未来计划。他有很多事情要考虑。这里有很多优秀的程序员，但很少有优秀的编程语言创造者。</p><p>After he finished his thesis on FLEX, Kay began to pursue his goal of designing a new computer language in one of the few places that had had the hardware, the software, and the critical mass of brain power to support his future plans -- the <a href="http://www.cs.stanford.edu/profile/ai.html">Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>. He had a lot to think about. There were many great programmers, but very few great creators of programming languages.</p>

      <p>他的主要兴趣是 FLEX 的最终继任者的编程语言，这不仅是因为<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他知道硬件会赶上他，还因为他知道编程语言会影响使用计算机的人的思维。1977年，在完成创建新编程语言</font><i>Smalltalk</i>的任务后，Kay 描述了编程语言与使用它的人的思维之间的这种联系的重要性：</p><p>The programming language for the eventual successor to FLEX was his primary interest, not only because <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">he knew that the hardware would be catching up to him, but because he knew that programming languages influence the minds of the people who use computers.</font> In 1977, after the task of creating his new programming language, <i>Smalltalk</i>, was accomplished, Kay described the importance of this connection between a programming language and the thinking of the person who uses it:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">符号语言的特殊结构很重要，因为它提供了一个背景，在这个背景中，某些概念比其他概念更容易思考。例如，数学符号最初是为了缩写那些只能用自然语言中笨拙的迂回表达的概念而出现的。人们逐渐意识到，表达式和操作的形式对于理解和操作表达式所代表的含义有很大的帮助。……</font>

        <p><font size="-1"><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">计算机颠覆了传统的科学研究过程，从而产生了对语言的新需求。它创造了新的宇宙，可以通过理论塑造这些宇宙，从而产生模拟现象。</font></font></p><p><font size="-1"><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The computer created new needs for language by inverting the traditional process of scientific investigation. It made new universes available that could be shaped by theories to produce simulated phenomena.</font></font></p>
      

      <p>Kay 指出的“传统科学研究过程”的“颠覆”是计算机<i>模拟</i>能力的源泉。而以可见形式模拟想法的能力正是新编程语言需要包含的，以便将计算机用作想象力放大器。如果皮亚杰是正确的，儿童既是科学家又是认识论者，那么模拟科学研究的工具可能会对幼儿和成人计算机程序员的学习量和学习速度产生巨大影响。</p><p>The "inverting" of "the traditional process of scientific investigation" noted by Kay was the source of the computer's power of <i>simulation</i>. And the ability to simulate ideas in visible form was exactly what a new programming language needed to include in order to use a computer as an imagination amplifier. If Piaget was correct and children are both scientists and epistemologists, a tool for simulating scientific investigation could have great impact on how much and how fast young children and adult computer programmers are able to learn.</p>

      <p>根据弗朗西斯·培根三百年前首次提出的科学归纳法规则，科学知识及其赋予的力量是通过首先观察自然、注意从这些直接观察中出现的模式和关系，然后创建理论来解释这些观察而产生的。随着<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">“遵守你希望成立的法则”的机器的诞生，人们有可能指定一个不存在的世界的法则，然后观察计算机根据这些法则创建的表示。</font></p><p>According to the rules of scientific induction, first set down by Francis Bacon three hundred years ago, scientific knowledge and the power granted by that knowledge are created by first observing nature, noting patterns and relationships that emerge from those direct observations, then creating a theory to explain the observations. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">With the creation of a machine that "obeyed laws you wanted to be held true," it became possible to specify the laws governing a world that doesn't exist, then observe the representation created by the computer on the basis of those laws.</font></p>

      <p>帕普特将这些模拟宇宙称为“微世界”，并使用 LOGO 创建的微世界向十岁儿童教授逻辑、几何、微积分和解决问题。一款优秀的电子游戏的魅力部分在于其微世界表现的视觉冲击力，以及赋予玩家对其作出反应并从而学习如何控制它的能力。在 Smalltalk 中，每个对象都应是一个微世界。</p><p>Papert called these simulated universes "microworlds," and used LOGO-created microworlds to teach logic, geometry, calculus, and problem-solving to ten-year-olds. Part of the fascination of a good video game lies in the visual impact of its microworld representation and the amount of power given to the player to react to it and thus learn how to control it. In Smalltalk, every object was meant to be a microworld.</p>

      <p>计算机科学家谈论计算机语言中的<font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>计算隐喻</i></font>——思考编程真正作用的替代框架。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">最广泛和最古老的隐喻是菜谱，</font>是为一个非常愚蠢但听话的仆人制作的菜谱——一份明确的、循序渐进的指令列表，当由一个盲目的指令遵循机制执行时，可以提供所需的结果。指令序列是对计算机如何运行的一个准确但有限的隐喻。它反映了这样一个事实：早期的计算机每次只做一件事，但做得非常快，然后转到下一条指令。</p><p>Computer scientists talk about <font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>computational metaphors</i></font> in computer languages -- alternative frameworks for thinking about what programming really does. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The most widespread and oldest metaphor is that of a recipe,</font> the kind of recipe you create for a very stupid but obedient servant -- a list of definite, step-by-step instructions that could provide a desired result when carried out by a mindless instruction-following mechanism. The sequence of instructions is an accurate but limiting metaphor for how a computer operates. It is a reflection of the fact that early computers were built to do just one thing at a time, but to do it very fast and get on to the next instruction.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">然而，这种模型并不适合未来的计算机，因为未来的计算机将同时执行许多过程</font>（这种计算称为并行处理）。基于数字、串行过程的主导隐喻的语言更适合算术等线性过程，而不太适合计算机作为表示媒介时需要执行的那些任务。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">并行处理也是人类大脑处理信息方式的更好模型。</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">This model, however, is not well suited to computers of the future, which will perform many processes at the same time</font> (in the kind of computation that is called parallel processing). Languages based on the dominant metaphors of numerical, serial procedures are much better suited for linear processes like arithmetic and less well suited for exactly those tasks that computers need to perform if they are to serve as representational media. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Parallel processing is also a better model of the way human brains handle information.</font></p>

      <p>从 LOGO 和 Simula 中提出的概念出发，Kay 开始设计一种新的隐喻，其中一次一条指令的字符串被多维环境所取代，其中的对象通过相互发送消息进行通信。实际上<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">，他开始构建一种计算机语言，使程序员能够将主机视为数千台独立的计算机，而不是串行指令的追随者，每台计算机都能够控制整台机器的功能。</font></p><p>Starting from concepts set forth in LOGO and in Simula, Kay began to devise a new metaphor in which the string of one-at-a-time instructions is replaced by a multidimensional environment occupied by objects that communicate by sending one another messages. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">In effect, he started out to build a computer language that would enable the programmer to look at the host computer not as a serial instruction follower, but as thousands of independent computers, each one able to command the power of the whole machine.</font></p>

      <p>1969 年和 1970 年，越南战争的影响越来越大，国会批评人士对他们所指的“轻率研究”施加的压力，导致了“ARPA 精神”的消亡，而这种精神曾促成了分时和计算机网络的诞生。1970 年的“曼斯菲尔德修正案”要求 ARPA 只资助那些具有明显的国防应用前景的项目。泰勒离开了。人工智能实验室和计算机系统设计师从其他机构获得了资金，但 60 年代成长起来的核心社区开始分裂。</p><p>In 1969 and 1970, the growing impact of the Vietnam war and the pressure by congressional critics of what they interpreted as "frivolous research" contributed to the death of the "ARPA spirit" that had led to the creation of time-sharing and computer networks. The "Mansfield Amendment" in 1970 required ARPA to fund only projects with immediately obvious defense applications. Taylor was gone. The AI laboratories and the computer systems designers found funding from other agencies, but the central community that had grown up in the sixties began to fragment.</p>

      <p>到 20 世纪 60 年代末，交互式计算方法的势头已在其少数追随者中积聚了如此之多，以至于每个人都知道这种分裂可能只是暂时的情况。但没有人确定重组将在何处或如何进行。1971 年左右，艾伦开始注意到，他 ARPA 项目的老朋友中最优秀的人才出现在距离他在斯坦福人工智能实验室的办公室一英里多一点的新机构中。</p><p>The momentum of the interactive approach to computing had built up such intensity in its small following by the late 1960s that everybody knew this fragmentation could only be a temporary situation. But nobody was sure where, or how, the regrouping would take place. Around 1971, Alan began to notice that the very best minds among his old friends from ARPA projects were showing up at a new institution a little more than a mile away from his office at the Stanford AI laboratory.</p>

      <p><a href="#OEBPS/Text/1.html0">1971 年初，艾伦·凯担任施乐顾问，随后成为帕洛阿尔托研究中心</a>创始团队的全职成员。此时，随着集成电路的出现和微处理器的发明，硬件革命已将小型化提升到一个新的水平。施乐拥有设计和生产少量先进微电子硬件的设施，这让计算机设计师能够以前所未有的强大功能快速启动和运行他们的设计。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">正是在这样的环境中，真正的个人计算机才有可能从梦想进入设计阶段。艾伦·凯当时已经在考虑一种功能强大且便携性极强的特殊个人计算机，后来他将其称为“Dynabook”。</font></p><p>By the beginning of 1971, Alan Kay was a Xerox consultant, then a full-time member of the founding team at the <a href="#OEBPS/Text/1.html0">Palo Alto Research Center</a>. By this time, the hardware revolution had achieved another level of miniaturization, with the advent of integrated circuitry and the invention of the microprocessor. Xerox had the facilities to design and produce small quantities of state-of-the-art microelectronic hardware, which allowed the computer designers unheard-of power to get their designs up and running quickly. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">It was precisely the kind of environment in which a true personal computer might move from dream to design stage. Alan Kay was already thinking about a special kind of very powerful and portable personal computer that he later came to call "the Dynabook."</font></p>

      <p>从设计软件操作系统和编程工具的“软件工厂”程序员，到 Alto 原型机的硬件工程师，再到负责连接各个单元的以太网局域网团队，每个人都渴望<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">尽快拥有一台可以运行的个人计算机。1971</font>年，艾伦写下并思考了一种当时还不叫 Dynabook 但看起来非常像的东西。凯的学习研究小组，包括阿黛尔·戈德堡、丹·英格尔斯等人，开始创建 Smalltalk，这是一种编程“环境”，一旦楼下的硬件奇才们组建起一个小型的原型个人计算机网络，它就会为硬件注入计算生命。</p><p>Everybody, from the programmers in the "software factory" who designed the software operating system and programming tools, to the hardware engineers of the Alto prototype machines, to the Ethernet local-area-network team who worked to link the units, was motivated by <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">the burning desire to get a working personal computer in their own hands as soon as possible.</font> In 1971, Alan wrote and thought about something that wasn't yet called a Dynabook but looked very much like it. Kay's Learning Research Group, including Adele Goldberg, Dan Ingalls, and others, began to create Smalltalk, the programming "environment" that would breathe computational life into the hardware, once the hardware wizards downstairs cooked up a small network of prototype personal computers.</p>

      <p>预期硬件的最重要的特性之一是显示屏的视觉分辨率。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">艾伦在观察孩子们学习 LOGO 时注意到的一件事是，孩子们对计算机的要求非常高，</font>尤其是在高分辨率、色彩鲜艳、动态显示方面。他们习惯于电视上的卡通片和 70 毫米宽屏电影，而不是当时计算机显示器上模糊的图像。凯和他的同事们知道，不久的将来硬件的突破将使 Sketchpad 等图形语言的交互特性与高分辨率图像相结合成为可能。</p><p>One of the most important features of the anticipated hardware was the visual resolution of the display screen. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">One of the things Alan had noticed when watching children learn LOGO was that kids are very demanding computer users,</font> especially in terms of having a high-resolution, colorful, dynamic display. They were accustomed to cartoons on television and 70-mm wide-screen movies, not the fuzzy images then to be found on computer displays. Kay and his colleagues knew that hardware breakthroughs of the near future would make it possible to combine the interactive properties of a graphical language like Sketchpad with very high-resolution images.</p>

      <p>视频显示屏上可能的图像分辨率取决于屏幕上显示的图像元素数量。Kay 认为，最能吸引和留住大量计算机用户的注意力，并赋予用户强大的计算机控制能力所需的图像元素阈值约为一百万个点。（标准快照的分辨率相当于约四百万个点。）为 PARC 研究人员建造的 Alto 计算机——学习研究小组称之为“临时 Dynabook”——将有大约五十万个点。</p><p>The amount of image resolution possible on a video display screen depends on how many picture elements are represented on the screen. Kay felt that the threshold number of picture elements needed to most strongly attract and hold the attention of a large population of computer users, and give the users significant power to control the computer, would be around one million dots. (The resolution of a standard snapshot is the equivalent to about four million dots.) The Alto computer being constructed for PARC researchers -- which the Learning Research Group called "an interim Dynabook" -- would have around half a million dots.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Alto 实现高分辨率屏幕的技术称为“位映射”，</font>这个术语意味着每个图像元素，即显示屏上的每个光点，都与计算机内存中特定位置的一个信息位相连，从而创建了一种双向屏幕信息图。例如，如果计算机“内存映射”中的特定位被关闭，屏幕上的该位置就不会出现光点。相反，内存映射中坐标处的“开启”位将在指定的屏幕位置产生一个光点。通过软件命令打开和关闭位图的部分，可以在屏幕上创建（和更改）可识别的图形图像。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The technique by which the Alto would achieve its high-resolution screen was called "bit-mapping,"</font> a term that meant that each picture element, each dot of light on the display screen, was connected to one bit of information in a specific place in the computer's memory, thus creating a kind of two-way informational map of the screen. If, for example, a specific bit in the computer's "memory map" was turned off, there would not be a dot of light at the location on the screen. Conversely, an "on" bit at a coordinate in the memory map would produce a dot of light at the designated screen location. By turning on and off parts of the bit map through software commands, recognizable graphic images can be created (and changed) on the screen.</p>

      <p>位图技术是朝着打造个人可以轻松使用的计算机迈出的重要一步，无论用户是专家程序员还是初学者。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">直接连接到计算机内存的视觉显示器的重要性与人类在大量信息中识别非常细微的视觉模式的能力有关——毫无疑问，这是一种生存特征，早在我们的祖先爬树和在大草原上行走时就进化而来。</font></p><p>Bit-mapping was a major step toward creating a computer that an individual could use comfortably, whether the user is an expert programmer or a beginner. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The importance of a visual display that is connected directly to the computer's memory is related to the human talent for recognizing very subtle visual patterns in large fields of information -- undoubtedly a survival trait that evolved way back when our ancestors climbed trees and prowled savannas.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">然而，人类信息处理器的短期记忆非常小，这意味着所有计算机都无法在一秒内提取千位数的平方根，而人类无法做到这一点，所有计算机和人类都无法在人群中认出熟悉的面孔。通过将计算机内部过程的一部分连接到可见的符号表示，位映射使人类信息处理器最复杂的部分与机械信息处理器最复杂的部分更紧密地联系在一起。</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Human information processors have a very small short term memory, however, which means that all computers and no humans can extract the square roots of thousand-digit numbers in less than a second, no computers and all humans can recognize a familiar face in a crowd. By connecting part of the computer's internal processes to a visible symbolic representation, bit-mapping puts the most sophisticated part of the human information processor in closer contact with the most sophisticated part of the mechanical information processor.</font></p>

      <p>位图不仅仅是为计算机的内部进程创建了一个被动窗口。正如计算机可以告诉使用它的人有关其内存中的某些信息一样，用户也可以通过操纵显示器来改变计算机。如果用户使用键盘命令、光笔（如 Sketchpad）或鼠标等指点设备（如 Engelbart）改变位图屏幕上的视觉表示形式，他们也可以改变计算机的内存。屏幕是一种表示，但它也是一个控制面板——位图屏幕上的绘图不仅仅是一幅画，它还可以是一种命令，甚至是一个程序，用于控制计算机的操作。</p><p>Bit-mapping created more than a passive window on the computer's internal processes. Just as the computer could tell the human who used it certain facts about whatever it had in its memory, the user was also given the power to change the computer by manipulating the display. If users change the form of the visual representations on bit-mapped screens, using keyboard commands, lightpens (� la Sketchpad), or pointing devices like mice (� la Engelbart), they can also change the computer's memory. The screen is a representation, but it is also a control panel -- a drawing on a bit-mapped screen can be nothing more than a drawing, but it can also be a kind of command, even a program, to control the computer's operations.</p>

      <p>例如，如果您使用鼠标移动屏幕上的视频指针，触摸文件夹或发件篮的视觉表示，并且您可以从计算机内存中调用该文件夹，只需指向它即可在屏幕上显示其中的文档，或者将计算机存储的发件篮的内容发送到其他人的收件篮，那么即使这个人对计算机编程一无所知，他也能完成办公室的工作。毕竟，这正是潜在的未来市场，促使施乐管理层创建 PARC 并首先解雇他们的神童。</p><p>If, for example, you were to use a mouse to move a video pointer on the screen to touch a visual representation of a file folder or an out basket, and you could call the folder, for example, from the computer's memory and display a document from it on your screen simply by pointing to it, or send the contents of the computer-stored out basket to somebody else's in basket, then a person would be able to accomplish the kind of work done in offices, even if that person knew nothing about computer programming. Which, after all, was the potential future market that motivated Xerox management to create PARC and cut their whiz kids loose in the first place.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">创造新型计算机输入和输出设备以帮助人类模式识别与机械符号操作相结合被称为“设计人机界面”，这是</font>一门艺术和科学，必须在 20 世纪 70 年代以利克莱德和恩格尔巴特在 20 世纪 60 年代设想的人机合作形式创建，这可能在 20 世纪 80 年代开始实现。艾伦·凯的 Smalltalk 项目在 Alto 界面的发展中发挥了关键作用，因此对公司最终在办公自动化市场的目标至关重要。但<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">即使在一开始，凯就开始让孩子们参与到项目中。</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Creating new kinds of computer input and output devices to help human pattern recognition mesh with mechanical symbol manipulation is known as "designing the human interface,"</font> an art and science that had to be created in the 1970s in the kind of human-computer partnership envisioned by Licklider and Engelbart in the 1960s, which could start to happen by the 1980s. Alan Kay's Smalltalk project played a key role in the evolution of the Alto interface, and as such was integral to the eventual company goals in the office automation market. But <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">even at the beginning, Kay started bringing children into the project.</font></p>

      <p>Smalltalk 项目对 PARC 早期的影响部分是鼓舞人心的。不久之后，团队的其他成员就理解了 Alan 的愿望，他希望让孩子们参与设计他和所有其他计算机科学家都想自己使用的同一种仪器的过程。Kay 的贡献的另一个方面更加具体：绝对相信他们正在设计某种东西供人们使用。这在今天听起来可能不太具有革命性，但即使在 1971 年，大多数相信这个工具不仅仅是计算机程序员的小工具的顶级计算机科学家都在 PARC。</p><p>Part of the Smalltalk project's effect on the early days at PARC was inspirational. It wasn't long before the rest of the team understood Alan's desire to bring children into the process of designing the same instrument that he and all the other computer scientists wanted to use themselves. Another aspect of Kay's contribution was more concrete: the absolute conviction that they were designing something meant for people to use. That might not sound too revolutionary today, but even as late as 1971, most of the top-flight computer scientists who believed that this tool was going to be more than just a gadget for computer programmers were at PARC.</p>

      <p>20 世纪 70 年代初，PARC 汇集了世界上最优秀的计算机科学家、硬件工程师、物理学家、程序员……这意味着它也是一群个性鲜明、主见鲜明的人。Bob <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Taylor、Alan Kay、Butler Lampson、Bob Metcalfe 和他们的同事各自都有自己独特的个人计算方法，但他们都同意一个基本假设 — — 他们的最终产品应该像锤子、滑轮或书籍一样普遍有用。</font>秘书和企业高管有一天将能够使用相同的工具来帮助他们完成工作。建筑师和设计师将拥有建模、预测和模拟的能力。PARC 的<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">各个团队一致认为，真正的个人计算机应该可供立法者和图书管理员、教师和儿童使用。而且，通过查看屏幕上的图像并用鼠标指向它们来操控的计算机肯定比需要通过键盘输入复杂的命令才能运行的计算机用途更加广泛。</font></p><p>PARC in the early 1970s was a collection of the worlds best computer scientists, hardware engineers, physicists, programmers . . . which meant that it was also a collection of people with strong personalities and definite opinions. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Bob Taylor, Alan Kay, Butler Lampson, Bob Metcalfe, and their colleagues each had his own unique approach to creating personal computing, but they agreed on one fundamental assumption -- that their ultimate product should be as generally useful as a hammer, or pulley, or book.</font> Secretaries and business executives would one day be able to use the same tool to help them perform the work. Architects and designers would have the power of modeling, forecasting, and simulation at their fingertips. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">A true personal computer, the diverse PARC groups agreed, ought to be usable by legislators and librarians, teachers and children. And a computer that could be commanded by looking at images on a screen and pointing to them by means of a mouse was certainly a lot more widely usable than a computer that required arcane keyboard-entered commands in order to function.</font></p>

      <p>第一台 Alto 个人计算机原型于 1974 年分发给 PARC 研究人员。正如他们所预测的那样，创建一个环境，让每个研究人员在历史上第一次能够亲自使用一台功能强大的计算机，并能够与所有同事的计算机进行通信，这对他们设计更强大的计算机系统的能力产生了深远的影响。</p><p>The first Alto personal computer prototypes were distributed to PARC researchers in 1974. As they had predicted, the creation of an environment in which every researcher had, for the first time in history, personal access to a powerful computer, and the means to communicate with all of his or her colleagues' computers, had a profound effect on their ability to do their job of designing even more powerful computer systems.</p>

      <p>到 20 世纪 70 年代末，PARC 的近一千名研究人员通过配备 Altos 的以太网通信网络，开发出了更先进的硬件和软件。但外界和计算机界的许多人仍然没有意识到个人计算机的潜力。正如 PARC 校友查尔斯·西蒙尼 (Charles Simonyi) 在 1983 年（多事的十年后）指出的那样，问题在于，施乐管理层在 1973 年没有意识到 PARC 领先于一个直到 1975 年才出现的行业十多年，这无可厚非。</p><p>By the late 1970s, yet another generation of even more advanced hardware and software had been created by a network of nearly a thousand researchers at PARC equipped with Altos, communicating via Ethernet networks. But the outside world, and many people in the computer world, were still unaware of the potential of personal computers. The problem, as PARC alumnus Charles Simonyi was to point out in 1983, an eventful decade later, was that Xerox management couldn't be faulted for not realizing in 1973 that PARC was more than ten years ahead of an industry that wouldn't even exist until 1975.</p>

      <p>20 世纪 70 年代中期，地平线上出现了另一朵小云——自制电脑爱好者们正在构建自己的低功耗微型计算机——到 20 世纪 70 年代末，这一群体已成为个人计算领域内一股风潮。这些微型计算机爱好者将新的微处理器芯片组装成可操作的计算机，但他们大多不知道，早在新墨西哥州的一家小公司（如今已是传奇的 MITS 公司）生产出第一台价格实惠的 DIY 计算机——Altair 之前，帕洛阿尔托就已经在使用功能强大得多的<i>设备</i>。</p><p>Another small cloud on the horizon in the mid-1970s -- the "home-brew" computer hobbyists who were building their own low-power microcomputers -- became a gathering storm of popular interest in personal computing by the end of the 1970s. The microcomputer hobbyists, who assembled the new microprocessor chips into operational computers, were for the most part unaware of the far more powerful devices that were in use in Palo Alto years before a tiny company in New Mexico, the now-legendary MITS, produced the first affordable, do-it-yourself computer -- the <i>Altair</i>.</p>

      <p>1977 年 3 月，艾伦·凯和<a href="http://crl.ucsd.edu/~goldberg/">阿黛尔·戈德堡</a>将一份 PARC 技术报告浓缩成一篇文章，文章标题描述了 PARC 项目 Smalltalk 分支的梦想和现实：“个人动态媒体”发表在一本名为<i>《计算机》的</i>杂志上，当时计算机杂志是为专家准备的。就像之前的布什、利克莱德、泰勒和恩格尔巴特一样，凯和戈德堡谈论的不是电路或程序，而是媒体、知识和创造性的人类思维：</p><p>In March, 1977, Alan Kay and <a href="http://crl.ucsd.edu/~goldberg/">Adele Goldberg</a> condensed a PARC technical report into an article, the title of which described both the dream and the reality of the Smalltalk branch of the PARC project: "Personal Dynamic Media" was published in a magazine named <i>Computer</i>, during a time when computer magazines were for specialists. Like Bush, Licklider, Taylor and Engelbart before them, Kay and Goldberg did not talk of circuits or programs, but of media, knowledge, and creative human thought:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">在有记载的大部分历史中，人类与媒介的互动主要是非对话式的，因为纸上的标记、墙上的油漆，甚至“动态”图片和电视都不会根据观看者的意愿而改变。数学公式——可能象征着整个宇宙的本质——一旦写在纸上，就会保持静止，需要读者去扩展它的可能性。</font>

        <p><font size="-1">每条信息在某种意义上都是对某个想法的<i>模拟</i>。它可能是具象的，也可能是抽象的。媒介的本质在很大程度上取决于信息嵌入、改变和查看的方式。尽管数字计算机最初是为进行算术计算而设计的，但模拟任何描述模型细节的能力意味着，如果嵌入和查看方法足够完善，计算机（被视为一种媒介）可以成为<i>所有其他媒介。此外，这种新的“元媒介”是</i><i>主动的</i>——它可以响应查询和实验——因此信息可以让学习者参与双向对话。这种特性以前从未有过，除非通过单个教师的媒介。我们认为其影响是巨大而引人注目的。</font></p><p><font size="-1">Every message is, in one sense or another, a <i>simulation</i> of some idea. It may be representational or abstract. The essence of a medium is very much dependent on the way messages are embedded, changed, and viewed. Although digital computers were originally designed to do arithmetic computation, the ability to simulate the details of any descriptive model means that the computer, viewed as a medium in itself, can be <i>all other media</i> if the embedding and viewing methods are sufficiently well provided. Moreover, this new "metamedium" is <i>active</i> -- it can respond to queries and experiments -- so that the messages may involve the learner in a two-way conversation. This property has never been available before except through the medium of an individual teacher. We think the implications are vast and compelling.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1"><i>一种用于创造性思维的动态媒介：Dynabook</i>。想象一下，在一个大小和形状与普通笔记本相同的便携式包装中拥有自己的独立知识导航器。假设它具有足够的能力超越您的视觉和听觉，足够的容量来存储数千页的参考资料、诗歌、信件、食谱、唱片、图画、动画、乐谱、波形、动态模拟以及您想要记住和更改的任何其他内容以供日后检索。</font></p><p><font size="-1"><i>A dynamic medium for creative thought: the Dynabook</i>. Imagine having your own self-contained knowledge navigator in a portable package the size and shape of an ordinary notebook. Suppose it had enough power to outrace your senses of sight and hearing, enough capacity to store for later retrieval thousands of page-equivalents of reference materials, poems, letters, recipes, records, drawings, animations, musical scores, waveforms, dynamic simulations, and anything else you would like to remember and change.</font></p>
      学习研究小组向帕洛阿尔托附近的乔丹中学的学生介绍了他们所谓的“临时 Dynabook”。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">在键盘和显示屏成为常见电器的近十年前，这些孩子接触到了一种以前没有孩子和只有少数计算机科学家见过的设备——一台运行 Smalltalk 的 Alto 计算机。</font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">通过使用鼠标和硬件和软件提供的图形功能，这些学生能够使用 Smalltalk 来指挥计算机，就像几年前剑桥的 Papert 的学生通过“教乌龟新单词”学习用 LOGO 编程一样。

      </font></font><p>屏幕要么是“非常清晰的高分辨率黑白 CRT，要么是低分辨率的高质量彩色显示器”。还提供高保真扬声器和声音合成器、像 Engelbart 的五键键盘和类似钢琴的键盘。该系统可以存储相当于 1500 页的文本和图形，处理器能够创建、编辑、存储和检索由单词、图形图像、声音、数字或所有四种符号形式的组合组成的文档。</p><p>The screen was either a "very crisp high-resolution black-and-white CRT or a lower resolution high quality color display." High-fidelity speakers and sound synthesizers, five-key keyboards like Engelbart's, and piano-like keyboards were also available. The system could store the equivalent of 1500 pages of text and graphics, and the processor was capable of creating, editing, storing, and retrieving documents that consisted of words, graphic images, sounds, numbers, or combinations of all four symbol forms.</p>

      <p>鼠标不仅可以用来指点，还可以用来画图，“图标编辑器”（Smalltalk 的另一项创新）<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">采用了一些符号，那些年纪太小还不会识字的小孩也可以使用这些符号来编辑图形；</font>例如，小孩不用输入命令来调用图形光标，而是可以指向一个画笔图标。</p><p>The mouse could be used to draw as well as to point, and an "iconic editor" (another Smalltalk innovation) <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">used symbols that children who were too young to read could use to edit graphics;</font> e.g., instead of typing in a command to invoke a graphics cursor, a child could point to a paintbrush icon.</p>

      <p>临时的 Dynabook 可用于阅读或书写带有插图的老式书籍，但它还可以做更多的事情：“它不必被视为模拟纸质书，因为这是一种具有新属性的新媒介。可以针对特定上下文进行动态搜索。文件介质的非连续性和动态操作的使用使故事具有许多可访问的观点；例如，达雷尔的《<i>亚历山大四重奏</i>》可能是一本读者可以通过多种叙事路径追寻的书，”凯和戈德堡写道。</p><p>The interim Dynabook could be used to read or write an old-fashioned book, complete with illustrations, but it could also do much more: "It need not be treated as a simulated paper book since this is a new medium with new properties. A dynamic search may be made for a particular context. The non-sequential nature of the file medium and the use of dynamic manipulation allows a story to have many accessible points of view; Durrell's <i>Alexandria Quartet</i>, for instance, could be one book in which the reader may pursue many paths through the narrative," wrote Kay and Goldberg.</p>

      <p>当用户熟悉了绘图、编辑、查看和通信工具包后，他们就清楚地认识到了这种媒介的动态特性。Smalltalk 不仅仅是一种语言，Al​​to 系统也不仅仅是一台单人计算机。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">硬件、软件以及用户学习软件的工具共同构成了一个<i>环境</i></font>——一艘小型的象征性宇宙飞船，首次使用者将学会如何控制和驾驶它穿越个人宇宙。</p><p>The dynamic nature of the medium was made clear to the users as they became acquainted with the toolkit for drawing, editing, viewing, and communicating. Smalltalk was not just a language, and the Alto system was not just a one-person computer. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Together, the hardware, the software, and the tools for the users to learn the software, constituted an <i>environment</i></font> -- a small symbolic spaceship that the first-time user learned to control and steer through a personal universe.</p>

      <p>当乔丹中学的孩子们尝试改变字体来显示字母形式，并改变计算机的位图来创建马赛克、线条和半色调的动画图像时，用户个性化信息表达和使用的能力变得清晰起来。用户不仅能够以新的方式进行创作和编辑，而且一旦他们学会了如何使用这种媒介，他们就能够自己选择<i>如何查看</i>指尖上的信息世界。</p><p>The ability of the users to personalize their representation and use of information became clear as the children from Jordan Middle School experimented with changing typefonts for displaying letterforms, and with changing the bit-maps of the computer to create and animate cartoon images in mosaics, lines, and halftones. The users not only had the capability to create and edit in a new way, but once they learned how to use the medium they gained the ability to make their own choices about <i>how to view</i> the universe of information at their fingertips.</p>

      <p>Dynabook 的编辑功能使得显示和更改 Smalltalk 微观世界中的每个对象成为可能。可以通过指向图标和选项列表（软件术语中的“菜单”）来操作文本和图形，显示屏上的多个“窗口”使得可以同时以几种不同的方式查看文档或文档组。归档功能使得存储和检索动态文档成为可能，这些文档可以由任何可以显示且彼此相关的对象集合组成。绘图工具和绘画程序使得可以徒手输入信息以及通过键盘输入信息。</p><p>The editing capabilities of the Dynabook made it possible to display and change every object in the Smalltalk microworld. Text and graphics could be manipulated by pointing at icons and lists of choices -- "menus" in software jargon -- and multiple "windows" on the display screen made it possible to view a document or group of documents in several different ways at the same time. The filing capabilities made it possible to store and retrieve dynamic documents that could consist of any collection of objects that could be displayed and have something to do with each other. Drawing tools and painting programs made it possible to input information freehand as well as through the keyboard.</p>

      <p>Smalltalk 语言的结构、首次使用者用来学习如何使用 Dynabook 的工具以及视觉或听觉显示都被刻意设计为以相同的方式可变和移动：“动画、音乐和编程，”Kay 和 Goldberg 写道，“可以被认为是动态过程的不同<i>感官视图</i>。它们之间的结构相似性在 Smalltalk 中显而易见，它为表达这些想法提供了一个共同的框架。” Smalltalk-Dynabook 工具包包括一个名为 OPUS 的“乐谱捕捉系统”和一个名为 SHAZAM 的图形动画工具。</p><p>The structure of the Smalltalk language, the tools used by the first-time user to learn how to get around in the Dynabook, and the visual or auditory displays were deliberately designed to be mutable and movable in the same way: "Animation, music, and programming," wrote Kay and Goldberg, "can be thought of as different <i>sensory views</i> of dynamic processes. The structural similarities among them are apparent in Smalltalk, which provides a common framework for expressing those ideas." A "musical score capture system" called OPUS and a graphic animation tool called SHAZAM were part of the Smalltalk-Dynabook toolkit.</p>

      <p>1977 年，<i>《科学美国人》</i>杂志的年度主题版以“微电子”为主题。艾伦·凯为该期杂志撰写的《微电子和个人计算机》是唯一一篇直接谈论这项新技术对<i>人类</i>意义的文章。该杂志的编辑们用两句话的副标题总结了这篇文章：“微电子技术的进步速度表明，大约十年后，许多人将拥有一台笔记本电脑大小的计算机，其容量与今天的大型计算机相当。这样的系统能为他们带来什么呢？”</p><p>In 1977, <i>Scientific American</i>'s annual theme edition was dedicated to the subject of "Microelectronics." Alan Kay's contribution to the issue, "Microlectronics and the Personal Computer," was the only article that directly talked about the meaning of this new technology for <i>people</i>. The magazine's editors summed up the piece in a two-sentence subtitle: "Rates of progress in microlectronics suggest that in about a decade many people will possess a notebook-sized computer with the capacity of a large computer of today. What might such a system do for them?"</p>

      <p>Kay 指出的第一件事就是使用交互式图形工具与锻炼新的认知技能之间的联系——一种选择新方式看待世界的技能。Kay 仍然认为元媒体在未来十年内才会出现，但只有当人们充分使用它来了解它的含义时，它才会发挥出全部的力量。1977<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">年的原型赋予使用此类设备的人创造许多新观点的能力。</font></p><p>One of the first things Kay pointed out was the connection between the use of interactive graphic tools and the exercise of a new cognitive skill -- a skill at selecting new ways to view the world. The metamedium which Kay still saw to be a decade in the future would only achieve its full power when people use it enough to see what it is about. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The power that the 1977 prototypes granted to the human who used such devices was the power to create many new points of view.</font></p>

      <p>Kay 认为，这种改变微观世界视角的自由是 20 世纪 70 年代末设计和测试的新型表征工具最重要的能力之一。在描述儿童学习使用 Smalltalk 系统的方式时，Kay 还描述了这种体验的一些本质：</p><p>This freedom to change one's view of a microworld, Kay believed, was one of the most important powers of the new kinds of representational tools that were being designed and tested in the late 1970s. In describing the way children learned to use the Smalltalk system, Kay also described something of the nature of the experience:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">最初，孩子们通过用铅笔状的指针在显示屏上“画”画和画直线来与我们的计算机交互。然后，孩子们发现程序可以创建比他们手工创建的任何结构都更复杂的结构。他们了解到，一幅画有几种表现形式，其中只有最明显的一种——图像——出现在屏幕上。最重要的表现形式是存储在计算机内存中的图片的符号模型。……</font>

        <p><font size="-1">教导非专家与计算机交流的最佳方法之一是让他们探索可以操纵图像的抽象层次。</font></p><p><font size="-1">One of the best ways to teach nonexperts to communicate with computers is to have them explore the levels of abstraction at which images can be manipulated.</font></p>
      

      <p>Kay 指出，当他把孩子们用来娱乐和学习 Smalltalk 编程的工具交给一位成年艺术家时，这位艺术家开始创作各种与他习惯在纸上创作的设计类似的设计。最终，这位艺术家发现，新媒介的特性以及他越来越熟练地掌握这些特性的能力使他能够探索他用旧媒介永远无法创造的图形世界：“从使用计算机对现有媒介进行贫乏的模拟，”Kay 写道，“他已经进步到发现计算机在人类表达方面的独特特性。”</p><p>Kay noted that when he gave the same tool that the children used as both an amusement and an entrance into Smalltalk programming to an adult artist, the artist started out creating various designs similar to those he was accustomed to making on paper. Eventually the artist discovered that the properties of the new medium, and his increasing facility for commanding those properties, made it possible for him to explore graphic universes that he could never have created with his old media: "From the use of the computer for the impoverished simulation of an already existing medium," Kay wrote, "he had progressed to the discovery of the computer's unique properties for human expression."</p>

      <p>这种观点的自由只是在 Smalltalk 中以初步的方式进行探索和展示：Kay 希望随着时间的推移，许多新的隐喻和语言能够演变成他所谓的“观察者语言”：</p><p>This freedom of viewpoint was only meant to be explored and demonstrated in a preliminary way in Smalltalk: It was Kay's hope that many new metaphors and languages would evolve as time went on, into what he called "observer languages":</p>

      
        <font size="-1">在观察者语言中，活动被“观点”所取代，这些观点相互依存，形成概念。例如，狗可以被抽象地（作为动物）、分析地（作为由器官、细胞和分子组成）、实用地（作为儿童的载体）、寓言地（作为童话故事中的人类）和语境地（作为骨头给草坪施肥的方式）来看待。观察者语言现在才刚刚形成。它们及其后继者将成为 20 世纪 80 年代的交流载体。</font>
      

      <p>凯伊阐述了他的理论，认为<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">个人电脑是人类表达的新媒介的组成部分</font>，并将个人电脑的近期和未来出现与过去媒介较慢的发展周期进行了比较。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他还预测，伴随新的计算机化读写能力而来的人类社会秩序的变化将比以往媒介革命的影响更为深远。</font>读写人口的产生将是这种变化的首要原因。在这些读写人口中，或许一些富有创造力的人会向我们展示可以取得什么成就。他拒绝预测这些社会变化的具体形态，并指出先前的此类预测尝试都失败了：</p><p>Kay set forth his theories about <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">personal computers as the components of a new medium for human expression</font> , and compares the recent and future emergence of personal computers with the slower development cycles of past media. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">He also predicted that the changes in the human social order that were likely to accompany a new computerized literacy would be much more sweeping than the effects of previous media revolutions.</font> The creation of a literate population would be the first reason for such a change. Out of that literate population, perhaps a few creative individuals would show the rest of us what could be achieved. He declined to predict the specific shape of these social changes, noting the failure of previous attempts at such forecasting:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">我们可能预期，计算机素养带来的变化将与阅读和写作素养带来的变化一样深远，但对于大多数人来说，这些变化将是微妙的，并不一定朝着他们理想化期望的方向发展。例如，我们不应该仅仅因为个人计算机能够推动教育领域的新革命就预测或期望它能够推动教育领域的新革命。本世纪的每一种新通信媒介——电话、电影、广播和电视——都引发了类似的预测，但这些预测并未实现。世界上数百万未受过教育的人可以通过公共图书馆轻松获取数百年来积累的文化，但他们并没有利用这些文化。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">然而，一旦个人或社会决定教育必不可少，书籍，以及现在的个人计算机，就可以成为社会传播知识的主要载体之一。</font></font>
      

      <p>然而，未来的 Dynabook 与过去所有图书馆的区别将取决于这种媒介的动态性质。图书馆是文化宝藏的被动宝库。你必须进入其中，挖掘出自己的意义。Dynabook<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">将结合优秀视频游戏的吸引力、图书馆和博物馆的文化资源、动画手指画集和合成管弦乐队的表现力。</font>最重要的是，它会主动寻找适合当前任务的知识，并以最适合每个使用者的形式和语言进行交流。</p><p>The difference between a Dynabook of the future and all the libraries of the past, however, would depend upon the dynamic nature of this medium. A library is a passive repository of cultural treasures. You have to go in and dig out your own meanings. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">A Dynabook would combine the addictive allure of a good video game with the cultural resources of a library and a museum, with the expressive power of an animated fingerpaint set and a synthesized orchestra.</font> Most importantly, it would actively find the knowledge appropriate for the task of the moment, communicated in the form and language best suited to each individual who used it.</p>

      <p>此类设备的智能——人工智能研究的软件突破有朝一日必须与个人电脑的发展相交叉的原因——将影响它们为需要它们的人提供资源的能力。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">当机器变得足够聪明，可以与八岁的孩子交流时，问题将从如何制造一台人们可以轻松使用的计算机转变为我们如何使用这种能力。</font></p><p>The intelligence of such devices -- the reason that software breakthroughs in artificial intelligence research would someday have to intersect with the evolution of personal computers -- would influence their ability to bring resources to the person who needs them. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">When the machines grow smart enough to communicate with eight-year-olds, then the question will shift from how to build a computer that people can easily use to what we all do with that kind of power.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">如果图书馆能够找出您最感兴趣和最需要了解的内容，并向您展示如何找到您想要的内容，那会怎样？</font>如果您可以对图书馆说：“我想知道生活在哈里发国的巴格达会是什么感觉？”或“我想知道成为鲸鱼的感觉如何？”并期望图书馆向您<i>展示</i>，那会怎样？您喜欢梵高吗？模拟他家外面的田野怎么样？您愿意与路易斯·阿姆斯特朗或沃尔夫冈·莫扎特坐在一起吗？如果我们都可以看到其他人的生活并分享他们的文化，这会对世界产生什么影响？</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">What if libraries were able to find out what most interests you and what you most need to know, and showed you how to find what you wanted?</font> What if you could say to the library: "I wonder what it would be like to live in the Baghdad of the Caliphate?" or "I wonder how it feels to be a whale?" and expect the library to <i>show</i> you? Do you like Van Gogh? How about a simulation of the fields outside his house? Would you care to sit in with Louis Armstrong or Wolfgang Mozart? What would it do to the world if we could all see how everybody else lived and share in their cultures?</p>

      <p>如果即将到来的超媒体的第一个效应可能是创造一个有文化的人口，他们享有使用符号和选择如何查看信息的新自由，那么第二个效应在于这种媒体独有的力量——<font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>模拟</i></font><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">的力量。<i></i></font>模拟是<i>看到你想象的东西</i>、创造服从你命令的世界的力量。计算机可以构建即时感官表征。用户/程序员探索一个<i>反应</i>的宇宙，其中用户的力量取决于并随着人们对世界运作方式的理解而增长。</p><p>If the first effect of the coming metamedium was likely to be the creation of a literate population who shared a new freedom to use symbols and to choose how to view information, then the second effect lay in the power that would be unique to this medium -- <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">the power of <i>simulation</i>.</font> Simulation is <i>the power to see what you imagine</i>, to create worlds that obey your command. The computer can build instant sensory representations. The user/programmer explores a universe that <i>reacts</i>, in which the degree of the user's power depends upon and grows with one's understanding of the way the worlds work.</p>

      <p>模拟的力量可以激发想象力，将人们在脑海中清晰辨别的事物具体化，正是这一点让这种设备成为“幻想放大器”。虽然有几条布道可以被称为“凯的第一定律”，但他最常称之为<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">“凯的第二定律”的说法是：“只要你制造了一个幻想放大器，你就有了一个赢家。”他的理由是，玩游戏和幻想是人们在世界上生存所需的技能的隐喻。</font></p><p>The power of simulation to empower the imagination and give form to whatever can be clearly discerned in the mind's eye is what makes this kind of device a "fantasy amplifier." Although there are several homilies that are entitled to be called "Kay's First Law," the statement that he most often calls <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"Kay's Second Law" is: "Any time you build a fantasy amplifier, you have a winner." His reasoning is that game playing and fantasizing are metaphors for the kind of skill people need to get around in the world.</font></p>

      <p>“我们生活在自己创造的幻觉中，”凯喜欢这样说。但我们的幻觉是如此复杂，我们所经历的世界有太多东西似乎超出了我们的控制范围，操作手册也如此难以找到，以至于我们都倾向于被我们的家庭、社会和文化看待世界的方式所束缚。“我们不能没有幻想，”凯断言，“因为幻想是人类的一部分。幻想是一个更简单、更可控的世界。”</p><p>"We live in a hallucination of our own devising," Kay is fond of saying. But our illusion is so complex, so much of the world we experience appears to be beyond our control, and the operating manual is so difficult to find, that we all tend to get locked into the way our families, societies, and cultures see the world. "We can't exist without fantasy, Kay asserts, "because it is part of being a human. A fantasy is a simpler, more controllable world."</p>

      <p>通过练习如何控制一个更简单的世界，我们常常会弄清楚如何操作幻想之外的世界。游戏既可控制又具有挑战性。它是间接的、有目的的，并且对结果持开放态度。从这个意义上说，体育、科学和艺术都涉及间接的、有目的的幻想。这就是为什么他认为电子游戏不是一时的热潮，而是某种具有更深刻力量的东西的先兆。这也是他加入雅达利公司最有可能的原因。</p><p>And by practicing how we would control a simpler version of the world, we often figure out how to operate the world outside the fantasy. A game is both controllable and challenging. It is entered vicariously, purposefully, and with an open mind about the outcome. Sports and science and art all involve vicarious, purposeful fantasies in that sense. That's why he feels that video games were not a fad but a precursor to something with much more profound power. And that is the most likely reason why he joined Atari Corporation.</p>

      <p>模拟的力量并不一定或完全是有益的，正如当今的系统破坏者、痴迷的程序员和黑暗黑客的传奇故事所证明的那样，正如 Kay 在其《<i>科学美国人》</i>论文中所警告的那样：</p><p>The power of simulation is not necessarily or exclusively a beneficial one, as the legends of today's system-crashers, obsesses programmers, and dark-side hackers attest, and as Kay warned in his <i>Scientific American</i> paper:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">还必须考虑模拟（任何计算的核心部分）的社会影响。首先，与语言一样，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">计算机用户有强烈的动机强调模拟与经验之间的相似性，而忽略符号在模型与现实世界之间造成的巨大差异。</font>权力感和对机器反射回来的图像的自恋迷恋很常见。其他倾向是将计算机当作琐碎之物（模拟纸张、油漆和文件柜的功能）、作为一种拐杖（使用计算机来记住我们自己完全可以记住的事情）或作为一种借口（将人类的缺点归咎于计算机）。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">更严重的是，人类倾向于信任一个尚未完全理解的机构并赋予其更高的权力。考虑到当前的计算机技术水平，许多组织实际上基于计算机模型做出决策（更糟糕的是，从计算机模型中做出决策），这一事实令人深感不安</font>……</font>
      

      <p>模拟对人类感知如此有吸引力，在“现实世界”应用中如此有用，一旦个人计算机变得足够复杂和便宜，它的广泛使用是不可避免的。模拟应该<i>如何使用</i>以及<i>用于什么目的，不应该使用模拟的</i><i>伦理</i>道德才刚刚开始形成。历史事件、家长教师协会和立法机构的辩论以及伴随这种媒介引入的公众关注的增长将有助于确定模拟未来伦理的形态。凯认为，寻求专家指导的最佳地点可能是我们这些对前计算机思维方式偏见最少的人：<i></i><i></i></p><p>The <i>fact</i> of simulation is so seductive to human perception, and so potentially useful in "real world" applications, that its widespread use is inevitable, once personal computers grow sophisticated and inexpensive enough. The ethics of <i>how</i> and <i>for what purposes</i> simulations should and should not be used are only beginning to be formulated. The historical events, debates in PTAs and legislatures, and growth in public concern that will accompany the introduction of this medium will help determine the shape of the future ethics of simulation. The best place to look for expert guidance, Kay suggests, might be to those of us who are the least prejudiced by precomputer ways of thinking:</p>
    <font size="+3">儿童计算机伦理</font>

    
      
        <font size="-1"><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">那些还没有失去好奇心和乐趣的孩子帮助我们找到了一种关于计算的道德准则：</font>不要自动化你从事的工作，而要自动化材料。如果你喜欢画画，不要自动化绘画；相反，要为你的个人电脑编程，让它给你一套新的绘画。如果你喜欢演奏音乐，不要制造一架“自动钢琴”；而是要为自己编程一种新的乐器。</font>
      

      <p>我们如何看待计算机——是机器、是模仿人类能力的系统、是工具、是玩具、是竞争对手还是合作伙伴——将在决定它们未来在社会中的角色方面发挥重要作用。在文章的结尾，凯警告不要让今天的人们妄自揣测，他们不知道未来几代人会选择或不会选择用前几代人创造的工具做什么：</p><p>The way we think about computers -- as machines, as systems that mimic human capabilities, as tools, as toys, as competitors, or as partners -- will play a large part in determining their future role in society. In the conclusion of his article, Kay cautions against the presumptions of present-day minds about what the minds of future generations may or may not choose to do with the instruments past generations worked to create:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">人们普遍误解计算机是逻辑性的。直截了当是一个更好的说法。由于计算机可以包含任意描述，因此可以执行任何可以想象的规则集合，无论是否一致。此外，计算机对符号的使用，就像语言和数学中对符号的使用一样，与现实世界完全脱节，使它们能够创造出精彩的废话。尽管计算机的硬件受自然法则的制约（电子只能以某些物理定义的方式在电路中移动），但计算机可以执行的模拟范围仅受人类想象力的限制。在计算机中，可以使航天器以比光速更快的速度行驶，从而反向穿越时间。</font>

        <p><font size="-1">讨论无意义的模拟似乎是一种罪过，但前提是我们要相信我们所知道的东西是正确和完整的。历史对那些赞同这种观点的人并不仁慈。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">正是这种表面上无意义的领域必须为未来不断发展的思想保持开放。虽然个人电脑可以按照我们选择的任何方向引导，但真正的罪过是让它像机器一样运转！</font></font></p><p><font size="-1">It may seem almost sinful to discuss the simulation of nonsense, but only if we want to believe that what we know is correct and complete. History has not been kind to those who subscribe to this view. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">It is just this realm of apparent nonsense that must be kept open for the developing minds of the future. Although the personal computer can be guided in any direction we choose, the real sin would be to make it act like a machine!</font></font></p>
      

      <p>由于凯伊年轻时就进入了一个本身就很年轻的领域，因此他是信息航海家的第一批人之一。信息航海家是在先驱者创造的工具的陪伴下成长起来的，他们一直在利用这些工具为我们其他人创造媒介。他在 ARPA 和 Utah、Sail 和 PARC、Atari 和 Apple 学到的一件事是，召集一群人才并让他们独自工作可能是实现他实现梦想所需的突破的最重要因素。</p><p>Because he started out young in a field that was young itself, Kay was one of the first of the generation of infonauts, the ones who grew up with the tools created by the pioneers, and who have been using them to create a medium for the rest of us. One of the things he learned at ARPA and Utah, Sail and PARC, Atari and Apple, was that putting together a group of talents and leaving them alone might be the most important ingredient in invoking the breakthroughs he'll need to complete his dream.</p>

      <p>人们开始好奇，如今在苹果公司的凯伊下一步打算做什么。鲍勃·泰勒 (Bob Taylor) 在 1984 年表示：“我可以想象他感到很沮丧。”他指的是艾伦·凯伊多年来没有开发出像 Smalltalk 这样有形的东西。苹果公司的一名优秀程序员则用另一种方式表达：“他应该被称为一位有远见的人，因为他确实是。我喜欢和他在一起，因为他对很多事情都了如指掌。但当你第三次听到他说‘我们早在 1974 年就做到了’时，你会感到有些厌倦。”</p><p>People are beginning to wonder what Kay, now at Apple, intends to do next. "I would imagine that he feels more than a little frustrated," said Bob Taylor, in 1984, referring to the fact that Alan Kay hadn't produced anything as tangible as Smalltalk in a number of years. A hotshot programmer at Apple put it differently: "He deserves to be called a visionary, because he is. And I love to hang around him because he knows so much about so many things. But it gets a little tiring the third time you hear him say, 'We already did that back in '74.' "</p>

      <p>雅达利是艾伦·凯在公司中发挥了重要作用但未取得任何突破的第一家公司。由于雅达利团队所发生或未发生的事情，他可能了解到，作为团队的一员，尽管是一个鼓舞人心甚至有远见的成员，也并不一定意味着他适合成为一名优秀的领导者。然而，在我们探索雅达利梦想的终结之前，另一位名叫布伦达的信息航海家将带我们一窥凯和他的同伙试图实现的部分目标。</p><p>Atari was the first institution where Alan Kay played a significant role but didn't make any breakthroughs. Because of what happened -- or didn't happen -- with the Atari team, he probably learned that being a member of a team, albeit an inspirational, even visionary member, doesn't necessarily mean that he is cut out to be a good leader. Before we explore the end of the dream at Atari, however, another infonaut by the name of Brenda will give us a glimpse at part of what Kay and his cohorts attempted to accomplish.</p>

      我与艾伦·凯的初次邂逅让我结识了当时为他工作的几位员工，最终我与布伦达·劳雷尔及其同事相处的时间比与艾伦相处的时间还长。</font></font><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">布伦达和她的朋友们对令我困惑的问题感兴趣：操作未来的思维增强信息载体会是什么<i>感觉</i></font><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">？我第一次接触他们的作品是在加利福尼亚州桑尼维尔的一间戒备森严、设备齐全的房间里，那里是雅达利系统研究小组的所在地。以下简要场景摘自我对第一次观察的笔记：

      </font></font><p>布兰达开口之前，世界一片灰暗，寂静无声。<br><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">
      “给我一个四月清晨的草地，”她说，灰色被清晨的阳光所取代。红杉树枝间可见一片片蔚蓝的天空。鸟儿啁啾。小溪潺潺流淌。</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">
      “嗯……划掉红杉林，”布兰达继续说：“把草地放在悬崖上，俯瞰一个小翠绿的海湾。更绿。白浪翻滚。”</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">
      布兰达斜倚在媒体室中间。“背景音听起来不错，”她补充道：“你从哪里弄来的？” </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">
      “这些鸟是北加州海岸的本土鸟类，”一个音调优美但空灵的女声回答道：“潺潺的小溪来自声学图书馆。它在数字上与苏格兰的小溪一模一样。” </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">
      “海湾里有一个树木繁茂的小岛，”布兰达继续说，低头看着她下方瞬间出现的岛屿，片刻之前那里还只有绿水。她站在海湾悬崖顶上的草地上，俯瞰着这座新岛屿，然后又说道：“蒙特利松、一座小山、一片白色沙滩。镜头拉到海滩。我们沿着那条小路走上去。那棵榕树下有一口井。我想潜入井中，然后全身干透地爬到亚历山大图书馆里，那是图书馆被烧毁的前一天。”</font></font></p><p>The world was grey and silent before Brenda spoke.<br><br>
      "Give me an April morning on a Meadow," she said, and the gray was replaced by morning sunshine. Patches of cerulean sky were visible between the redwood branches. Birds chirped. Brooks babbled.<br><br>
      "Uhhmm . . . scratch the redwood forest," Brenda continued: "Put the meadow atop a cliff overlooking a small emerald bay. Greener. Whitecaps."<br><br>
      Brenda was reclining in the middle of the media room. "The background sounds nice," she added: "Where did you get it?"<br><br>
      "The birds are indigenous to the northern California coast," replied a well-modulated but disembodied female voice: "The babbling brook is from the acoustic library. It's digitally identical to a rill in Scotland."<br><br>
      "There's a wooded island in the bay," continued Brenda, looking down upon the island that instantly appeared below her where only green water had been a moment before. She surveyed the new island from her meadow atop the cliff above the bay, then spoke again: "Monterey pine, a small hill, a white beach. Zoom into the beach. Let's walk up that path. There's a well under that banyan tree. I want to dive in and emerge bone-dry in the Library of Alexandria, the day before it burned."</p>

      <p>认知技术前沿的几个团队一直在努力寻找图像，以帮助他们实现布什的 Memex、恩格尔巴特的 Augmentation Workshop 和凯的 Dynabook 的大众市场版本。那些试图设计这些设备的人都认为，这些机器将从今天的计算机技术发展成为可能与我们今天看到的计算机不一样的东西。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">理想情况下，我们不会看到这些假设的未来计算机，因为它们将是隐形的，内置于​​环境本身中。</font></p><p>A few groups on the leading edge of cognitive technology have been trying to find images to help them in their effort to materialize a mass-marketable version of Bush's Memex, Engelbart's Augmentation Workshop, and Kay's Dynabook. Those people who are attempting to design these devices share an assumption that such machines will evolve from today's computer technology into something that will probably not resemble the computers we see today. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Ideally, we won't see these hypothetical computers of tomorrow, because they will be invisible, built into the environment itself.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">试想一下，一台看不见摸不着的计算机，从信息上来说，它可以满足你的每一个愿望。你进入一个房间（或戴上头盔），房间（或头盔）会提供任何你能想到的、真实的或虚构的事物的多感官表征，让你要求它表征。</font>过去几十年的科幻小说作家们已经尽了自己最大的努力去推测，在这样一个具有表征能力的环境中，人们可以做些什么。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">例如，你可以在阿尔卑斯山滑雪，</font>周围是环绕式全彩三维视觉显示屏、真实的全音效、刺骨的冷空气、富含紫外线的高海拔阳光、粉雪溅到脸颊上、脚下滑雪板的感觉、被推下斜坡的感觉。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Try to imagine a computer that is nowhere to be seen, and is set up to attend to your every wish, informationally speaking. You enter a room (or put a helmet over your head), and the room (or the helmet) provides multisensory representations of anything, real or imaginary, you can think of to ask it to represent.</font> Science fiction writers of the past decades have done their share of speculating on what one might do in such a representationally capable environment. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">You could, for example, go skiing in the Alps</font> with wraparound full-color three-dimensional visual display, authentic panphonic soundtrack, biting cold air, ultraviolet-rich high-altitude sunshine, spray of powder snow on your cheeks, the feeling of skis beneath your feet, of being impelled down a slope.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">但你不应该将这种通用信息媒介的使用限制在真实的地球体验中。你可以探索邻近星系的黑洞，通过神经系统导航，成为亚瑟王宫廷中的康涅狄格州洋基人。</font>如果你想实时将感官延伸到现实世界，你可以用X射线射电望远镜观察类星体，用CAT扫描你看到的一切，乘坐气象卫星悬停在地球上空，缩小镜头，用​​电子显微镜观察肯尼亚车牌上灰尘微粒上的微生物。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">But you shouldn't have to limit your use of such a universal information medium to a real terrestrial experience. You could explore a black hole in a neighboring galaxy, navigate through tour nervous system, become a Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's court.</font> If you want to extend your senses into the real world in real time, you can look at quasars with x-ray radiotelescope vision, CAT scan everything you see, hover above the earth in a weather satellite, zoom down to take an electron microscopic look at the microbes on a dust mote on a license plate in Kenya.</p>

      <p>如果你想与一个人或整个在线网络进行交流，你可以使用所有媒体，以及额外的“对话支持工具”来增强互动。或者互动可能是私密的，仅限于你和信息环境——出于工作或娱乐的原因。</p><p>If you want to communicate with one person or an entire on-line network, you have all the media at your disposal, along with additional "dialogue support tools" to augment the interaction. Or the interaction might be private, limited to you and the informationscape -- for reasons of work or play.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">也许您想了解一些有关蓝鲸的知识。您可以查阅所有杂志、图书馆或研究数据库中的所有内容，如果您愿意，还有一位隐形图书管理员随时为您提供帮助；只需将目光集中在参考文件上，它就会填满整个屏幕。向图书管理员询问您想知道的问题，或让图书管理员向您提问。但您不必只阅读有关鲸鱼的内容。您可以听它们说话、看它们、参观它们。只需询问，您就会潜入水下，在它们中间游泳，或者乘坐直升机，在清澈的巴哈水域上空盘旋，观察它们。</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Perhaps you want to know something about blue whales. Everything written in every magazine, library, or research data base is available to you, and an invisible librarian is there you help you, if you wish; just focus your eyes on a reference file and it fills the screen. Ask the librarian questions about what you want to know, or allow it to ask you questions. But you don't have to just read about whales. You can listen to them, watch them, visit them. Just ask, and you'll be underwater, swimming among them, or in a helicopter, watching them while you hover above the crystalline Baja waters.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">这种体验并非完全是被动的。您可以</font>在模拟视频中扮演鲸鱼或路易十四（或成吉思汗，如果您喜欢的话）的角色，并决定这场遭遇的结果。调色板、文本编辑器、音乐和声音合成器、自动编程程序和动画工具将使您能够创建自己的蓝鲸或古代蒙古微观世界并在其中嬉戏。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The experience won't be strictly passive. You can act out the role of a whale or Louis XIV (or Genghis Khan, if that is your taste)</font> in a simulated video encounter and make decisions about the outcome of that encounter. Paint palettes, text editors, music and sound synthesizers, automatic programming programs, and animation tools will give you the power to create your own blue whale or ancient Mongolian microworlds and romp around in them.</p>

      <p>由于凯离开施乐时，麻省理工学院、卢卡斯影业和 Evans &amp; Sutherland 都在竞标他的职位，因此可以肯定，雅达利一定为他提供了更多。尽管凯显然希望经营一家先进的软件商店，但他知道，他的下一个软件梦想需要非常先进的硬件。“你想要硬件设计师吗？我们会帮你找硬件设计师，”你可以想象他们会这样说。雅达利为他找的都是最好的——包括英特尔传奇科学家泰德·霍夫，他是发明微处理器芯片的团队的负责人。凯组建了自己的软件研究团队。</p><p>Since MIT, Lucasfilm, and Evans &amp; Sutherland were in the bidding for Kay's services when he left Xerox, one can safely assume that Atari must have offered him something more. Although his obvious desire was to run an advanced software shop, Kay knew that his next software dream would require very advanced hardware. "You want hardware designers? We'll get you hardware designers," you can imagine them saying. Atari got him nothing but the best -- including Ted Hoff, the legendary Intel scientist who was the leader of the team that invented the microprocessor chip. Kay assembled his own software research team.</p>

      <p>布伦达·劳雷尔 (Brenda Laurel) 在雅达利系统研究集团 (Atari Systems Research Group) 的教育营销部门工作了一段时间后加入了该集团。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">我第一次见到她时，她正在参与一个研究项目，她坚称这个项目很难用语言描述。</font>她邀请我观看他们刚刚开始探索的一种特殊的头脑风暴会议。</p><p>Brenda Laurel joined Atari Systems Research Group after a stint in their educational marketing division. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">When I first met her, she was involved in a research project that she insisted defied verbal description.</font> She invited me to watch a special kind of brainstorming session they were just beginning to explore.</p>

      <p>雅达利研究大楼位于典型的桑尼维尔平原工业园区，配备了常见的高科技高安全设施——24 小时保安、彩色名牌、制服护卫。在这里，我和布伦达以及她的几位同事一起参加了一项集体想象练习，与他们所谓的媒体室项目有关。</p><p>The Atari research building was in a typical Sunnyvale flatland industrial park, with the usual high-tech high-security trappings -- twenty-four-hour guards, laminated color-coded nametags, uniformed escorts. It was here that I joined Brenda and several of her colleagues in a group-imagination exercise connected with what they called a media-room project.</p>

      <p>布伦达帮我签到，带我穿过灰色墙壁、灰色地毯的走廊，然后带我来到一个大房间，除了几张工业现代风格的沙发和椅子、一套录像机和两块白板外，房间里空无一物。房间里有项目负责人埃里克·胡尔廷、红发、说话轻声细语的年轻女子苏珊、安静、心不在焉的预科生斯科特、机器人专家唐和罗恩·迪克森、有点怀疑论的留着胡子的黑客克雷格、杰夫、汤姆、布伦达和正在录制活动的雷切尔。</p><p>Brenda signed me in, walked me through the gray-walled, gray-carpeted corridors, and brought me to a large room, bare except for a few industrial-modern couches and chairs, a videotape setup, and two whiteboards. Inside the room were Eric Hulteen, the project leader; Susan, a red-haired, soft-spoken young woman; Scott, a quiet, spaced-out preppie type; Don and Ron Dixon, the Robotic experts; Craig, a somewhat skeptical, bearded hacker; Jeff, Tom, Brenda, and Rachel, who was videotaping the event.</p>

      <p>蕾切尔个子矮，留着平头，穿着一件背心 T 恤，紫色宽松哈伦裤，没穿鞋。唐和罗恩是双胞胎。这群人中有几个人年龄最小，只有二十三四岁，最年长的不超过三十五岁。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">牛仔裤和凉鞋是主要服装。没有人打领带。没有人长痤疮或有言语障碍。没有人戴塑料笔筒。</font></p><p>Rachel was short, had a crewcut, wore a tank-top tee shirt, purple blousy harem pants, and no shoes. Don and Ron were twins. A few in the group could be as young as twenty-three or twenty-four, the oldest was no older than thirty-five. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Jeans and sandals were the dominant costume. Nobody wore a tie. Nobody had acne or a speech impediment. Nobody wore a plastic penholder.</font></p>

      <p>正如 Brenda 和 Eric（该项目负责人）向我解释的那样，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">媒体室是一个人们可以在里面走动的信息终端——在这里，你可以直接与机器进行交流，而无需键盘等显式输入设备。</font>房间本身是为了监控人类的交流输出而设置的。这意味着目前处于实验或开发阶段的所有硬件和软件都将协同工作，完成一个好的媒体室所做的事情——而不会让使用它的人了解其操作的细节。</p><p>As it was explained to me by Brenda and by Eric, whose project it was, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">a media room is an information terminal that a person can walk around inside -- a place where you can communicate directly with the machine without explicit input devices like keyboards.</font> The room itself is set up to monitor human communication output. This presumes that all the hardware and software that are now in experimental or developmental stages will be working together to do what a good media room does -- without bothering the person who uses it with details of its operations.</p>

      <p>埃里克从麻省理工学院的建筑机器小组来到雅达利，这是一个由艾伦·凯的老朋友兼雅达利顾问<a href="http://nicholas.www.media.mit.edu/people/nicholas/">尼克·尼葛洛庞帝</a>领导的创新小组。麻省理工学院小组提出的“空间数据管理”理念是对如何驾驭计算机开辟的巨大新信息领域的问题的回应，采用<i>信息空间</i>的隐喻，用户可以或多或少地“飞”过。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">软件设计中的主流隐喻是通过众所周知的“文件柜”隐喻来查看大量信息，其中每条信息都被视为用户通过传统归档方法找到的“文件夹”的一部分。但是，如果信息集合可以直观地显示并按空间排列，那么用户就会产生“浏览”它的错觉，那会怎样呢？</font></p><p>Eric came to Atari from MIT's Architecture Machine Group, an innovative group led by Alan Kay's old friend and Atari consultant <a href="http://nicholas.www.media.mit.edu/people/nicholas/">Nick Negroponte</a>. The idea of "spatial data management" that came from the MIT group was a response to the problem of finding a way to navigate the huge new informational realms opened by computers, by adopting the metaphor of <i>information space</i> that the user can more or less "fly" through. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The dominant metaphor in software design viewed large collections of information through the well-known "file-cabinet" metaphor, in which each piece of information is regarded as part of a "file folder" that the user locates through traditional filing methods. But what if the collection of information could be displayed visually and arranged spatially, so the user could have the illusion of "navigating" through it?</font></p>

      <p>也许这个比喻最著名的例子是尼葛洛庞帝团队制作的“阿斯彭地图”。要使用这张地图，你需要坐在视频屏幕前，触摸屏幕，然后沿着科罗拉多州阿斯彭的街道和房屋的照片导航。</p><p>Perhaps the most well-known demonstration of this metaphor was the "Aspen Map" created by Negroponte's group. To use this map, you sit in front of a video screen and touch the screen to steer your way down a photographic representation of the streets and houses of Aspen, Colorado.</p>

      <p>计算机控制的视频磁盘将视频转向控制与阿斯彭的大量照片集连接起来。计算机将您的位置和命令转换为正确的照片序列。如果您决定向左看，屏幕将显示位于真实城市中此位置左侧的街道和房屋。如果您决定停下来仔细观察其中一栋有特殊标记的房屋，甚至打开门向内看，您都可以这样做。</p><p>A computer-directed videodisk connects the video steering controls to a very large collection of photographs of Aspen. The computer translates your position and your commands into the correct sequence of photographs. If you decide to look to the left, the screen shows the streets and houses that are located to the left of this position in the real city. If you decide to stop and take a closer look at one of the houses that are specially marked, or even open the door and look inside, you can do so.</p>

      <p>城市街道的这种简单分支结构仅代表了最基本的信息库，这种信息库可以用空间来表示。这个想法最重要的方面与道路地图无关——尽管这显然是学习如何在从未见过的城市中出行的好方法。重点是，一些信息领域可以围绕空间隐喻进行组织，从而创建一个连贯的环境路径，每个用户都可以通过遵循自己的特定路径在其中移动。对于试图找出汽车发动机或核潜艇管道系统问题的人来说，参考资料也可以很容易地以这种方式映射出来。</p><p>The kind of simple branching structure of a city's streets represents only the most basic kind of information base that can be represented spatially. The most important aspect of this idea doesn't have to do with road maps -- although this is obviously a good way to learn how to get around in a town you've never seen before. The important point is that some information domains can be organized around a spatial metaphor, creating a coherent environment path that each user can move around in by following his own particular path. A reference work for someone trying to find the problem in an automobile engine or the plumbing system of a nuclear submarine could just as easily be mapped in such a way.</p>

      <p>无论是来自麻省理工学院、卡内基梅隆大学还是其他视频游戏制造商，凯的雅达利团队中的每个人都代表了机器人技术、全息技术、视频光盘技术、人工智能、认知心理学和软件设计等领域最优秀的年轻人才。每个人都希望，当真正棘手的部分——软件设计、构建和调试——即将完成时，媒体室所需的硬件组件将会面世。</p><p>Whether they came from MIT, Carnagie-Mellon, or another video game manufacturer, every person in Kay's Atari group represented the cream of the crop of the best young minds in fields ranging from robotics to holography to videodisk technology to artificial intelligence to cognitive psychology to software design. The necessary hardware components of the media room will become available, everyone hopes, by the time the really tricky part -- the software design, construction, and debugging -- is on its way to completion.</p>

      <p>身处全尺寸媒体室的人将拥有某种 360 度视觉显示——高分辨率视频或全息图像——由计算机生成并存档。图像可以从库中检索（并添加到库中），也可以由人或计算机构建。将有一个涵盖超低频和超高频的全声音响系统。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">但最重要的元素不是感官显示，它涉及简单但目前昂贵的技术，而是软件——房间的设计方式是“知道”要做什么。</font></p><p>The person inside a full-scale media room will have 360-degree visual displays of some sort -- high-resolution video or holographic images -- computer-generated and archived. Images can be retrieved from a library (and added to the library), or they can be constructed by the person or by the computer. There will be a total-sound audio system ranging into ultralow and ultrahigh frequencies. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">But the most important element is not in the sensory displays, which involve straightforward if now-expensive technology, but in the software -- in the way the room is designed to "know" what to do.</font></p>

      <p>如果媒体室要成为通用媒介，那么房间本身必须能够看到和听到里面的人，并且“理解”它所看到和听到的内容，以便执行人的命令。理想情况下，它应该能够充分了解与之打交道的人，以便<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">根据对个人偏好和过去表现的了解，</font><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">积极<i>引导</i></font>幻想或信息搜索。地板内置的生物电子传感器将跟踪用户的情绪。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">房间唯一不能<i>做</i>的事情就是读心术。</font></p><p>If the media room is to be the universal medium, the room itself must be able to see and hear the person inside, and "understand" what it sees and hears well enough to carry out the person's commands. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Ideally, it should understand the person it is dealing with well enough to actively <i>guide</i> the fantasy or the information search, based on its knowledge of personal preferences and past performance.</font> Bioelectronic sensors built into the floors will keep track of the user's mood. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The only thing the room is presumed <i>not</i> to do is read minds.</font></p>

      <p><i>描述媒体室的一种方式是“没有界面的计算机”或“全</i>是界面的计算机”。当计算机界面消失时，您不是在机器的控制面板前，而是在北极冰层上行走，或飞往哈莱姆，或在一间发霉的旧房间里翻阅一本书。人们如何想象一种尚不存在的技术的能力？<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">您如何处理一台看不见的计算机？</font>如果您不必担心如何告诉它做什么，并且它的计算机表示能力太大而不必担心，那么问题<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">就从工具转移到任务：“好吧，现在我可以去任何地方，包括不存在的地方，我想去哪里？”</font>布伦达、埃里克和他们的同事想知道人们可能会采用什么样的新沟通方式来应对这样的系统。最重要的是，他们想知道使用这样的系统会是什么<i>感觉。</i></p><p>One of the ways to describe a media room is "a computer with no interface," or "a computer that is <i>all</i> interface." When the computer interface disappears, you are not at the control panel of a machine, but walking over the Arctic ice, or flying to Harlem, or looking through a book in a musty old room. How does one envision the capabilities of a technology that doesn't exist yet? <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">How do you deal with an invisible computer?</font> If you don't have to worry about how to tell it what to do, and if its computer-representation capabilities are too large to worry about, the <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">question shifts from the tool to the task: "Okay, now that I can go anywhere, including places that don't exist, where do I want to go?"</font> Brenda, Eric, and their colleagues wanted to know what new communication styles people might adopt in response to such a system. Most of all, they wanted to know how it would <i>feel</i> to use such a system.</p>

      <p>那天晚上，我看到布兰达和她的同事在桑尼维尔的房间里幻想，布兰达的想法是利用演员创造想象空间的相同技巧来规划未来此类技术的用途：“通过即兴表演可以发生神奇的事情，”她告诉小组，“因为它可以诱使你透露出前语言的想法。我们每个人在这方面都具有实时获得灵感的能力。”</p><p>The night I watched her and her colleagues fantasize in that room in Sunnyvale, Brenda's idea was to plan the uses of a future technology of this sort by using the same kinds of tricks that actors use to create imaginary spaces: "Magical kinds of things can happen through improvisation," she told the group, "because it can trick you into revealing preverbal ideas. What we each bring to this is our capacity to have inspirations in real time."</p>

      <p>第一次即兴表演是热身练习。布伦达参观亚历山大图书馆之后，斯科特参观了一面超级镜子，镜子向他展示了他在红外线下的样子，并以十六种颜色实时扫描了他的大脑代谢情况。他观察着自己思维过程的颜色，就像观察着自己思维过程的颜色一样。</p><p>The first improvisations were warm-up exercises. Brenda's trip to the Library of Alexandria was followed by Scott's visit to a hypermirror that showed him what he looked like in the infrared and gave him a real-time scan of his brain metabolism in sixteen colors. He watched the colors of his thought processes as he watched the colors of his thought processes.</p>

      <p>然后，小组决定让埃里克扮演使用该系统的人，而其他人则即兴扮演媒体室的组成部分——输入用户的视觉、移动性、听觉、情绪和思想。在第一次尝试中，每个人都热情高涨地扮演自己的角色，埃里克身边挤满了模仿他、给他建议、扮鬼脸的人。他花了很多时间试图弄清楚谁做了什么。这就像二十个问题和猜谜游戏的结合，但它揭示了即使是技术娴熟的计算机用户在面对一个不能自我解释而只是<i>行动的</i>系统时也会感到困惑。</p><p>Then the group decided to make Eric play the role of the person using the system, while everyone else improvised roles as the components of the media room -- input to the user's vision, mobility, hearing, emotions, thoughts. In the first try, everyone got into their role with such enthusiasm that Eric was literally swarming with people mimicking him, giving him advice, grimacing. He spent his time rather defensively trying to figure who did what. It was like a combination of twenty questions and charades, but it revealed something about the bewilderment of even a technically sophisticated computer user when faced with a system that does not explain itself but simply <i>acts</i>.</p>

      <p>在下一个实验中，苏珊作为该系统的中间人，决定尝试控制各个元素，并发现<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">通过添加“帮助代理”，不同组件的所有角色都可以彻底改变。</font>帮助代理通过说“向她询问某个地方”或“问他——他知道要寻找什么”之类的话来引导用户。这个想法是创建一种“信息管家”，它可以同时观察用户和信息系统，记录个人的偏好、优势和劣势，并积极干预以帮助用户找到或做用户想要找到或做的事情。</p><p>In the next experiment, Susan, acting as the person in the middle of such a system, decided to try to take control of the elements, and discovered that <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">all the roles of the different components could be changed radically by adding a "help agent."</font> The help agent oriented the user by saying things like "ask her about a place," or "ask him -- he knows what to look for." The idea was to create a kind of "informational butler" that would observe both the user and the information system, keep a record of that individual's preferences, strengths, and weaknesses, and actively intervene to help the user find or do what the user wanted to find or do.</p>

      <p>第二天，几名团队成员前往南加州，看看一所著名大学的认知科学系能为他们提供什么关于设计人类可以使用的机器的建议。大约一周后，布伦达和我谈论了她从认知科学家那里学到的东西，以及即兴表演练习。</p><p>The next day, several of the crew were going to Southern California, to see what a prominent university cognitive science department could tell them about designing machines that people can use. About a week later, Brenda and I talked about what she had learned from the cognitive scientists, and the improvisation exercise.</p>

      <p>“认知科学人员正在研究人机交互。当讨论的主题是如何教秘书使用文件管理系统时，雇佣的黑客自然而然地参与其中。员工会议上的一名程序员总结了这个问题，问道：‘我们如何让秘书明白斜线单引号 DEL 会删除文件？’这就是他对人机界面的理解——这是一个如何让人类适应程序员内置在机器中的深奥通信协议的问题。”</p><p>"The cognitive science people are looking at human-machine interactions. Naturally, the hired hackers got into the act when the subject of the discussion was how to teach secretaries to use a file management system. One of the programmers at the staff meeting summarized the problem by asking, 'how do we get a secretary to understand that slash-single quote-DEL will delete a file?' That was his understanding of the human interface -- a matter of figuring out how to adapt a human to the esoteric communication protocol some programmer built into a machine."</p>

      <p>电脑游戏中让用户走出游戏世界的那一部分，它并不能帮助用户参与游戏的乐趣，而只是充当<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">与程序对话的工具——这就是距离的作用所在。当程序员告诉秘书斜线单引号 DEL 表示“删除这个”时，她就是这样做的。她不想让电脑删除它；她只是想删除它。</font></p><p>That part of a computer game that makes the user step outside the game world, that doesn't help the user to participate in the pleasure of the game, but acts as <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">a tool for talking to the program -- that's where distance comes in. That's what happens to the secretary when the programmer tells her that slash-single quote-DEL means "erase this." She doesn't want to ask the computer to erase it; she simply wants to erase it.</font></p>

      <p>布伦达的意思听起来很奇怪，与我所学的一切背道而驰，我花了好一会儿才明白：本质上，她说，当谈到计算机软件时，人类将人工制品视为工具的习惯<i>可能</i>会成为阻碍。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">好的工具应该从人们的意识中消失。</font>你不会试图说服锤子敲钉子——<i>你会</i>在锤子的帮助下敲钉子。但目前构成的计算机软件迫使我们学习晦涩难懂的语言，这样我们就可以与工具交谈，而不是继续完成任务。</p><p>What Brenda was getting at seemed so strange and so counter to everything I had been taught that it took a while for it to sink in: In essence, she was saying that when it comes to computer software, the human habit of looking at artifacts as <i>tools</i> can get in the way. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Good tools ought to disappear from one's consciousness.</font> You don't try to persuade a hammer to pound a nail -- <i>you</i> pound the nail, with the help of a hammer. But computer software, as presently constituted, forces us to learn arcane languages so we can talk to our tools instead of getting on with the task.</p>

      <p>“当工具隐喻应用于包括人类操作员在内的更大系统层面时，它就会成为障碍，”Brenda 解释道。即使程序员为您提供了一个以工具方式运行的文件管理系统，但人类为了使用该工具而被迫采取的奇怪行动方式，在人类需要执行的操作与工具的功能之间造成了不必要的距离。</p><p>"The tool metaphor gets in the way when it is applied at the level of the larger system that includes the human operator," Brenda explained. Even though your programmer gives you a file management system that is functional in a tool-like way, the weird way the human is forced to act in order to use the tool creates an unnecessary distance between the action the human is required to perform and the tool's function.</p>

      <p>“然而，我们还知道，计算机还有<i>另外</i>一些功能，它们与工具完全不同。例如，游戏和艺术创作。那么，在这种情况下，计算机能做什么呢？我的答案是，它的功能是表现<i>事物</i>。在艺术或游戏的情况下，这意味着功能至少与结果相同，因为在艺术或游戏中，表现至少是结果的一部分。”</p><p>"We also know, however, that there is <i>another</i> set of computer capabilities that aren't at all tool-like. Games and creating art, for example. So what is it that a computer does, in that case? My answer is that its function is to <i>represent</i> things. Which, in the case of art or games, means that the function is at least the same as the outcome, because in art or games, representation is at least part of the outcome."</p>

      <p>孩子们玩电子游戏并不是因为这是练习手眼协调能力的好方法，也不是为了玩游戏的纯粹乐趣而玩其他任何游戏。另一方面，没有人会因为享受使用程序的乐趣而使用文字处理程序；他们使用文字处理器是因为他们想写点东西。对于文字处理器来说，结果是最重要的。在<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">电子游戏中，用户/玩家与游戏所代表的世界之间没有分离。在文字处理器中，软件的命令语言在用户和任务之间创造了距离。</font></p><p>Kids don't play video games by the hour because it is a good way to practice hand-eye coordination, or for any other reason besides the sheer pleasure of playing. On the other hand, nobody uses a word processing program out of sheer enjoyment of using the program; they use a word processor because they want to write something. In the case of the word processor, the outcome is most important. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">In the video game, there is no separation from the user/player and the world represented in the game. In the word processor, the command language of the software creates a distance between the user and the task.</font></p>

      <p>“我们研究的一个策略是找出如何消除使我们保持距离的部分。”布伦达解释道。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">“我想直接把手伸过屏幕，做我想做的事，”</font>她补充道，带着一种自从恩格尔巴特眼神茫然，开始谈论人类可以用真正的增强系统做什么以来我从未见过的热情。我不想输入一堆命令，”布伦达坚持说。 “<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">如果我必须以一种不同于我通常说话的方式说出一堆命令，</font><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">我可能甚至不想<i>说出一堆命令。我想要</i><i>第一人称</i>互动。</font>很好。但首先我必须消除我和结果之间的所有这些东西。</p><p>"One strategy in our research is to find out how to eliminate the part that keeps us distanced." Brenda explained. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"I want to reach my hands right through the screen and do what I want to do,"</font> she added, with the kind of passionate conviction I hadn't encountered since Engelbart got that faraway look in his eyes and started talking about what humankind could do with a true augmentation system. I don't want to enter a bunch of commands," Brenda insisted. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"I might not even want to <i>speak</i> a bunch of commands, if I have to speak them in a way that is different from the way I normally talk. I want <i>first-person</i> interaction.</font> Great. But first I have to do away with all this stuff between me and the outcome.</p>

      <p>“什么隐喻<i>还没有</i>被使用过？也许界面就是障碍。我认为这不仅仅是一个技术问题。如果整个界面概念都基于不完整的隐喻，那么你就不能指望通过构建更好的界面来解决问题。使用一个在仔细推敲后可能会失效的真正艺术隐喻，我喜欢将计算机视为一个制作魔法门户的系统。就像<i>《绿野仙踪》</i>中桃乐丝打开门的那一刻，一切都从黑白变成了彩色。<i>这</i>就是我想要发生的事情——在感知上、认知上、情感上。门户对我来说是一个过渡的隐喻。我们需要更丰富的东西。我正在寻找能够契合并重新解释界面概念的东西。</p><p>"What metaphors <i>haven't</i> been used? Maybe the interface is the barrier. I think that it is more than a technological question. You can't expect to solve a problem by building a better interface if the whole idea of interface is based on an incomplete metaphor. To use a real artsy metaphor that will probably break down under scrutiny, I like to look at the computer as a system for making magic portals. Like that moment in <i>The Wizard of Oz</i> when Dorothy opens the door and everything changes from black and white to color. <i>That</i> is what I want to happen -- perceptually, cognitively, emotionally. The portal is an interim metaphor to me. We need something richer. I'm looking for something that will click into place and re-explain the idea of the interface.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">“我想创造一个我可以穿越的幻想世界，”</font>布伦达解释道。“这就是冒险游戏试图实现的目标。早在普通人可以使用计算机之前，大型计算机的黑客就迷上了冒险游戏。现在，你可以在家用计算机上玩冒险游戏。当你尝试构建第一<i>人称</i>冒险游戏时会发生什么？</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"I want to make a fantasy that I can walk through,"</font> Brenda explained. "That is what an adventure game tries to do. Long before computers were available to regular folks, hackers on large mainframe computers were hooked on adventure games. Now there are adventure games that you can play on your home computer. What happens when you try to build a <i>first-person</i> adventure game?</p>

      <p>“我在这个游戏中走动时要做的第一件事就是<i>看</i>它。也许屏幕上有一些图形。也许屏幕就在我周围。也许有一些文字可以阅读，或者有音轨可以读给我听。所有这些都是重要的技术方面，但它们与我关心的无关。屏幕和扬声器所做的就是建立一个环境。然而，一旦我环顾环境，我就想与它互动。</p><p>"The first thing I do in this game I want to walk around in is to <i>look</i> at it. Maybe there are some graphics on the screen. Perhaps the screen is all around me. Maybe there is some text to read, or a sound track that reads it to me. All of these are important technical aspects, but they are peripheral to my concern. All the screen and speakers do is to establish an environment. Once I look around the environment, however, I want to interact with it.</p>

      <p>“假设这个幻想环境是第一流科幻小说家发明的。假设这是我为星际联邦探索的一颗行星。我开始在这个世界里行走。在目前的界面艺术水平下，如果我想向北移动并翻开一块石头，我会告诉计算机，‘向北移动。翻开石头。’<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">请注意，我必须<i>告诉计算机</i>。我刚刚走出了幻想。当你走出幻想时，你就毁掉了幻想。</font></p><p>"Let's say that the environment of this fantasy is something that a science fiction writer of the first caliber invented. Say it's a planet that I'm exploring for the United Federation of Planets. I start walking through this world. Today, with the state of the interface art as it is, if I want to move to the north and turn over a stone, I'd tell the computer, 'Move north. Turn stone.' <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Note that I have to <i>tell the computer</i>. I've just stepped out of the fantasy. And you destroy a fantasy when you step out of it.</font></p>

      <p>“什么样的系统能让我简单地向北移动并捡起那块该死的石头？我认为这不仅仅是一个让环境栩栩如生的问题。这不仅仅是一个更高级的投影仪需要解决的技术问题。这是一个世界在构建时如何建立的问题。作者如何建立人们与之联系的方式。</p><p>"What kind of system enables me to simple move north and pick up the damn stone? I don't think it's just a question of making the environment lifelike. It isn't just a technical question for a fancier projector to solve. It's a question of how the world is established when it is constructed. How the author established the way in which people can relate to it.</p>

      <p>“也许我可以环游地球，直到找到向导。还记得媒体室即兴表演中的‘帮助代理’吗？这种对环游世界的描述听起来很像戏剧即兴表演。你走上舞台，导演说，‘好吧，这是一个新星球。你扮演一个探险家。出发。’十有八九，这样的事情会逐渐消失，但如果你幸运的话，你会发现这个角色的一些有用的东西。你很少会回头说，“这是一个精彩的故事。”</p><p>"Maybe I can look around the planet until I find a guide. Remember the 'help agent' in the media room improvisation? This description of walking around the world sounds a lot like a theatrical improvisation. You walk up to the stage, and the director says, 'Okay, this is a new planet. You play an explorer. Go.' Nine times out of ten, something like that dwindles away, but if you are lucky you discover something useful about the character. Very rarely do you look back and say, "That was a wonderful story.'"</p>

      <p>根据布伦达的理论，即便是出色的即兴表演，也很难让人记住，因为演员被迫用部分思维去思考自己是剧作家。为了达到出色的戏剧效果，演员必须同时思考自己的角色和操纵情节线，以便让一切都以一种有趣的方式呈现。除非你是表演天才，否则你必须牺牲部分表演能力来思考剧本。如果你要兼顾表演工作，你就无法出色地创作戏剧。</p><p>According to Brenda's theory, the reason is rarely memorable, even in a good improvisation, is because the actors are forced to use part of their mind to think about being playwrights. To achieve an excellent dramatic outcome the actor has to think about his character and manipulate the plot line at the same time, so that it all comes out in an interesting way. Unless you are an acting genius, you have to trade part of your acting power in order to think about the play. And you can't do a great job of crafting a drama if you have the acting job to juggle.</p>

      <p>“我认为计算机可以在这个方面为我们提供帮助，”布伦达坚持说：<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">“我仍然认为一个答案是将剧作家的智慧融入第一人称幻想创作系统中。</font></p><p>"This is where I think the computer can assist us," Brenda insists: <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"I still think one answer is to put the smarts of the playwright into a first-person fantasy-creating system.</font></p>

      <p>“它必须融入虚构世界的构建方式中。在所有图形、语音识别和语音合成之上，有一个专家系统，它能够利用关于可能发生的情况的足够大的知识库和一套筛选知识库的规则<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">，对潜在的戏剧性情况做出明智的决定。”</font></p><p>"It has to be built into the way the imaginary world is constructed. Sitting on top of all your graphics and voice recognition and speech synthesis is an <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">expert system that can make informed decisions about the potential of dramatic situations,</font> using a large enough base of knowledge about the possible situations that can arise and a set of rules for sifting through the knowledge base."</p>

      <p>布伦达所说的“专家系统”虽然不那么神奇，但功能仍然强大，现在确实存在——下一章我们将看看另一位信息航海家对这些“知识传递”程序的潜力的看法。布伦达描述的假设变体将能够从经验中学习——使用它的个人或曾经使用过它的每个人的经验。布伦达认为，这样的程序可以接近戏剧评论家所做的那种分析。“也许我们可以把亚里士多德的好戏剧规则放在系统中。”</p><p>Less fantastic, but nonetheless powerful versions of the "expert system" Brenda was talking about do exist now -- and in the next chapter we'll take a look at what another infonaut thinks about the potential of these "knowledge-transferring" programs. The hypothetical variation Brenda was describing would be able to learn form experience -- experience with the individual who is using it or with everybody who has ever used it. Brenda thinks that such a program could approach the kind of analysis that a drama critic does. "Maybe we can put Aristotle's rules for good drama in the system to start."</p>

      <p>目前，已有专家系统可以帮助医生诊断疾病。这些系统能够将人类医生改编的诊断规则应用于大量已知症状的数据（知识库）。用戏剧代替疾病，用戏剧元素（如普遍性和因果关系）代替症状，我们幻想中的自动戏剧专家将能够挑选出玩家所执行动作最具戏剧性的反应和后果，并将它们重新编织到幻想中。这个想法似乎远远领先于当今的娱乐软件，就像艾伦·凯的 Dynabook 领先于 20 世纪 60 年代的计算机硬件一样。</p><p>Right now, there are expert systems in existence that can help doctors to diagnose diseases. Those systems are able to apply diagnostic rules adapted from human doctors to a large collection of data, a knowledge base, regarding known symptoms. Substitute drama for disease, and the elements of drama (like universality and causality) for symptoms, and the automatic drama expert in our fantasy will be able to pick out the most dramatic responses and consequences for actions that the player performs, and weave them back into the fantasy. It's an idea that seems to be as far ahead of today's entertainment software as Alan Kay's Dynabook was ahead of the computer hardware of the 1960s.</p>

      <p>假设你可以模拟一座中世纪城堡，让观众以第一人称视角 360 度地观看戏剧，这样每次你以霍雷肖、哈姆雷特或奥菲莉亚的身份进入<i>哈姆雷特的</i>世界时，你都会对结果做出不同的选择。人工智能研究告诉我们，如果你能以某种方式构建世界的表征，使其特征被表述为朝某些方向发展的趋势，你就不必专门将所有可能发生的事件存储在一个巨大的数据库中。例如，当你捡起一块石头时，你很可能会在它下面发现爬行的东西。</p><p>Assume that you can simulate a medieval castle and give an audience member a 360 degree, first-person role in the dramatic action, so that every time you step into the <i>Hamlet</i> world as Horatio or Hamlet or Ophelia, you make different choices about the outcome. Artificial intelligence research tells us that you don't have to specifically store all the possible events that could occur in a giant data base if you can structure the representation of the world in such a way that its characteristics are formulated as tendencies to go in certain directions. When you pick up a stone, for example, you are likely to find crawly things under it.</p>

      <p>抛开关于构建这样一个系统的可行性的技术争论，布兰达最关心的是，遇到她所描述的系统会对我们的情绪和认知产生什么影响：体验这样的世界感觉如何？穿过它的门户会如何改变我的感知？我如何找出边界在哪里？我能与这个世界进行什么样的交易？</p><p>Leaving aside the technical arguments about the feasibility of constructing such a system, Brenda is most concerned about what effects the experience of encountering such a system like the one she described might have upon our emotions as well as our cognitions: How does it feel to experience a world like that? How does it change my perception to walk through its portals? How do I find out where the edges are? What kind of transactions can I have with this world?"</p>

      <p>布伦达所描述的体验是人机界面的体验——思维与机器的交汇。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">界面硬件和软件是计算机人员所说的系统的“前端”。后端是系统所需的智能，以便最终结果令人愉悦。</font>现在，你可以在冒险游戏中四处游荡，收集宝藏，杀死怪物，以胜利或被杀结束。没有展开戏剧的感觉。为了让冒险游戏的前端传达出那种直接的第一人称戏剧感，它必须基于非常复杂的后端。</p><p>The experience Brenda described is the experience at the human interface -- where the mind and machine meet. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The interface hardware and software are what computer people call the "front end" of the system. The back end is what the system needs in the way of smarts so that outcomes end up being dramatically pleasurable.</font> Right now, you can wander around in an adventure game and gather treasure and kill monsters and finish by winning or being killed. There isn't a sense of unfolding drama. In order for the front end of an adventure game to convey that sense of direct, first-person drama, it would have to be based on a very sophisticated back end.</p>

      <p>“你可以使用现有技术根据你的决定来分支场景，但除非以最机械的方式，否则这不会产生戏剧性的结果。但你可以采用相同的世界、相同的角色和相同的元素，并添加这种戏剧感，然后制作出更像亲身体验戏剧的东西。</p><p>"You use existing technology to make scenes branch according to your decisions, but that doesn't converge on a dramatic outcome, except in the most mechanical way. But you could take the same world with the same characters and the same elements and add this sense of drama, and come out with something that would be more like experiencing a drama at first hand.</p>

      <p>“我所描述的系统必须能够通过记住我关注过哪些事物来找出我想要的东西。该系统必须对我有足够好的模型，并记住我过去的行为，以便对我未来可能的行为做出正确的猜测。</p><p>"The kind of system I'm describing has to be able to find out what I want by remembering what kinds of things I have paid attention to. The system has to have a good enough model of me, and memory of how I have acted in the past, to make good guesses about how I'm likely to act in the future.</p>

      <p>“我试图用最简单的事情来描述一个元素，我认为我和我的同事在不久的将来实际上能够做到这一点。让我们展望未来十年。假设我们真的让系统运转起来，我们知道如何合成戏剧效果、编排音轨和图像，并让使用系统的人能够影响这些表现。</p><p>"I've tried to describe an element from the simplest thing that I think my colleagues and I will actually be able to do in the near future. Let's look down the road ten years. Say we really get the system working and we know how to synthesize dramatic outcomes and orchestrate sound tracks and images and give the person who uses the system a way to affect these representations.</p>

      <p>“我们可以将这样的系统视为一种互动幻想的媒介，也可以将其视为一种非幻想信息的界面。如果这个世界不是 X 星球或莎士比亚笔下的丹麦，而是鲸鱼的世界或化学反应的世界，那会怎样？这是一个强大的想法，我们现在可以在当代最好的教育软件中看到它。”</p><p>"We can think of such a system not only as a medium for an interactive fantasy but as a kind of an interface to information that is not a fantasy. What if the world, instead of planet X or Shakespeare's Denmark, is the world of whales or the worlds of chemical reactions? That's a powerful idea that we can see at work right now in the best of contemporary educational software."</p>

      <p>她举了一个例子，在游戏中，玩家体验成为一艘星际飞船上的学员的幻想。每个学员将负责操作飞船的一部分。玩家可以选择他们想专攻导航、推进、生命支持或计算机系统。在实时中，他们操作飞船的各自部分。然后出了问题——生命支持系统受到威胁，反应堆发生故障。或者发生了一些有趣的事情——外星生物学家发现了一个需要调查的星球。玩家必须找出要做什么以及如何去做。以第一人称。</p><p>She offered the example of a game in which the players experience the fantasy of being cadets on a starship. Each cadet would be responsible for running part of the ship. The players can choose whether they want to specialize in navigation or propulsion or life support or computer systems. In real time, they run their parts of the ship. Then something goes wrong -- the life-support systems are threatened, the reactor is malfunctioning. Or something interesting occurs -- the exobiologists have spotted a planet to investigate. The players have to find out what to do and how to do it. In the first person.</p>

      <p>“现在让我们从戏剧理论的角度来看待这个问题，”她提议道，“你很容易接受我是太空学员的想法。我也接受。当一位大师级演员模仿一个角色时，就会发生这种情况。当我模仿某人时，我<i>全身心都</i>在模仿那个角色。为了做到这一点，什么必须消失，什么必须从我自己的行为中消失？我就是那个不知道自己没有学到什么的人的想法必须消失。同样的想法经常会妨碍我们学习任何新东西。</p><p>"Now let's look at it from the point of view of drama theory," she proposed. "You accept easily the idea that I am a space cadet. I accept it too. This is what happens when a master actor impersonates a character. When I am impersonating someone, <i>all</i> of me is impersonating that character. What has to go away, to disappear from my own behavior to make that possible? The idea that I am me -- the person who doesn't know what I haven't learned -- has to go away. The same idea that often gets in the way of learning anything new.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">“第一人称模拟游戏让参与者自愿放下怀疑，让他们感受到拥有更大个人权力的感觉。</font>这样的世界向我们展示了没有日常生活中我们认为的限制是什么样的。当我们看到一个孩子通过玩哪怕是简单的视频游戏就能学到多少关于预测简单轨迹和物体运动规则的知识时，我认为很容易看到利用这些‘虚构环境’作为通往信息世界的大门的教育潜力，这些信息既有用又健康，而且学习起来很有趣。”</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"A willing suspension of disbelief that accompanies a first-person simulation enables the person who participates to feel what it would be like to have greater personal power.</font> A world like that shows us what it's like not to have the limitations that we think we have in everyday life. When we see how much a kid learns about predicting simple trajectories and the rules of bodies in motion from playing even simple video games, I think it is easy to see the educational potential in using these 'fiction environments' as the door to worlds of information that are as useful or healthy to know as they are fun to learn about."</p>

      <p>当然，到那时，我问的问题和本章中大多数人问的问题是一样的：“我们什么时候才能玩这些‘虚构环境’？雅达利距离根据这项研究发布实际产品还有多远？”</p><p>Of course, by this time, I was asking the same question that most of the people reading this chapter must be asking: "When are we going to play with these 'fiction environments'? How close is Atari to releasing actual products based on this research?"</p>

      <p>不幸的是，答案是雅达利不太可能将这项研究转化为消费产品。在我与艾伦·凯交谈并观察了布伦达·劳雷尔的研究小组六个月后，系统研究小组被集体解雇。布伦达和埃里克在五分钟内就收到了解雇通知。艾伦随后不久就去了苹果公司。再一次，就像 ARC 和 PARC 的情况一样，这家<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">培育了最令人兴奋的交互式思维增强计算机系统研究的公司管理层在开发产品时似乎惨遭失败。</font></p><p>The answer, unfortunately, is that it is unlikely that Atari is ever going to translate this research into consumer products. Six months after I talked to Alan Kay and observed Brenda Laurel's research group, the Systems Research Group was fired en masse. Brenda and Eric were given five minutes' notice. Alan went to Apple shortly thereafter. Once again, as in the case of ARC and PARC, it seemed that <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">the management of the corporation that nurtured the most exciting research in interactive, mind-augmenting computer systems seemed to fail miserably when it came to developing products.</font></p>

      <p>被解雇后，布伦达更愿意谈论为一家以消费品为导向的公司进行长期研究的压力。在她看来，雅达利研究公司倒闭以及雅达利公司命运的戏剧性逆转导致大幅削减开支的原因很简单。她声称：“华纳人”（雅达利的所有者）“从来不知道创新。他们雇佣来管理雅达利的人来自伯灵顿工业公司、菲利普莫里斯、宝洁公司——狗粮男孩。狗粮多久换一次？”</p><p>After she was fired, Brenda was a lot more willing to talk about the pressures of doing long-term research for a consumer-product-oriented company. In her opinion, the explanation for the demise of Atari Research, and the dramatic reversal of Atari Corporation's fortunes that led to the drastic cutback, is a simple one. "The Warner people" (who owned Atari), she claims, "never knew anything about innovation. The people they hired to run Atari were from Burlington Industries, Philip Morris, Proctor and Gamble -- dog food boys. How often does dog food change?"</p>

      <p>在进入系统研究部门之前，布伦达从事市场营销工作。她声称自己曾告诉雷蒙德·卡萨尔（雅达利前首席执行官），<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">“人们想要的不是更多无聊的娱乐，而是能帮助他们成长的东西。最大的市场是个人能力市场，是与对生拇指相当的新东西市场。”</font></p><p>Before she was in Systems Research, Brenda was in marketing. She claims that she told Raymond Kassar (former CEO of Atari) that <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"what people are going to want from us is not more deadhead entertainment, but stuff that helps their minds grow. The largest market of all is the market for personal power, for new equivalents to opposable thumbs."</font></p>

      <p>像恩格尔巴特这样的增强技术幻想家、像利克莱德这样的交互式计算的预言家，以及像艾伦·凯和布伦达·劳雷尔这样的信息航海家，都倾向于用宏大的言辞来谈论他们所做的事情的最终效果——这是自印刷机甚至自对生拇指以来最大的变化。他们似乎都相信，尽管 SRI、施乐和雅达利等机构目光短浅，但一项必然会出现的技术将证明他们的预测是正确的。</p><p>Augmentation visionaries like Engelbart, prophets of interactive computing like Licklider, and infonauts like Alan Kay and Brenda Laurel tend to talk in grand terms about the ultimate effects of what they are doing -- the biggest change since the printing press or even since the opposable thumb. They all seem convinced that their projections will be vindicated by a technology that will inevitably come into existence despite the myopia of institutions like SRI, Xerox, and Atari.</p>

      <p>随着家用电脑功能越来越强大，以及对娱乐和教育软件的需求越来越大，似乎在不久的将来，规模较小的创业组织（而不是学术或大型产品导向机构）将生产出梦幻般的放大器和思维增强器。创业研究最具争议的领域之一是应用人工智能领域。下一​​章的主题涉及布伦达提到的那些有趣程序的商业开发，即所谓的专家系统，它起源于麻省理工学院和斯坦福大学正在进行的纯研究，似乎正在入侵商业软件领域。</p><p>With the increasing power of home computers, and the growing demand for entertainment and educational software, it seems likely that smaller groups, working in entrepreneurial organizations rather than academic or large-scale product-oriented institutions, will produce the fantasy amplifiers and mind augmentors of the near future. One of the most controversial areas of entrepreneurial research is in the field of applied artificial intelligence. The subject of the next chapter is involved in the commercial development of those intriguing programs that Brenda mentioned, the so-called expert systems that originated in the pure research that is being conducted at MIT and Stanford, and which seem to be invading the world of commercial software.</p>

Unlike other artificial intelligence researchers, Avron Barr is not concerned with systems that can direct an optical sensor to recognize visual patterns, or to help a speech-recognition system to understand natural languages, or direct a robot in the task of climbing stairs. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">He and his colleagues are trying to build systems that can transfer knowledge from experts to novices and that can use the transferred knowledge to help people make decisions about specific problems.</font></p>

      <p>巴尔的专业似乎弥补了那些将计算机的未来视为“思维工具”的人和那些将其视为“智能进化的下一步”的人之间的差距。像我遇到的其他参与开发未来软件工具的人一样，巴尔坚信，当这些实验渗透到公众体验层面时，我们将面临具有划时代意义的变化。例如，考虑以下场景：</p><p>Barr's specialty seems to bridge the gap between those who see the future of computers in terms of "mind tools" and those who see it in terms of "the next step in the evolution of intelligence." Like the other people I met who have been involved in building tomorrow's software tools, Barr has a firm belief in the epochal quality of the changes we will face when these experiments filter down to the level of public experience. For example, consider the following scenario:</p>

      <p>一天深夜，西南部一个小镇的全科医生被一通急救电话吵醒——一名六岁女孩被送进当地医院。她昏迷不醒，发着高烧。医生要求进行当时这个只有一家医院的小镇里所有可以进行的临床检查，并打电话给病理学家。症状和初步检查结果与全科医生或病理学家之前所见完全不同。药物供应充足——药房设备齐全，尽管专业知识短缺。但要买什么药呢？</p><p>A general practitioner in a small town in the Southwest was awakened late one night by an emergency call -- a six-year-old girl had been admitted to the local hospital. She was comatose, and she had a high fever. The doctor ordered all clinical tests that were available at that hour in a one-hospital town and called the pathologist. The symptoms, and the results of the first tests, weren't anything the GP or the pathologist had seen before. Drugs were available -- the pharmacy was well equipped, even if specialized expertise was in short supply. But which drug?</p>

      <p>从数百种抗生素中选择出合适的抗生素对小女孩来说是生死攸关的问题，全科医生和病理学家都不愿意将这位年轻患者的生命押在猜测上。他们把实验室结果带到了当地社区大学，那里一位总是在半夜出现的年轻程序员使用微型计算机和电话将他们与加利福尼亚州帕洛阿尔托的一位专家联系，这位专家知道针对此类病例应该问哪些问题。</p><p>Choosing the proper antibiotic from the hundreds of possibilities was a matter of life and death for the little girl, and neither the GP nor the pathologist was comfortable about staking the young patient's life on guesswork. They took their laboratory results over to the local community college, where one of the young programmers who always seemed to be around in the middle of the night used a microcomputer and a telephone to put them in contact with an expert in Palo Alto, California, who knew just the right questions to ask about a case like this.</p>

      <p>“患者最近是否有持续性头痛的症状或者其他异常神经症状（头晕、嗜睡等）？”加州专家问道。</p><p>"Has the patient recently had symptoms of persistent headache or other abnormal neurologic symptoms (dizziness, lethargy, etc.)?" asked the specialist in California.</p>

      <p>“是的。”当地主治医生回答道。</p><p>"Yes," replies the local attending physician.</p>

      <p>“患者近期是否有医生观察或检查证明存在异常神经体征（颈强直、昏迷、癫痫等）的客观证据？”</p><p>"Has the patient recently had objective evidence of abnormal neurological signs (nuchal rigidity, coma, seizures, etc.) documented by physician observation or examination?"</p>

      <p>“是的，”病理学家回答。</p><p>"Yes," replied the pathologist.</p>

      <p>在专家通过电话提供的线索的帮助下，当地医生又进行了一次检测，将寻找致病生物的范围缩小到了专家建议的三种可能性之一。远程专家帮助他们确定了感染的治疗方法，手头有药物。小女孩康复了。医生、病理学家和孩子的家人都很感激。</p><p>With the help of clues provided over the telephone by the expert, the local doctors were able to administer one more test that narrowed their search for the disease-causing organism down to one of the three possibilities suggested by the specialist. There were drugs on hand for treating the infection that the long-distance expert had helped them pinpoint. The little girl recovered. The doctor, the pathologist, and the child's family were grateful.</p>

      <p>该专家是一个名为 MYCIN 的计算机程序，驻留在斯坦福医学中心的一台大型计算机中，它在其已经令人印象深刻的诊断记录上又取得了一次胜利。</p><p>The specialist, a computer program named MYCIN residing in a mainframe computer at Stanford Medical Center, chalked up another diagnostic triumph to its already impressive record.</p>

      <p>虽然这个故事是虚构的，但对话是<a href="http://www.eas.asu.edu/~drapkin/556/mycin.html">MYCIN</a>咨询的真实摘录。该程序确实存在，并且被用作严格的实验性诊断助手。它是一系列新<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">计算机程序（称为<i>专家系统）</i>的一个例子，这些程序现在充当人类专家的智能助手，涉及医学和地质学、数学和分子生物学、计算机设计和有机化学等各个领域。</font>专家系统只是 Avron Barr 等信息航海家向人机关系的未知领域发起的一系列全新软件探测中的第一个。</p><p>Although this particular story is fictional, the dialogue is an excerpt from a real <a href="http://www.eas.asu.edu/~drapkin/556/mycin.html">MYCIN</a> consultation. The program does indeed exist, and is in use as a strictly experimental diagnostic assistant. It is an example of a whole range of new <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">computer programs known as <i>expert systems</i> that are now serving as intelligent assistants to human experts in fields as diverse as medicine and geology, mathematics and molecular biology, computer design and organic chemistry.</font> Expert systems are just the first of a whole new variety of software probes that infonauts like Avron Barr are launching into the unknown regions of human-machine relationships.</p>

      <p>这些系统既是研究工具，也是商业产品。一个名为 PROSPECTOR 的程序最近帮助确定了一个价值数千万美元的钼矿床。一个名为 DENDRAL 的程序最初是一个人工智能实验，现在由一个化学公司联盟拥有，该联盟的化学家用它来设计和合成可能有用的新化合物。</p><p>These systems are both research tools and commercial products. A program called PROSPECTOR has recently helped pinpoint a molybdenum deposit worth tens of millions of dollars. A program named DENDRAL, which started out as an artificial intelligence experiment, is now owned by a consortium of chemical companies, whose chemists use it to design and synthesize potentially useful new compounds.</p>

      <p>专家系统与其他类型的计算机程序的一个重要区别是，专家系统并不像计算器提供方程式的解那样简单地提供问题的答案。当然，专家系统会给出答案建议，最终它们会给出答案，并附带一个数字声明，表明对答案的“信心”。但它们的作用不止于此。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">专家系统最重要的部分是程序与使用者之间的<i>互动。</i></font></p><p>One important difference between an expert system and other kinds of computer programs is that the program does not simply provide answers to questions, the way a calculator provides the solutions to equations. Expert systems do, of course, suggest answers, and eventually they will venture answers accompanied by a numerical statement of "confidence" in the answer. But they do more than that. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The most important part of an expert system is in the <i>interaction</i> between the program and the person who uses it.</font></p>

      <p>面对专业问题的人可以咨询专业程序，该程序能够就问题的细节向人类提出自己的问题。咨询是一种针对具体情况的<i>对话。</i><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">该程序模拟人类专家的决策过程，</font>并将该过程的结果反馈给咨询它的人，从而为使用它的人提供参考和指导。</p><p>The human who is faced with a specialized problem can consult the specialized program, which is able to ask the human questions of its own regarding the particulars of the problem. The consultation is a <i>dialogue</i> that is tailored to the specific case at hand. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The program simulates the decision process of human experts,</font> and feeds back the results of that process to the human who consults it, thus serving as a reference and guide for the person who uses it.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">当今的专家系统由三部分组成</font>：特定任务知识库、一套用于根据这些知识做出决策的规则，以及回答人们关于程序建议原因的问题的方法。“专家”程序并不通过计算机内存中的原始事实量来了解它所知道的内容，而是通过将规则系统应用于知识库的类似推理的过程来了解；它在备选方案中进行选择，不是通过蛮力计算，而是通过使用人类专家使用的一些相同的经验法则。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Expert systems as they exist today are made of three parts</font> -- a base of task-specific knowledge, a set of rules for making decisions about that knowledge, and a means of answering people's questions about the reasons for the program's recommendations. The "expert" program does not know what it knows through he raw volume of facts in the computer's memory, but by virtue of a reasoning-like process of applying the rule system to the knowledge base; it chooses among alternatives, not through brute-force calculation, but by using some of the same rules of thumb that human experts use.</p>

      <p>专家的正确率统计是评估专业知识的最终标准——无论专家是经过多年的研究的人，还是昨天刚刚诞生的计算机程序。进行这种评估的方法是由<a href="#OEBPS/Text/3.html">艾伦·图灵</a>在 20 世纪 50 年代提出的。“图灵测试”绕过了关于人工智能的抽象论点，要求人们确定他们通过电传打字机通信的系统是机器还是人。如果大多数人不能仅根据对方回答问题的方式来区分计算机和人类，那么对方就被认为是智能的。人们已经采用了类似的策略来判断专家系统的有效性。为什么不直接让一些人类专家来区分人类和机器的诊断呢？</p><p>Statistics about how often experts turn out to be right are the ultimate criteria for evaluating expertise -- whether the expert is a person who has studied for years, or a computer program that was literally born yesterday. The methodology for conducting such an evaluation was suggested in the 1950s, by <a href="#OEBPS/Text/3.html">Alan Turing</a>. The "Turing test" bypasses abstract arguments about artificial intelligence by asking people to determine whether or not the system they are communicating with via teletype is a machine or a person. If most people can't distinguish a computer from another human, strictly by the way the other party responds to questions, then the other party is deemed to be intelligent. A similar strategy has been employed to judge the efficacy of expert systems. Why not just ask some human experts to distinguish human from machine diagnoses?</p>

      <p>斯坦福医学院开展的一项实验首先向 MYCIN 提交了十名患有不同类型传染性脑膜炎的患者的病史。与此同时，八名人类医生（包括五名传染病专家、一名研究员和一名住院医生）也获得了与 MYCIN 相同的信息。MYCIN 的建议连同人类医生的建议（同样未指明身份）以及患者实际接受的治疗记录一起发送给了八名非斯坦福专家。外部专家给予 MYCIN 最高评分。</p><p>One experiment conducted by the Stanford Medical School began by submitting to MYCIN case histories of ten patients with different types of infectious meningitis. At the same time, eight human physicians, including five faculty specialists in infectious diseases, a research fellow, and a resident, were given the same information that had been fed to MYCIN. MYCIN's recommendations were sent, along with the human physicians' recommendations, also unidentified as such, and a record of the therapy the patients actually received, to eight non-Stanford specialists. The outside specialists gave the highest rating to MYCIN.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">在 20 世纪 80 年代，几乎没有人质疑专家系统在某些高度专业化的领域可以非常高效，甚至优于人类专家。20</font>年前，即使在人工智能界，也很少有人相信这一点。通常“纯粹”的人工智能研究领域误入了这个可能存在争议的应用人工智能领域，这是必然的，因为围绕专业知识的问题是模拟人类智能的核心。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">In the 1980s, there is little question that expert systems can be highly effective, if not superior to human expertise, in certain highly specialized fields.</font> Twenty years ago, few people, even inside the artificial intelligence community, were confident that it could be done at all. The normally "pure" research field of artificial intelligence strayed into this potentially controversial area of applied AI, as it was bound to, because the questions surrounding expertise are at the core of the effort to simulate human intelligence.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www-cs.stanford.edu/profile/people/feigenbaum.html">爱德华·A·费根鲍姆 (Edward A. Feigenbaum)</a>是人工智能研究领域的人士之一，他在 20 世纪 60 年代中期认为，了解计算机程序的知识范围非常重要<i>，</i>而了解这一问题的最佳方式是尝试构建一个人工智能专家。诺贝尔奖得主遗传学家 Joshua Lederberg 认为，根据质谱数据并遵循已知的分子键规则来确定化合物的分子结构是一项难度较大且可能对人工智能技术有用的问题。1965 年，Lederberg 和 Feigenbaum 与软件专家 Bruce Buchanan 以及诺贝尔奖得主生物化学家 Carl Djerassi在斯坦福大学开始设计第一个专家系统<a href="http://www-camis.stanford.edu/research/history.html#DENDRAL">DENDRAL 。</a></p><p><a href="http://www-cs.stanford.edu/profile/people/feigenbaum.html">Edward A. Feigenbaum</a> was one of the people from artificial intelligence research who decided, in the mid-1960s, that it is important to know how much a computer program can <i>know</i>, and that the best way to learn something about the question would be to try to construct an artificial expert. Joshua Lederberg, the Nobel laureate geneticist, suggested the task of determining the molecular structure of compounds, based on data from mass spectrography and guided by the rules that are known to govern molecular bonds, was an appropriately difficult and potentially useful problem for artificial intelligence techniques. Together with software expert Bruce Buchanan and Nobel laureate biochemist Carl Djerassi, Lederberg and Feigenbaum started to design <a href="http://www-camis.stanford.edu/research/history.html#DENDRAL">DENDRAL</a>, the first expert system, in 1965, at Stanford University.</p>

      <p>人类化学家知道，组成任何化合物的分子可能的空间排列取决于关于不同原子如何相互结合的一些基本规则。他们还知道很多关于已知化合物中不同原子的事实。当他们制造或发现一种以前未知的化合物时，他们可以通过使用质谱仪分析该物质来收集有关该化合物的证据。质谱仪提供了大量数据，但没有线索表明它们意味着什么。</p><p>Human chemists know that the possible spatial arrangement of the molecules that make up any chemical compound depends on a number of basic rules about how different atoms can bond to one another. They also know a lot of facts about different atoms in known compounds. When they make or discover a previously unknown compound, they can gather evidence about the compound by analyzing the substance with a mass spectrograph. The mass spectrograph provides a lot of data, but no clues to what it all means.</p>

      <p>传统的计算机系统未能提供基于光谱数据的分子结构发现工具。问题在于规则允许大量“近似结构”——可能的结构几乎但不完全符合所有数据。在筛选所有近似结构的任务中似乎存在“复杂性差距”。用于发现简单结构的简单得多的计算过程对于更复杂的结构来说根本不够。DENDRAL 的设计目的是找到一个完全符合光谱数据和化学键规则的“大海捞针”结构。</p><p>Conventional computer-based systems had failed to provide a tool for discovering molecular structures, based on spectrographic data. The problem is that the rules allow a very large number of "near misses" -- possible structures that almost, but not quite, fit all the data. There appears to be a "complexity gap" when it comes to the task of sifting through all the near misses. The far simpler computing processes that were used to discover simple structures are just not adequate for more complex structures. DENDRAL was designed to find that one "structure in a haystack" that perfectly fit the spectrographic data and the rules of chemical bonds.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">事实证明，你不能只是把所有已知的事实输入计算机，然后期望得到一个连贯的答案。</font>这不是人类专家做决定的方式，显然也不是你哄骗计算机做决定的方式。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">你需要的是一个“推理引擎”，将游戏规则、先前已知的事实、大量新数据拼凑在一起，然后大胆猜测这一切意味着什么。</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">It turns out that you can't just feed all the known facts into a computer and expect to get a coherent answer.</font> That isn't the way human experts make decisions, and apparently that isn't the way you coax a computer into making a decision. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">What you need is an "inference engine" to fit together the rules of the game, the body of previously known facts, the mass of new data, then venture a guess about what it all means.</font></p>

      <p>构建正确的“如果-那么”程序，即具有足够灵活性以使用人类专家使用的经验法则的程序，只是需要解决的第一个主要问题。创建能够操纵专家知识的程序结构后，您仍然需要将一些知识输入系统。在向计算机程序输入大量有关分子的数据以及有关它们如何在分子结构中组合的规则后，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">DENDRAL 的创建者采访了专业化学家，试图说明专家如何做出决定，确定哪些组合和结构可能有用。</font>由此产生的程序成为软件发展的一个里程碑，也是化学家、生物学家和其他研究人员的一系列软件工具中的第一个。</p><p>Building the right kind of "if-then" program, one with enough flexibility to use the kind of rules of thumb that human experts employ, was only the first major problem to be solved. Once you've created the program structure capable of manipulating expert knowledge, you still have to get some knowledge into the system. After feeding the computer program lots of data about molecules, and rules about how they can be combined in molecular structures, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">the creators of DENDRAL interviewed expert chemists, trying to specify how the experts made their decisions about which combinations and structures are likely to be useful.</font> The resulting program became a milestone in the evolution of software, and the first of a series of software tools for chemists, biologists, and other researchers.</p>

      <p>构建 DENDRAL 的过程还有另一个有用的、意想不到的副作用：从人类专家那里提取与判断相关的知识这一任务催生了一个新的子领域，即“知识工程”。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">“知识工程”是观察人类专家、建立他们的专业知识模型并不断改进模型直到人类专家同意其有效为止的艺术、工艺和科学。MYCIN</font>的首批衍生产品之一是 EMYCIN——一种面向那些擅长构建专家系统的人的专家系统。通过将推理引擎与事实知识体系分离，可以为专家系统构建者制作专家工具，从而推动最先进的技术。</p><p>The process of constructing DENDRAL had another useful, unexpected side effect: The task of extracting judgment-related knowledge from human experts led to a new subfield known as "knowledge engineering." <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"Knowledge engineering" is the art, craft, and science of observing human experts, building models of their expertise, and refining the model until the human experts agree that it works.</font> One of the first spinoffs from MYCIN was EMYCIN -- an expert system for those people whose expertise is in building expert systems. By separating the inference engine from the body of factual knowledge, it became possible to produce expert tools for expert-systems builders, thus bootstrapping the state of the art.</p>

      <p>虽然这些奇特的程序似乎远离交互式计算机系统研究的主流，但专家系统研究萌芽于开发分时、国际象棋程序、太空战争和黑客道德的实验室。DENDRAL 源自麻省理工学院 (MIT，实际上是 MAC) 早期的研究，该研究旨在执行更高级的数学函数，如证明定理。随着 DENDRAL 和 MYCIN 的成功，很明显这些程序对计算机科学领域以外的人很有用。同时很明显的是，当这个新的子领域变得更加广为人知时，魏森鲍姆等人提出的关于人工智能的非技术性问题将会被提出。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">正如医学领域的第一个令人恐惧的实际应用所证明的那样，人工智能领域涉及重要的伦理、哲学、心理学和工程学考虑。</font></p><p>While these exotic programs might seem to be distant from the mainstream of research into interactive computer systems, expert-systems research sprouted in the same laboratories that created time-sharing, chess playing programs, Spacewar, and the hacker ethic. DENDRAL had grown out of earlier work at MIT (MAC, actually) on programs for performing higher level mathematical functions like proving theorems. It became clear, with the success of DENDRAL and MYCIN, that these programs could be useful to people outside the realm of computer science. It also became clear that the kind of nontechnical questions that Weizenbaum and others had raised in regard to AI were going to be raised when this new subfield became more widely known. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">As the first frighteningly practical applications to the field of medicine proved when they were created, the field of artificial expertise involves important ethical as well as philosophical, psychological, and engineering considerations.</font></p>

      <p>将知识工程应用于人类医学最明显的潜在危险是可能因误解而误用。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">尽管建立该系统的人认为它是一个奇妙但完全容易出错的工具，但许多人往往过于重视计算机的建议，仅仅因为它来自计算机。</font>由于医疗建议通常涉及生死攸关的问题，因此当您尝试构建向专家提供医疗建议的东西时，您必须考虑到这种“自动医生”可能带来的心理影响。</p><p>The clearest area of potential danger in applying knowledge engineering to human medicine is the possibility of misuse through misunderstanding. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Although the people who built the system see it as a marvelous but thoroughly fallible tool, many people tend to give too much weight to the recommendation of a computer simply because it comes from a computer.</font> Since medical advice often deals in life and death matters, you have to take into consideration the potential psychological impact of such an "automatic doctor" when you attempt to build something that gives medical advice to an expert.</p>

      <p>和所有复杂问题一样，医学知识工程的伦理也有另一面。来自非西方、非工业化或非城市文化的人可能会注意到，专业知识，尤其是医学专业知识，是一种极其稀缺的资源。为数不多的与世界上最大的人道主义问题——流行病和饥荒作斗争的医学、卫生和农业专家分散精力，工作过于努力，无法跟上各自领域的科学进步。即使在大型医疗中心，某些重要专业的专业知识也是一种稀缺商品。</p><p>Like all complex issues, the ethics of medical knowledge engineering have another side. It might be noted by someone from a non-Western, nonindustrial, or nonurban culture that expertise, particularly medical expertise, is a desperately scarce resource. The few medical, hygiene, and agricultural experts who are fighting the biggest humanitarian problems of the world -- epidemics and famine -- are spread too thin and are working too hard to keep up with scientific progress in their fields. Even in major medical centers, expertise in certain important specialties is a rare commodity.</p>

      <p>尽管“现代医学”的许多功能（例如 CAT 扫描仪和其他医学成像技术）非常昂贵，仅限于少数富裕或有充分保险的患者使用，但<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">基于软件的系统的每个患者的潜在成本却低得可笑，</font>几乎低到可以在不远的将来带来一些好处，届时地球上重病患者的数量可能会达到数亿。</p><p>While so many of the trappings of "modern medicine" -- like CAT scanners and other medical imaging technologies -- are so expensive as to be limited to a few wealthy or well-insured patients, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">the potential cost per patient of a software-based system is absurdly low,</font> almost low enough to do some good in a near-future when the number of critically ill people on earth might number in the hundreds of millions.</p>

      <p>医学——前景广阔，但又有诸多棘手的伦理问题——似乎是商业知识工程最有前途的应用领域之一。20 世纪 70 年代中期，斯坦福医学院的医生兼计算机科学家 Edward H. Shortliffe 博士开发了 MYCIN，即前面对话中引用的诊断系统。诊断某一类脑部感染的问题在技术上适合专家系统研究，也是人类特别迫切需要的领域，因为识别感染因子的速度对于成功治疗至关重要。</p><p>Medicine -- with all its promise and all its difficult ethical implications -- appears to be one of the most promising areas of application for commercial knowledge engineering. In the mid 1970s, a physician and computer scientist at Stanford Medical School, Dr. Edward H. Shortliffe, developed MYCIN, the diagnostic system quoted in the earlier dialogue. The problems associated with diagnosing a certain class of brain infections was a technically appropriate area for expert-system research, and an area of particularly pressing human need because the speed with which the infecting agent is identified is critical to successful treatment.</p>

      <p>MYCIN 的推理引擎（程序的一部分，通过将一般规则应用于科学特定数据来做出决策）被称为 E-MYCIN，斯坦福大学和太平洋医学中心的研究人员用它来开发 PUFF，这是一种帮助诊断某些肺部疾病的专家系统。一个更新的系统 CADUCEUS（以前称为 INTERNIST）使用人工智能技术来模拟特定人类医生——匹兹堡大学医学院的 Jack Meyers 博士的诊断技能。Meyers 和他的搭档 Harry Pople, Jr.（卡内基梅隆大学训练的人工智能专家）一直在存储 Meyers 的部分问题解决风格和他对整个医学领域的知识，以及来自医学文献的大量信息。CADUCEUS 尚未完成，但在提交医学期刊的疑难病例时，它已经表现得非常出色。</p><p>MYCIN's inference engine (the part of the program that makes decisions by applying general rules to scientific specific data), known as E-MYCIN, was used by researchers at Stanford and Pacific Medical Center to produce PUFF, an expert system that assists in diagnosing certain lung disorders. An even newer system, CADUCEUS (formerly known as INTERNIST), uses AI techniques to simulate the diagnostic skills of a specific human physician -- Dr. Jack Meyers of the School of Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. Meyers and his partner, Harry Pople, Jr., a Carnagie-Mellon-trained AI expert, have been storing parts of Meyers' problem-solving style and his knowledge about the entire range of medicine, along with an impressive body of information from the medical literature. CADUCEUS is not yet complete, but it can already perform creditably when it is submitted difficult cases from the medical journals.</p>

      <p><i>人们告诉《计算机机构》</i>一书的作者凯瑟琳·菲什曼，他们的目标是提供“医生会使用的东西，而不是去图书馆或咨询专家。即使在大型中心，也没有那么多专家可用。”对 CADUCEUS 表现出兴趣的赞助机构包括 NASA，它在载人航天任务中显然需要这样的医疗助手，以及海军，它可以将类似的东西用于核潜艇。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">宇航员和核潜艇人员的特殊装备听起来可能离大多数人的日常生活很遥远，但在近代历史上，晶体管收音机、手持计算器和许多其他新技术的例子在不到十年的时间里就从 NASA 的奇特空间传播到了世界各地青少年的胸前口袋里。</font></p><p>People told Katherine Fishman, the author of <i>The Computer Establishment</i>, that their object is to provide "something the physician would use instead of going to the library or consulting a specialist. There aren't that many experts available, even at major centers." Among the sponsoring agencies who have shown interest in CADUCEUS are NASA, which has an obvious need for such a medical helper in manned space missions, and The Navy, which could use something similar for nuclear submarines. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Special gear for astronauts and nuclear submariners might sound remote from most people's daily lives, but in recent history, the transistor radio, handheld calculators, and many other examples of new technologies have traveled from the exotic confines of NASA to the breast pockets of teenagers around the world in less than ten years.</font></p>

      <p>与之前技术进步的创造者一样，知识工程师首先必须证明专家系统完全可以建立，而且很有用。这花了大约十年时间。接下来，他们必须找到潜在的应用领域——这项任务并没有花费那么长的时间。目前大约有二十多家公司正在开发和销售专家系统和服务。第一家公司是 TeKnowledge，由 Feigenbaum 及其同事于 1981 年创立。IntelliGenetics 可能是最奇特的，专门为基因工程行业提供专家系统。该领域的初创公司往往采用科幻小说般的名称——机器智能公司、计算机思想公司、Symbolics 等。其他已经在非人工智能领域建立的公司也进入了该领域——其中包括施乐、DEC、IBM、德州仪器和斯伦贝谢。</p><p>Like the creators of previous technological advances, knowledge engineers first had to prove that expert systems could be built at all and that they were useful. That took about ten years. Next, they had to find potential areas of application -- a task that didn't take nearly as long. About two dozen corporations are currently developing and selling expert systems and services. TeKnowledge, founded by Feigenbaum and associates in 1981, was the first. IntelliGenetics is perhaps the most exotic, specializing in expert systems for the genetic engineering industry. Startups in this field tend toward science-fictionoid names -- Machine Intelligence Corporation, Computer Thought Corporation, Symbolics, etc. Other companies already established in non-AI areas have entered the field -- Xerox, DEC, IBM, Texas Instruments, and Schlumberger among them.</p>

      <p>专家系统目前已在多个领域投入商业和研究使用。部分示例如下：</p><p>Expert systems are now in commercial and research use in a number of fields. A partial sampling:</p>

      <p>很难与钼矿床或相当高的诊断成功率争论。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">随着关于软件是否能够智能运作的争论在数学家所谓的“存在性证明”中逐渐平息，计算机技术是否<i>应该</i>应用于医学、空中交通管制、核电站运营或核武器运载系统等领域的问题才刚刚开始。</font></p><p>It's hard to argue with a molybdenum deposit or a significantly high rate of successful diagnoses. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">As the debate over whether software is capable of acting intelligently dies down in what mathematicians call an "existence proof," the question of whether computer technology <i>ought</i> to be applied to such areas as medicine, air traffic control, nuclear power plant operations, or nuclear weapons delivery systems is just beginning.</font></p>

      <p>一些批评人士，包括人工智能领域的知名人士，一直在警告人们，过度依赖专家系统等电子工具来做决策可能会带来道德<i>风险。约瑟夫·魏森鲍姆担心，过度依赖这种非常擅长</i><i>模仿</i>人类更深层次思维过程的技术会带来巨大危险。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">专家系统是魏森鲍姆所反对的那种“工具推理帝国主义”的典型——这种思维认为所有问题都可以通过计算机使用的分析、机械过程来解决。</font></p><p>Some critics, prominent members of the artificial intelligentsia among them, have been sounding alarms over the potential ethical <i>dangers</i> of relying too much on electronic artifacts like expert systems to make decisions. Joseph Weizenbaum fears that there is great peril in relying too much on a technology that is very good at <i>mimicing</i> what are actually much deeper human thought processes. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Expert systems are the epitome of the kind of "imperialism of instrumental reasoning" Weizenbaum rails against -- the kind of thinking that sees all problems as solvable through the kind of analytical, mechanical processes a computer uses.</font></p>

      <p>在 1983 年的一次采访中，魏森鲍姆说：“认为可以通过观察一位非常聪明的老师来在很大程度上掌握其本质的想法简直是荒谬的。我认为有这种野心的人、认为这会很容易或完全可能的人，都是自欺欺人。”</p><p>In a 1983 interview, Weizenbaum said: "To think that one can take a very wise teacher, for example, and by observing her capture the essence of that person to any significant degree is simply absurd. I'd say people who have that ambition, people who think that it's going to be that easy or possible at all, are simply deluded."</p>

      <p align="center"></p>

      <p>阿夫隆·巴尔是一位知识工程师，他并不认为自己被误导了，而知识型教育系统恰好是他的专业领域之一。令人惊讶的是，巴尔同意魏森鲍姆关于将人类生命与人工智能研究混为一谈的潜在道德风险的观点：“人工智能尚不存在，”巴尔强调道，“但<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">我相信，我们已经开始探索的基于知识的专家系统的研究最终可以创造出一种真正<i>理解</i>人类询问的工具。我不确定人们是否准备好面对这种权力所带来的道德决策。”</font></p><p>Avron Barr is a knowledge engineer who does not feel that he is deluded, and knowledge-based educational systems happen to be one of the areas of his expertise. Surprisingly, Barr agrees with Weizenbaum about the potential ethical danger of mixing human lives and artificial intelligence research: "Artificial intelligence doesn't exist yet," Barr emphasizes, "but <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">I believe that the kind of research we have started to explore with knowledge-based expert systems can eventually create a tool that truly <i>understands</i> human inquiries. And I'm not sure that people are prepared for the ethical decisions that will accompany that kind of power."</font></p>

      <p>从我们的谈话中，以及从我对他作品的阅读中，我发现巴尔也认为，尽管滥用存在危险，但利用这项技术帮助<i>人类</i>的潜力是值得追求的。除了开发和向专家和普通公民分发自动化专业知识，作为复杂世界中生活的信息抗毒素之外，巴尔还喜欢大声思考这些软件条目还能如何用于进一步的积极目的。他的个人梦想是最终建立一个专家系统，帮助人类达成共识。如果化学家和医生可以使用智能助手，为什么外交官和军备控制谈判人员不能获得同样的帮助？阿夫隆·巴尔在哲学、心理学和计算机编程方面的冒险经历使他怀疑我们个人的<i>知识</i>和我们如何<i>集体达成共识</i>之间存在着深刻的联系。</p><p>From our conversations, and from my perusal of his written work, it has been evident to me that Barr also feels that the potential for using this technology to <i>assist</i> humanity is well worth pursuing, despite the dangers of misuse. Besides developing and distributing automated expertise to both specialists and ordinary citizens as an informational antitoxin to life in a complicated world, Barr likes to wonder aloud how else might these software entries be used to further positive ends. His personal dream is to eventually build an expert system that is an expert in helping humans reach agreement. If chemists and physicians can use intelligent assistants, why can't diplomats and arms-control negotiators avail themselves of the same assistance? Avron Barr's odyssey through philosophy, psychology, and computer programming has led him to suspect a deep connection between what we <i>know</i> individually and how we <i>agree</i> collectively.</p>

      <p>我在人工智能中心地带的一家快餐店里遇到了阿夫隆·巴尔——这家名为“赶火车迟到”的餐馆位于门洛帕克火车站旁边。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">如果有一份技术间谍窃听名单，这家地震学热饼和豆芽店必须位列前五。</font>斯坦福国际研究所是历史最悠久的机器人研究中心之一，也是钼嗅探软件助手 PROSPECTOR 的诞生地，距离这家餐馆只有几个阴凉、绿树成荫、富裕的街区。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">隔壁桌那位穿着粗花呢衣服、涂着黄油烤饼的老头，看上去就像是中央选角中心刻板印象中的诺贝尔奖得主。</font></p><p>I met Avron Barr in a short-order restaurant in the heart of artificial intelligence country -- an establishment named "late for the Train," located next to the Menlo Park train station. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">If there is an eavesdropping hit list for technological spies, this seismographic hotcake-and-sprouts joint has to be in the top five.</font> SRI International, one of the oldest robotics research centers, and the birthplace of PROSPECTOR, the molybdenum-sniffing software assistant, is a few shady, tree-lined, affluent blocks away. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The tweedy old fellow buttering a scone at the next table looked like a central-casting stereotype of a Nobel laureate.</font></p>

      <p>我们见面时，巴尔穿着一件白衬衫，打着领带。他看上去三十五六岁。他的头发是棕色的，梳理得很整齐，胡子也修剪得很整齐——他是众多婴儿潮一代中的一员，六十年代的他们可能是嬉皮士，但现在他们每个月都会去理发店两次。他看起来就像以前那个帮你把杂货放进袋子里的年轻人。</p><p>Barr was wearing a white shirt and tie when we met. He appears to be in his midthirties. His hair is brown and well-groomed, his moustache neatly trimmed -- another one of the many babyboomers who might have been hippies in the sixties, but who now go to hairstylists twice a month. He looks like the young man who used to put your groceries in the bag.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">巴尔最初从事编程是因为他需要一份工作，</font>他之所以涉足人工智能是因为人工智能程序员似乎拥有他能找到的唯一能够帮助他为研究团队创建所需程序的工具。他从研究生院辍学后才开始需要一份工作。他在康奈尔大学攻读物理和数学本科学位，1971 年他来到伯克利大学，在那里，作为物理研究生学习了几个月后，他清楚地意识到，他真的不想成为一名物理学家。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Barr got into programming in the first place because he needed a job,</font> and he became involved with artificial intelligence because AI programmers seemed to have the only tools he could find that were capable of helping him to create the kind of programs he needed in his work for a research team. His need for a job came after he dropped out of graduate school. His undergraduate work in physics and math at Cornell led to Berkeley, in 1971, where a few months as a physics graduate student made it clear to him that he really didn't want to be a physicist, after all.</p>

      <p>那时，计算机科学职业甚至还没有列入他的目标，但编程恰好是他的一项有市场价值的技能——他在康奈尔大学为不同的教员做过科学编程，在 FORTRAN 语言方面磕磕绊绊，他在一个周末从一本书中自学而来。在他放弃物理学职业并开始找工作后，他注意到斯坦福大学招聘一名具有编程经验的研究员。斯坦福大学的工作要求在实验室里担任一名常驻软件杂工，该实验室正在探索教学技术。他接受了这份工作。</p><p>At that point, a career in computer science wasn't even on his list of goals, but programming happened to be one of his marketable skills -- he had worked his way through Cornell doing scientific programming for various faculty members, stumbling along in FORTRAN, which he taught himself from a book one weekend. After he abandoned his physics career and he began to look for employment, an announcement for a research associate with programming experience came to his attention. The Stanford job called for a resident software handyman in a laboratory that was exploring the technology of instruction. He took it.</p>

      <p>当他加入斯坦福数学与社会科学研究所的一个小型研究小组时，他已成为研究团队的重要贡献者，同时也是受雇的计算机管理员。在接下来的几年里，他帮助设计了一个程序，教初学者如何使用 BASIC 语言编程。</p><p>He had become a significant contributor to the research team, as well as the hired computer jockey, when he joined a small research group at Stanford Institute of Mathematical and Social Sciences. Over the next several years, he helped design a program that taught beginners how to program in the language BASIC.</p>

      <p>“这意味着我必须重新思考什么样的人将会与计算机打交道，”巴尔回忆道，“并找出这些人在学习第一种计算机语言的过程中可能会遇到什么样的问题。</p><p>"Which meant that I had to go back to thinking about what kinds of people were going to be dealing with computers," Barr recalls, "and finding out what kinds of problems those people might have in the process of learning their first computer language.</p>

      <p>“显而易见的第一件事是，计算机程序与我们在学校学到的大多数东西非常不同，因为程序员很少甚至从来没有第一次就找到正确的答案。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">编程就是调试。因此，犯错并不是要不惜一切代价避免的事情，而应该被视为正确做法的线索。</font>这就是为什么它实际上是一个<i>环境</i>，而不仅仅是一个教学程序。我们试图建立一个教授 BASIC 的课程，以及人们在学习软件时似乎需要的指导性帮助，直接进入 BASIC 语言解释器。”</p><p>"One of the first things that is evident is that computer programs are very different from most of the things we learn in school because programmers rarely if ever hit the right answer the first time out. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Programming is debugging. So being wrong is not so much something to be avoided at all costs, but should be seen as a clue to the right way of doing it.</font> That's why it was actually an <i>environment</i> rather than just an instructional program. We tried to build a curriculum for teaching BASIC, along with the handholding help people seemed to need in learning software, right into the BASIC language interpreter."</p>

      <p>必须记住，解释器并不是专门解释计算机术语的人，而是一种计算机程序，它可以将以人们更容易编写的高级语言编写的编程命令转换为计算机可以读取的机器语言形式。</p><p>An interpreter, it must be remembered, is not a person who specializes in deciphering computer jargon, but a kind of computer program that can convert programming commands written in the kind of high-level language that people find easier to write into a machine-language form that the computer can read.</p>

      <p>程序员和解释器之间非常原始的通信方式造成了初学者在学习旧式编程时感到沮丧的很多问题。解释器无法编写出能够在计算机上成功运行的程序，除非程序编写得完美无缺，没有任何小错误。如果括号的位置不对，解释器就会停止操作并在屏幕上显示一些令人毛骨悚然的消息——臭名昭著的“致命错误”或神秘的“语法错误”。</p><p>The very primitive communications between programmer and interpreter created much of what beginners have always found frustrating about learning old-style programming. Interpreters cannot create programs that will run successfully on computers unless the programs are written perfectly, without a single minor error. If a parenthesis is out of place, the interpreter simply stops operation and puts some spine-chilling message on the screen -- the infamous "Fatal Error" or the enigmatic "Syntax Error."</p>

      <p>首次使用 BASIC 的程序员与运行程序所必需的 BASIC 解释器之间的通信是 Avron Barr 和他的同事试图使系统的一部分变得更容易、更少让人类用户感到沮丧：“通常，当解释器被输入一个有错误的程序时，它会返回神秘的‘错误消息’，”Barr 解释说。“我们构建的程序旨在使用错误消息和调试来学习如何编程。”</p><p>The communication between first-time BASIC programmers and the BASIC interpreter necessary to run their programs was the part of the system Avron Barr and his colleagues were trying to make easier and less frustrating to the human user: "Usually, interpreters return cryptic 'error messages' when they are fed a program with a bug in it," Barr explains. "The program we were building was meant to use the error messages and the debugging as a way to learn how to program."</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">为了构建一个不仅能识别错误，还能为初学者提供解决问题的提示的解释器，Avron 必须超越编程行业的常规技巧，学习一些开始从人工智能研究中涌现出来的新奇概念。这不是绝大多数程序员的标准操作程序：对于大多数计算机程序员，甚至是科学程序员来说，人工智能是一群痴迷的学者用国防部的大量资金开发的深奥的花招。</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">In order to build an interpreter that not only is able to identify errors, but also can give beginning users hints about how to go about solving the problem, Avron had to go beyond the normal tricks of the programming trade and learn about some of the exotic new notions that were beginning to emerge from AI research. This wasn't standard operating procedure for the vast majority of programmers: To most computer programmers, even scientific programmers, AI was esoteric hocus-pocus that a clique of obsessed academics did with a lot of money from the Defense Department.</font></p>

      <p>智能解释器项目完成后，巴尔进入斯坦福大学计算机科学系攻读研究生，并在那里遇到了艾德·菲根鲍姆。尽管他一直是一名专业程序员，身边都是人工智能专家，甚至还从人工智能黑客那里学到了一些技巧，但这是巴尔第一次正式接触该领域。菲根鲍姆有编写和编辑一本书的想法。阿夫隆承担了这项任务。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他们认为他们可以在夏季结束前编写出一本关于人工智能的通用手册。这花了五年半的时间。</font></p><p>When the intelligent interpreter project was finished, Barr entered the computer science department as a graduate student at Stanford, where he encountered Ed Fiegenbaum. Although he had been working as a professional programmer, and he was surrounded by artificial intelligence types, and had even picked up a few tricks from AI hackers, this was Barr's first formal exposure to the field. Feigenbaum had an idea about writing and editing a book. Avron took on the task. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">They thought they could produce a general handbook on AI by the end of the summer. It took five and a half years.</font></p>

      <p>除了研究生课程要求外，巴尔的报酬丰厚的工作还要求他从数百名人工智能研究人员的贡献中编写出一本通用文本，这本书可以让非计算机相关领域的人士了解人工智能领域最重要的工作。这份工作拖得越来越长，在完成编辑任务期间，他从硕士学位升入了认知科学博士学位。</p><p>Besides the course requirements of his graduate work, Barr's paying job required him to produce a general text from the contributions of hundreds of AI researchers, a book that someone in a noncomputer related field could use to get an overview of the most significant work that had been done in AI. The job stretched out longer and longer, and during the time it took to complete his editing duties, he progressed from his master's degree to a Ph.D. in cognitive science.</p>

      <p>到了 20 世纪 70 年代末，巴尔并不是唯一一个认为<font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>知识</i></font>的探索和工程——了解人类或机器如何获取知识、如何在思维或软件中呈现知识、如何在人与计算机之间进行交流以及如何在整个文化中传播知识——<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">是哲学、心理学和人工智能的核心问题的人，而专家系统建设者所创建的新学科很可能会以令人惊讶的方式解答这一问题。</font></p><p>By the late 1970s, Barr was not alone in feeling that the exploration and engineering of <font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>knowledge</i></font> -- learning how it is acquired by humans or machines, how it is represented in the mind or in software, how it is communicated between humans and computers and disseminated throughout a culture -- <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">was a central problem in philosophy, psychology and artificial intelligence that might well be answered in surprising ways by the new discipline created by the builders of expert systems.</font></p>

      <p>计算机可以跟踪大量信息，并且可以非常快速地处理这些信息。但是，当要解决除最简单的问题（即人类幼儿或象棋大师可以轻松解决的问题）以外的任何问题时，计算机就会遇到严重的问题。就计算机所需的内存而言，大永远不够大，就计算速度而言，快永远不够快。世界上的信息实在太多了，无法通过检查所有可能的解决方案来解决问题。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">蛮力计算和人类知识之间的差异是硬核人工智能研究中缺失的一环（和圣杯）。</font></p><p>Computers can track large amounts of information, and they can move through that information very quickly. But when it comes to solving any but the simplest problems -- the kind that a human toddler or a chessmaster can handle easily -- computers run up against a severe problem. Large is never large enough when it comes to the computer memory needed, and fast is never fast enough in terms of computational speed. There is simply too much information in the world to solve problems by checking every possible solution. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The difference between brute-force calculation and human knowledge is the missing link (and holy grail) of hard-core AI research.</font></p>

      <p>个人知识很难描述，因此计算机很难模仿。知识不仅仅是事实的集合，被冻结成某种合理的编码顺序。当我们思考时，我们的大脑是如何完成所有事情的，而不需要有意识地思考如何去做？在浩瀚的信息海洋中，你如何知道哪些细节值得你关注？例如，新手和专家之间的区别不仅仅是储存了更多有关专业领域的事实的数量问题；相反，这种区别取决于对该领域新问题做出判断的能力。</p><p>Personal knowledge is a tricky thing to describe, and hence a difficult thing for a computer to emulate. Knowledge is more than a collection of facts, frozen into some rationally coded order. How do our minds do all the things they do when we're thinking, without consciously thinking about how to do it? How do you know which details in a sea of information are worth your attention? The difference between a novice and an expert, for example, is not simply a quantitative question of more stored facts about the area of expertise; the difference hinges, instead, on the ability to make judgments about novel problems in the field.</p>

      <p>国际象棋一直是计算机程序难以模拟专业知识的典型例子。它是一种有限游戏，允许的走法数量有限，每一步都有完全确定的结果。国际象棋符合图灵机意义上的形式系统，因此可以用计算机模拟。给计算机提供规则、起始位置和对手的第一步，计算机<i>原则上</i>能够计算出对该走法的所有可能的反应，并根据该计算制定应对措施。</p><p>Chess has been the classic example of the difficulties of emulating expertise with computer programs. It is a finite game, with a limited number of clearly allowable moves, each of which have perfectly specified outcomes. Chess qualifies as a formal system in the Turing machine sense, and hence can be imitated by a computer. Give the computer the rules, the starting position, and the opponent's first move, and the computer is capable <i>in principle</i>, of calculating all the possible responses to that move and formulating a response based on that calculation.</p>

      <p>然而，经过四分之一世纪的努力，没有人能开发出一个<i>无懈可击的</i>国际象棋程序。蛮力计算未能击败人类大师的原因与其说是技术原因，不如说是数学原因：<i>组合爆炸</i>是香农在 1950 年提出的蛮力障碍术语。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">即使只有 64 个方格和有限的允许走法，国际象棋中可能的走法数量也会迅速增加，以至于需要花费无数年的时间才能评估所有合法的可能性。</font></p><p>Yet, after a quarter of a century of effort, nobody has come up with an <i>unbeatable</i> chess playing program. The reason that brute-force calculation hasn't defeated a human grandmaster is not rooted so much in technology as in mathematics: the <i>combinational explosion</i> is the term for the brute-force barrier noted by Shannon back in 1950. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Even with only 64 squares and a limited number of allowable moves, the number of possible moves in chess multiplies so quickly that it would take uncountable years to evaluate all legal possibilities.</font></p>

      <p>在国际象棋和许多其他形式系统中，正确答案是大量可能替代方案中的一个。对手的举动所带来的问题最好通过能够捕获对手国王的举动来解决。在对手每一步的大量可能反击中隐藏着一个答案或一小组答案，这些答案最有可能实现最终目标或某个中间目标。隐藏解决方案的抽象域称为“问题空间”。</p><p>In chess and many other formal systems, the correct answer is a member of a very large number of possible alternatives. The problem posed by an opponent's move is best answered by a move that will lead to capturing an opponent's king. Hidden among the huge number of possible countermoves for each one of the opponent's move is one answer or a small group of answers that would have the best chance of achieving the final goal or some intermediate goal. The abstract domain in which the solution is hidden is known as a "problem space."</p>

      <p>通过生成和检查所有可能存在的符合规则的可能性来找到正确棋步的强力方法被称为“问题空间的穷举搜索”。问题空间是组合爆炸潜伏的地方，等待任何超过几层深度的分支触发。</p><p>The brute-force method of finding the right chess move by generating and checking each and every possibility that could exist according to the rules is known as an "exhaustive search of the problem space." Problem space is where the combinational explosion lurks, waiting to be triggered by any branching more than a few levels deep.</p>

      <p>组合爆炸问题可以很容易地被看作一个树形结构。如果将在不同选项之间做出选择的决策看作一棵树的分支，那么一个简单的双决策示例将在第一步产生两个分支，下一步产生四个分支，再下一步产生八个分支。当你进行到 64 步时，每一步的分支数量都是前一步的两倍，你将无法看到树枝组成的森林。如果你将需要决策的案例数量从两个增加到三个，情况会变得更加混乱：在三重分支树上经过两步之后，就有九个分支（而不是四个）；经过三步之后就有二十七个分支（而不是八个），等等，以此类推<i>。</i>因此，你必须建立一个系统来剔除合法但荒谬的举动，以及一个提前评估两三步的策略。</p><p>The problem of the combinational explosion can be easily visualized as a tree structure. If the decisions needed to choose between different options are seen as the branches of a tree, then a simple two-decision example would yield two branches on the first move, four on the next, eight on the one after that. By the time you get to sixty-four moves, each with twice as many branches as the previous move, you won't be able to see the forest for the branches. If you increase the number of cases to be decided between from two to three, it gets even more snarled: After two moves on a triple-branching tree, there are nine branches (instead of four); after three moves there are twenty-seven (instead of eight), etc., <i>ad infinitum</i>. So you have to build a system to weed out the legal but absurd moves, as well as a strategy to evaluate two or three moves in advance.</p>

      <p>实际上，在机器开始行动之前，它需要知道的是人类棋手所知道的神秘事物，这使他们在看棋盘时（或听到口头描述的棋局情况）能够<i>排除</i>除少数可能性之外的所有可能性。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">当一个人思考棋局时，他的大脑就完成了一项极其复杂的信息处理任务。</font></p><p>What a machine needs to know, practically before it can get started, is that the mysterious something that human chessmasters know that enables them to <i>rule out</i> all but a few possibilities when they look at a chessboard (or hear a chess situation described to them verbally). <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">When a human contemplates a chess position, that person's brain accomplishes an information processing task of cosmic complexity.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">人类大脑显然找到了绕过穷举搜索规则的方法</font>——一种击败搜索问题空间所涉及的数字的方法。这是人工智能程序设计者似乎从一开始就未能掌握的至关重要的技巧。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The human brain has obviously found a way to bypass the rules of exhaustive search</font> -- a way to beat the numbers involved in searching problem space. This is the vitally important trick that seems to have eluded artificial intelligence program designers from the beginning.</p>

      <p>人类棋手如何修剪蛮力程序创建的树？计算机如何帮助其他人执行类似的任务？专家系统构建的目的不在于超越大脑，而在于通过在大脑过程和世界复杂性（尤其是与信息相关的复杂性）之间创建智能缓冲区来<i>帮助</i>人类推理。问题修剪工具可能是这种信息中介的重要组成部分。</p><p>What does the human chessmaster do to prune the tree created by brute-force programs, and how can computers help other humans perform similar tasks? The point of expert-system building is not to outdo the brain but to <i>help</i> human reasoning by creating an intelligent buffer between brain processes and the complexities of the world -- especially information-related complexities. A problem-pruning tool could be an important component of such an informational intermediary.</p>

      <p>人类大脑完成任务的方式似乎需要大量的计算机能力，如果要用机器来复制这些任务的话。第一个专家系统实验并非只关注机器能力或人类能力，而是关注两种符号处理器之间的边界。机器如何将专业知识从一个人转移到另一个人？当 MYCIN 等系统证明这种软件能够显著增强人类判断力时，机器能力和人类认知才能之间出现的差异变得更加清晰。使用 MYCIN 辅助诊断决策的医生最终比使用该程序辅助之前做出的诊断更准确。第一个专家系统的“推理”能力实际上相当原始，但这些系统作为“咨询工具”的工作方式清楚地表明，设计能够以模拟和增强<font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>人类</i><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">认知的方式</font><font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>与人互动的</i></font></font><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">软件系统具有巨大的潜在能力。<i></i><i></i></font></p><p>Human brains seem to accomplish tasks in ways that would require absurd amounts of computer power if they were to be duplicated by machines. The first expert-systems experiments were not focused exclusively on machine capabilities nor on human capabilities, but on the border between the two types of symbol processors. How could a machine be used to transfer expertise from one human to another? The emerging differences between machine capabilities and human cognitive talents were brought into sharper focus when it was demonstrated by systems like MYCIN that this kind of software was capable of measurably augmenting the power of human judgment. Doctors who used MYCIN to aid their diagnostic decision-making ended up making accurate diagnoses more often than they did before they used the program to assist them. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The "reasoning" capabilities of the first expert systems were actually quite primitive, but the way these systems worked as "consultation tools" made it clear that there was great potential power in designing software systems that could <i>interact with people</i> in ways that simulated and augmented <i>human</i> knowing.</font></p>

      <p>阿夫隆·巴尔 (Avron Barr) 及其同事认为，增强人类智力的技术、构建专家系统的业务和人工智能科学之间的当前联系是<font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>专业知识转移</i></font>的作用，它既是一种实用的、有价值的工具，也是理解理解本质的探索：</p><p>The present link between the technology of augmenting human intellect, the business of building expert systems, and the science of artificial intelligence, Avron Barr and his colleagues, is the role of <font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>transfer of expertise</i></font> both as a practical, valuable tool and as a probe for understanding the nature of understanding:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">我们当前构建专家系统的方法的一个关键点是，这些关键程序不仅应该能够将专家知识库应用于特定问题，而且还应该能够像人类在学习、解释和教授他们所知道的知识时一样与用户进行交互。……这些专业知识<i>转移</i>(TOE) 能力最初是出于“人体工程学”的考虑——构建和使用我们系统的人需要各种“协助”和“解释”设施。然而，TOE 的概念不仅仅是实现所需的用户功能：这些社交互动——向专家学习、解释自己的推理和教授自己所知道的知识——是人类知识的基本维度。这些对于智能的本质来说与专家级问题解决一样根本，它们改变了我们对表示和知识的看法。</font>
      

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">为了借助专家系统做出决策，人类用户必须了解的不仅仅是系统建议的事实。</font>首先，人类必须学会如何与计算机交流；然后，他或她需要知道系统如何得出结论，并且要用他或她能理解的术语。为了告诉人类其推理过程的步骤，此类系统必须有一种了解它们所知道内容的方法。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">In order to make a decision with the help of an expert system, a human user must know more than just the facts of the system's recommendation.</font> First, the human has to learn how to communicate with the computer; then he or she needs to know how the system arrived at its conclusion, in terms that he or she can understand. And in order to tell the human about the steps of its reasoning process, such systems must have a means for knowing what they know.</p>

      <p>到目前为止，这项练习已经不仅仅是在长长的可能性列表中进行机械搜索。解决问题只是系统功能的一部分，该系统必须让人类相信它找到的解决方案确实是正确的。巴尔怀疑，这一转移过程的内部和外部沟通方面为人工智能以及智力增强研究中一些最重要的问题提供了线索：</p><p>By this point, the exercise has become more than a mechanical search through long lists of possibilities. Problem-solving is only part of the function of a system that must convince a human that a solution it has found is indeed the correct one. The internal and external communication aspects of this transfer process, Barr suspects, offer clues to some of the most significant problems in artificial intelligence as well as intellectual augmentation research:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">我们正在构建系统，参与人类在不同领域的专家、从业者和学生之间进行<i>专业知识转移的</i>活动。我们的问题仍然和以前一样：我们必须找到好方法来表示知识和元知识，进行对话，并解决领域中的问题。但我们方法的指导原则和解决方案的潜在约束已经发生了微妙的变化：我们的系统不再仅仅被设计为使用大量编码知识的专家问题解决者。这些是“知识”的方面，迄今为止在人工智能研究中尚未探索：通过参与<i>人类的</i>专业知识转移，这些系统将涉及更多的行为结构，这就是我们将知识和智能<i>归因</i>于人的原因。</font>
      

      <p><a href="#OEBPS/Text/9.html">和道格·恩格尔巴特 (Doug Engelbart)</a>和<a href="#OEBPS/Text/11.html">艾伦·凯 (Alan Kay)</a>一样，巴尔认为，在拓展我们对机器和人类能力的认识方面，未来的几代人将比现在的计算机制造商和用户更不受约束。人类态度和计算机能力的这种调整是知识工程师当前务实的关注点，也是利克莱德所预测的人机共生的长期先决条件。</p><p>Like <a href="#OEBPS/Text/9.html">Doug Engelbart</a> and <a href="#OEBPS/Text/11.html">Alan Kay</a>, Barr feels that future generations will be less inhibited than present-day computer builders and users when it comes to stretching our ideas of what machines and humans can do. This adjustment of human attitudes and computer capabilities is a present-day pragmatic concern of knowledge engineers, and a long-term prerequisite for the kind of human-machine symbiosis predicted by Licklider.</p>

      <p>在他的谈话、演讲和写作中，巴尔经常提到他和其他认知导向的计算机科学家所说的“飞行隐喻”。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">早期的人工智能研究人员一直在寻求务实的方法来处理机器是否能够思考的问题，他们将自己比作那些不久前相信他们最终会制造出飞行机器的人类发明家：</font> “今天，尽管我们无知，但我们可以指出这一生物学里程碑，即思考大脑，就像几百年前科学家们指出鸟类是自然界中比空气重的机器可以飞行的证明一样，”费根鲍姆和费尔德曼在 1963 年写道。</p><p>In his conversations, lectures, and writing, Barr often refers to what he and other cognitively oriented computer scientists call "the flight metaphor." <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Early AI researchers, who were seeking pragmatic means to deal with the question of whether machines could think, compared themselves to those human inventors who not so long ago believed they would eventually build flying machines:</font> "Today, despite our ignorance, we can point to that biological milestone, the thinking brain, in the same spirit as the scientists many hundreds of years ago pointed to the bird as a demonstration in nature that mechanisms heavier than air could fly," wrote Feigenbaum and Feldman in 1963.</p>

      <p>巴尔在 1983 年写道：“进一步探讨这个类比是有益的。”</p><p>"It is instructive to pursue this analogy a bit farther," Barr wrote in 1983:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">飞行是应对环境的一种方式，有多种形式——从翱翔的雄鹰到盘旋的蜂鸟。如果我们开始通过研究自然界中的飞行形式来研究飞行，我们对所研究内容的初步理解可能涉及羽毛、翅膀、重量与翅膀大小的比率，可能还有翅膀拍动等术语。这是我们开始发展的<i>语言</i>——识别规律并区分现象。但当我们开始制造飞行器时，我们的理解会立即改变。</font>
      

      <p>巴尔随后引用了另一位飞行隐喻的贡献者，麻省理工学院的西摩·派普特 (Seymour Papert)，他参与了 MAC 项目和 LOGO 项目，他指出，当发明家<i>不再</i>对鸟类如何飞行进行如此深入的思考时，对空气动力学的最重要见解就出现了。派普特在 1972 年巴尔参加的欧洲研讨会上说道： “想想人们是如何了解鸟类如何飞行的。当然，我们观察了鸟类。但主要是为了识别某些现象。对<font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>鸟类飞行</i></font><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">的真正理解来自于<i>对飞行的</i>理解，而不是鸟类。”<i></i><i></i></font></p><p>Barr then cited another contributor to the flight metaphor, Seymour Papert of MIT, Project MAC, and LOGO fame, who pointed out that the most significant insights into aerodynamics occurred when inventors <i>stopped</i> thinking so extensively about how birds flew. Papert stated to a 1972 European seminar attended by Barr: <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"Consider how people came to understand how birds fly. Certainly we observed birds. But mainly to recognize certain phenomena. Real understanding of <i>bird flight</i> came from understanding <i>flight</i>; not birds."</font></p>

      <p>第一批人造航空设计师面临的最大障碍不是他们的发明面临的环境障碍，也不是他们所拥有的材料和技术的性质，而是他们对飞行可以和不可以的想法。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">飞行不需要拍打翅膀这一简单但令人难以置信的想法的无可否认的证明是莱特兄弟取得的最重要的成就。</font></p><p>The most difficult barrier faced by the first designers of artificial aviation was not in the environmental obstacles their inventions faced, nor in the nature of the materials and techniques they had available, but in their ideas of what flight could and could not be. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The undeniable proof of the simple but incredible idea that flight does not require flapping wings was the most important thing achieved by the Wright brothers.</font></p>

      <p>世纪之交，航空设计师面临的一个根本问题在于放弃对事物现状的偏见，以便能够辨别出<i>可能性</i>。那些想要制造飞行器的人必须放弃对大自然解决飞行生命进化问题的方式的执着，这样他们才能超越鸟类来理解飞行的本质。同样，人工智能设计问题的一个根本部分在于能够超越大脑或计算机来理解智能的本质。</p><p>At the turn of the century, a fundamental part of the problem facing aviation designers lay in abandoning prejudices about the way things actually were so that the <i>possible</i> might be discerned. Those who wanted to build flying machines had to abandon their fixation with the way nature solved the problem of evolving a flying lifeform so that they might see beyond birds to understand the nature of flight. In the same sense, a fundamental part of the problem of artificial intelligence design lies in the ability to see beyond brains or computers to understand something about the nature of intelligence.</p>

      <p>认知科学家知道，这些知识可以揭示人类大脑的工作方式。巴尔指出，这些知识可能会扩展到各种智能，这些智能与人类智能的差异就像喷气式飞机与鹰的差异一样。</p><p>Cognitive scientists know that such knowledge can shed light on the way human brains work. Barr points out that such knowledge might expand into varieties of intelligence as different from human intelligence as a jet plane is different from an eagle.</p>

      <p>巴尔声称，如果飞行隐喻能够忠实地推广到思考机器的创造者和理解程序的工程师身上，那么难以想象的信息处理机制的新世界将成为可能——这些机制将与人类大脑的工作方式兼容，但又截然不同：</p><p>If the flight metaphor could be faithfully extrapolated to the artificers of thinking machines and engineers of programs that understand, Barr claims, new worlds of unimaginable information processing mechanisms would become possible -- mechanisms that would be compatible but quite different from the way human brains do things:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">...每一种新设计都会带来关于什么可行、什么不可行以及原因的新数据。每一种新装置都会在我们的理论语言定义的空间中尝试一些不同的<i>设计方案</i>。而每一次尝试都会澄清我们对飞行的理解。</font>

        <p><font size="-1">但是，人造科学不仅仅是定义自然现象的“真实本质”。对人工制品本身（硬翼飞行器）的探索，因为它们对社会<i>有用</i>，自然会延伸对技术与社会之间各种接口点的探索。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">虽然自然对可能性的探索受到其突变机制的限制，但人类发明家会改变他们能想到的每个参数，以产生可能有用的效果——从各个角度探索机器设计的限制。“飞行”现象的空间将充满大自然尚未有机会尝试的例子。</font></font></p><p><font size="-1">But there is more to the sciences of the artificial than defining the "true nature" of natural phenomena. The exploration of the artifacts themselves, the stiff-winged flying machines, because they are <i>useful</i> to society, will naturally extend the exploration of the various points of interface between the technology and society. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">While nature's explorations of the possibilities is limited by its mutation mechanism, human inventors will vary every parameter they can think of to produce effects that might be useful -- exploring the constraints on the design of their machines from every angle. The space of "flight" phenomena will be populated by examples that nature has not had a chance to try.</font></font></p>
      智能，就像飞行一样，是一种应对环境的方式。智能，同样像飞行一样，为拥有它的生物或物种带来了生存优势。能够从一个地方飞到另一个地方的纯粹实用性和对社会的实用价值确保了更好的人工飞行方式。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">巴尔认为，专家系统和其他基于知识的技术是具有同样高实用价值的“思维飞行机器”，因此市场经济将推动未来对其能力的探索。</font>

      <p>在巴尔看来，“应用人工智能”中的“应用”部分是专家系统最重要的方面之一，因为智能系统与有价值的社会目标的联系保证了年轻科学的进一步发展。因为在这个特定市场中开发更好的产品也意味着开发更好的增强人类智能的手段，所以这种机器的进化将与人类思想的未来进化紧密相关：</p><p>The "applied" part of "applied AI" is one of the most significant aspects of expert systems, in Barr's opinion, because the linkage of intelligent systems with valuable social goals guarantees the further development of the young science. Because the development of better products in this particular market also means the development of better means of augmenting human intelligence, the evolution of this kind of machine will be rather closely coupled with the future evolution of human thought:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">那些参与专家系统技术商业开发的人们的目标是将该技术融入到一些可以出售的设备中。但是专家系统运行的<i>环境</i>是我们自己的认知环境；正是在这个活动领域——人们解决问题——最终的专家系统产品才会有用。<i>它们将根据我们的思维进行设计</i>。</font>

        <p><font size="-1">...从实验室中开发的专家系统到真正融入人们生活的产品还有很长的路要走；事实上，甚至很难想象这样的产品会是什么样子。惠普实验室的 Egon Loebner 讲述了他多年前与电视技术发明者 Vladimir Zworykin 的一次谈话。20 世纪 20 年代，当 Zworykin 开发这项技术时，Loebner 曾问他对他这项发明有什么想法——他认为他的努力会创造出什么样的产品。这位<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">发明家说，他对电视的最终用途有一个非常清晰的想法：他设想在手术室的走廊里的医学院学生可以通过电视屏幕清晰地看到下面正在进行的手术。</font></font></p><p><font size="-1">. . . It is a long way from the expert systems developed in the research laboratories to any products that fit into people's lives; in fact it is difficult even to envision what such products will be. Egon Loebner of Hewlett-Packard Laboratories tells of a conversation he had many years ago with Vladimir Zworykin, the inventor of television technology. Loebner asked Zworykin what he had in mind for his invention when he was developing the technology in the 1920s -- what kind of product he thought his efforts would produce. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The inventor said that he had a very clear idea of the eventual use of TV: He envisioned medical students in the gallery of an operating room getting a clear picture on their TV screens of the operation being conducted below them.</font></font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">一开始，人们不可能理解新技术的应用，因为它会进入尚不存在的应用领域。洛布纳用<i>技术生态</i>位来描述这一过程，与进化论相呼应。就像物种及其环境一样，发明及其应用也是共同定义的——它们不断一起进化，生态位代表相对稳定的时期，最终进入新的现实……因此，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">技术发明会随着人们的需求而改变，人们所从事的活动也会随着新技术的出现而改变。</font>当工业界人士试图将新技术推向一些有利可图的领域时，他们也会探索潜在现象的本质。当然，参与这一探索的不仅仅是开发新技术的科学家和工程师：一半的工作涉及发现新功能能为人们做些什么。</font></p><p><font size="-1">One cannot, at the outset, understand the application of a new technology, because it will find its way into realms of application that do not exist. Loebner has described this process in terms of the <i>technological niche</i>, paralleling evolution theory. Like the species and their environment, inventions and their applications are co-defined -- they constantly evolve together, with niches representing periods of relative stability, into a new reality. . . . Thus, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">technological inventions change as they are applied to people's needs, and the activities that people undertake change with the availability of new technologies.</font> And as people in industry try to push the new technology toward some profitable niche, they will also explore the nature of the underlying phenomena. Of course, it is not just the scientists and engineers who developed the new technology who are involved in this exploration: Half the job involves finding out what the new capabilities can do for people.</font></p>
      

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">为了构建专家系统，知识工程师需要对人类专家用于对特定领域的问题做出决策的规则进行编码，然后将这些决策规则与该领域的大量事实联系起来。</font>要求人类专家测试软件模型。如果人类专家不同意系统对问题的建议解决方案，那么人类专家就会要求系统重建导致其做出决策的规则和事实链。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">In order to build an expert system, a knowledge engineer needs to encode the rules a human expert uses to make decisions about problems in a specific field, then connect those decision rules with a large collection of facts about that field.</font> The human expert is asked to test the software model. If the human expert disagrees with the system's suggested solution to a problem, then the human asks the system to reconstruct the chain of rules and facts that led to its decision.</p>

      <p>通过精确定位程序出错的地方，人类专家和知识工程师通过逐步调试的过程将他们的粗略模型变成一个可以工作的专家系统。最终，他们最终会得到一个程序，该程序在很大比例的时间里与人类专家的判断一致。当你请第二位专家评估系统时，就会达成<i>共识</i>。在现实生活中，人类专家之间意见不一，即使是最高水平的专家也是如此。这意味着，无论专家系统与某位人类专家的判断有多一致，都不能保证另一位专家不会发现软件做出的错误决定。</p><p>By pinpointing the places where the program went wrong, the human expert and the knowledge engineer turn their rough mock-up into a working expert system by a process of progressive debugging. Eventually, they end up with a program that will agree with the human expert a very high proportion of the time. <i>Consensus</i> comes in when you ask a second expert to evaluate the system. In real life, human experts disagree with one another, even at the highest levels of expertise. Which means that no matter how well an expert system agrees with one particular human expert, that does not guarantee that another expert won't catch the software making a wrong decision.</p>

      <p>巴尔意识到，利用专家之间自然产生的分歧的关键是建立<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">一种“记忆经验”的机制，</font>保留旧的决策，即使它们是错误的，并根据分歧的结果创建新的规则。从长远来看，系统的这一方面直接引出了人工智能研究中最热门的问题之一——程序是否能从经验中学习。巴尔只对这个问题的一个特定方面感兴趣——创建一种跟踪决策和跟踪人类专家意见不一致的情况的方法的可能性。</p><p>The key to taking advantage of these natural disagreements between experts, Barr realized, was to <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">build in a mechanism for "remembering experiences,"</font> for keeping around old decisions, even if they were wrong, and creating new rules from the outcome of disagreements. Taken far enough, this aspect of the system leads directly to one of the hottest issues in AI research -- the question of whether programs can learn from experience. Barr was only interested in one specific aspect of this issue -- the possibility of creating a means of tracking decisions and keeping track of instances where human experts disagree with each other.</p>

      <p>“当两位专家意见不一时，”巴尔解释道，“他们会想方设法向对方展示对方的知识不适合产生双方都同意的正确结果。建立共识的第一步是找出你们意见一致的地方。然后，你们可以进入第二步——试图找出你们各自知识体系中分歧的确切所在。</p><p>"When two experts disagree," Barr explains, "they try to find ways to show each other cases where the other's knowledge is not appropriate to produce what they both agree would be the right result. The first steps of establishing consensus, then, involve figuring out where you do agree. Then you can get on to the second step -- trying to find exactly where in your individual knowledge systems the disagreement lies.</p>

      <p>“找到分歧点通常是这一过程的重要部分，因为在有意识地寻找分歧时，专家们意识到他们所使用的术语含义并不相同，或者对目标的描述并不一致。</p><p>"Locating the point of disagreement usually turns out to be an important part of the process, because in consciously looking for disagreements the experts realize that they don't share the same meanings for the terms they are using or that they don't share a compatible description of the goal.</p>

      <p>“这种调试并不令人兴奋，但它为达成共识的第三步奠定了基础，在这一步中，专家们必须决定如何对待彼此。他们可以同意其中一人是错的，他们都可以坚信自己是对的，他们可以决定他们都错了或都对了。他们可以寻找可以解决这个问题的调查或实验。或者他们可以决定他们都必须等待新的知识。”</p><p>"This kind of debugging isn't exciting, but it creates a foundation for the third step of consensus, where the experts have to decide what to do about each other. They can agree that one of them was wrong, they both can remain convinced that they are right, they can decide that they are both wrong or both right. They can look for an investigation or experiment that could decide the issue. Or they can decide that they both have to wait for new knowledge."</p>

      <p>巴尔认为，共识辅助只是“我们能用智能助手实现的终极目标”的一个开始。Consensys 最初是描述如何与这些系统之一进行通信的一种方式，特别是如何推动专家系统处理两个不同的人类专家，并结合这两个专家可能存在的差异的价值。</p><p>Barr believes consensus assistance is only a start on "the ultimate kind of thing we can do with intelligent assistants. Consensys started out as a way of describing how you communicate with one of these systems, in particular, how you might push the expert system to deal with two different human experts and incorporate the value of the differences that the two experts might have.</p>

      <p>“我的梦想与这样的想法有关：我们所有人来到这个世界上都有自己的目的，而我们每个人都是发现这个目的的必需品。我们每个人都有自己的窥视孔，可以窥视正在建造的建筑物。我们都不知道它是什么，但我们每个人都有略微不同的视角。所有这些视角对于弄清楚正在建造什么都是必要的。奇怪的是，我们可以在如此短的时间内取得如此多的文化成就，我们可以得到关于我们如何来到这里以及宇宙如何运作的所有伟大想法，但我们对这一切的意义却知之甚少。我认为这暗示计算可以发挥作用。</p><p>"My dream has to do with the idea that there is a purpose for us all being here, and we're all necessary for discovering that purpose. Each of us has our own little peephole onto the building being constructed. None of us know what it is, but each of us has a slightly different perspective. And all of those perspectives are necessary to figure out what's being built. It's strange that we can achieve so much as a culture in such short time, and we can get all these great ideas about how we got here and how the universe works, and yet know so little about the point of it all. I think that's a clue that computation has a role to play.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">“我认为计算是一个抽象的概念，它指的是分享对环境的解释。</font>计算涉及对符号的系统操作，而符号与世界之间存在认知关系。我们需要内部表征之间的这些中间信息来分享对世界的看法。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"I think of computation as an abstract idea about what it is to share an interpretation of the environment.</font> Computation involves systematic manipulation of symbols, and symbols have a cognitive relation to the world. We need those intermediate messages between our internal representations in order to share perspectives on the world.</p>

      <p>“我认为，这类系统确实有可能在未来某一天被用来解决人与人之间的差异。要实现这一点，就必须先承认我们不知道目的是什么，然后找出我们不知道的原因，并共同想出如何才能理解<i>。</i>也许计算机可以在理解这一目的方面发挥作用。</p><p>"I think it is indeed possible that these kinds of systems will someday be used as a way to work out differences between people. The understanding that is necessary for that to begin to happen involves admitting that we don't know what the purpose is, then finding out why we don't know, and figuring out together how we might come to <i>understand</i>. Perhaps computers can play a role in understanding that purpose.</p>

      <p>“这听起来可能非常哲学，但理解的本质是人工智能程序目前面临的问题的核心。人工视觉或听觉中的模式识别、理解自然语言的能力、问题解决的模拟、智能计算机界面的设计——所有这些研究问题都涉及<font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>理解</i></font><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">的本质。<i></i></font>我们不知道理解的目的是什么，也不知道为什么你必须对整个世界有很深的了解才能识别一张脸或理解一句话。</p><p>"This might sound very philosophical, but the nature of understanding is at the core of the problems AI programs are up against right now. Pattern recognition in artificial vision or hearing, the ability to understand natural language, the emulation of problem-solving, the design of an intelligent computer interface -- <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">all of these research questions involve the nature of <i>understanding</i>.</font> We don't know what the purpose of understanding is, or why you have to know a whole lot about the world in general to recognize a face or understand a sentence.</p>

      <p>“我认为我们大多数人都相信理解总比不理解要好，我们理解得越多，我们就会越好。我认为当今基于知识的专家系统的后代将帮助我们更好地理解。我们每个人都将能够更好地理解，因为我们将通过专家工具的帮助与人互动，获取信息。它们甚至可能帮助我们理解没有人理解的事情。”</p><p>"I think most of us believe that understanding is better than not understanding, and that the more we understand the better off we'll be. And I think that the descendants of today's knowledge-based expert systems will help us all to better understanding. Each of us will be able to understand better because we'll be interacting with people and with information through the assistance of expert tools. They may even help us understand things that nobody understands."</p>

      <p>很少有人反对理解无人理解的事物这一概念——直到有人提出，实现这种理解的媒介可能是由硅而不是原生质构成的智能。人工智能信息导航员可能走上了一条最终将绕过近未来技术的道路，这些技术可以增强但不会超越人类智能。如果巴尔和他的同事是正确的，那么他们的想法将有力地支持利克莱德在 1960 年提出的推测，当时他提出了即将到来的人机共生的概念。利克莱德认为，这种共生是机器超越我们的能力之前的几十年或几个世纪的中间步骤。</p><p>Few people object to the notion of understanding things that nobody understands -- until it is suggested that the agent for achieving that understanding might be an intelligence that is made of silicon rather than protoplasm. The AI infonauts might be on a track that ultimately will bypass the near-future technologies that augment, but do not surpass, human intelligence. If Barr and his colleagues are correct, then their ideas offer strong reinforcement for the speculations that Licklider made in 1960, when he introduces the idea of a coming human-machine symbiosis. Licklider suggested that such a symbiosis was an intermediate step for the interim decades or centuries before the machines surpass our ability to keep up with them.</p>

      <p>即使人机合作只是一种中间关系，仅持续几代人的时间，但<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">接下来的几代人也必将令人兴奋不已。</font>当我们回顾计算的历史时，很明显专家们一直低估了这项技术的变化速度。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">即使最大胆的人工智能专家也可能严重低估了未来五十年或一百年将发生的技术变化。</font></p><p>Even if the human-machine partnership is to be an intermediate relationship, lasting only a few human generations, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">those next few generations promise to be exciting indeed.</font> When we look at the history of computing, it is clear that the experts consistently underestimate the rate at which this technology changes. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Even the boldest AI pundits might be seriously underestimating the technological changes that will occur in the next fifty or one hundred years.</font></p>

      <p>通往思维增强技术未来的道路似乎正在向外延伸，可供选择的范围越来越广，越来越难以预测。鉴于过去的发展，所有这些道路都有可能带来独特的新技术，并将促使人类文化发生重大变化。一个方向似乎涉及<a href="#OEBPS/Text/11.html">艾伦·凯</a>和<a href="#OEBPS/Text/12.html">布伦达·劳雷尔</a>等人的作品所代表的那种交互式第一人称幻想放大器。恩格尔巴特的智力增强梦想为通用工具的进化提供了一个不同的模型。在下一章中，我们将探讨另一条道路——这条道路与文学史的关系比与机器史的关系更密切。</p><p>The paths to the future of mind-augmenting technology appear to be fanning out, the range of alternatives becoming wider and less predictable. It is possible, given past developments, that all of these paths will lead to distinct new technologies, and will precipitate significant changes in human culture. One direction seems to involve the kind of interactive, first-person fantasy amplifiers exemplified by the work of people like <a href="#OEBPS/Text/11.html">Alan Kay</a> and <a href="#OEBPS/Text/12.html">Brenda Laurel</a>. Engelbart's dreams of intellectual augmentation furnish a different model of how the universal tool might evolve. In the next chapter, we'll look at yet another path -- one that is more connected to the history of literature than the history of machines.</p>

      <p><a href="#OEBPS/Text/14.html">我们的最后一位信息航天员泰德·尼尔森 (Ted Nelson)</a>设想了一个未来，届时，所有人都将参与人类文化的盛大对话，而此前，这一对话仅限于那些作品被摆上图书馆书架的少数创作者。尽管他的预测可能有些疯狂，但必须认真考虑，因为他早在个人电脑历史的“旧时代”——20 世纪 60 年代和 70 年代就做出了极为准确的预测。</p><p><a href="#OEBPS/Text/14.html">Ted Nelson</a>, our final infonaut, envisions a future in which the entire population joins the grand conversation of human culture that has heretofore been restricted to those few creators whose works have found their way to library shelves.

      <p>到 20 世纪 70 年代中期，集成电路已经达到了如此高度的微型化，以至于<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">可以制造比<a href="#OEBPS/Text/4.html">ENIAC</a></font>复杂数千倍的电子元件——只是这些机器不会将仓库加热到 120 度。事实上，如果你把它们掉在地毯上，它们往往会丢失。1971 年，<a href="http://www.intel.com/intel/index.htm">英特尔公司</a>的一个团队开发了特殊的集成电路，其中包含制造相当强大的冯·诺依曼型计算机所需的所有组件——4004，随后是 8008“片上计算机”。</p><p>By the mid-1970s the state of integrated circuitry had reached such a high degree of miniaturization that <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">it was possible to make electronic components thousands of times more complicated than <a href="#OEBPS/Text/4.html">ENIAC</a></font> -- except these machines didn't heat a warehouse to 120 degrees. In fact, they tended to get lost if you dropped them on the rug. In 1971, a team at <a href="http://www.intel.com/intel/index.htm">Intel Corporation</a> developed the special integrated circuits that contained all the components needed to make a fairly powerful von Neumann-type computer -- the 4004, followed by the 8008 "computer-on-a-chip."</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">在微处理器被发明时，没有人意识到，作为每年生产的数千种电子元件之一，微处理器会成为家喻户晓的名词。</font>那时，世界上可能只有几十个地位显赫或技术狂热的人在家中拥有个人使用的计算机。IBM 和 DEC 并没有将微处理器芯片的发明视为开始生产消费计算机的信号。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">At the time it was invented, nobody realized that the microprocessor, one of thousands of electronic components churned out every year, would become a household word.</font> At that point, probably no more than a few score highly placed or technically fanatic people in the world had computers in their homes for their personal use. IBM and DEC didn't exactly see the invention of the microprocessor chip as the signal to start producing consumer computers.</p>

      <p>1974 年，新墨西哥州的一位名叫 Ed Roberts 的人偶然发现了 8008 芯片，他是微型仪器和遥测系统 (MITS) 公司的总裁，他萌生了一个想法。除了电子工程师，该芯片本身对其他人来说毫无用处。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">它内置了一套“固件”原始命令的“指令集”，一个算术和逻辑单元，一个时钟，临时存储寄存器，但没有外部存储器，没有输入或输出设备，也没有将这些组件连接在一起形成一台工作计算机的电路。</font></p><p>In 1974, a fellow in New Mexico named Ed Roberts, president of a company called Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), happened upon the 8008 chip and got a notion. The chip itself was useless to anyone but an electronic engineer. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">It had an "instruction set" of "firmware" primitive commands built into it, an arithmetic and logic unit, a clock, temporary storage registers, but no external memory, no input or output devices, no circuitry to connect the components together into a working computer.</font></p>

      <p>罗伯茨决定提供其他组件和连接它们的方法，并将这些套件出售给爱好者。1975<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">年 1 月，<i>《大众电子》</i>杂志刊登了一篇封面故事，题为“一台你可以花 420 美元自己组装的电脑”。</font>它被称为<a href="http://www.hyperweb.com/altair/"><i>Altair （以</i></a><a href="http://alethea.ukc.ac.uk/SU/Societies/StarTrek/Episodes/TOS/3"><i>《星际迷航》</i></a><a href="http://alethea.ukc.ac.uk/SU/Societies/StarTrek/Episodes/TOS/3">剧集中<i></i></a>的一颗行星命名）。罗伯茨希望在 1975 年能收到 200 份订单，以维持企业的生存，而这期杂志上架后，他收到的第一封邮件就超过了这个数字。</p><p>Roberts decided to provide the other components and a method for interconnecting them and sell the kits to hobbyists. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">In January of 1975, <i>Popular Electronics</i> magazine did a cover story on "a computer you can build yourself for $420."</font> It was called the <a href="http://www.hyperweb.com/altair/"><i>Altair</i></a> (after a planet in <a href="http://alethea.ukc.ac.uk/SU/Societies/StarTrek/Episodes/TOS/3">a <i>Star Trek</i> episode</a>). Roberts was hoping for 200 orders in 1975, to keep the enterprise alive, and he received more than that with the first mail after the issue hit the stands.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">比尔·盖茨和保罗·艾伦分别为 19 岁和 22 岁，他们为 Altair 编写了 BASIC 版本。</font>他们前往新墨西哥州与 MITS 公司合作，为第一批业余计算机开发软件。从第一天起，很明显很多人都想拥有自己的计算机。MITS 公司遇到了成功的初创公司通常会遇到的问题。罗伯茨最终将其出售。1977 年，Commodore、Heathkit 和 Radio Shack 开始销售基于 Altair 建立的互连方法的个人计算机 - 至今仍称为 S100 总线。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Bill Gates and Paul Allen were nineteen and twenty-two years old when they wrote a version of BASIC for the Altair.</font> They went to New Mexico to work with MITS, developing software for the first hobbyist computers. It had been obvious from day one that a great many people wanted to have computers of their own. MITS had the usual problems associated with a successful start-up company. Roberts eventually sold it. In 1977, Commodore, Heathkit, and Radio Shack began marketing personal computers based on the interconnection method established by the Altair -- still known as the S100 bus.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">史蒂夫·沃兹尼亚克和史蒂夫·乔布斯</font>于 1977 年开始销售苹果电脑，如今他们已牢牢地占据了硅谷车库作坊神话的史册——七十年代的惠普和帕卡德。盖茨和艾伦创立了<a href="http://library.microsoft.com/msinfo/mshist.htm">微软公司</a>。1983 年，他们的公司向个人电脑用户销售了价值超过 5,000 万美元的软件。微软的目标是实现一亿美元的目标，而盖茨还有几年时间才满 30 岁。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs</font> started selling Apples in 1977 and now are firmly established in the annals of Silicon Valley garage-workshop mythology -- the Hewlett and Packard of the seventies generation. Gates and Allen became <a href="http://library.microsoft.com/msinfo/mshist.htm">Microsoft, Inc</a>. Their company sold over $50 million worth of software to personal computer users in 1983. Microsoft is aiming for the hundred-million-dollar category, and Gates still has a couple more years before he reaches the age of thirty.</p>

      <p>艾伦·凯、鲍勃·泰勒和伊凡·萨瑟兰已经因其过去的成就而受到认可，并期待在资金雄厚、声望颇高的组织的支持下完成他们未来的项目。盖茨、艾伦、沃兹尼亚克和乔布斯都是亿万富翁，正在努力赚取他们的第一个十亿。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他们都拥有实现他们几十年来梦想的工具和玩具所需的一切。泰德·尼尔森的命运（目前）还没有如此辉煌。</font></p><p>Alan Kay and Bob Taylor and Ivan Sutherland have already been acknowledged for their past accomplishments, and look forward to the completion of their future projects under the auspices of well-funded and prestigious organizations. Gates and Allen and Wozniak and Jobs are multimillionaires working on their first billions. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">They all have what they need to materialize the tools and toys they have dreamed about for decades. Ted Nelson's fortunes, have not (yet) turned out so spectacularly.</font></p>

      <p>泰德·尼尔森和他长期受苦的同事罗杰·格雷戈里现在拥有的是一个用“C”语言编写的长程序——这个程序要么是泰德·尼尔森未来的金矿，要么是全人类的福音，要么是计算机历史边缘的又一个疯狂的浪费。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">尽管他的未来可能不确定，但他过去拥有的是远见、顽强和坚韧，能够清楚、坦率地谈论计算机帝国的新衣。</font></p><p>What Ted Nelson and his long-suffering associate Roger Gregory have now is a long program written in the "C" language -- a program that is either a future goldmine for Ted Nelson and a boon to all humankind, or yet another crackpot boondoggle on the fringes of computer history. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Unsettled as his future might be, what he had in the past was the foresight, the orneriness, and the tenacity to talk clearly and plainly about the computer empire's new clothes.</font></p>

      <p>泰德·尼尔森是少数几个在早期就看到了计算机个人增强潜力的人之一，并且了解犹他州、<a href="http://www.sri.com/">斯坦福研究院</a>、<a href="http://web.mit.edu/">麻省理工学院</a>和<a href="http://www.parc.xerox.com/">帕洛阿尔托研究中心</a>所做工作的重要性。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">与许多受保护的学者不同，他还看到了业余爱好者“地下”的潜力。尼尔森选择绕过（从而激怒）学术界和工业界的计算机专家，通过一系列自出版的小册子直接向公众呼吁，抨击编程神职人员的言论。</font></p><p>Ted Nelson was another one of the few people who saw the personal augmentation potential of computers early in the game and grasped the significance of the work being done at Utah, <a href="http://www.sri.com/">SRI</a>, <a href="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a> and <a href="http://www.parc.xerox.com/">PARC</a>. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Unlike many of the more sheltered academics, he also saw the potential of a hobbyist "underground." Nelson chose to bypass (and thereby antagonize) both the academic and industrial computerists by appealing directly to the public in a series of self-published tracts that railed against the pronouncements of the programming priesthood.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">纳尔逊的著作<i>《计算机解放》</i>、<i>《家用电脑革命</i>》和<i>《文学机器</i>》不仅给正统派带来了明显的布朗克斯欢呼声，还对个人电脑的未来做出了几十个预测，其中许多预测被证明是惊人的准确，但也有一些被证明是错误的猜测。</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Nelson's books, <i>Computer Lib</i>, <i>The Home Computer Revolution</i>, and <i>Literary Machines</i>, not only gave the orthodoxy blatant Bronx Cheers -- they also ventured dozens of predictions about the future of personal computers, many of which turned out to be strikingly accurate, a few of which turned out to be bad guesses.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">作为一个以不可预测著称的领域的预测者，泰德·尼尔森在预测方面比大多数人做得更好。他的商业和学术事业尚未在学术机构或计算机市场取得成功。他曾让那些对他的狂野才华足够尊重并冒险雇用他的人失望和反感。</font>他目前正处于“第三次职业崩溃”阶段，还需要等待一段时间才能知道他持有的那家将推销他的梦想的公司的股票是否会让他成为百万富翁，从而证明他长期奋斗的正确性，还是会让他身无分文，从而将他打上一个真正的怪人而不是一个大器晚成的梦想家的烙印。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">As a forecaster in a notoriously unpredictable field, Ted Nelson has done better than most -- at forecasting. His business and scholarly ventures have yet to meet with success in either the academic establishment or the computer marketplace. He has a history of disenchanting and antagonizing the people who have enough respect for his wild talents to take the risk of hiring him.</font> He's currently on his "third career crash." and still has a while to wait before he knows whether the stock he holds in the company that is going to market his dream will make him a millionaire, thereby vindicating his long struggle, or leave him penniless, thereby branding him as a bona fide crank instead of a late-blooming visionary.</p>

      <p>和许多其他计算机天才一样，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">当泰德·尼尔森第一次意识到学校对他的所作所为时，他开始了自己常常孤独而又固执的独特的智力之旅。</font> “我一生都讨厌学校，”他声称，“从一年级到高中，我无时无刻不在讨厌学校。我从未见过像我这样讨厌学校的人，尽管我认为其他辍学者也是这样。”</p><p>Like so many other computer prodigies, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Ted Nelson started his often lonely and always stubbornly unique intellectual journey when he first realized what they were trying to do to him in school.</font> "I hated school all my life," he claims, "from the first grade through high school, unrelentingly and every minute. I have never known anyone who hated school as much as I did, although my assumption is that other dropouts do."</p>

      <p>尽管泰德·尼尔森与教育当局屡次发生冲突，但他还是在 20 世纪 50 年代末在<font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><a href="http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/">斯沃斯莫尔</a></font><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">学院确立了自己“校园里的极端疯子”的形象<a href="http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/"></a></font>，在那个时代和那个地方，极端疯子的数量比十年后少得多。他还以优异的成绩毕业，足以让他选择研究生院。他最终选择了哈佛大学，这所大学以容忍知识傲慢而闻名，只要这种傲慢伴随着近乎天才的独创性。</p><p>Despite his repeated clashes with educational authorities, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Ted Nelson managed to establish himself as an "extreme loony on campus" at <a href="http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/">Swarthmore</a></font> , in the late 1950s, a place and an era where extreme loonies were rather more rare than they became a decade later. He also managed to graduate with an academic record good enough to give him his choice of graduate schools. He decided on Harvard, an institution known to tolerate intellectual arrogance as long as it was accompanied by near-genius originality.</p>

      <p>1960 年秋天，在研究生二年级时，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">泰德·尼尔森 (Ted Nelson) 发现了计算机，而且来得正是时候。他被自己的信息淹没，随身携带着大量几乎未整理过的笔记，记录着他丰富的梦想和计划。</font>他发现了范尼瓦尔·布什 (Vannevar Bush) 的论文，并接受了这样一个想法：他可以使用计算机来记录自己源源不断的思绪和草图。</p><p>In the fall of 1960, during his second year of graduate school, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Ted Nelson found out about computers, and not a moment too soon. He was drowning in his own information, carrying around an already monumental collection of barely collated notes about his abundant dreams and schemes.</font> He found out about Vannevar Bush's paper and embraced the idea that he could use a computer to keep track of his own prodigious stream of thoughts and sketches.</p>

      <p>泰德很失望地发现，当时还没有计算机配备或编程来执行这样的服务。后来在麻省理工学院，第一台分时计算机才刚刚开始制造。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">但泰德需要一个存储和检索系统来跟踪他的笔记，这似乎是使用计算机辅助创造性思维的一种显而易见的方式，因此他开始自己开发这样的程序。23 年后，他承认：“当时我觉得它非常简单明了。现在仍然如此。但就像许多刚开始使用计算机的人一样，我把清晰的视野误认为是短距离。</font> ”</p><p>Ted was disappointed to discover that there were no computers equipped or programmed to perform such a service. Down the road at MIT, the first time-sharing computers were only beginning to be built. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">But Ted needed a storage and retrieval system to keep track of his notes, and it seemed like such an obvious way to use computers as aids to creative thought that he set out to create such a program himself. Twenty-three years later, he admitted: "It seemed so simple and clear to me then. It still does. But like so many beginning computerists, I mistook a clear view for a short distance.</font> "</p>

      <p>泰德在 1960 年选修了哈佛大学的计算机编程课程，课程使用的是当时哈佛大学唯一可用的计算机，即史密森尼天文台的 IBM 7090。作为一个学期项目，泰德决定编写一个机器语言程序，使他能够将笔记和手稿存储在计算机中，以各种方式修改和编辑草稿，并生成最终的印刷版本。在编写程序的第 4 万行左右时，他意识到自己对这项任务的规模以及完成这项任务所需的时间的最初估计过于乐观了。</p><p>The Harvard course in computer programming that Ted took in 1960 used the only computer then available at Harvard, the IBM 7090 at the Smithsonian Observatory. As a term project, Ted decided to write a machine-language program that would enable him to store his notes and manuscripts in the computer, to change and edit drafts in various ways, and produce final printed versions. Somewhere around the forty-thousandth line of his program, it dawned on him that his first estimates of the magnitude of the task -- and the amount of time it would take to establish it -- had been overoptimistic.</p>

      <p>尽管尼尔森能够清晰地设想某样事物，但他却无法创造出来，这在软件界并不罕见。这个问题如此普遍，以至于计算机编程的一条非官方规则（在某些圈子里被称为<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">“巴贝奇定律”）是：“任何大型编程项目所花的时间总是你估计的两倍。”</font>尽管他在 1960 年指定的最简单的文本处理功能在其他程序员手中成为了 20 世纪 80 年代办公自动化的软件先锋，但尼尔森在为他的学期项目编写的程序中远远超出了简单的文本处理。</p><p>Nelson's inability to create something even though he was able to clearly envision it is not unusual in the software world. The problem is so widespread that one of the unofficial rules of computer programming (known in some circles as <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">"Babbage's Law") is: "Any large programming project will always take twice as long as you estimate."</font> Even though the simplest of the text-handling capabilities he specified in 1960 were to become, in the hands of other programmers, the software spearhead of office automation in the 1980s, Nelson went far beyond simple text manipulation in the program he set out to write for his term project.</p>

      <p>和<a href="#OEBPS/Text/9.html">道格·恩格尔巴特一样，</a><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">纳尔逊渴望的不仅仅是一台懒人打字机，尽管</font>他还没有了解恩格尔巴特的作品。他们都希望能够自由地以新的方式引导自己的思维路径。而特德尤其渴望改变主意的特权。他希望有插入和删除单词以及移动段落的自由，但他也希望计算机记住<i>他</i>的决策路径。其中一项规格是他称之为“历史回溯”的功能，计算机可以快速向他展示他不断变化的文本的各种早期替代版本。</p><p>Like <a href="#OEBPS/Text/9.html">Doug Engelbart</a>, whose work he had yet to learn about, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Nelson yearned for more than a lazy man's typewriter. They both wanted the freedom to steer their thought paths in new ways.</font> And Ted especially desired the prerogative of changing his mind. He wanted the freedom to insert and delete words and move paragraphs around, but he also wanted the computer to <i>remember</i> his decision path. One of the specs was for something he called "historical backtrack," in which the computer could quickly show him the various earlier alternative versions of his ever-changing text.</p>

      <p>“替代版本”？<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">从存储笔记的地方到雕刻文本的工具，他的学期项目现在让他进入了更加奇妙的科幻领域，一个可以用平行替代方案来思考的地方。</font>整个平行替代方案的图书馆，以及在微秒内执行最繁琐搜索的自动图书管理员。我们为什么要放弃任何想法？<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">为什么不把所有东西的每一个变体都存储起来，让计算机在我们想要查看某些东西时负责筛选呢？</font></p><p>"Alternative versions"? <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">From a place to store notes to a tool for sculpting text, his term project had now landed him in even more wondrous science-fiction territory, a place where it was possible to think in terms of parallel alternatives.</font> Of entire libraries of parallel alternatives, and automated librarians to perform the most tedious of searches in microseconds. Why should we abandon any thought at all? <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Why not just store every variation on everything and let the computer take care of sifting through it when we want to view something?</font></p>

      <p>泰德·尼尔森 (Ted Nelson) 对此非常着迷，他迫切希望成为一名“计算机人”，但他却反对仍然盛行的观念，即计算机是“数学的”。尼尔森从不因自己的智力而过分谦虚，他承认自己“数学无能”。对于那些从麻省理工学院辍学并在 26 号楼附近徘徊的局外人来说，他甚至是一个局外人。斯沃斯莫尔/哈佛大学的人根本不了解布朗克斯科学学院/麻省理工学院的人谈论计算机的方式。</p><p>Ted Nelson was hooked, and desperately wanted to become a "computer person," but came up against the still-prevalent notion that computers are "mathematical." Never one to be accused of excessive modesty regarding his intellectual powers, Nelson admits that he was "a mathematical incompetent." He was even an outsider to those outsiders who were dropping out of MIT and hanging around Building 26. A Swarthmore/Harvard person just wasn't versed in the way Bronx-Science/MIT people talked about computers.</p>

      <p>他找不到任何计算机梦想家的工作，但他设法在迈阿密的一个实验室找到了一份摄影师和电影编辑的工作，当时一个名叫约翰·利利的人正在那里研究海豚智力。利利有一件非常罕见的仪器——韦斯·克拉克设计的原始 LINC 微型计算机之一。（纳尔逊在工作中没有使用这台机器，但它的存在使他相信小型个人计算机的想法确实是合理的。）之后，他在瓦萨学院找到了一份教授社会学的工作。</p><p>He couldn't find any jobs as a computer dreamer, but he did manage to find a position as a photographer and film editor at a laboratory in Miami where a man named John Lilly was conducting research on dolphin intelligence. Lilly had a very rare piece of instrumentation -- one of the original LINC microcomputers designed by Wes Clark. (Nelson didn't use the machine in his work, but its existence convinced him that the idea of small, personal computers was indeed sensible.) After that came a job teaching sociology at Vassar.</p>

      <p>在接下来的两年里，纳尔逊一边教授社会学，一边思考着存储和交叉引用的复杂性，正是这些阻碍了他完成笔记计划。与此同时，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">纳尔逊意识到自己正在尝试创造一种新的东西。它是一种工具，但同时也是一个图书馆、一种媒介和一群奴隶图书管理员。20</font>世纪 60 年代中期，当他在一家图书公司工作时，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他开始将整个计划称为<i>Xanadu</i>。</font>他说，这是“文学记忆的魔幻之地的传统名称”，但值得注意的是，柯勒律治的同名诗歌和纳尔逊的学期项目一样，都是未完成的。</p><p>Over the next two years, while he taught sociology and thought about the complexities of storing and cross-referencing that had prevented him from finishing his note-keeping program, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Nelson realized that he was trying to create a new kind of thing. It was a tool, but it was also a library, and a medium, and a legion of slave-librarians.</font> In the mid-1960s, when he was working at a book firm, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">he started to call the whole scheme <i>Xanadu</i>.</font> He says it is "a traditional name for a magic place of literary memory," but it is worth noting that Coleridge's poem of that name, like Nelson's term project, was unfinished.</p>

      <p>到了 60 年代末，在得罪了学术、商业和军事计算领域所有能帮到他的人之后，泰德终于可以自由地找到一些志同道合、痴迷于计算机的朋友，并尝试编写让“上都”成为可能的软件。到那时，他不仅构思出了这个新信息处理系统完整版本的规格，还成功吸引了一些同样狂热的盟友。</p><p>By the late sixties, having offended anyone who could help him in the worlds of academic, commercial, and military computing, Ted was free to find a few like-minded and computer-obsessed friends and attempt to write the software that would make Xanadu possible. By this time, he had not only dreamed up the specifications for the full-blown version of this new information processing system, he had managed to attract a few equally fanatic allies.</p>

      <p>最基本的笔记记录方案旨在建立一个处理所有回溯的系统。下一步是扩展此功能以处理备选版本，并向用户显示不同版本中哪些部分相同，哪些部分不同。纳尔逊现在估计，这种版本控制功能<i>消耗</i>了国民生产总值的 5% 左右——从律师使用的样板段落到波音计算机中存储的 747 设计 47 个不同版本。在现实生活中，几乎不存在“合同”或“747 蓝图”这样的东西。标准功能和自定义功能混合在一起，导致合同或蓝图版本略有不同，这种情况更为常见。</p><p>The basic note-keeping scheme that started it all was meant to have a system for taking care of all backtracking. The next step was to expand this capability to handle alternative versions and to show the user which parts of different versions are the same and which are different. This <i>versioning</i> capability, which Nelson now estimates to consume about 5 percent of the Gross National Product -- from the boiler-plate paragraphs used by attorneys to the 47 different versions of the 747 design that are stored in Boeing's computers. In real life, there is hardly ever such a thing as "the contract" or "the 747 blueprint." Mixtures of standard and custom features that make for slightly different versions of contracts or blueprints are more often the case.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">然而，历史追踪和版本控制只能提供一个强大的文字处理系统。当尼尔森想到添加<i>链接</i>时，事情开始变得超乎寻常。</font>恩格尔巴特认为，他和尼尔森恰好在同一时间想出了类似的东西，尽管恩格尔巴特拥有技术和资金来真正启动和运行这样一个系统。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">整个想法最初是一种计算机动态脚注——一种</font>从文本的一部分跳转到当前文档主体之外的内容的方法。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Historical tracing and versioning, however, don't make for much more than a powerful word processing system. Things started getting extradimensional when Nelson thought about adding <i>links</i>.</font> Engelbart thinks that he and Nelson just happened to come up with something similar around the same time, although Engelbart had the technology and the wherewithal to actually get such a system up and running. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The whole idea started out as a kind of computer-dynamized footnote --</font> a way to jump from part of the text to something outside the main body of the current document.</p>

      <p>用户无需在遇到星号时查看页面底部的脚注，也无需在图书馆的其他地方查找其他文档来验证参考文献，只需使用光笔或鼠标作为星号的电子等价物，即可自动将附加或引用的材料显示在屏幕上。返回按钮会将用户带回到原文中出现链接符号的位置。Doug Engelbart 早期的 NLS 系统中内置了一个非常相似的功能。</p><p>Instead of encountering an asterisk and looking at the bottom of the page for a footnote, and possibly looking up another document elsewhere in the library to verify a reference, the user would point a lightpen or a mouse as the electronic equivalent of the asterisk, and automatically bring the appended or referenced material to the screen. A return button would bring the user back to the point in the original text where the link symbol appeared. A very similar feature was built into Doug Engelbart's early NLS system.</p>

      <p>恩格尔巴特更关心的是构建解决问题的工具包和工作室，而不是推测这种设施可能创造的文学形式。然而，纳尔逊是文科生而非工科生——他痛恨这种二分法，因为它使他长期远离电脑——他想知道会出现什么样的艺术形式和智力系统。从最简单的意义上讲，链接是一种提醒，“这里有东西可以跳转到”。链接意味着文学不再必须是连续的。</p><p>Engelbart was more concerned with constructing the toolkit and workshop for solving problems than speculating about the kind of literary form such a facility might create. Nelson, however, being a liberal arts type rather than an engineering type -- a dichotomy he deplores, since it kept him away from computers for so long -- wondered what art forms and intellectual systems might emerge. In its simplest essence, a link is a reminder that "there is something to jump to here." Links meant that literature no longer had to be sequential.</p>

      <p>尼尔森从一开始就坚持认为，链接功能提供的远比附加零碎信息的方法强大得多。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">具有回溯、版本控制和链接的系统将创造一种将思想组织成文字的新方法，这是一种在计算机出现之前不可能实现的非连续写作形式，他称这种文学形式为<i>超文本</i>。</font></p><p>The link facility, Nelson insisted from the first, provides something far more powerful than a means of attaching odds and ends. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">A system with backtrack, versioning, and links would create the possibility of a new way of organizing thoughts into words, a nonsequential form of writing that was never possible before computers, a literary form he called <i>hypertext</i>.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">超文本，正如他最初设想的那样，既可以应用于学术研究，也可以应用于诗歌。</font>科学文献是全球科学研究的基础，由已发表的文献组成，这些文献参考了许多以前发表的文献。通常进行实验是为了检验基于先前实验的假设。当面对新的研究问题时，科学家做的第一件事就是进行“文献搜索”。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Hypertext, as he first imagined it, could apply to scholarship as well as to poetry.</font> Scientific literature, the very basis of worldwide scientific scholarship, consists of published documents which refer to many previously published documents. An experiment is usually performed to test a hypothesis that was based on previous experiments. Performing a "search of the literature" is the first thing a scientist does when confronted with a new research problem.</p>

      <p>当今的问题是科学研究过于<i>成功</i>。正如范尼瓦尔·布什四十年前所警告的那样，科学出版物的速度和数量已经超出了我们印刷时代技术的应对能力。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">有了超文本系统，每篇科学文献都可以链接到其知识前因和相关问题的文件。</font>所有相关科学文献都可以压缩到每篇单独的文件中。这些链接的功能与脚注相同，但可以立即访问引用的材料，就好像每个脚注都是引用文件的一扇窗户或一扇门。</p><p>The problem today is that scientific research is <i>too</i> successful. As Vannevar Bush warned forty years ago, the rate and volume of scientific publication have overwhelmed the coping capacity of our print-era technology. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">With a hypertext system, each scientific document could have links to its intellectual antecedents and to documents regarding related problems.</font> The entire body of relevant scientific literature could be collapsed into each individual document. The links would function in the same way as footnotes, but with immediate access to the cited material, as if each footnote was like a window or door into the cited document.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">具有链接、回溯和版本控制的系统只需要一个经济结构即可成为发布系统。</font>纳尔逊看到了一个基于他对版税和次级版税概念的无政府但自组织的系统。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">在类似 Xanadu 的系统中，版税由主机网络自动监控，并且主要基于传输时间——人们在线关注给定文档的时间量。系统</font>中的每个文档都有一个所有者，每当有人从内存中调用他们的文档并以文字、声音或图像显示时，每个所有者都会获得“一点版税” 。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">A system with links, backtrack, and versioning needs only an economic structure to become a publishing system.</font> Nelson sees an anarchic but self-organizing system based on his conception of royalties and subroyalties. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">In a Xanadu-like system, royalties are automatically monitored by the host computer network, and are based largely on transmission time -- the amount of time people pay on-line attention to a given document.</font> Every document in the system has an owner, and every owner is paid "a whiff of royalty" whenever somebody calls their document from the memory and displays it in words, sounds, or images.</p>

      <p>每个人都可以创建自己想要的文本并将其放到系统中，从十四行诗到小册子再到教科书，每个人都可以引用或引用任何其他文档。文档可以由链接组成。纲要、导游、目录和索引将作为独立文档出现；秩序将成为一种有价值的商品。“结果是文档池看似无政府状态，这是真的，但无论如何，文学就是这样的……”，纳尔逊声称。“它的有序性并不是像有些人认为的那样，是由计算机或其管理员强加的，而是由很久以前在文学的自然结构中出现的东西，我们只是保留了它。”<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">正如文学评论家和图书管理员已经找到了组织和分类看似混乱的传统文学流的方法一样，纳尔逊声称人们会自发发明组织基于超文本的文学作品的方法。</font></p><p>Everybody can create what text they want and put it on the system, from sonnets to pamphlets to textbooks, and everybody can quote or cite any other document. Documents can consist of links. Compendia, guided tours, directories, and indexes will spring up as independent documents; order would become a valuable commodity. "The result is a seemingly anarchic pool of documents, true, but that's what literature has been anyhow . . . ," Nelson claims. "Its orderliness is not, as some would suppose, imposed by the computer or its administrators, but by something which arose long ago in the natural structure of literature, and which we are merely retaining." <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Just as literary critics and librarians have found ways to organize and categorize the apparently chaotic stream of traditional literature, Nelson claims that people will spontaneously invent methods of organizing a hypertext-based body of literature.</font></p>

      <p>尼尔森认为他对这项技术的终极担忧是政治性的。大多数革命者都认为计算机是极权压迫的工具，是集权和非人性的象征，而尼尔森早就知道，这些想法是基于一种过时的计算机。由单个功能强大的计算机组成的分布式网络与具有大量扩展的中央计算机完全不同，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">尼尔森是第一批指出这项技术有可能创造由个体成员指导的社会形式的人之一，</font>这些成员不受任何老式大型机式中央控制的指挥。他对能够随时获取可用信息形式（旧黑客的秘诀）所带来的个人力量充满热情，并热衷于保留以自己的方式探索信息的自由：</p><p>Nelson sees his ultimate concerns about the technology as political. Where most revolutionaries have regarded the computer as a tool of totalitarian oppression, a symbol of centralized power and dehumanization, Nelson has long known that these ideas are based on an outmoded kind of computer. Distributed networks of individually powerful computers are an entirely different thing from a central computer with a lot of extensions, and <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Nelson was one of the first to point out this technology's potential for creating social forms directed by the individual members,</font> who are beyond the command of any old-fashioned, mainframe-type central control. He is enthused by the personal power that comes with having ready access to usable forms of information -- the bite of the old hacker apple -- and zealous about preserving the freedom to explore it in your own way:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">我们这些从小就热衷于相信自由、多元主义和思想开放等让我们的国家变得伟大的理想的人，很难忽视这种开放的希望。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">自由主义者关于开放和激动人心的思想可能会驱散现在笼罩在我们土地上的视频麻醉，就像一团雾。我希望看到希罗多德、诺查丹玛斯和马修·布兰恩的作品像罗德·麦昆的作品一样容易理解，以及文艺复兴时期的艺术和未来的电影——一个包罗万象的图画书百科全书喧嚣的涂鸦世界，整个作品。</font></font>

        <p><font size="-1">如果这一切听起来像是一个疯狂的想法，那意味着你理解它。这是一个充满可能性的疯狂时代。在这个充斥着袖珍计算器、避孕药、火箭氢弹和卫星肥皂剧的时代，我们可以尝试在社会中创造任何我们想要的疯狂。</font></p><p><font size="-1">If this all seems like a wild idea, that means you understand it. These are times wild with possibility.

        <p><font size="-1">……我说这些世界很快就会实现。我们需要它们，它们会赚很多钱。软件正在开发中。但真正缺少的是那些有远见的艺术家、作家、出版商和投资者，他们能看到这些可能性，并帮助将这些想法变成现实。</font></p><p><font size="-1">. . . I say these worlds are possible soon.

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">纳尔逊所热衷的不是一项技术，而是一个<i>社区</i>。<a href="#vc/book">电子社区的概念不再仅仅是一个想法</a>。</font>配有粗糙显示屏的膝上型电脑已经逐渐普及。随着价格下降，视觉显示器将变得更加复杂，计算机的处理能力也将提高。Dynabook 和 ARPAnet 突然不再局限于研究实验室或军事官僚机构。<a href="#vc/book/666.html">在线互动社区</a>正在世界各地发展，这得益于使用调制解调器的青少年、携带公文包远程计算机的旅行商务人士、信息实用程序、计算机公告板系统和各种电信公社的完全自愿的努力。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">What Nelson is raving about is not a technology, but a <i>community</i>. <a href="#vc/book">The idea of electronic communities is no longer just an idea</a>.</font> Lap-sized computers with crude display screens are already on their way to being commonplace. The visual displays will grow far more sophisticated, and the computers' processing power will increase as prices drop. Dynabooks and ARPAnets are suddenly not limited to research laboratories or military bureaucracies. <a href="#vc/book/666.html">On-line interactive communities</a> are evolving right now, all around the world, through the wholly voluntary efforts of teenagers with modems, traveling business people with briefcase telecomputers, information utilities, computer bulletin board systems, and telecommunes of every stripe.</p>

      <p>泰德·纳尔逊从技术角度说出了少数人早已知道的事情——<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">通信和计算机技术的交汇将创造<a href="#vc/book">一种具有巨大可能性的新通信媒介</a>。</font>但他指出，向我们展示这些可能性的艺术可能属于不同类型的思想家，这些人与发明这项技术的人有着不同的动机和技能。古腾堡之后是塞万提斯。活字印刷之后是小说。正如艾伦·凯所指出的那样，文学是那个时代的软件。超文本的塞万提斯现在可能正在学习阅读。</p><p>Ted Nelson is voicing what a few people have known for a while, from the technical side -- that <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">the intersection of communication and computer technologies will create <a href="#vc/book">a new communication medium with great possibilities</a>.</font> But he notes that the art of showing us those possibilities might belong to a different breed of thinker, people with different kinds of motivations and skills than the people who invented the technology. After Gutenberg came Cervantes. After movable type came novels. As Alan Kay pointed out, literature was the software of the era. The Cervantes of Hypertext might be learning to read right about now.</p>

      <p>二十年前，创建分时系统的几百人开始对几种通过计算机中介实现的新通信方式感到兴奋。十五年前，加入 ARPAnet 第一个版本的数千人开始尝试新媒体——在日常工作中作为一种娱乐方式。大约十年前，另一群人开始专注于专门为促进分散社区之间的通信而设计的软件系统——<i>计算机电话会议</i>。</p><p>Twenty years ago, the few hundred people who built time-sharing began to get excited about several new means of communication that were becoming possible via computer mediation. Fifteen years ago, the thousand-odd people who joined the first version of ARPAnet began to experiment with the new media -- in their daily work as a way to have fun. About a decade ago, another group of people began to concentrate on software systems specifically designed to facilitate communications among a dispersed community -- <i>computer teleconferencing</i>.</p>

      <p>计算机会议的概念源自通常的意外因素的汇聚——在这种情况下，是 1948 年的柏林空运、智库发明的决策工具以及 1971 年的工资价格冻结。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">这个想法是建立一个系统，让被空间和时间分开的群体能够通过公共承运人通信线路以各种方式进行通信。</font>社区通信在柏林空运期间首次出现疲态，当时唯一能够与所有北约国家进行直接实时通信的机构是国务院，使用的是老式电传打字机。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">有人试图将所有这些机器连接在一起，而没有使用计算机来帮助组织信息流——这造成了典型的混乱，</font>也是新媒体诞生的经典故事。</p><p>The concept of computerized conferencing came from the usual convergence of unexpected factors -- in this case the Berlin airlift of 1948, a decision tool invented by a think tank, and the wage-price freeze of 1971. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The idea was to build a system in which computers make it possible for groups that are separated by both space and time to communicate in various ways, over common-carrier communication lines.</font> Community communication was first tired during the Berlin airlift, when the only agency with direct real-time communications of its own to all the NATO countries was the State Department, with its old-style teletype machines. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Somebody tried to wire all these machines together, without the aid of computers to help organize the message-stream -- which created a classic mess,</font> and the classic story of the birth of the new medium.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">在分散的会议中使用计算机调解的想法最早的发展与<a href="http://eies.njit.edu/~turoff/">穆雷·图罗夫 (Murray Turoff)</a>有关，</font>他是一个标准的古怪神童，他对每件事都有不同的看法，像他之前的其他年轻、有独立思想的思想家一样，他喜欢追随自己的想法，无论它引领他去哪里。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The earliest development of the idea of using computer mediation in geographically dispersed conferences is most widely associated with <a href="http://eies.njit.edu/~turoff/">Murray Turoff</a>,</font> the standard eccentric prodigy, the character who happens to see everything differently and who, like other young, independent-minded thinkers before him, liked to follow an idea wherever it led him.</p>

      <p>20 世纪 60 年代末，特洛夫为华盛顿特区的一家智库——国防分析研究所 (Institute for Defense Analysis) 从事战争游戏和其他类型的计算机模拟工作。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">其中一些游戏需要通过远程计算系统同时连接多个“玩家”。</font>由于这种经历，特洛夫开始对使用计算机来调解兰德公司开发的一种特殊过程感兴趣，这种过程被称为“<a href="http://eies.njit.edu/~turoff/Papers/delphi3.html">德尔菲方法</a>”，其中印刷的问卷和答案在专家社区中流传。德尔菲是一种对复杂情况做出快速集体判断的方法；特洛夫认为，这个过程非常适合当时在 ARPAnet 上展示的那种在线通信。因此，他开始尝试使用计算机化的德尔菲系统。</p><p>In the late 1960s, Turoff was working on war games and other kinds of computer-based simulations for a Washington, D.C., think tank, the Institute for Defense Analysis. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Some of these games involved connecting several "players" at once, via remote computing systems.</font> As a result of this experience, Turoff became interested in using computers to mediate a special process developed at Rand, known as the "<a href="http://eies.njit.edu/~turoff/Papers/delphi3.html">Delphi Method</a>," in which printed questionnaires and responses circulate among a community of experts. Delphi was a way to reach a quick collective judgment about a complex situation; Turoff thought the process was ideally suited to the kind of on-line communications then being demonstrated on the ARPAnet. So he started to experiment with a computerized Delphi system.</p>

      <p>20 世纪 70 年代初，特洛夫调到应急准备办公室，在那里他的工作与他对电话会议的直接兴趣无关。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他的上司发现他正在使用计算机终端试验未经授权的会议系统，并且出现了一些工作上的摩擦。但随后 1971 年的工资物价冻结，这一行动需要迅速收集和整理前所未有的大量信息。</font>特洛夫的上司改变了主意。德尔福会议系统及时准备就绪。</p><p>In the early 1970s, Turoff had moved to the Office of Emergency Preparedness, where his job wasn't related to his immediate interests in teleconferencing. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">His superiors found out that he was using his computer terminal to experiment with an unauthorized conference system, and there was some on-the-job friction. But then came the wage-price freeze of 1971, an action that required the rapid collection and collation of an unprecedented amount of information.</font> Turoff's superiors changed their minds. The Delphi Conference System was ready just in time.</p>

      <p>在整合过程中，系统设计者和使用者开始发现，该系统的某些功能似乎在在线社区中很受欢迎，没有官方的推动，而且通常与手头的任务毫无关系。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">例如，有一项功能被简称为“消息”。任何接入系统的人都可以在一种计算机化的黑板上给其他人留言。</font>就像黑板一样，你可以稍后查看你的消息，看看是否有人添加了注释。注释激增得如此之快，以至于人们开始开发筛选它们的程序。</p><p>In the process of putting it together, the people who designed the system and the people who used it began to discover that some of the system's features just seemed to become popular with the on-line community, with no official urging and often with no connection to the task at hand. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">There was, for example, a feature simply called "messages." Anyone plugged into the system could leave a message for anyone else on a kind of computerized blackboard.</font> Like a blackboard, you could check your message later and see if anyone appended a note. Notes proliferated so fast that people began to develop programs for sifting through them.</p>

      <p>当您希望能够只查看最后五条消息、只查看与特定主题相关的消息、查看来自特定人员或特定日期的所有消息时，该软件的奇特之处就显现出来了。与 ARPAnet 一起，人们也在努力构建电子邮件系统。这两个系统早期出现的一个独特功能是能够与特定受众进行交流，即使您不知道这些受众是谁。例如，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">如果您向主机指示您希望将有关 AI 研究、民间舞蹈和太空战争的所有未来消息路由到您的电子邮箱，那么任何了解这些主题之一的消息的人都可以联系到您，而无需知道您是谁。</font></p><p>The fancy part of the software came in when you wanted to be able to review only the last five messages, or only those relating to a particular topic, or all the messages from a particular person, or on a given date. Similar efforts to build electronic mail systems were also going on in conjunction with the ARPAnet. One unique feature of both systems that emerged early was the capability of communicating with a specialized audience, even if you didn't know who was in that audience. For example, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">if you indicate to the host computer that you want all future messages on the topic of AI research, folk dancing, and Spacewar to be routed to your electronic mailbox, then anyone with news about one of those topics can reach you without knowing who you are.</font></p>

      <p>他们还发现了以前的通信媒介中未知的东西——消息的内容也可以是地址。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">计算机会议系统远非一种非人性化的工具，它可以提高每个人联系共同感兴趣的社区的能力。</font>某些类型的电话会议软件的创建是为了能够发布有关西葫芦或微处理器（或应急准备程序，或组织空运）主题的消息，并确保将消息传送给所有需要了解这些主题的人。</p><p>They were also discovering something that had been unknown in previous communication media -- the content of the message is capable of also being an address. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Far from being a tool of dehumanization, the computer conferencing system could boost everybody's ability to contact a community of common interest.</font> Some kinds of teleconferencing software were created in order to make it possible to post a message on the topic of zucchini or microprocessors (or emergency preparedness procedures, or organizing an airlift) and be sure that the messages would be transmitted to everyone who needed to know about those topics.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">特洛夫认为，使用计算机中介信息系统最终创造了一些新的<i>社会</i>现象。</font>从 ARPAnet 上活跃的电子邮件流量可以明显看出，某种新的对话正在进行。从技术层面上讲，这些系统的用户能够共享计算机资源和研究成果，这是理所当然的。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">但事实证明，每当人们接触到计算机网络时，他们似乎都想用它来相互<i>交流。</i></font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The use of a computer-mediated message system, as Turoff understood, ultimately created several new <i>social</i> phenomena.</font> It was obvious from the vigorous electronic mail traffic on the ARPAnet that some new kind of conversation was going on. At a technical level, the users of these systems were able to share computer resources and research findings, as they were supposed to. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">But it also turned out that whenever people are introduced to a computer network, they seem to want to use it to <i>communicate</i> with each other.</font></p>

      <p>ARPAnet 上的人们花费数小时来编写消息。对于能够访问此类系统的少数人而言，关于人工智能和外交政策、航天飞机和太空战争、长篇大论、双关语、谜题、恶作剧和笑话的持续对话<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">成为一种电子茶水间和定制每日新闻媒体的结合。</font>所有其他新闻媒体都被归入新媒体的子集，因为将通讯社接入系统没有问题。元媒体似乎也培育了新的价值观。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">偶像破坏、辩论、不受约束的异质性利益权利似乎在新兴的在线社区中受到高度重视。</font></p><p>People on the ARPAnet devoted hours to composing messages. For the small community of people who had access to such systems, the continuing dialogues on AI and foreign policy, space shuttles and space-war, diatribes, puns, puzzles, pranks, and running jokes <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">became a kind of combination electronic water-cooler and customized daily news medium.</font> All the other news media were collapsed into subsets of the new one, since it was no problem to plug the wire services into the system. The metamedium seemed to foster new kinds of values, as well. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Iconoclasm, debate, the right to an unbridled heterogeneity of interests seemed to be highly valued in the emerging on-line community.</font></p>

      <p>在该社区的某些领域，像 Turoff 和 Engelbart 这样的人试图从网络通信行为中学习足够的知识，以帮助他们设计新的群组通信工具。美国国家科学基金会深切关注为该国 50 万科学家建立一种新的相互交流方式的问题，因此赞助了一些会议研究。在 NSF 的赞助下，Turoff 搬到了新泽西理工学院 (NJIT)，研究和改进这项技术。一个类似的项目已经在加利福尼亚州的 Menlo Park 开始，距离 SRI 和 PARC 不远，被称为<a href="http://www.iftf.org/">未来研究所</a>。</p><p>In some quarters of that community, people like Turoff and Engelbart were trying to learn enough from network communication behavior to help them design new tools for group communications. The National Science Foundation, deeply concerned with the problem of establishing a new way for the half-million scientists in this country to communicate with each other, sponsored some of the conferencing research. Under NSF sponsorship, Turoff moved to the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), to both study and improve the technology. A similar project had already begun in California, at a place called Menlo Park, not far from SRI and PARC, called the <a href="http://www.iftf.org/">Institute for the Future</a>.</p>

      <p>Roy Amara 和 Jacques Vallee 以及未来研究所的其他工作人员共同开发了一个名为 PLANET（规划网络，因为它最初是针对政府和工业界的规划人员）的系统。Turoff 和研究所的系统都是从电子邮件、用于联合创作的共享笔记本空间、用于在线和离线群组通信的会议设施以及开放消息/公告板开始的。</p><p>Roy Amara and Jacques Vallee and other staff members at the Institute for the Future worked on a system known as PLANET (for Planning Network, because it was initially directed at planners in government and industry). Both Turoff's and the institute's systems began with electronic mail, a shared notebook space for joint compositions, a conference facility for in-line and off-line group communications, and an open-message/bulletin board.</p>

      <p>特洛夫及其同事从德尔菲会议系统发展而来的 EMISARI 系统，又演变成了 RIMS（资源中断监控系统）。根据特洛夫的说法，“自 1971 年以来，联邦防备局在每次全国性重大商品短缺和运输罢工中都使用过该系统”。</p><p>Turoff and his associates' EMISARI system that had evolved from the Delphi Conference System evolved again into the RIMS (Resource Interruption Monitoring System) which had been used, according to Turoff, by the "Federal Preparedness Agency in every major national commodity shortage and transportation strike since 1971."</p>

      <p>到他加入 NJIT 时，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Turoff 的兴趣已经超出了开发危机管理通信工具的范围：“我认为计算机化会议的最终可能性是为人类群体提供一种锻炼‘集体智慧’能力的方式，”</font>他在 1976 年指出。“计算机作为一种允许人类群体展示集体智慧的设备是一个相当新的概念。原则上，一个群体如果成功，就会表现出比任何成员都高的智慧。在接下来的几十年里，尝试设计计算机化会议结构，让一个群体用一个集体大脑来处理一个特定的复杂问题，这可能会给人类带来比迄今为止所有的人工智能工作更多的利益。”</p><p>By the time he joined NJIT, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Turoff's interest had expanded beyond the development of a communications tool for crisis management: "I think the ultimate possibility of computerized conferencing is to provide a way for human groups to exercise a 'collective intelligence' capability,"</font> he noted in 1976. "The computer as a device to allow a human group to exhibit collective intelligence is a rather new concept. In principle, a group, if successful, would exhibit an intelligence higher than any member. Over the next decades, attempts to design computerized conferencing structures that allow a group to treat a particular complex problem with a single collective brain may well promise more benefit for mankind than all the artificial intelligence work to date."</p>

      <p>1977 年，美国国家科学基金会资助新泽西理工学院建立“一个供地理上分散的研究团体使用的电子通信实验室”。到 1978 年 7 月，七个试验项目正在进行中，每个项目都是一个由 10 到 50 名成员组成的现有研究团体的一部分。该系统的建立是为了收集其自身运作的数据，以检验类似电话会议的系统可以提高研究团体效率的假设。</p><p>In 1977, the National Science Foundation funded the NJIT to build "an electronic communication laboratory for use by geographically dispersed research communities." By July, 1978, seven trial projects were under way, each one a part of an established research community of ten to fifty members. The system was set up to collect data on its own operations, in order to test the hypothesis that a teleconference-like system could enhance the effectiveness of research communities.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.njit.edu/CCCC/eies/eiesinfo.html">电子信息交换系统</a>（EIES，发音为“眼睛”）是那些永不停止的实验之一，因为实验对象就​​是不肯放弃它。这似乎发生在每一次新的交互式计算发展中——人们就是拒绝停止对系统的实验，并且在实验结束后不会放弃实验工具。正如吉姆·法迪曼在谈到 ARC 时所说，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">人们似乎不愿意被解除增强，就像他们一开始就抵制增强一样。</font></p><p>The <a href="http://www.njit.edu/CCCC/eies/eiesinfo.html">Electronic Information Exchange System</a>, known as EIES (pronounced "eyes"), was one of those experiments that never shut itself down because the experimental subjects just wouldn't let go of it. It seemed to happen with every new development of interactive computing -- people would simply refuse to stop experimenting with the system, and wouldn't give up the experimental tools when the experiment was over. As Jim Fadiman noted of ARC, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">people seem to be as reluctant to be deaugmented as they are resistant to augmentation in the first place.</font></p>

      <p>EIES 最初成立的目的是让会员能够向个人或团体发送私人通信，保留讨论主题评论的永久记录，并提供文本处理和文件管理服务，参与者可以使用这些服务来撰写联合撰写的论文。使用所有通信功能（如 Engelbart 的 NLS 系统）的协议并不容易学习。它需要一些决心，相信它是值得学习的，这也是研究社区成为实验理想实验室的原因之一。</p><p>EIES was first set up to enable members to send private communications to individuals or groups, maintain permanent transcripts of comments on discussion topics, and provide text processing and file management services that participants could use to construct jointly authored papers. The protocols for using all the communication features, like Engelbart's NLS system, were not easy to learn. It took some commitment to the idea that it was worthwhile learning, which is one reason why research communities were ideal laboratories for the experiment.</p>

      <p>EIES 迅速从纯科学研究团体扩展到立法研究人员和医学研究人员。70 年代末的另一个项目使用了 Engelbart 的 NLS 系统的修改版，使一个实验组中的 EIES 用户能够快速浏览时间敏感的技术信息。到 1978 年，政策制定者、艺术家、长期规划师和其他人开始加入 EIES。Roxanne Hiltz 和 Turoff 于当年出版了一本名为<i>《网络国家》的</i>书，在书中他们预测这种媒介将不仅限于少数实验室和智库。他们指出，任何带有调制解调器和适当软件的微型计算机都可以接入用户知道如何进入的任何网络。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">他们认为，开发更易于使用、覆盖全民的电话会议网络是缩小人们思想和想法之间距离的一种手段，是智力讨论和集体决策的论坛，是新型社区的典范，在这种社区中，一个人的年龄、性别、种族或外貌不再像一个人所说的话那么重要。</font></p><p>EIES quickly expanded from pure scientific research communities to legislative researchers and medical researchers. Another project in the late seventies used a modification of Engelbart's NLS system to enable EIES subscribers in one experimental group to quickly browse through time-sensitive technical information. By 1978, policy-makers, artists, long-range planners, and others began to join EIES. Roxanne Hiltz and Turoff published a book that year, entitled <i>Network Nation</i>, in which they predicted that the medium wouldn't be limited to a few laboratories and think tanks. They noted that any microcomputer with a modem and appropriate software could plug into any network its user knew how to enter. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">They saw the development of easier-to-use, population-wide teleconferencing networks as a means of reducing the distance between people's minds and thoughts, as a forum for intellectual discourse and group decision-making, as a model for a new kind of community where one's age, gender, race, or physical appearance would no longer matter as much as what one has to say.</font></p>

      <p>到 20 世纪 80 年代初，个人电脑的销量已达到数百万台，一些购买电脑的人希望接入他们开始听说的这些网络。EIES 一直属于精英阶层——你必须申请并支付相对较高的费用。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">但第一个公共信息实用程序很快就出现了。1979</font>年 6 月，美国电信计算公司在弗吉尼亚州麦克莱恩的一台主机上开始营业。读者文摘于 1980 年收购了该公司，并将其更名为<a href="#vc/book/7.html">Source Telecomputing Corporation</a>。读者文摘并不是一个以小规模活动而闻名的组织，它帮助该组织度过了早期计算机销量达到数十万台的时期。到 1982 年底，Source 拥有超过 25,000 名订户，并且每月新增订户数量超过 1,000 名。卫星、最先进的计算机和新软件的加入使该公司的用户数量达到 25 万。</p><p>By the early 1980s, personal computers were being sold by the millions, and some of the people who bought them wanted to plug into these networks they were beginning to hear about. EIES has always been something of an elite -- you have to apply and pay a relatively high fee. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">But the first public information utility wasn't long in coming.</font> In June, 1979, the Telecomputing Corporation of America opened for business out of a host computer in McLean, Virginia. Reader's Digest bought the company in 1980, and it was renamed <a href="#vc/book/7.html">Source Telecomputing Corporation</a>. Reader's Digest, not an organization known for small-scale pursuits, carried the organization through the early years when computer sales crept into the hundreds of thousands. By the end of 1982, The Source had over 25,000 subscribers, and a growth rate of over 1000 new subscribers per month. Satellites and state-of-the-art computers and new software were added to accommodate up to a quarter-million subscribers.</p>

      <p>对于那些能负担得起 100 美元入会费和每小时 7 至 22 美元连接费的人来说，The Source 及其较新的竞争对手 Compuserve 为计算机所有者提供了一个正在形成的电子社区。除了远程计算、电子邮件、通信、电话营销、软件交换、游戏、新闻采集、公告板和其他服务外，The Source 还提供所谓的“用户发布”。</p><p>To those who can afford an initiation fee of $100, and a connect-time fee of $7 to $22 per hour, The Source and its newer competitor, Compuserve, offer computer owners admission to an electronic community-in-the-making. Besides remote computing, electronic mail, communications, telemarketing, software exchange, game playing, news gathering, bulletin board, and other services, The Source provides something called "user publishing."</p>

      <p>由于订阅者是根据其电脑连接到 Source 主机的时间长短来付费的，因此可以根据连接时间的一部分向“信息提供商”支付版税。每次 Source 订阅者阅读有线服务信息时，信息提供商都会获得一定比例的分成。用户出版商也是如此。您必须为存储的所有内容付费，因此您的服务在订阅者中的受欢迎程度决定了任何出版物是否具有经济可行性。对于创意作家来说<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">，挑战是诱人的——只要您能让读者继续阅读，版税就会超过存储费用。艺术家现在可以成为出版商，直接面向观众。</font></p><p>Since subscribers are billed according to how much time they spend with their computer connected to the Source host computer, it is possible to pay royalties to "information providers," based on a portion of that connect time. Every time a Source subscriber reads wire service information, the information provider gets a cut of the take. The same is true of user publishers. You have to pay for everything you put in storage, so the popularity of your service with the subscribers is what determines whether any publication is economically viable. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">To a creative writer, the challenge is tempting -- as long as you can keep your audience reading, the royalties will outweigh the storage charges. The artist can now be the publisher and go directly to the audience.</font></p>

      <p>我第一次接触到的两本电子杂志分别是<i>《Sourcetrek》</i>和<i>《Mylar's Warp》</i>。<i>《Sourcetrek》</i>的副标题是《穿越电子虚空的旅程》，由“Sourcetronaut Dave”（又名“Sourcevoid Dave”）出版。当您命令 The Source 连接您到<i>Sourcetrek</i>时，屏幕上会出现一系列菜单，以及有关这些选项的不同统计数据列表——阅读时间、阅读次数、上次阅读的确切时间。我选择了第一篇“文章”，标题为《Hello》，内容（部分）如下：</p><p>Two electronic magazines I encountered my first time out were called <i>Sourcetrek</i> and <i>Mylar's Warp</i>. <i>Sourcetrek</i>, subtitled "Journeys through the Electronic Void," is put out by "Sourcetronaut Dave," aka "Sourcevoid Dave." When you give The Source the command to connect you to <i>Sourcetrek</i>, you get a choice of menus on your screen, along with a list of different statistics about the choices -- reading time, number of times read, the exact time it was last read. I selected the first "article," entitled "Hello," which went (in part) as follows:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">你好。</font>

        <p><font size="-1">我是“Sourcevoid”戴夫。否则就是<a href="#vc/book/9.html">戴维·休斯</a>。</font></p><p><font size="-1">I am "Sourcevoid" Dave. <a href="#vc/book/9.html">David Hughes</a> otherwise.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">我出生在科罗拉多州，我的祖先是固执的威尔士人，他们从来不对国王忠诚。这或许就是为什么我满足于做一个特立独行的人，拥有威尔士人的想象力。</font></p><p><font size="-1">I was born in Colorado, descended from stubborn Welshmen who were never too loyal to the king. Which is probably why I am content being a maverick of sorts, with a Welsh imagination.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">我住在历史悠久的老科罗拉多城，位于海拔 14,114 英尺的派克峰山脚下。</font></p><p><font size="-1">I live in Historic Old Colorado City at the base of 14,114 foot Pike's Peak.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">我在 1984 年的电子小屋里工作，拥有各种微型计算机和电信工具......</font></p><p><font size="-1">I work out of my 1984 Electronic Cottage with a variety of microcomputer and telecommunications tools. . . .</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">我是一个幸福的已婚中年家庭男人，见识过足够多的大政府、大产业、大政治事业（无论是左派的还是右派的），现在更喜欢在一个小房子里、小社区里经营一家小公司，与一些小组织合作，使用一台小型计算机来实现这一切。</font></p><p><font size="-1">I am a happily married middle-aged family man who has seen enough of Big Government, Big Industry, Big political Causes -- either of the left or the right -- to now prefer to operate a small business out of a small house, in a small neighborhood, working with small organizations, using a small computer to make it all possible.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">我还有一个小型计算机公告板，用来将我当地的朋友与我的大脑联系起来——异步的，并且使用高雅的英语书面形式。……</font></p><p><font size="-1">I also have a small computer bulletin-board to link my local friends with my brain -- asychronously and in the noble written form of English. . . .</font></p>
      

      <p>戴夫有自己的见解、诗歌和故事要讲。他通过调制解调器给世界各地的学生上课。所有订阅者都可以自费阅读他的文章，也可以通过电子邮件回复，如果他们愿意，也可以自费。我读过的另一本电子杂志是<a href="http://members.aol.com/ffloyd/resume.html">弗洛伊德·弗拉纳</a>根的<i>电子连载《Mylar's Warp》</i>，完全是虚构的。任何连载背后的想法都是一样的——作家必须让文章保持有趣，才能吸引读者的注意力。<a href="http://members.aol.com/ffloyd/resume.html"></a></p><p>Dave has opinions and poems and stories to tell. He teaches classes via modem to students around the world. And all subscribers can read what he has to say, at their own expense, and reply by electronic mail if they wish, also at their own expense. The other electronic magazine I sampled, <i>Mylar's Warp, an Electronic Serial</i>, by <a href="http://members.aol.com/ffloyd/resume.html">Floyd Flanagan</a>, was strictly fictional. The idea is the same idea behind any serial -- the writer has to keep it interesting in order to keep the readers' attention.</p>

      <p>第 1 章的标题是“冰上的思考”，在我意识到我花了多少连接时间之前，我读了这么多内容：</p><p>The title of Chapter 1 was "Reflections on Ice," and this is as much as I read before I realized how much I was spending in connect time:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">我知道我快要冻死了。本来我什么感觉都没有的。哈！每分钟都有傻瓜出生。你被活活冻死了，并不意味着你不会冻死。我可能慢了下来，但我并不笨。我肯定快要冻死了。</font>

        <p><font size="-1">那么，我是怎么来到这里的？没有理由不重温一千一百万遍。没有别的事可做。我是来自犹他州皮博迪的约翰尼·迈拉。皮博迪因黛娜而出名，黛娜是一个真人大小的豌豆绿色水泥恐龙复制品，就像我一样，被时间冻结了……</font></p><p><font size="-1">So, how did I get here? No reason not to go over it again for the eleven millionth time. Nothing else to do. I'm Johnny Mylar, from Peabody, Utah. Peabody's claim to fame was Dinah, a life-sized pea-green cement replica of a dinosaur, like me, frozen out of time. . . .</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">不管怎样，这一切都始于我去更新驾照的时候，一位女士问我是否愿意在驾照背面贴上器官捐献者的标签。我告诉她，我以前从来没有想过这件事。于是，她解释说，如果我死了，驾照上贴着一张标签，医院就可以用我的器官来帮助那些失去眼睛、心脏、大脑、牙齿或其他器官的人。“当然可以，”我说。“只要是对的就行。”对于最基本的问题，比如性和死亡，我一直持漫不经心的态度。我不是总是从穿绿色短裙的小女孩那里买女童子军饼干吗？还有……”</font></p><p><font size="-1">Anyway, it all started when I was getting my drivers license renewed and the lady asked me if I would like an organ donor sticker on the back of my license.

So, she explained how, if I died and there was a sticker on my license, the hospitals would be able to use my organs to help people who had lost an eye, or heart, or brain, or tooth, or whatever. "Sure," I said. "Whatever's right." I had always had a cavalier attitude concerning the most basic matters, like sex and death. Didn't I always buy Girl Scout cookies from the little girls in the short green skirts, and . . . "</font></p>
      

      <p>尽管 EIES、The Source、Compuserve、Dow Jones 和其他信息公用事业的订户群体仍然很小，足以维持高昂的服务成本，但随着配备调制解调器的家用计算机的普及，远程计算用户数量必然会从几万增长到数百万，这必将降低价格，使更多的 Floyd Flanagans 和 David Hughses 能够尝试他们的电子杂志。但大型信息公用事业并不是唯一存在的在线社区。在大型公用事业试图将个人订户整合到本质上是集中控制的分时技术的同时，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">另一种计算机互连方式正在催生一种更疯狂的网络文化变体——<a href="#vc/book/4.html">基于计算机的公告板</a>。</font></p><p>While the community of subscribers to EIES, The Source, Compuserve, Dow Jones, and other information utilities is still small enough to keep the costs of services high, the inevitable growth of telecomputing population from tens of thousands to millions, spurred by the proliferation of modem-equipped home computers is sure to lower the price enough to make it possible for more Floyd Flanagans and David Hughses to experiment with their electronic magazines. But the big info-utilities are not the only kind of on-line community in existence. At the same time that the larger utilities seek to plug individual subscribers together into what is essentially a centrally controlled time-sharing technology, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">a different way of interconnecting computers is giving birth to an even wilder mutant of network culture -- the <a href="#vc/book/4.html">computer-based bulletin boards</a>.</font></p>

      <p>计算机公告板系统通常称为 CBBS，或简称为 BBS，由一台由特殊软件控制的计算机和将其连接到普通电话线所需的硬件组成。该软件使一台小型主机能够在拨打电话号码时自动应答，并向远程计算机发送和接收消息。通过让这样的系统持续连接，并在一两个地方发布访问号码，小道消息会处理剩下的事情。一周后回来阅读所有消息，你会发现一个社区已经自行创建。</p><p>A computer bulletin board system, often called a CBBS, or simply a BBS, consists of a computer controlled by special software and the hardware needed to connect it to an ordinary telephone line. The software enables a small host computer to automatically answer when its telephone number is dialed, and transmit and receive messages to and from remote computers. By leaving such a system hooked up continuously, and posting the access number in one or two places, the grapevine takes care of the rest. Come back and read all the messages a week later and you'll discover that a community has created itself.</p>

      <p>1978 年，芝加哥的 Ward Christensen 和 Randy Seuss 开发了第一个让微型计算机所有者设置 CBBS 的软件。到 1984 年，这种系统的数量很难确定，但至少有数百个，可能很快就会达到数千个。要连接到 BBS，您需要一台个人计算机、一个调制解调器、电信软件和一部电话。将电话插入调制解调器，使用通信程序拨打 BBS 号码，然后当计算机连接时，主机系统会将文字显示在屏幕上并告诉您如何操作该系统。</p><p>The first software that enabled microcomputer owners to set up CBBS was created by Ward Christensen and Randy Seuss, in Chicago, in 1978. By 1984, the number of such systems is difficult to determine, but it must at least be in the hundreds, and probably will soon be in the thousands. To connect to a BBS, you need a personal computer, a modem, telecommunication software, and a telephone. Plug the telephone into the modem, use the communication program to dial the BBS number, then when the computers are connected, the host system will put words on your screen and tell you how to work the system.</p>

      <p>大多数人知道这些系统和地下用户社区，是因为电影<a href="http://www.students.uiuc.edu/~lneumann/wargames/"><i>《战争游戏》</i></a>、关于电脑神童的电视节目以及关于黑暗黑客的宣传。事实上，社区变化如此之快，以至于盗版、电话攻击、破坏性黑客，甚至对电脑工作原理的痴迷现在只占据了 BBS 场景的一小部分。许多公告板已经存在多年，但似乎更多的公告板每周都会出现和消失。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">在我自己对 BBS 世界的有限抽样中，在几个月的时间里，我遇到了青少年哲学家、各个年龄段和男女的朴实讲师，他们愿意就任何你想说的话题进行漫谈，我甚至偶然发现了一些在线宗教，既有控制论的，也有异教的。</font></p><p>Most people know of these systems, and the underground community of users, because of the movie <a href="http://www.students.uiuc.edu/~lneumann/wargames/"><i>WarGames</i></a>, television programs about computer whiz kids, and publicity about dark-side hackers. In fact the community has changed so swiftly that piracy, phone-freaking, destructive hacking, and even obsessive interest in how computers work now occupy only a small part of the BBS scene. Many bulletin boards have been in existence for years, but even more seem to spring up and die out on a weekly basis. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">In my own limited sampling of the BBS world, over the span of a few months, I encountered teenage philosophers, homespun lecturers of all ages and both sexes willing to ramble about any topic you'd care to name, and I even stumbled onto a couple of on-line religions, both cybernetic and pagan.</font></p>

      <p>一天晚上，我在公告板区遇到了克莱德幽灵怪物，克莱德最终向我介绍了一个号码，让我开始接触网络宗教。一切开始的方式和你浏览公告板时通常的方式一样。一串公告板号码让我找​​到了另一个活跃的讨论组，名为新泽西州的“日出”，由来自全国各地的随机访客组成，他们和我一样，还有一个核心小组，主要是当地人，他们似乎彼此认识，花了几个小时交换关于任何事情的信息。</p><p>I met Clyde Ghost Monster one night out in the bulletin board zone, and Clyde ultimately turned me on to the number that led me to the on-line religion. It started the way it usually does when you browse the boards. A list of bulletin board numbers had led me to a list of bulletin board numbers that led me to another lively discussion group called "Sunrise" in New Jersey, consisting of random drop-ins from anywhere in the country, like me, and a core group, mostly local, who seemed to know each other, and who spent hours trading messages about utterly anything at all.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">虽然有些论坛是专门为黑客、电脑爱好者、科幻迷、性狂或和平主义者开设的，但 Sunrise 似乎是一家电子饼干桶商店，旁边是一堵公共厕所墙。</font>我以“Johnny Jupiter”的身份加入了 Sunrise，当时我决定在一个非常有趣的正在进行的会议上发表我的看法，这个会议只包含“我最喜欢的人”的名单。Sunrise 社区发现，仅凭一份人员名单就可以表达很多东西，当时“Ivan Idea”发布了第一份名单，开始了这一切。几个小时后，名单的创建者都用“Tater Tot”、“Clock Speed”和“Clyde Ghost Monster”等名字签名。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">While some boards are strictly for hackers or computer enthusiasts or science-fiction freaks or sex freaks or peace types, Sunrise appeared to be a kind of electronic cracker-barrel store crossed with a public restroom wall.</font> I joined Sunrise as "Johnny Jupiter" when I decided to add my two cents to a very funny ongoing conference that consisted of nothing but lists of "my favorite people." You can say a lot with just a list of people, the Sunrise community discovered one night, when "Ivan Idea" started it all by posting the first list. The creators of the lists that followed within hours signed themselves with names like "Tater Tot," "Clock Speed," and "Clyde Ghost Monster."</p>

      <p>我每周都会查看 Sunrise，一天晚上，当我正在涂鸦回应一场正在进行的认识论辩论时，屏幕上出现了“SYSOP 请求聊天”几个字。我输入了“好的，让我们聊天”，按下回车键，然后开始与一位极其迷人的人实时交谈，通过快速输入的信息进行交流。</p><p>I checked in on Sunrise from week to week, and one night, while scrawling some graffitist reply to an ongoing epistemological debate, the words "SYSOP REQUESTS CHAT" appeared on my screen. I typed "OKAY LET'S CHAT," hit the return key, and started conversing in real time with an utterly fascinating individual, via an exchange of quickly typed messages.</p>

      <p>原来，主机位于克莱德幽灵怪物的卧室里，克莱德就是系统操作员。系统操作员就像仁慈的独裁者。如果他们愿意，他们可以把你从社区记忆中剔除，但话又说回来，他们的计算机是为任何想加入的人提供信息中介系统的计算机，从电子角度来说。克莱德幽灵怪物是一个无政府主义系统操作员，他更喜欢机智统治。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">几周后我才知道，克莱德幽灵怪物也是一个十六岁的女孩。</font>塔特托特是一个十七岁的男孩，和她上过高中。他们不知道伊万·伊迪格是谁。</p><p>It turned out that the host computer was located in Clyde Ghost Monster's bedroom, which made Clyde the system operator. Sysops are like benevolent dictators. They can weed you out of the community memory if they want, but then again, their computer is the one that provides a message-mediation system to anyone who wants to drop in, electronically speaking. Clyde Ghost Monster was an anarchist sysop, who preferred the rule of wit. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Clyde Ghost Monster, I was to learn weeks later, was also a sixteen-year-old girl.</font> Tater Tot was a seventeen-year-old boy who went to her high school. They had no idea who Ivan Idea was.</p>

      <p>克莱德告诉我，如果我想了解新类型的社区，我应该给加利福尼亚州圣克鲁斯的一个会议树公告板打电话，阅读“起源”的开场白。会议树是一种基于公告板的媒介，似乎特别适合进行社群交流中极其多样化的实验。会议树背后的想法是，你可以打电话、阅读或写信给各种会议，每个会议都包含一个不断分支的消息和子消息列表。消息的名称传达了它的全部内容，从狂热的热情到彻底的蔑视，各种不同的意见都可以在子消息和子消息的子消息中表达出来。</p><p>Clyde told me that if I wanted to find out about new kinds of communities, I ought to call a conference-tree bulletin board in Santa Cruz, California, and read the opening message for "ORIGINS." The conference tree is a bulletin-board-based medium that seems particularly well suited to wildly heterogeneous experiments in communitarian communication. The idea behind a conference tree is that you can call in and read from or write to a variety of conferences, each one consisting of a constantly branching list of messages and submessages. The name of the message conveys something of what it is all about, and all the variations of opinion from rabid enthusiasm to utter contempt can be expressed in submessages and submessages of submessages.</p>

      <p>我的调制解调器向主机发出哔哔声，当屏幕上出现“CONNECT”字样时，我按了两次回车键。出现一个会议菜单，以每个会议中第一条消息的名称列表的形式出现。我按照指示选择了“ORIGINS”。ORIGINS 首先给了我一个地址，让我写信去获取小册子，然后我的屏幕上出现了以下消息：</p><p>My modem beeped its way to the host computer, and when the word CONNECT appeared on my screen, I hit the return key twice. A menu of conferences appeared, in the form of the list of names of the first message in each conference. I selected "ORIGINS," as instructed. ORIGINS first gave me an address to write to obtain a brochure, then the following message appeared on my screen:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">ORIGINS 是在这台电脑上发起的一场运动（圣克鲁斯，408-475-7101）。Origins 始于 START-A-RELIGION 会议，但我们不称其为宗教。</font>

        <p><font size="-1">ORIGINS 部分是宗教，部分是西方形式的瑜伽社团，部分是和平运动。它是一个改善生活和同时改善世界的框架。</font></p><p><font size="-1">ORIGINS is partly a religion, partly like a westernized form of yoga society, partly a peace movement. It is a framework for improving your life and improving the world at the same time.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">该运动以“实践”为中心——你可以在日常生活中运用这些行动来建立有效的人际关系、社区力量和自我意识。所有实践都基于行动。不需要任何特殊的设备、环境、领导者、理论或社会地位。普通的日常时刻和人际关系中的人类普遍性构成了这项培训的基础。</font></p><p><font size="-1">The movement centers on "practices" -- actions you can use in everyday life to build effective human relationships, strength of community, and self-awareness. All the practices are based on action. None require any special equipment, settings, leaders, theories or social status. The human universals of the ordinary, everyday moment, and the personal relationship, form the basis for this training.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">ORIGINS 没有领导者，没有官方存在，没有出售任何东西。因为它是在一次开放的计算机会议上发起的，所以没有人知道所有的创造者是谁。</font></p><p><font size="-1">ORIGINS has no leaders, no official existence, nothing for sale. Because it started in an open computer conference, no one knows who all the creators are.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">这项运动才刚刚开始。上面提到的小册子推荐了七种做法（利用恩惠、寻求帮助并获得帮助、运用魅力、完成工作、使用魔法、观察自己、分享恩典），但这些建议只是开始。我们的想法是不断开发新的培训/行动方法，作为一个社区项目，然后通过任何可用的通信媒体进行讨论和分享。这项运动永远不会结束，因为它寻求一个永久创新的社区。</font></p><p><font size="-1">This movement has just begun. The brochure mentioned above recommends seven practices (Leverage a favor, Ask for help and get it, Use charisma, Finish a job, Use magic, Observe yourself, Share Grace), but these suggestions are only starters. The idea is to continually develop new training/action methods, as a community project, then discuss and share them through whatever communications media are available. This movement will never be finished, because it seeks a community of permanent innovation.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">希望能够创造一些可以让世界变得更美好的事物。第一步是让自己的生活变得更好。如需更详细地了解 ORIGINS，请从上​​述地址获取手册。如需了解该运动的发展历程，请阅读 START-A-RELIGION 信息及其子信息。</font></p><p><font size="-1">The hope is to build something which can make a better world. The first step is to make your own life better. For a more detailed overview of ORIGINS, get the brochure from the address above. To see how the movement developed, read the START-A-RELIGION message and its submessages.</font></p>
      <font style="vertical-align:inherit"><font style="vertical-align:inherit">尽管包含 ORIGINS 及其父会议、姐妹会议和子会议（BBS 术语中称为子消息和根消息）的会议树是我在几个月通过调制解调器进行的间接漫游中发现的最有趣的电子聚集地之一，但它远非唯一不寻常的电子聚集地。

      </font></font><p>宗教的利弊，以及创立新宗教或复兴旧宗教的可能性，似乎是一个热门的讨论话题。ORIGINS 就是控制论的一个例子。我浏览了一些基督教论坛和一个冥想者 BBS，但最令人吃惊的发现是异教派别，他们在会议树上发布了一条消息，宣布了自己的存在：</p><p>The pros and cons of religion, and the possibility of starting new ones or reviving old ones, seems to be a popular topic of discussion. ORIGINS was an example of the cybernetic variety. I ran across a few Christian boards and a meditators' BBS, but the most startling discovery was the Pagan faction who announced themselves with a message on a conference tree:</p>

      
        <font size="-1">女神之约是各种异教团体的伞状组织。它成立于 60 年代，旨在为北加州一个原本无定形的女巫集会团体提供一些结构（也许还有一些力量，因为一些团体受到政府的骚扰），但最终成员遍布各地。异教团体主要指女巫，尽管网上也有德鲁伊教团和其他严格不结盟的组织。女巫指的是任何亲和团体，其一般信条之一是，耶和华可能不是掌权者——他是一个由许多被误导和渴望权力的人创造的强大幻象，至高无上的存在是并且应该是更有幽默感和同情心的人，更不用说爱了。简而言之，如果说它比其他任何方式都好，那么它很可能就是异教的。这些定义是排除性的，因为定义整个异教运动的一种方式是将其定义为一个相信对更多事情说“是”的团体。女巫集会是一群女巫的亲和团体。这个名字很古老。有些女巫集会有着严格的行为准则和礼仪规则，而另一些则时不时地聚在一起闲聊。总的来说，女巫的聚会是所有团体中最好的。加州地区还有另一个组织，名为新改革正统金色黎明教团，它始于 60 年代，最初是为了开玩笑，目前拥有数千名成员，其中许多人显然可以指望参加聚会。顺便说一句，为了开玩笑而成立最大的伞状组织通常是异教徒的做法。很多女巫都计算过，而这棵树上可能有一群女巫懒得表明自己的身份。（女巫没有识别标记——除了眼睛里那滑稽的光芒。）</font>
      

      <p>无论是古代还是现代，宗教作为 BBS 讨论话题仍然不如性那么受欢迎。有<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">一定比例的论坛完全以性为导向。</font>问题过去在于系统上根本没有女性，但这种情况似乎正在迅速改变。以性为导向的 CBBS 和电话约会论坛是进入另一种亚文化的入口，其中一些成员使用该系统安排与合适的伴侣的现实生活约会，但大多数人使用该系统来实现幻想中的性生活，包括与其他匿名参与者进行热烈的对话。</p><p>Religion, ancient or modern, is still less popular than sex as a topic for BBS discussion. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">A certain steady percentage of boards are entirely sexually oriented.</font> The problem used to be that there simple weren't any females on the system, but that appears to be changing rapidly. Sexually oriented CBBS and dial-a-date boards are an entrance into yet another subculture, some members of which use the system to arrange real-life assignations with compatible companions, but most of whom use the system to live out fantasy sex lives consisting of hot dialogues with other anonymous participants.</p>

      <p>由于计算机程序可以像文字或数字一样轻松地通过电话线传送，因此有些委员会从事软件盗版活动——分发专有软件而不支付许可费。其他委员会则分发“公有领域”软件作为社区服务。有些委员会提供访问特殊信息的权限，如内部通讯，并发放密码和收费连接时间。有些委员会是独家的，许多委员会对谁可以写和读消息的规定很混乱。</p><p>Because computer programs can be sent over the telephone wires as easily as words or numbers, some boards engage in software piracy -- passing along proprietary software without paying the licensing fee. Others dispense "public domain" software as a community service. some of them offer access to special information, like an insider newsletter, and issue passwords and bill for connect-time. Some are exclusive, and many are promiscuous, about who is allowed to write as well as read messages.</p>

      <p>然后，有些人开始将<i>临时的</i>在线社区用作艺术形式，并作为改变社区和城市等较大社区意识的实验。1983 年，西雅图一个自称为“<i>隐形西雅图”</i>的文学团体发起创作了一部十五章的神秘故事，由该市 50 万公民中的代表性样本撰写。就更标准的网络类型而言，集体小说并不是一种新形式。EIES 几年前开始连载，其中不同的作家扮演各种角色，并以会议的方式撰写故事。</p><p>Then there are folks who are starting to use <i>temporary</i> on-line communities as art forms and as experiments in changing the consciousness of larger communities like neighborhoods and cities. In 1983, a literary group in Seattle that called itself <i>Invisible Seattle</i> instigated the creation of a fifteen chapter mystery story written by a representative sampling of the half-million citizens of the city itself. The collective novel was not a new form, as far as the more standard kinds of networks go. EIES started a serial years before, in which different writers took on the personae of various characters and wrote the story like a conference.</p>

      <p>然而，隐形西雅图派出“文学建设者”到城里寻找各行各业愿意贡献情节、文字和想法的人，然后通过临时安排的电子游戏机部件、两台较大的个人电脑、一些定制的软件和六台较小的个人电脑，将这些信息从起点传达到城市各处的其他节点。</p><p>Invisible Seattle, however, sent "literary construction workers" out into the city looking for people from all works of life who were willing to contribute plots, words, ideas, which were communicated from the point of origin to the other nodes throughout the city via a temporary arrangement of video arcade game parts, two larger personal computers, some custom written software, and six smaller personal computers.</p>

      <p>Xanadu、EIES、The Source、Clyde Ghost Monster 和 Invisible Seattle 与<a href="#OEBPS/Text/3.html">图灵</a>、<a href="#OEBPS/Text/4.html">冯·诺依曼</a>、<a href="#OEBPS/Text/7.html">利克莱德</a>等人创造的技术有什么关系？<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">族长们会如何看待信息航天员？</font>最早的软件预言家所预测的变化似乎只是一个开始。在 ORIGINS 会议树上萌芽的宗教——它的起源是否比几个世纪前在尘土飞扬的中东村庄中兴起的当今主流宗教更奇怪或更不可能？<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Xanadu 和 EIES 可能看起来像是新奇和不为人所知的媒体——但印刷机和电话首次出现时也是如此。</font></p><p>What do Xanadu, EIES, The Source, Clyde Ghost Monster, and Invisible Seattle have to do with the technology created by <a href="#OEBPS/Text/3.html">Turing</a>, <a href="#OEBPS/Text/4.html">von Neumann</a>, <a href="#OEBPS/Text/7.html">Licklider</a>, et al.? <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">What would the patriarchs think of the infonauts?</font> The changes that were predicted by the earliest software prophets seems to be only the beginning. The religion that germinated on the ORIGINS conference tree -- was its origin any stranger or less likely than the dominant religions of today that sprang up centuries ago in dusty Middle Eastern villages? <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Xanadu and EIES might seem like novel and unfamiliar media -- but so did the printing press and telephones when they first appeared.</font></p>

      <p>过去文化创新的形式可以帮助我们预测未来——但过去的形式只能让我们瞥见未来，而不是详细描绘未来。对当代人来说最重要的发展，如飞艇和电报，对他们的孙辈来说却成了可笑的时代错误。一旦某件事看起来像是预测未来生活方式的良好模型，意外就会发生。如果<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">说有什么教训的话，那就是我们应该习惯于期待意外。</font></p><p>The forms that cultural innovations took in the past can help us try to forecast the future -- but the forms of the past can only give us a glimpse, not a detailed picture, of what will be. The developments that seem the most important to contemporaries, like blimps and telegraphs, become humorous anachronisms to their grandchildren. As soon as something looks like a good model for predicting the way life is going to be from now on, the unexpected happens. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The lesson, if anything, is that we should get used to expecting the unexpected.</font></p>

      <p>我们似乎正在经历一个罕见的时代之间的关键时期，在新的社会秩序出现之前，许多实验短暂地蓬勃发展。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">如果前几代人的经验可以提供任何指导，那么最好的态度可能不是选择当今机构最有可能的继任者，而是鼓励一种实验的氛围。</font>泰德·纳尔逊比艾伦·图灵更疯狂吗？古腾堡考虑过公共图书馆的影响吗？</p><p>We seem to be experiencing one of those rare pivotal times between epochs, before a new social order emerges, when a great many experiments briefly flourish. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">If the experiences of past generations are to furnish any guidance, the best attitude to adopt might have less to do with picking the most likely successors to today's institutions than with encouraging an atmosphere of experimentation.</font> Is Ted Nelson any crazier than Alan Turing? Did Gutenberg think about the effects of public libraries?</p>

      <p>人们开始思考计算机和网络的用途，由此可以推测出新兴秩序的形态。但这有点像观看 20 世纪早期飞行器的老电影，这类电影每次在现代观众面前放映都会引来阵阵笑声，因为从喷气时代的角度来看，有些螺旋翼或十二翼飞行器看起来太可笑了。然而，每个人都能看到螺旋翼装置与直升机的原理非常接近。</p><p>Hints to the shape of the emerging order can be gleaned from the uses people are beginning to think up for computers and networks. But it is a bit like watching the old films of flying machines of the early twentieth century, the kind that get a lot of laughs whenever they are shown to modern audiences because some of the spiral-winged or twelve-winged jobs look so ridiculous from the perspective of the jet age. Yet everyone can see how very close the spiral-winged contraption had come close to the principle of the helicopter.</p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">强大的计算机技术已普及到世界人口的很大一部分，而综合信息处理全球神经系统似乎正在逐步建立，这已将我们推向一场我们知之甚少的社会变革，只知道这场变革将与以往的变革截然不同，因为引发变革的工具与以往的工具大不相同。并非</font>所有试图预测这场变革进程的人都像利克莱德或纳尔逊那样乐观。约瑟夫·魏森鲍姆尤其担心将计算机误认为人类思维或将人类视为机器的危险。</p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">The dispersal of powerful computer technology to large segments of the world's population, and the phasing-in of the comprehensive information-processing global nervous system that seems to be abuilding, are already propelling us toward a social transformation that we know very little about, except that it will be far different from previous transformations because the tool that will trigger the change is so different from previous tools.</font> Not all of those who have tried to predict the course of this transformation have been so optimistic as Licklider or Nelson. Joseph Weizenbaum, in particular, has voiced his fear of the danger of mistaking computers for human minds or treating human beings as machines.</p>

      <p>魏泽鲍姆的论点部分指出，计算机的发明和发展所外化的人性方面恰恰是最像机器的方面。体现这一方面的机器可以做一些人类无法做到的非常了不起的事情，目前它们几乎无法完成人类可以完成的更复杂的智力壮举。即便如此，它们正在接管我们文明的管理。在<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">我们开始将更多的决策责任交给机器之前，魏泽鲍姆警告说，相信所有人类问题和人类生活的所有重要方面都是可计算的，这是一个可怕的错误。</font></p><p>Weizenbaum's argument, in part, points out that the aspect of human nature that was externalized by the invention and evolution of computers was precisely the most machine-like aspect. The machines that embody this aspect can do some very impressive things that humans cannot do, and at present can do very little of the more sophisticated intellectual feats humans can accomplish. Even so, they are taking over the management of our civilization. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">Before we begin to give more decision-making responsibility over to the machines, Weizenbaum warns that it is a terrible mistake to believe that all human problems and all important aspects of human life are computable.</font></p>

      <p>魏森鲍姆警告说，这种“工具推理的暴政”可能导致暴行，在二十世纪的最后几年，<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">对国防部最初推出的任何闪亮新技术在大规模生产时可能对我们的生活造成的影响保持一些健康的怀疑并不是什么偏执。而且，毫无疑问，战争是最初的动机，并且一直是支持计算机技术发展的持续来源。</font></p><p>This "tyranny of instrumental reasoning" can lead to atrocities, Weizenbaum warns, and in the closing years of the twentieth century, <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">it is not at all paranoid to have some healthy suspicions about what any shiny new technology that came from the Defense Department in the first place might do to our lives when they get around to mass producing it. And there is no dispute that war was the original motivation and has been the continuing source of support for the development of computer technology.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">如果说人类大脑最初可能是标准类人猿模型的投石变种，那么事实证明，人类大脑也能够创作《登山宝训》、《蒙娜丽莎》<i>和</i>《<i>赋格的艺术》</i>。如果说个人计算机最初是作为弹道计算的辅助手段，那么，拥有低成本、高功率计算机并能使用自组织分布式网络的人们，就有可能拥有强大的防御能力，抵御任何集中组织的技术暴政。</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">If it is true that the human brain probably started out as a rock-throwing variation on the standard hominid model, it has also proved capable of creating the Sermon on the Mount, the <i>Mona Lisa</i>, and <i>The Art of the Fugue</i>. If it is true that the personal computer started out as an aid to ballistic calculations, it is also true that a population equipped with low-cost, high-power computers and access to self-organizing distributed networks has in its hands a potentially powerful defense against any centrally organized technological tyranny.</font></p>

      <p>利克莱德相信，人机共生将成为引领地球度过未来几十年危险的方法。其他人则用另一个生物学比喻来描述我们未来与信息处理技术的关系——<font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>共同进化</i></font><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">的概念，即<i></i></font>两种不同生物体之间达成的共同变化的协议，以某种方式相互作用，从而提高一个物种的生存机会，从而提高另一个物种的生存机会。</p><p>Licklider believed that a human-computer symbiosis would be the means of steering our planet through the dangerous decades ahead. Others have used another biological metaphor for our future relationship with information processing technology -- <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">the concept of <i>coevolution</i>,</font> an agreement between two different organisms to change together, to interact in such a way that improvements in the chances for survival for one species can lead to improvements in the chances for survival of the other species.</p>

      <p>也许另一个生物学隐喻可以帮助我们预见未来的转变。当毛毛虫变成蝴蝶时，它会经历一个生物学上独特的过程。古代观察家注意到，蝴蝶蛹所经历的变化与人类思维的变化相似，当人类思维经历与理解世界的全新方式相关的转变时——事实上，蝴蝶和灵魂的希腊词都是<i>psyche</i>。</p><p>Perhaps yet another biological metaphor can help us foresee the transformation ahead. When a caterpillar transforms into a butterfly, it undergoes a biologically unique process. Ancient observers noticed the similarity between the changes undergone by a butterfly pupa and those of the human mind when it undergoes the kind of transformation associated with a radical new way of understanding the world -- in fact the Greek word for both butterfly and soul is <i>psyche</i>.</p>

      <p>毛毛虫用丝线将自己弄伤后，其体内开始发生异常变化。某些细胞（生物学家称之为<i>成虫细胞</i>）开始表现出与正常毛毛虫细胞截然不同的行为。很快，这些不寻常的细胞开始影响其附近的细胞。成虫细胞开始在蜕变的蛹体内生长成群落。然后，随着毛毛虫细胞开始解体，新的群落连接在一起形成蝴蝶身体的结构。</p><p>After the caterpillar has wound itself with silk, extraordinary changes begin to happen within its body. Certain cells, known to biologists as <i>imaginal cells</i>, begin to behave very differently from their normal caterpillar cells. Soon, these unusual cells begin to affect cells in their immediate vicinity. The imaginal cells begin to grow into colonies throughout the body of the transforming pupa. Then, as the caterpillar cells begin to disintegrate, the new colonies link to form the structure of the butterfly's body.</p>

      <p>在某个时刻，一个由曾经在地面上爬行的转化细胞组成的综合超级菌落从茧中爬出，用五颜六色的翅膀飞向春天的天空。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">如果说人机关系的未来有一个积极的形象，那么也许它反映在信息文化的成虫细​​胞的形状中</font>——从拥有幻想放大器的八岁儿童到知识工程师，从特德·纳尔逊到默里·特罗夫，从克莱德幽灵怪物到 Sourcevoid Dave，从 ARPA 到 ORIGINS。</p><p>At some point, an integrated supercolony of transformed cells that had once crawled along the ground emerges from the cocoon and flies off into the spring sky on multicolored wings. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">If there is a positive image of the future of human-computer relations, perhaps it is to be seen reflected in the shapes of the imaginal cells of the information culture</font> -- from eight-year-olds with fantasy amplifiers to knowledge engineers, from Ted Nelson to Murray Turoff, from Clyde Ghost Monster to Sourcevoid Dave, from ARPA to ORIGINS.</p>

      <p>信息航天员的飞行并不是元老们开始的旅程的终点​​，而是他们最激动人心的软件之旅的起点。<font color="#9900FF" size="+1">计算机是我们的主人、仆人还是伙伴，都由我们来决定。</font></p><p>The flights of the infonauts are not the end of the journey begun by the patriarchs, but the beginning of the most dramatic software odyssey of them all. <font color="#9900FF" size="+1">It is up to us to decide whether or not computers will be our masters, our servants, or our partners.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1"><i>人类意味着什么，人类与</i><i>机器</i>究竟有何不同，哪些任务应该或不应该交给这两种符号处理系统，这些都取决于我们自己。但有些决定必须尽快做出，因为这项技术还很年轻。而且，决策必须由尽可能多的公民共同参与，而不仅仅是专家。从这个意义上说，在 21 世纪，我们是否都能看到人道、可持续世界的曙光，最重要的因素将是我们如何处理这些由我们中的一些人想出、许多人将要使用的机器。</font></p><p><font color="#9900FF" size="+1">It is up to us to decide what <i>human</i> means, and exactly how it is different from <i>machine</i>, and what tasks ought and ought not to be trusted to either species of symbol-processing system. But some decisions must be made soon, while the technology is still young. And the deciding must be shared by as many citizens as possible, not just the experts. In that sense, the most important factor in whether we will all see the dawn of a humane, sustainable world in the twenty-first century will be how we deal with these machines a few of us thought up and a lot of us will be using.</font></p>
