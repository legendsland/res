The combustive combination of radical politics and technological ambition is laid out so convincingly, in fact, that it’s mildly disappointing when, in the closing pages, Markoff attaches momentous significance to a confrontation between the freewheeling Californian computer culture and a young Bill Gates only to bring the story to an abrupt halt.

Wozniak, the story goes, built a computer to share with his friends at the Homebrew Computer Club, a ragtag group that began meeting on the San Francisco Midpeninsula in the spring of 1975. His high school friend, Steve Jobs, had the foresight to see that there might be a consumer market for such a machine, and so they went on to found Apple Computer in 1976.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>第二个故事将个人电脑的诞生地定位在 20 世纪 70 年代早期施乐公司著名的帕洛阿尔托研究中心。在那里，这家复印机巨头聚集了一批全国最优秀的计算机科学家，并给予他们足够的自由去构思未来办公室的信息工具。这群杰出的人才创造了一台名为 Alto 的计算机，它是当今台式机和便携式计算机的前身。尽管施乐因未能成功将该设备商业化而“错失了未来”，但 PARC 产生的数十个衍生产品成为了硅谷最常被提及的寓言之一的基础：1979 年，乔布斯参观了 PARC，并带走了图形用户界面的想法。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The second account locates the birthplace of personal computing at Xerox’s fabled Palo Alto Research Center in the early 1970s. There, the giant copier company assembled a group of the nation’s best computer scientists and gave them enough freedom to conceive of information tools for the office of the future. Out of that remarkable collection of talent came a computer called the Alto, the forerunner of today’s desktops and portables. Although Xerox is reputed to have “fumbled the future” by not commercializing the device successfully, the dozens of spin-offs that resulted from PARC became the basis for one of Silicon Valley’s most oft-told fables: that in 1979 Jobs visited PARC and took away with him the idea of the graphical user interface.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>这两个故事都是真实的，但都不完整。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Both stories are true, yet they are both incomplete.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>这本书讲述的是过去发生的事情，关于非凡的<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_fm02.html.page10"></a>政治、文化和技术的融合发生在不到二十年的时间里，而且发生在仅仅几平方英里的空间里。这种融合催生出了一个非凡的想法：个人计算，即一个人应该控制计算机的所有功能，而机器反过来会作为想法的放大器做出反应。到 20 世纪 60 年代末，这个想法已经在旧金山中半岛盛行。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>This book is about what came before, about the extraordinary <a></a>convergence of politics, culture, and technology that took place in a period of less than two decades and within the space of just a few square miles. Out of that convergence came a remarkable idea: personal computing, the notion that one person should control all of the functions of a computer and that the machine would in turn respond as an idea amplifier. By the late 1960s, that idea was already in the air on the San Francisco Midpeninsula.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>在施乐公司的科学家和自制软件爱好者到来之前，斯坦福大学两侧的两个政府资助的研究实验室正在研究个人计算的基础技术。这两个实验室成立于 20 世纪 60 年代，基于完全不同的理念：道格拉斯·恩格尔巴特在斯坦福研究所的增强人类智力研究中心致力于这一理念：强大的计算机将能够大大提高人类思维的能力。相比之下，约翰·麦卡锡的斯坦福人工智能实验室最初的目标是创造一种模拟人类智能。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Before the arrival of the Xerox scientists and the Homebrew hobbyists, the technologies underlying personal computing were being pursued at two government-funded research laboratories located on opposite sides of Stanford University. The two labs had been founded during the sixties, based on fundamentally different philosophies: Douglas Engelbart’s Augmented Human Intellect Research Center at Stanford Research Institute was dedicated to the concept that powerful computing machines would be able to substantially increase the power of the human mind. In contrast, John McCarthy’s Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory began with the goal of creating a simulated human intelligence.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>一组人致力于增强人类思维，另一组人则致力于取代人类思维。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>One group worked to augment the human mind; the other to replace it.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>尽管这两个团队在 60 年代只是偶尔接触，但每个实验室中都有少数研究人员和工程师，他们很早就了解当时在圣克拉拉谷扎根的微电子行业的一个基本事实：与任何以前的技术不同，硅芯片的本质将不可避免地导致计算能力的提高。此外，随着蚀刻在硅晶片上的晶体管尺寸缩小，该过程的速度将加快。晶体管尺寸每缩小一半，芯片上电路的面积就会增加四倍。计算机速度和容量将继续提高，而成本会下降，计算机尺寸会缩小。这是一个直截了当的见解，但对于那些迈出这一步的人来说，这相当于服用了迷幻药。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Although the two groups had only sporadic contact during the sixties, within each lab was a handful of researchers and engineers who early on understood a fundamental truth about the microelectronics industry then taking root in Santa Clara Valley: Unlike with any previous technologies, the very nature of the silicon chip would inexorably lead to an increase in the power of computing. Moreover, as the transistors etched onto silicon wafers shrank in size, the pace of the process would accelerate. For each reduction of the size of transistors by half, the area for circuits on a chip quadrupled. Computer speed and capacity would continue to increase while costs fell and the size of computers shrank. It was a straightforward insight, but for those who made the leap it was the mind-expanding equivalent of taking a psychedelic drug.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>1965 年，英特尔联合创始人戈登·摩尔注意到了这一现象，<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_fm02.html.page11"></a>后来，摩尔定律成为硅谷的主导原则。到了 20 世纪 80 年代和 90 年代，摩尔定律成为硅谷几乎所有领域的基本假设，从技术到商业、教育，甚至文化。摩尔定律指出，晶体管的数量每隔几年就会翻一番。它规定，任何事物都不会一成不变；任何技术都无法摆脱后继者的影响；成本下降，计算能力不是以恒定的速度增长，而是呈指数级增长：如果你没有利用所谓的“互联网时间”，你就会落后。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>In 1965, Intel cofounder Gordon Moore noted the phenomenon, <a></a>which was later known as Moore’s Law and which became Silicon Valley’s defining principle. By the 1980s and 1990s, Moore’s Law had emerged as the underlying assumption that governed almost everything in the Valley, from technology to business, education, and even culture. The “law” said the number of transistors would double every couple of years.

The personal computer had the ability to encompass all of the media that had come before it and had the additional benefit of appearing at a time and place where all the old rules were being questioned.

Early in 2001, I met with Apple’s cofounder, Steve Jobs. I have interviewed Jobs dozens of times over two decades and have come to know his moods well. This was not one of our better conversations. A photographer had accompanied me, and if there is one way to insure that Apple’s mercurial chief executive will be irritated, it is to attempt to take his picture during an interview.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>拍了几张照片后，乔布斯就把摄影师赶走了，事情从此开始走下坡路。乔布斯的心情特别糟糕。然而，当我们的谈话结束时，他坐在一台 Macintosh 电脑前，向众多忠实粉丝演示他当天早上推出的一款新程序。iTunes 可以将任何 Macintosh 电脑变成数字音乐播放器，存储和播放 CD 或从互联网上下载的音乐。它包括一个简单的可视化功能，可以变出舞动的彩色图案，这些图案会随着音乐的节奏在电脑屏幕上跳动。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>After only a handful of photographs, Jobs threw the photographer out, and things went downhill from there. Jobs was in a particularly bad mood. However, as our session ended, he sat down in front of one of his Macintosh computers to demonstrate a new program he had introduced earlier that morning before the legions of faithful. iTunes was to turn any Macintosh into a digital music player that stored and played CDs or music downloaded from the Internet. It included a simple visualization feature that conjured up dancing color patterns that pulsed on the computer’s screen in concert with the beat of the music.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>乔布斯显然对这个功能很满意，他微笑着转过身对我说：“这让我想起了我的青春岁月。”我回答说，硅谷最著名的几位先驱者在 20 世纪 60 年代服用过迷幻药。这引发了出乎意料的坦率和热情的回应。众所周知，乔布斯从波特兰里德学院辍学，在帮助创立这家古怪的电脑制造商之前和之后都曾尝试过毒品并追求反主流文化的生活方式。尽管他现在乘坐自己的公务机环游世界，并且拥有<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_fm02.html.page19"></a>乔布斯个人资产净值超过10亿美元，但他与自己成长的时代始终保持着深厚的情感联系。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Obviously pleased with the feature, Jobs turned to me with a slight smile and said, “It reminds me of my youth.” I responded by mentioning the names of several of Silicon Valley’s best-known pioneers who had taken psychedelic drugs in the 1960s. That ignited an unexpectedly candid and passionate response. It is widely known that Jobs, a dropout from Reed College in Portland, had experimented with drugs and pursued a countercultural lifestyle both before and after helping found the quirky computer maker. Despite the fact that he now flies around the world in his own corporate jet and has a <a></a>personal net worth of more than one billion dollars, Jobs has maintained deep emotional ties to the era in which he grew up.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>他解释说，他仍然相信服用 LSD 是他一生中最重要的两三件事之一，他说他觉得因为他熟悉的人没有尝试过迷幻药，所以他们无法理解他身上的一些东西。他还说，他的反主流文化根源常常让他觉得自己在如今担任企业领导者的企业界中是个局外人。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>He explained that he still believed that taking LSD was one of the two or three most important things he had done in his life, and he said he felt that because people he knew well had not tried psychedelics, there were things about him they couldn’t understand. He also said that his countercultural roots often left him feeling like an outsider in the corporate world of which he is now a leader.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>三十年来，六十年代的原始精神已大为消逝。对今天的许多人来说，那个时代几乎就像一场历史性的罗夏墨迹测验：要么是理想主义时代，以抗议者将鲜花放入枪管为标志；要么是保守派评论家（如<span class="italic"><span>《新闻周刊》</span></span>专栏作家乔治·威尔）抨击的对象，无论是因为 LSD 的邪恶，还是因为感恩至死乐队的享乐主义毁掉了数百万人的生命。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Over the span of three decades, much of the original spirit of the sixties has been lost.

Today, the modern computing industry has become divided into two warring camps: On one side, giant Microsoft champions the private ownership of information. Software, the company believes, is a commodity to be bought, sold, and jealously guarded. Opposed to Microsoft are growing legions of computer programmers who have formed an open-source movement that is committed to the idea that information should be free and that shared software can be used to animate increasingly powerful computers.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>信息私有制论者和信息自由论者之间的分歧不仅分裂了计算机行业，而且也日益分裂了整个数字世界，影响了消费电子、唱片和电影行业。信息私有制的捍卫者认为，不受监管的信息可用性，无论是以文件共享的形式，还是以开源运动的信条的形式，都是对行业和创新的根本威胁。在微软和唱片和电影行业的带领下，人们大声疾呼，破坏者已经到了门口，<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_fm02.html.page20"></a>信息共享是数字时代的威胁，相当于共产主义在十九世纪和二十世纪对发展中的工业主义构成的威胁。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The schism between information propertarians and information libertarians divides not only the computer industry but increasingly the entire digital world, affecting the consumer electronics, recording, and motion-picture industries. The defenders of information as private property make the case that unregulated information availability, whether in the form of file sharing or in the doctrines of the open-source movement, is a fundamental threat to industry as well as innovation. Led by Microsoft and the recording and film industries, there is a great cry that the vandals are at the gates and that <a></a>information sharing is the digital-age equivalent of the threat communism posed to developing industrialism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>然而，当社会利益与私人利益相权衡时，允许信息不受限制地共享的后果就变得更加微妙。想想硅谷的根源。晶体管是在新泽西州 AT&amp;T 的贝尔实验室发明的，但这家电信巨头后来被迫根据与司法部达成的反垄断协议免费许可这项发明。硅谷的存在——美国历史上最引人注目的技术和创业热潮的产物——正是由于晶体管的强制普及才得以实现。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>When societal benefits are weighed against those of private interests, however, the consequences of allowing information to be shared without restriction become more nuanced. Consider the roots of Silicon Valley. The transistor was invented at AT&amp;T’s Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, but the giant telecommunications company was later forced to license the invention freely under the terms of an antitrust settlement with the Justice Department. The Valley’s very existence—the product of the most dramatic technological and entrepreneurial boom in the nation’s history—was made possible by the enforced availability of the transistor.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>同样，黑客共享信息的精神是个人电脑爆炸式增长的核心。在 20 世纪 60 年代和 70 年代初期，在反对越南战争、民权运动和广泛使用迷幻药的抗议活动达到顶峰时，个人电脑从少数由政府和企业资助的实验室以及一小群业余爱好者的工作中涌现出来，这并非巧合，他们渴望得到可以亲自控制并决定如何使用的电脑。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Likewise, the hacker’s ethos of sharing information lies at the very heart of the explosive growth of the personal computer. It is not a coincidence that, during the sixties and early seventies, at the height of the protest against the war in Vietnam, the civil rights movement, and widespread experimentation with psychedelic drugs, personal computing emerged from a handful of government-and corporate-funded laboratories, as well as from the work of a small group of hobbyists who were desperate to get their hands on computers they could personally control and decide to what uses they should be put.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>科幻作家威廉·吉布森曾经说过：“未来已至，只是尚未均匀分布。” <span class="xrefInternal"><span><sup><a href="#OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_not01.html.en_des_00000_00004">5</a></sup></span></span>这一观察对于一个微小的微观世界来说尤其正确，这个微观世界虽然局限于某个地方，但却对世界产生了深远的影响，就如半个世纪前 15 世纪的佛罗伦萨给世界带来了文艺复兴一样。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Science fiction writer William Gibson has said, “The future’s already arrived; it’s just not evenly distributed yet.”<span class="xrefInternal"><span><sup><a href="#OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_not01.html.en_des_00000_00004">5</a></sup></span></span> That observation is particularly true of a tiny microcosm that was as localized but has become as influential in the world as fifteenth-century Florence was when it gave the world the Renaissance half a millennium ago.</span></p><p class="spaceBreak" style="text-indent:0%"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="spaceBreak" style="text-indent: 0%"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent:0%"><span>这本书的灵感来源于几年前在加利福尼亚州索萨利托的一艘游艇上举行的一次热闹的晚宴。那天晚上，计算机行业先驱道格拉斯·恩格尔巴特与<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_fm02.html.page21"></a>一小群曾经为他工作过的人：比尔和罗伯塔·英格利什以及比尔和安·杜瓦尔。在场的还有特德·尼尔森，他是一位流动作家、发明家和社会科学家，可以说是计算机界的堂吉诃德。尼尔森是 60 年代恩格尔巴特的同代人，两人追求过许多相同的创新。</span></p><p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%"><span>This book grew out of a spirited dinner held several years ago on a Sausalito, California, houseboat. The evening was an informal reunion of a computer-industry pioneer—Douglas Engelbart—with a <a></a>small group of people who had once worked for him: Bill and Roberta English and Bill and Ann Duvall. Also present was Ted Nelson, an itinerant writer, inventor, and social scientist who can best be described as the Don Quixote of computing. Nelson was a contemporary of Engelbart in the sixties, and the two men had pursued many of the same innovations.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>然而，恩格尔巴特是第一个提出直接引领当今计算机世界愿景的人。他很早就意识到，计算的潜力远远超出了处理数字的范围。他预见到计算机将成为能够帮助人类交流和拓展其智力范围的机器。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Engelbart, however, had been the first to demonstrate a vision that led directly to today’s computing world. He came early on to understand that computing had the potential to range far beyond crunching numbers. He foresaw that computers would become machines that could help human beings communicate and extend the reach of their intelligence.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>当他在 60 年代开始他的征程时，计算机几乎完全是少数科学家、大公司和军队的领域。几年前，恩格尔巴特开始草拟一项了不起的计划，概述了一套基于强大计算机的新信息工具。从最初的灵感出发，个人计算机和互联网最终应运而生。恩格尔巴特是一个说话温和、头发早白的男人，他之所以能够在 1963 年启动一项由空军、美国国家航空航天局和五角大楼资助的尖端计算机科学实验，是因为他能够引起当时在五角大楼担任项目经理的几位有远见的科学家的注意。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>When he began his crusade in the sixties, computing was almost exclusively the province of a handful of scientists, giant corporations, and the military. Several years earlier, Engelbart had begun to sketch a remarkable plan outlining a new set of information tools based on powerful computers. From that original inspiration, both personal computing and the Internet ultimately emerged. A soft-spoken man with a mane of prematurely silver hair, Engelbart was able to launch in 1963 a leading-edge computer-science experiment funded by the air force, NASA, and the Pentagon because he had been able to capture the attention of several far-seeing scientists who were at the time working in the Pentagon as program managers.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>虽然恩格尔巴特的“增强框架”只是一个奇特的设想，但它是由一小群深受中半岛政治和文化氛围影响的研究人员实现的。事实上，在斯坦福研究所（恩格尔巴特在门洛帕克开始工作的研究中心）里，他的研究人员被视为极端分子。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>While it was a singular vision, Engelbart’s “Augmentation Framework” was brought to life by a small band of researchers who were deeply influenced by the political and cultural climate of the Midpeninsula.

The era was dominated by a belief that artificial intelligence was at hand and would soon create a world populated by thinking machines. Engelbart’s notion of creating work groups where human intelligence was instead “augmented” by computers was thought of as quaint and beside the point. It might be suited for the office, or it could improve the skills of a secretary, but it certainly could not be considered real computer “science.”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>事实上，恩格尔巴特的增强理念在很多方面都与人工智能的理想截然相反，后者试图用机器取代人类。人工智能在斯坦福研究院的其他地方和斯坦福校园的另一边都很流行，在那里，来自麻省理工学院的杰出数学家和计算机科学研究员约翰·麦卡锡正忙于创建自己的研究中心——斯坦福人工智能实验室。SAIL，也就是后来的人们所熟知的，是 1970 年开始在施乐 PARC 汇集的思想、人才和技术的第二个来源。然而，尽管 SAIL 和 Augment 在哲学上是对立的，但这两个实验室都拥有共同的计算机黑客文化和强烈的反权威主义观点。SAIL 由五角大楼高级研究计划局资助，处于其最具创造力和不受约束的鼎盛时期，是计算机界许多最具创造力的人才的家园。SAIL 既标新立异又富有创新精神。研究人员住在办公室上方的阁楼里，小组在地下室的蒸汽隧道中会面，从这种喧嚣中诞生的技术洞察力将有助于在接下来的十年重塑硅谷乃至整个世界。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Indeed, Engelbart’s augmentation philosophy was in many ways the polar opposite of the ideal of artificial intelligence, which sought to replace humans with machines. AI was in fashion both elsewhere in SRI and on the other side of the Stanford campus, where John McCarthy, a brilliant mathematician and computer-science researcher who had come from MIT, was busy creating his own research center, the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. SAIL, as it came to be known, served as a second source for the ideas, people, and technology that were to come together beginning in 1970 at Xerox PARC. Yet though SAIL and Augment were philosophically opposed, the labs shared a computer hacker culture and deeply antiauthoritarian outlook. Funded by the Pentagon’s Advanced Research Projects Agency, at the height of its most creative and unconstrained period, SAIL served as a home to many of the most inventive minds in the computing world. SAIL was as unconventional as it was innovative. Researchers lived in the attic above their offices, encounter groups met in the steam tunnels in the basement, and from that tumult emerged the technological insights that would help reshape both Silicon Valley and the entire world during the next decade.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>与恩格尔巴特共进晚餐时，我意识到，尽管我读过<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_fm02.html.page23"></a>虽然我对硅谷和计算机的历史了解甚少，但对那天晚上讲的故事并不熟悉。令我印象深刻的是，这些故事并不是关于技术，而是关于研究人员自己的生活、他们的人际关系、他们服用的药物、他们享受的性爱、他们听的摇滚乐以及他们参与的政治抗议。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>At dinner with Engelbart, I realized that, in spite of reading <a></a>widely about the history of Silicon Valley and computing, I wasn’t familiar with the stories being told that evening.

In 1922, the county had eighty thousand acres of plum orchards, but by 1960 they and local cow pastures were giving way to tract homes for the waves of engineers and scientists who were arriving in the area.

One day in his senior year of high school, he was sitting in class when he happened to look down the aisle at a row of his schoolmates.

At one point, Crane threw up his hands and ended up going from one manager at SRI to another looking for help in coping with him.

Hubbard, while he was the president of a Canadian uranium mine, had discovered psychedelics in the early 1950s when he participated in mescaline experiments at the University of Vancouver. He found LSD in 1955, and in addition to Huxley, Heard, and perhaps more than one thousand others during the 1950s, he introduced the drug to Stolaroff and indirectly to a small group of engineers who formed a splinter group from the Rathbuns’ Sequoia Seminar.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>在从赫德那里得知哈伯德之后，斯托拉罗夫就忘记了他，直到亚历山大·波尼亚托夫提到曾见过这位<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch01.html.page51"></a>加拿大著名的人物，他声称自己能够使用 LSD 治愈多种疾病，包括酗酒。第二次听说他后，斯托拉罗夫决定坐下来给哈伯德写一封长信，讲述他在红杉研讨会上的精神之旅以及他对 LSD 的兴趣。不久之后，哈伯德给他打了电话，然后很快去了他在 Ampex 的办公室。那次会面彻底改变了斯托拉罗夫的生活，并最终使他失去了受人尊敬的工程师和公司规划师的职位。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>After learning of Hubbard from Heard, Stolaroff had forgotten about him until Alexander Poniatoff mentioned having met this re<a></a>markable character in Canada who claimed he had been able to use LSD to cure a variety of diseases, including alcoholism.

It struck him that, if used as part of the Ampex product-design process, the drug could be a perfect tool for improving a company’s business. That insight set Stolaroff off on an even more curious quest, as he became convinced that psychedelic drugs could open new vistas of creativity in both engineers and artists. Even before LSD was in widespread use, this was a controversial notion, and remains so today, as an angry debate continues over whether enhancing creativity is possible with chemical substances. The most celebrated scientist to have explored the effect of psychedelic drug use has been Kerry Mullis, the winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his discovery of the process known as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a crucial technique underlying much of modern biotechnology.<span class="xrefInternal"><span><sup><a href="#OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_not01.html.en_des_00001_00019">20</a></sup></span></span> Possibly the question is so cloudy because the psychic costs are potentially so high: Despite intriguing evidence of positive effects in the first years of LSD experimentation, there were also incidents of psychotic outcomes as well.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>斯托拉罗夫对这些批评性报道不以为然，他相信，有了哈伯德对这种药物的熟悉，他可以避免任何负面影响。当时，他已成为 Ampex 负责长期规划的总裁助理，也是该公司管理委员会的成员。他向高管团队提出了基于 LSD 的研究项目的想法，但立即遭到了否决。斯托拉罗夫辩称，他自己对这种药物的体验以及哈伯德对这种药物的体验表明，在商业背景下探索这种药物是值得的，但<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch01.html.page54"></a>对公司最宝贵资源的大脑进行篡改对于执行委员会来说实在是太过难以接受。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Stolaroff brushed off the critical reports, confident that, armed with Hubbard’s familiarity with the drug, he could avoid any of its negative consequences.

He proposed the idea of an LSD-based research project to the executive group, but it was immediately rejected.

Roy Kepler had been a World War II conscientious objector, who in the early 1950s had founded the lively Menlo Park institution.

A crowd of students was sitting around talking about the philosophical issues related to the protest. Was there any philosophical justification for killing another? Was there a God?

It was Moore who would be the first to try to make the direct connection between computer hacking and the outside world. Indeed, his life was like a runaway billiard ball. He never intended to provide the spark that would create the personal-computer industry, but was merely attempting to extend his draft-resistance community-organizer politics with the help of an eclectic group of engineering misfits. It just got a little out of hand. Throughout it all, he remained remarkably unaffected, acting as a solitary individual and a wanderer with an uncompromising moral sense and an inability to comprehend why others were not able to see what he saw so clearly and take the same actions.

After leaving the service in 1958, he had planned to go to graduate school at the University of California at Berkeley and showed up there looking for a research assistant position. He had been accepted into the graduate program in civil engineering, but he found the Berkeley campus to be remarkably inhospitable. A quiet man with an easy and open smile, English was stunned by the snobbery of professors and researchers. No one showed the slightest interest in the young engineer, and so on an impulse he decided to call SRI about the possibility of a job.

He wrote several draft versions of papers exploring what he had come to call the concept of the “man-machine interface.” Historically, machines had only handled materials or generated power, but now, by adding information, it became possible to control their actions by programming them. For the first time, it was possible to consider using computers as something other than mere calculators.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>恩格尔巴特的理念强调机器与用户之间的互动，这在当时是闻所未闻的。正如他所写，“计算机世界应该经历类似的演变。我们现在处于大型机器的阶段，正式安排好了，但我们很快就会进入新的应用阶段，人类在追求职业目标的过程中，在持续的控制下指挥信息的移动和操纵。”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Engelbart’s ideas stressed interaction between a machine and its user, an idea that was unheard-of at the time.

However, like the researchers at PARC who were to follow him a decade later, he was looking well beyond the idea of an isolated machine. He always couched his vision in terms of a work-group community and not the isolated individual. It was an idea that was to gather momentum toward the end of the decade when Engelbart’s group was picked by the Pentagon’s Advanced Research Projects Agency to become one of the first two nodes of the ARPAnet, what J. C. R. Licklider thought of as an “intergalactic computer network” that would weave together an expanding community of scientific researchers and engineers.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>在他和 Hew Crane 一起前往费城之前<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch02.html.page70"></a>1960 年 1 月，恩格尔巴特提出了他的扩展思想，开始在 SRI 组织一系列关于增强人类智力的非正式研讨会。尽管他们没有计算机来探索他们的想法，但小组成员一直在摆弄原始 PC 应用程序。当时，最有效的简单排序技术是卡片文件系统。数据是手工输入到卡片上的，卡片的外边缘有穿孔。切割与各种属性相匹配的缺口使得通过将编织针滑过一叠卡片并摇晃就可以检索信息。带有缺口的卡片会从牌堆中掉出来；因此可以通过这种方式执行简单的统计操作。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Shortly before he traveled to Philadelphia with Hew Crane to <a></a>present his ideas on scaling in January 1960, Engelbart began organizing a series of informal seminars at SRI on the idea of augmenting the human intellect. Although they did not have computers with which to explore their ideas, members of the group had been fiddling with proto-PC applications. At the time, the most efficient simple sorting techniques were card-file systems. Data were entered by hand on cards, the outside edges of which were ringed with punched holes. Cutting notches to match various attributes made it possible to retrieve information by sliding a knitting needle through a stack of cards and shaking. The cards with the notched holes would fall out of the deck; it was thus possible to perform simple statistical operations this way.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>有时，该小组会邀请外部人员进行演讲，1961 年 2 月，恩格尔巴特在一份备忘录中宣布：“保罗·豪尔顿先生被邀请参加一次交流会。”他“领导着政府情报活动中的一个大型小组，负责管理大量信息文件。他博览群书，游历广泛，善于交谈，我们应该会发现这次会议非常令人振奋。” <span class="xrefInternal"><span><sup><a href="#OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_not01.html.en_des_00002_00002">3</a></sup></span></span></span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>On occasion, the group would invite outsiders to make presentations, and in February of 1961 Engelbart announced in a memo: “Mr. Paul Howerton has been invited for a give and take session.” He “heads a large group within a government intelligence activity and is responsible for the management of a very large file of information. He is the widely read, widely traveled sort of person that is a good talker, and we should find the session very stimulating.”<span class="xrefInternal"><span><sup><a href="#OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_not01.html.en_des_00002_00002">3</a></sup></span></span></span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>该小组还探索了一系列提高会议效率和生产力的技术，这初步表明恩格尔巴特对社会学和组织理论的兴趣不亚于对技术的兴趣。在他看来，增强技术始终是一个完整的系统，而不仅仅是一个盒子。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The group also explored a range of techniques for improving the efficiency and productivity of meetings, an early indication that what Engelbart was interested in doing was as much about sociology and organizational theory as it was about technology.

By April of 1961, the group had jury-rigged a voting system involving yes and no voting options and explored the idea of letting a speaker continue until his favorable rating fell below 50 percent. The group also came up with a “covert interrupt procedure,” which involved multiple pushes of a button by each of the meeting participants.

He wasn’t a dictator, and he had none of the enfant terrible qualities that would later become the stock-in-trade of some of Silicon Valley’s most imposing figures. Instead, he evinced a kind of unpretentious determination, coupled with a slight sense of fatalism suggesting that the world might fall apart at any moment. Betraying that uncertainty, he noted in concluding the announcement of one of the early meetings: “One of the interesting features of this meeting is that yours truly, Doug C.

Doing so by long distance was a laborious process, but he tried. He had one programmer at the time, who wrote code in Menlo Park and then traveled to Santa Monica to run and debug it, and sometimes Engelbart himself flew down to work on the machines. But SDC had set up only a tiny display with a keyboard to provide access to the SRI programmers, and to make matters worse, the terminal was a long way from the computer itself, which was kept in a secure area. The machine was in time-sharing mode for only several hours each day, and it was so unstable that it crashed repeatedly. A frustrated Engelbart began to explore the idea of remotely connecting to the SDC computer from the Control Data minicomputer in Menlo Park using an early modem. Unfortunately his engineers were never able to make the system communicate reliably. As a result, for the next two years Engelbart’s fledgling Augmented Human Intellect Research Center began to build his system on a computer that had far less processing power than an Apple II of a decade and a half later.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>门洛帕克计算机使用了恩格尔巴特、克雷恩和英格利希在 50 年代共同改进的磁芯存储器。它的主存储器容量为 8000 个 12 位字符（略多于三页打字文本）。<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch02.html.page79"></a>它不是将信息存储在磁盘驱动器上，而是将信息永久存储在可容纳三万两千个字符的旋转磁鼓上。它还配有磁带存储系统用于备份，以及纸带和打字机用于输入程序。恩格尔巴特的机器的另一个奇怪之处是，它配备了一个 16 英寸的圆形显示器，可以显示十六行六十四个字符，并且只显示大写字母。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The Menlo Park computer used the magnetic-core memory that Engelbart, Crane, and English had all worked on improving in the fifties.

And if the larger vision of augmenting human intelligence initially eluded him, he quickly decided that Engelbart was doing the neatest stuff at SRI. He immediately took to the idea of manipulating text on a computer screen, and the experiments with pointing devices gave him the opportunity to build things.

He remembers that what today is called the cursor on the screen was at the time called a “CAT.” Bates has forgotten what CAT stood for, and no one else seems to remember either, but in hindsight it seems obvious that the CAT would chase the tailed mouse on the desktop.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>恩格尔巴特的想法是把一组设备（包括鼠标）放在一起，然后进行一个实验，让研究人员了解哪一种设备在选择文本方面是最好的。与作为测试机的微型计算机配合使用的屏幕被安装在计算机桌面上的一个框架中，看起来很像今天空中交通管制员仍在使用的圆形屏幕。作为实验的一部分，他们带进来的志愿者面临的挑战是看他们能多快多准确地找到显示屏上的某个字符。受试者会点击空格键，抓住指点设备，在屏幕上找到字符，然后按下选择按钮。从某种意义上说，他们都在玩一个游戏<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch02.html.page83"></a>世界上第一款电子游戏。鼠标毫无疑问赢得了比赛，但也有一些令人惊讶的结果。踏板立即被抛弃，光标键也是如此，但膝盖控制实际上提供了良好的效果，在某些情况下排在鼠标之后的第二位。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Engelbart’s idea had been to get a collection of devices, including the mouse, together and then perform an experiment that would give the researchers some idea of which one was the best in terms of selecting text. The screen that had been rigged to work with the minicomputer that would serve as a test machine was set into a frame that sat on the computer desktop, and looked very much like the round screens that are still used today by air-traffic controllers. The challenge for the volunteers they brought in as part of the experiments was to see how quickly and accurately they could get to a particular character on the display. A subject would tap the space bar, grab the pointing device, find the character on the screen, and then push a selection button. In a sense, they were all playing one of <a></a>the world’s first video games. The mouse won the contest hands down, but there were some surprising results.

Engelbart had a complete vision, but as he evolved it, his best ideas were cherry-picked by others and used to create one of the world’s most vibrant industries.

In general, Brand was a hard man to label. Unlike many in the sixties and seventies generation he later deeply influenced with the <span class="italic"><span>Whole Earth Catalog,</span></span> he saw the world from a perspective that in some ways was much more conservative and traditional. A Midwesterner who had come to Stanford via prep school at Exeter, Brand had taken training as a paratrooper in the late 1950s and served in the army in Europe. Toward the end of his tour of duty, he had worked at the Pentagon as a photographer, and in 1961 he had asked to go to Vietnam. He decided that since he had trained as an infantryman he wanted to par<a></a>ticipate in a real war. The military’s response was that certainly he could go, but he would have to re-up for another three years.

He filed the program and the group who were playing it away in his mind. It was to be six years before he returned to them.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>他对这次访问的记忆颇为深刻。他脑海中浮现的是痴迷于电脑的年轻人沉迷于游戏的画面，沉浸在灵魂出窍的体验中。这是布兰德在短时间内获得的第二个感悟。第一个感悟是他和家人的朋友迪克·雷蒙德一起拍摄沃姆斯普林斯印第安人保留地。现在，在计算机中心，他又有同样的感觉：这里是另一个世界，一个可能比他自己的世界更引人注目的世界。他偶然发现了多年后被称为网络空间的东西。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>What he did remember of the visit was telling. What stuck in his mind was an image of computer-obsessed young men in the thrall of the game, locked in an out-of-body experience. It was the second of two insights that came to Brand in short order. The first had been photographing the Warm Springs Indian reservation with a family friend, Dick Raymond. Now, in the computer center, the same feeling came over him: Here was a whole other world, one that was perhaps more compelling than his own. He had happened on the first inklings of what years later would come to be known as cyberspace.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>同一时期，他还偶然发现了斯托拉洛夫的基金会。当时迷幻地下组织规模很小，每个人都互相认识。五十年代，作为斯坦福大学的学生，布兰德读过赫胥黎的《<span class="italic"><span>知觉之门》</span></span>，后来结识了这位作者。他和一些游走于波西米亚边缘的朋友一起，探索过佩尤特，在军队服役期间，他经常前往纽约市，在那里他游走于“垮掉的一代”的边缘。在那里，他结识了垮掉的一代诗人格尔德·斯特恩，自 1949 年两人在一家精神病院相识以来，他一直认识艾伦·金斯堡。他和斯特恩以及一群朋友一起在哈德逊河上游的一座改建教堂里吸食过麦司卡林。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>He also stumbled around the same time upon Stolaroff’s foundation. The psychedelic underground was then small, and everyone knew everyone else. In the fifties, as a Stanford student, Brand had read Huxley’s <span class="italic"><span>Doors of Perception</span></span> and later met the author. With a number of his friends who were traveling on the edge of the bohemian scene, he had already explored peyote, and while he was in the army he had made frequent trips to New York City, where he hung out on the fringes of the Beat scene. There, he befriended Gerd Stern, a Beat poet who had known Allen Ginsberg since the two men had met in a mental hospital in 1949. With Stern and a group of friends, he had taken mescaline at a converted church up the Hudson.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>1962 年底，布兰德签约接管该基金会的<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch02.html.page88"></a>引导式 LSD 体验。临床接触 LSD 的过程与几年后迷幻药成为一种娱乐性药物时的情况截然不同。对于布兰德来说，一切始于接触 Carbogen，就像阿尔·哈伯德在服用 LSD 之前让迈伦·斯托拉罗夫体验其暂时效果一样。然而，对于布兰德来说，他们似乎在强迫他的大脑吸入过多的氧气并“熄灭”。他去了一个“非常有趣”的另一个宇宙，他认为那一定是“七个永恒”。当他回来时，所有一直在看着他的人都还坐在那里，他们的香烟只是少了一点。他认为 Carbogen 很棒，后来得出结论，相比之下，LSD 有点令人失望。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>At the end of 1962, Brand signed up to take the foundation’s <a></a>guided LSD experience. The clinical exposure to LSD was a very different process from what would become commonplace several years later when acid was a recreational drug. For Brand, it began with an introduction to Carbogen, much in the same way that Al Hubbard had introduced Myron Stolaroff to its temporary effects before taking LSD. To Brand, however, it seemed as if they were forcing his brain to take in too much oxygen and “flame out.” He went to a “very interesting” other universe for what he thought must have been “seven eternities.” When he came back, everyone who had been watching him was still sitting there, and their cigarettes were just a little shorter.

After all, the aims of the early LSD community closely paralleled his own passionate quest to augment human intelligence. Drug-induced creativity was not part of his original vision, but if it would make a difference it certainly might be a welcome addition to the process, which he referred to as bootstrapping: working in an iterative fashion in which each improvement would in turn accelerate the pursuit of further advances. In a way, bootstrapping was simply a restatement of the concept of exponential change, in this case applied to a human organization. The results of Engelbart’s own psychedelic-drug experience, however, proved disappointing.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>他的第一次 LSD 疗程是与一个小组一起进行的，由 Jim Fadiman 指导。Engelbart 被给予了 25 微克的“适量”剂量，然后花了四个小时进行冥想、听音乐和放松。实验前一天晚上，创造力研究中的每一位受试者都进行了大量的心理准备，旨在让他们相信在药物的作用下，他们将能够解决问题，因为该实验的基本前提是激励一群人，这些人已经花了至少三个月的时间研究一个困难的技术或创造性问题，却没有取得进展。这些问题应该是科学家们有很高的情感需求去解决的问题。午饭后，在 LSD 起效后，他们将被要求工作，而研究人员则在一旁观察。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>His first LSD session was with a group and was held under Jim Fadiman’s guidance. Engelbart was given a “modest” dose of twenty-five micrograms and then spent four hours meditating, listening to music, and relaxing. The night before the experiment, each of the subjects in the creativity study went through an extensive psychological preparation aimed at infusing them with the idea that under the influence of the drug they would be able to solve their problems, for the premise underlying the experiments was to motivate a group of people who had spent at least three months working on a difficult technical or creative issue and were not making progress. The problems were supposed to be ones the scientists had a high emotional need to solve. After lunch, and after the LSD had taken effect, they would be put to work, while the researchers observed.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>在小组环境中，每个人都在进步。电气工程师在设计电路；惠普机械设计师在改进照明设计；建筑师在设计建筑。但道格·恩格尔巴特却不是这样。他对第一次实验的反应几乎是精神错乱。在整个实验过程中，他只是盯着墙看。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>In the group setting, everyone was making progress.

Fadiman entered the room carrying a tray of small cups containing the dose for the evening’s experiment. Based on his conversations with Fadiman, Engelbart sensed that he was about to be given a lower dose than the others because of his reaction to his first drug trip. He unobtrusively shifted his position in the group about three places and continued talking as if nothing had changed. Sure enough, when Fadiman finally approached Engelbart, he had to rotate the tray so that he would receive the cup with a half dose.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>最后，第二次吸毒体验帮助了道格·恩格尔巴特的创造力，但它增强人类智力的能力尚不明确。恩格尔巴特在这次创造力课程中的贡献是他在 LSD 的影响下构思的玩具。他称之为“叮当玩具”，这是一个小水车，它会漂浮在马桶里，当水（或尿液）流过时就会旋转。它可以作为小男孩如厕训练的教具，激励他在马桶里小便。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>In the end, the second drug experience aided Doug Engelbart’s creativity, but its ability to augment human intelligence was less clear. Engelbart’s contribution to the creativity session was a toy he conceived under the influence of LSD. He called it a “tinkle toy,” and it was a little waterwheel that would float in a toilet bowl and spin when water (or urine) was run over it. It would serve as a potty-training teaching aid for a little boy, offering him an incentive to pee in the toilet.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>最终，迷幻药开始从中半岛少数知识分子波西米亚社区中脱离出来，并威胁要像一股巨浪一样席卷美国社会。最早向美国发出信号，提醒人们迷幻药的猛烈攻击已经到来，这是一家有影响力的杂志的特刊。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Eventually LSD began to escape from its niche in the Midpeninsula’s tiny intellectual bohemian community and threaten to break like a huge wave on American society.

The piece caught Engelbart’s eye, and he invited Evans to come to work for him part-time while he was finishing his Ph.D. in electrical engineering.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>这位年轻的研究员立即被他所谓的“大愿景”所吸引。当他到达 SRI 实验室时，他首先谈到了相似性，这一扩展性想法在 1959 年首次引起了恩格尔巴特的注意。他们最初<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch02.html.page96"></a>恩格尔巴特谈论的只是它在微电子领域的严格技术意义，但恩格尔巴特的目标要广泛得多。他还对“扩大”他的 Augment 工具的想法很感兴趣，试图扩大他的用户群体。这是恩格尔巴特整个职业生涯中一直在努力解决的问题——大部分时间都没有成功。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The young researcher was immediately caught up in what he referred to as the “big vision.” When he arrived at the SRI laboratory, one of his first conversations was about similitude, the scaling idea that had first captured Engelbart’s attention in 1959. They initially <a></a>talked about it in the strictly technical sense as it applied to microelectronics, but Engelbart’s aims were much broader. He was also interested in the idea of “scaling up” his Augment tools, in trying to expand his community of users. It was the problem that Engelbart struggled with—unsuccessfully for the most part—throughout his career.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>由于埃文斯不是程序员，他很难与那些忙于编写 NLS 系统的软件专家们相处。但他很快就发现自己的优势在于能够帮助传达恩格尔巴特的远大愿景，即建立一个由技术人员组成的“引导社区”，让他们学会如何以“高效”团队的形式一起工作。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Since he wasn’t a programmer, Evans had some difficulty fitting in with the software wizards who were busy coding the NLS system. But he soon found his strength in helping to communicate the big vision, expressed as Engelbart’s desire to build a “bootstrap community” of technical people who would learn to work together as a “high-performance” team.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>有时恩格尔巴特自己会找到这些追随者，有时则是比尔·英格利什 (Bill English) 找到的。人们通常从美国小型计算机研究界日益高涨的讨论中得知恩格尔巴特在做什么。在利克莱德的支持下，以及后来接替利克莱德在 ARPA 任职的他的门徒鲍勃·泰勒 (Bob Taylor) 的支持下，增强小组在 60 年代中期稳步发展。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Sometimes Engelbart himself found these acolytes, and other times it was Bill English who did. Often, people heard about what Engelbart was doing from the growing buzz in the nation’s tiny computer-research community. With backing from Licklider and then from his protégé Bob Taylor, who would eventually succeed Licklider at ARPA, the Augment Group grew steadily through the mid-sixties.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>华盛顿大学的四名年轻学生曾一起在计算机中心度过了很长一段时间，并成为了好朋友。他们后来都进入了斯坦福大学的研究生院，在那里，他们一个接一个地加入了 Augment 项目。1966 年，Jeff Rulifson、Elton Hey、Don Andrews 和 Chuck Kirkley 加入了他们的团队，当时第一个 NLS 正在创建中。Kirkley 并没有待太久，因为他与 Engelbart 就是否有可能编写研究人员想要内置到系统中的特别困难的软件功能发生了争执。这位年轻的研究生坚持说：“你不能这样做！”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>A group of four young University of Washington students had all spent long hours together at the computer center there and had become friends, and they all came to graduate school at Stanford, where, one after another, they found their way to the Augment project. Jeff Rulifson, Elton Hey, Don Andrews, and Chuck Kirkley came to work during 1966 as the first NLS was being created. Kirkley did not stay long, having quarreled with Engelbart over whether it was possible to program a particularly difficult software function the researcher wanted built into the system. The young graduate student insisted, “You can’t do that!”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>恩格尔巴特的回答是：“我不在乎，做吧！”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Engelbart’s answer was, “I don’t care, do it!”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>作为一名领导者，恩格尔巴特说话温和，但他对自己想要实现的目标非常专注，有时甚至非常热情。他的优势在于他从用户的角度看待事物，然后挑战他的程序员，让他们弄清楚如何将他的想法作为整体设计的一部分发挥作用。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>As a leader, Engelbart was soft-spoken, but he was remarkably focused and sometimes even fiery about what he was trying to accomplish. His strength was that he saw things from the point of view of the user and then challenged his programmers to figure out how to make his ideas work as part of the overall design.</span></p><a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch02.html.page97"></a><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>1966 年，功能更强大的 24 位计算机 CDC 3100 取代了项目开始时使用的 CDC 小型计算机 160A。最初，该系统以非交互式批处理模式使用，但后来 Jeff Rulifson 为新的 CDC 创建了实时图形显示，并且还从头编写了一个文本编辑器。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>In 1966, a more powerful CDC 3100, a twenty-four-bit computer, replaced the CDC minicomputer, the 160A, that the project had begun with. Initially, the system was used in the noninteractive batch mode, but then Jeff Rulifson created a real-time graphics display for the new CDC, and a text editor was also written from scratch.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>1966 年，增强人类智力研究中心也迁入了 SRI 的一栋新建筑。来访者首先进入一个大办公室，四周环绕着私人办公室，这些办公室相当简朴，配有金属家具。随着大波斯地毯的加入，情况迅速改变，与研究所的其他部分形成了鲜明的对比。增强集团随后开始与 Herman Miller 家具公司合作开发创新的办公室工作系统。其中一种被称为“瑜伽工作站”的系统由一张低矮的四脚咖啡桌和一个键盘扩展器组成。鼠标和钢琴式单手和弦键系统可以放在记事本或工作文件的两侧。显示器是一台笨重的电视，放在一个灵活的四轮支架上。程序员坐在两个舒适的枕头上。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>In 1966, the Augmented Human Intellect Research Center also relocated to one of SRI’s new buildings. Visitors entered first into a large bullpen ringed with private offices, which were fairly spartan, with metal furniture. That changed quickly as large Persian carpets were added, offering a striking contrast with the rest of the institute. The Augment Group then began working with the Herman Miller furniture company on innovative office work systems. One of them, called a “yoga workstation,” consisted of a low, four-legged coffee table with a keyboard extension. The mouse and the piano-style, one-handed chord-key system could sit on either side of a notepad or work document. The monitor was a bulky TV that sat on a flexible, four-wheeled stand. The programmer sat on two comfortable pillows.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>Augment 的办公室位于 SRI 一栋三层大楼的二楼，从停车场进来时，你可以看到面向停车场的窗户。很快，情况就变得明朗起来，恩格尔巴特的一名程序员决定住在他的办公室里。共用一台性能不足的计算机的后果之一是，使用这台机器的机会非常稀缺，因此计算机黑客自然会选择在深夜和清晨，因为那时需求最少。当你独享计算机时，你可以获得不错的响应时间，因此住在实验室里似乎是一个自然的解决方案。这个方案一直很好，直到这位住家黑客决定将他的一些衣服挂在衣架上，在办公室窗外晾干。程序员经济高效的居住工作策略就此终结。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The Augment offices were on the second floor of a three-story SRI building, and as you came in from the parking lot you could see into the windows facing the lot. It soon became clear that one of Engelbart’s programmers had decided that he would take up residence in his office. Among the consequences of sharing a single underpowered computer was that access to the machine was a scarce commodity, and so computer hackers naturally gravitated to late nights and early-morning hours, when the demand was minimal. When you had the computer all to yourself, you could get decent response times, so living in the laboratory seemed a natural solution. That worked fine until the live-in hacker decided to put some of his clothes on hangers and air them outside of his office window. That was the end of the programmer’s cost-effective live-work strategy.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>Augment 的研究人员最初专注于只需要一台工作站的项目。除了指点设备外，还创建了文本编辑器和编程工具。再一次，<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch02.html.page98"></a>恩格尔巴特对微电子成本下降的直觉理解在他的早期研究中发挥了至关重要的作用。他并不担心他所开发的系统成本过高，因为他知道等到它们真正被掌握时，价格就会大幅下降。19<span class="xrefInternal"><span><sup><a href="#OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_not01.html.en_des_00002_00018">然而</a></sup></span></span>，在依赖军方和 NASA 合同资金的繁荣与萧条的研究世界中，恩格尔巴特的研究项目总是处于危险之中，常常取决于像泰勒和利克莱德这样有远见的支持者。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The Augment researchers initially focused on projects that required only a single workstation. In addition to the pointing device, text editors and programming tools were created. Once again, <a></a>Engelbart’s intuitive understanding of the falling costs of microelectronics played a crucial role in his early research. He didn’t worry about the remarkably high expense of the systems he was developing because he knew that by the time they were really mastered, prices would have plunged.<span class="xrefInternal"><span><sup><a href="#OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_not01.html.en_des_00002_00018">19</a></sup></span></span> However, in the boom and bust research world that relied on military and NASA contracting dollars, Engelbart’s research projects were invariably at risk, often at the mercy of visionary backers like Taylor and Licklider.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>1967 年，Augment 实验在 NASA 进行了一次不稳定的评估，整个项目面临失去资金的危险，直到鲍勃·泰勒再次向恩格尔巴特伸出援手。1966 年，泰勒取代伊凡·萨瑟兰担任 ARPA 信息处理技术办公室主任，不久后发现恩格尔巴特的项目遇到了资金问题。在此期间，恩格尔巴特在全国巡回宣传一部影片，展示了在计算机屏幕上而不是在纸质打字机终端上进行编辑的一些可能性。他手拿影片，出席了 ARPA 研究人员的年度会议，该会议在全国各地不同地点举行，这次是在麻省理工学院。泰勒在会议开始时转向恩格尔巴特说：“好吧，道格，你为什么不先告诉我们你在做什么呢？” <span class="xrefInternal"><span><sup><a href="#OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_not01.html.en_des_00002_00019">20</a></sup></span></span>恩格尔巴特一直缺乏安全感，他觉得自己被邀请来几乎是为了搞笑。当时的普遍共识仍然是人工智能和分时研究人员在做“重要”的工作。他认为泰勒让他先上场只是为了让大家热身一下。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The Augment experiment went through a shaky review with NASA in 1967, and the entire project was in danger of losing its funding until Bob Taylor came to Engelbart’s aid again. Taylor had replaced Ivan Sutherland as director of the ARPA Information Processing Technology Office in 1966 and soon discovered that Engelbart’s project was having financial problems. During this period, Engelbart was barnstorming the country with a film that showed some of the possibilities of editing on a computer screen instead of on paper-based typewriter terminals. With film in hand, he appeared at one of the annual ARPA investigators’ meetings, held at different locations around the country, this time at MIT. Taylor began the meeting by turning to Engelbart and saying, “Well, Doug, why don’t you start by telling us what you are doing?”<span class="xrefInternal"><span><sup><a href="#OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_not01.html.en_des_00002_00019">20</a></sup></span></span> Ever insecure, Engelbart had been feeling he was invited almost as comic relief. The general consensus at the time was still that the artificial intelligence and time-sharing researchers were doing the “important” work. He figured that Taylor was asking him to go first just to warm the group up.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>于是他播放了他的影片，其中除其他外，影片展示了与计算机的交互速度比大多数研究人员所见过的都要快。他惊讶地发现他的影片产生了影响。使用显示屏的想法立即引起了轰动。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>So he ran his movie, which among other things demonstrated a faster interaction with a computer than most of the researchers had ever seen. He was surprised to find that his film made an impact. The idea of using a display screen was an instant hit.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>那天晚上，当大家坐在休息室聊天时，泰勒转身对恩格尔巴特说：“道格，你的问题是，你的心胸不够宽广。”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>That evening, when the group was sitting around the lounge socializing, Taylor turned to Engelbart and said, “The trouble with you, Doug, is that you don’t think big enough.”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>恩格尔巴特惊呆了。他只是想让自己的小团队活下去。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Engelbart was stunned. He was simply trying to keep his tiny group afloat.</span></p><a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch02.html.page99"></a><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>“你到底想做什么？”泰勒问道。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>“What would you really want to do?” Taylor asked.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>“建立分时系统，这样我们就可以拥有一个实验室，或者我们可以自己建造和使用它，然后从那里开始发展，”他立即回答道。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>“Get a time-sharing system so that we can have a lab, or we could build it and use it ourselves and evolve it from there,” he immediately responded.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>“好吧，我们来写一份提案吧，”泰勒指示道。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>“Well, let’s write a proposal,” Taylor instructed.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>次年，泰勒向 Augment 实验室捐赠了 53.5 万美元，用于从位于加利福尼亚州埃尔塞贡多的 Scientific Data Systems 购买一台 SDS-940。这台计算机是一台分时计算机，最初是由 Project Genie 开发的，该项目是加州大学伯克利分校的一项交互式计算和分时研究项目，由 ARPA 资助。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The following year, Taylor gave the Augment laboratory $535,000 to purchase an SDS-940 from Scientific Data Systems in El Segundo, California. The computer, a time-sharing machine, had originally been developed by Project Genie, an interactive computing and time-sharing research effort at the University of California at Berkeley that had been funded by ARPA.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>到达五角大楼后，泰勒决定将 Project Genie 的工作成果转化为产品，因此他邀请了科学数据系统负责人马克斯·帕列夫斯基来拜访他。泰勒认为，操作系统软件的开发显然已经由纳税人的钱支付，将分时计算引入商业世界将是一件大事。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>After arriving at the Pentagon, Taylor had decided that the Project Genie work should be turned into a product, so he invited Max Palevsky, the head of Scientific Data Systems, to pay him a visit. It seemed obvious to Taylor that the development of the operating-system software had already been paid for by the taxpayers’ money and that it would be a great thing to get time-sharing computing out into the commercial world.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>帕列夫斯基带着他的一些员工来了，泰勒向他阐述了自己的想法。这位高管——几年后将自己的公司卖给了施乐公司，为这家复印机制造商进军计算机领域铺平了道路——并没有看到其中的商业潜力。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Palevsky showed up with a number of his staff, and Taylor laid out his idea. The executive—who several years later sold his company to Xerox to pave the way for the copier maker’s abortive foray into the computing world—did not see the commercial possibilities.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>在听完泰勒的说辞后，他回答道：“不。”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>“No,” he said, after hearing Taylor’s pitch.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>“为什么不呢？”泰勒问道。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>“Why not?” Taylor asked.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>“因为它卖不出去。”帕列夫斯基回答道。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>“Because it won’t sell,” Palevsky responded.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>泰勒争论了一会儿，但帕列夫斯基无动于衷。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Taylor argued for a while, but Palevsky was unmoved.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>“这只是一些大学生的疯狂想法，”他说。“他们不知道自己在做什么。你知道，我是个商人。这太愚蠢了。”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>“This is just some crazy, wild idea about some university people,” he said. “They don’t know what they’re doing.

He was emblematic of a small group of scientists at the Pentagon at the height of the Vietnam War who had a very different worldview than much of the military organization that employed them. The people working with Taylor in the Defense Department who supported the computer-research activities of the 1960s were largely uncoupled from the military. Not only did they keep their distance from the soldiers in uniform, but they also had a set of values more in common with those in the universities and the corporate laboratories than with the bureaucratic system that was waging war in Southeast Asia.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>和许多同辈一样，泰勒一直是战争的温和支持者。他认为南越有坏人，他们利用好人，杀害无辜人民。然而，在四年的时间里，他多次前往越南，试图理顺用于向白宫林登·约翰逊汇报军事行动进展的信息系统。约翰逊对他从前线收到的错误数据感到不安，他要求国防部长罗伯特·麦克纳马拉解决这个问题。麦克纳马拉于是打电话给 ARPA 主任，说：“你们难道没有一个计算机专家或其他人可以去那里看看到底发生了什么吗？”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Like many of his peers, Taylor had been a moderate supporter of the war. He thought there were bad people in South Vietnam who were taking advantage of good citizens, killing innocent people. However, over a period of four years he made a number of trips to Vietnam in an effort to straighten out the information systems that were being used to report the progress of the military effort to Lyndon Johnson in the White House. Johnson was upset that he was getting bad data from the front, and he demanded that Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara fix the problem. McNamara in turn called the director of ARPA and said, “Don’t you have a computer guy or somebody that can go out there and find out what the hell’s going on?”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>麦克纳马拉是最初的“神童”之一，二战期间，他将现代统计方法应用于美国空军前身陆军航空兵团的管理。<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch02.html.page101"></a>战后，十名神​​童帮助陷入困境的福特汽车公司扭转了局面。他们的成功对一代美国企业管理产生了广泛影响，他们越来越多地采用数字驱动的战略。麦克纳马拉后来把这种理念带到了五角大楼，先是在约翰·肯尼迪的领导下，然后在林登·约翰逊的领导下。批评者随后认为，美国在越南的失败在很大程度上是由于过度依赖死亡人数算法，而这种算法忽视了内战的现实政治。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>McNamara had been one of the original “whiz kids,” who applied modern statistical methods to the management of the Army Air Corps, the forerunner of the U.S. Air Force, during World War II. <a></a>After the war, a group of ten of the whiz kids went on to help turn around an ailing Ford Motor Company. Their success had a wide impact on a generation of American business management, which increasingly adopted numerically driven strategies. McNamara later brought that philosophy to the Pentagon, first under John Kennedy and then under Lyndon Johnson. Critics subsequently argued that the American failure in Vietnam was due in large part to the overreliance on a body-count algorithm, which ignored the real-world politics of the civil war.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>泰勒的职责是合理化死亡人数。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>It fell to Taylor to rationalize the body count.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>几周后，他便启程前往越南。第一次出访时，他带了三名参谋长联席会议的参谋人员，包括一名空军上校、一名陆军少校和一名海军指挥官。当三名代表参谋长联席会议的军官出现时，军方会留意。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>In a matter of weeks, he was on his way to Vietnam. On his first trip, he took three staff officers of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, including an air force colonel, an army major, and a navy commander. When three officers representing the Joint Chiefs show up, the military pays attention.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>第二次出访结束时，他确信美国军方不应该出现在东南亚，但他的工作是修复五角大楼信息报告系统的缺陷。他很快发现，三个不同的军种对它们应该报告的每个对象都有不同的定义，对数据的核算方法也不同。泰勒创建了一套新的后勤定义和报告格式，并在西贡郊外的一个空军基地建立了一个新的计算机中心。最后，一份报告被送到了白宫。他总结说，这份报告可能仍然充满谎言，但至少是一套一致的谎言。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>By the end of his second trip, he was convinced the U.S. military had no business being in Southeast Asia, but his job was to fix the flaws in the Pentagon’s information-reporting system. He quickly discovered that the three different services had different definitions for each of the objects they were supposed to be reporting, as well as different methods for accounting for the data. Taylor had a new set of logistics definitions and reporting formats created and a new computer center built at an air force base outside of Saigon. In the end, a single report was sent to the White House. The report, he concluded, was probably still full of lies, but at least it was a consistent set of lies.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>他的军旅生活变得越来越难以忍受，越南战争和他对理查德·尼克松的本能厌恶最终导致泰勒离开了五角大楼。在犹他大学短暂停留后，他搬到了帕洛阿尔托，成为施乐公司正在建立的一个新计算机实验室的经理。在那里，他将收获他在 20 世纪 60 年代在计算研究中播下的种子。和 JCR Licklider 和 Engelbart 一样，泰勒很早就意识到计算机的潜力不仅仅是一种算术<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch02.html.page102"></a>机器。相反，他预见到了计算机作为通信媒介的用途，正是这种洞察力使他能够资助 ARPAnet，即最终成为当今互联网的研究计算机网络。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>His life in the military became increasingly intolerable, and Vietnam and his visceral dislike for Richard Nixon eventually led Taylor to leave the Pentagon. After a brief stay at the University of Utah, he moved to Palo Alto to become a manager at a new computer laboratory that was being established by Xerox. There, he would harvest the seeds he had sown in computing research during the 1960s. Like J. C. R. Licklider and Engelbart, Taylor had perceived early on that the computer had the potential to be more than an arithmetic <a></a>machine. He foresaw instead its use as a communications medium, and it was that insight that had put him in a position to fund the ARPAnet, the research computer network that would ultimately become today’s Internet.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>计算机网络之所以出现，是因为利克莱德开始资助全国范围内的交互式计算研究——麻省理工学院、圣莫尼卡的系统开发公司和伯克利大学——当泰勒来到五角大楼时，他承担了这项任务。然而，他发现自己有独立的终端连接到这三个项目。这毫无意义，也使得单一计算机网络的逻辑不可避免。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The computer network came into being because Licklider had begun the funding of interactive computing research around the country—at MIT, at the Systems Development Corporation in Santa Monica, and at Berkeley—and when Taylor arrived at the Pentagon he assumed that task.

If the Free U didn’t offer such a course, he looked for someone to create it.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>自由大学从一开始就被政治化了。起初，重点是当前学生的政治辩论——是在校内还是校外组织。校外派系赢得了辩论，自由大学将自己设在东帕罗奥图的一所房子里，这是一个贫困社区，位于富人区帕罗奥图对面的海湾高速公路上。起初他们开设了两门课程，一门是关于美国统治阶级和权力精英的，另一门是关于瑜伽的。尽管<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch04.html.page138"></a>东帕罗奥图主要是黑人社区，所有学生都是白人，不久之后，邻居们就来建议——不那么礼貌——自由大学在高速公路的另一边组织自己的人。学校回到了帕罗奥图本区，分成了两个团体，一个是斯坦福大学实验项目，另一个是帕罗奥图自由大学。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The Free U was politicized from its inception. At first, the focus was on the current student political debates—whether to organize on campus or off campus. The off-campus faction won the debate, and the Free U located itself in a house in East Palo Alto, an impoverished community located across the Bayshore Freeway from affluent Palo Alto. At first they offered two courses, one on the American ruling class and the power elite and the other on yoga. Although <a></a>East Palo Alto was largely a black community, all of the students were white, and it wasn’t long before the neighbors came and suggested—not so politely—that the Free U organize its own people on the other side of the freeway. The school returned to Palo Alto proper and split into two groups, one a Stanford program called the Experiment, and the other the Palo Alto Free University.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>随后，在 1967 年，自由大学爆发了。它从一个由不到一百名成员和几个互不往来的派系组成的小团体，几乎一夜之间就变成了一个充满活力的组织，拥有一百多门课程、一份时事通讯、一千名成员和五万美元的年度预算。在接下来的三年里，它成为了中部半岛蓬勃发展的反主流文化的核心。它衍生出了一个医疗中心、一个法律公社、一个租户联盟、一家杂货店和一个机械车间。总部搬到了门洛帕克的埃尔卡米诺雷亚尔，就在开普勒的街上，并兼作一家工艺品商店和一家印刷店。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Then, in 1967, the Free U erupted. It went from being a tiny group made up of fewer than one hundred members and several factions that wouldn’t talk to one another, to become almost overnight a vibrant organization with a catalog of more than one hundred courses, a newsletter, one thousand members, and a fifty-thousand-dollar annual budget. For the next three years, it became the heart of the Midpeninsula’s thriving counterculture. It spun off a medical center, a law commune, a tenant union, a grocery store, and a machine shop. The main office was moved to El Camino Real in Menlo Park, just up the street from Kepler’s, and doubled as an arts-and-crafts store and a print shop.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>自由大学吸引了整个社区的人们，从 SAIL 的教授到帕洛阿尔托高中的学生。第一批加入的人之一是名叫马克·波拉特的以色列年轻人，他的父亲是纳粹难民，后来来到斯坦福攻读博士学位。虽然他的父亲安排他毕业后进入一所好大学，但波拉特已经变得激进起来。高中时，他的一群明星运动员同学加入了海军陆战队，并在一年内全部阵亡，他意识到越南战争有些不对劲。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The Free U attracted people from the entire community, ranging from the professors at SAIL to Palo Alto High School students. One of the first to join was a young Israeli named Marc Porat, whose father had been a refugee from the Nazis and had come to Stanford to get his Ph.D. Although his father had arranged for him to get into a good college after he graduated, Porat had already been radicalized. In high school, he realized that something was wrong about the Vietnam War after a group of his classmates who were star athletes joined the Marines and were all killed within a year.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>高中毕业后，他和女友离开帕洛阿尔托，加入南方的民权运动。一天晚上，詹姆斯·钱尼、安德鲁·古德曼和迈克尔·施沃纳被谋杀后不久，他们在一家加油站停了下来。当他加油时，他看到五六个男人朝他走来。他甚至没有把油箱里的软管拿出来，就跳上车开走了。他最终来到南卡罗来纳州的查尔斯顿，在那里他<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch04.html.page139"></a>试图从事政治组织工作，直到种族平等大会要求白人离开。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>After graduating from high school, he left Palo Alto with his girlfriend to join the civil rights movement in the South.

He ended up in Charleston, South Carolina, where he <a></a>attempted to do political organizing work, until the Congress of Racial Equality asked whites to leave.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>次年，波拉特回到帕洛阿尔托，成为一名全职组织者和活动家。他赶在新年期间参加了帕洛阿尔托的一次迷幻测试，在那里他第一次服用了迷幻药。他成为自由大学以及一系列“聚会”的组织者之一，这些聚会在帕洛阿尔托市中心的一个露天广场和斯坦福大学街对面的一个城市公园举行。波拉特打电话给感恩至死乐队、杰斐逊飞机乐队和索普威斯骆驼乐队等旧金山乐队，邀请他们来公园为反战活动免费演出。这些乐队几乎无一例外地都来了。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>When Porat returned to Palo Alto the following year, he became a full-time organizer and activist. He had arrived in time for one of the Palo Alto Acid Tests over New Year’s, where he took LSD for the first time. He became one of the organizers of the Free U as well as of a set of “be-ins” that were held in an open plaza in downtown Palo Alto and in a city park across the street from Stanford. Porat called San Francisco bands such as the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, and Sopwith Camel and asked them to come down to play for free for an antiwar benefit in the park. The bands almost invariably showed up.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>他是新左派的象征，新左派不仅关心政治，还关心文化和社区。有一段时间，他住在帕洛阿尔托大学大道的一座豪宅里，主人是成功的房地产律师约翰·蒙哥马利。这座豪宅是一座带游泳池的杂乱无章的房子，在 20 世纪 60 年代末的几年里，它因举办狂野派对而臭名昭著，许多硅谷更开放的技术人员都会参加。夏天，每个周末都会有活动。那里有裸体日光浴者、在后院漫步的孔雀、播放摇滚音乐的扩音系统，还有一架灯光风琴，这是一种投射彩色灯光来伴奏音乐的电子设备。里面，地板上铺着质量最好的亚洲地毯，还有狂欢室和一个每个人都可以尝试笑气的房间。硅谷最著名的计算机研究人员之一的妻子后来表示，正是在约翰·蒙哥马利的聚会上，她才知道硅谷谁受过割礼，谁没有受过割礼。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>He was emblematic of the New Left, which wasn’t just about politics, but also about culture and community. For a while, he lived in a mansion on University Avenue in Palo Alto that was owned by a successful real-estate attorney named John Montgomery. A rambling house with a swimming pool, the mansion became notorious for several years in the late sixties as a site of wild parties that were attended by many of the Valley’s more liberated techies. During the summer, something would happen there every weekend. There were nude sunbathers, peacocks strolling in the backyard, a PA system playing rock-and-roll music, and a light organ, an electronic device that projected colored lights to accompany music. Inside, the floors were covered with Asian rugs of the finest quality, and there were orgy rooms and a room where everyone could try laughing gas. The wife of one of Silicon Valley’s best-known computer researchers later said that it was at John Montgomery’s parties that she learned who in the Valley was circumcised and who wasn’t.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>波拉特还成为维克·洛弗尔心理剧工作坊的成员。虽然邂逅小组在 60 年代迅速成为主流心理学的一部分，但心理剧仍然更为强大，更具情感挑战性，更具对抗性和激烈性。心理剧成为自由大学的一项重要活动，约翰·麦卡锡偶尔会在家里举办这些工作坊。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Porat also became a member of Vic Lovell’s psychodrama workshops. While encounter groups quickly became part of mainstream psychology in the sixties, psychodrama remained stronger, more emotionally challenging stuff, more confrontational and intense. Psychodrama became a significant activity in the Free U, and John McCarthy on occasion opened his home to these workshops.</span></p><a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch04.html.page140"></a><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>尽管麦卡锡在政治上已经转向右翼，但他仍然忠于自由大学的精神，直到 1971 年当地一个名叫 Venceremos 的毛派组织接管了这所学校。麦卡锡刚刚说服他的朋友、计算机科学家埃德·弗雷德金向自由大学杂志捐款六千美元，但随着毛派掌权，这笔钱消失了。他怒不可遏，参加了在学校在帕洛阿尔托市中心经营的 Tangent 咖啡馆举行的会议。房间里大约有 40 个人，麦卡锡站起来提出动议，要求自由大学重申其非暴力政策。动议因没有附议而夭折，更糟糕的是，其中一名激进分子站起来威胁要杀死麦卡锡。这次经历只是证实了他的信念，即如果学生激进分子统治这个国家，他们与苏联的斯大林主义官僚没有什么不同。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Even though he had moved to the right politically, McCarthy retained his allegiance to the spirit of the Free U until a local Maoist group called Venceremos took over the school in 1971. McCarthy had just persuaded his friend, computer scientist Ed Fredkin, to donate six thousand dollars to the Free U magazine, but with the Maoists in power the money vanished. Outraged, he attended a meeting at the Tangent, a coffeehouse that was run by the school in downtown Palo Alto. There were about forty people in the room, and McCarthy stood up and made a motion that the Free University should reaffirm its policy of nonviolence. The motion died for lack of a second, and to make matters worse one of the militants stood up and threatened to kill McCarthy. The experience only served to confirm his belief that if the student radicals ever ran the country, they would be no different than the Stalinist bureaucrats in the Soviet Union.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>激进主义的白热化时期并没有持续多久。美国反战运动内部的分裂力量很快也让波拉特精疲力竭。他得出结论，他曾尝试从外部进行变革，但没有取得多大成功，那么为什么不从内部尝试呢？他进入哥伦比亚大学后，决定他参加的政治示威活动的目的是为了登上沃尔特·克朗凯特的晚间新闻。对他来说，这一切都是为了媒体报道，这似乎合乎逻辑，他决心成为哥伦比亚广播公司的高管，这将使他能够从内部进行变革。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The white-hot period of radicalism didn’t last long. The same divisive forces at work within the American antiwar movement soon led Porat to burn out as well. He concluded that he had tried making change from the outside without a lot of success, so why not try from the inside? He entered Columbia University after deciding the goal of the political demonstrations he had been in was to get on Walter Cronkite’s evening news. It seemed only logical to him that it was all about media coverage, and he was determined to become a top executive at CBS, which would enable him to make the changes from the inside.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>但事与愿违，两年后他回到斯坦福大学，获得了经济学研究生学位。他创造了“信息经济”一词，进入苹果电脑公司工作，后来成为硅谷一家命运多舛的创业公司 General Magic 的联合创始人。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>It didn’t work out that way, however, and two years later he was back at Stanford, where he received a graduate degree in economics.

From over his shoulder, Dorothy watched him work with his lists and became fascinated by the idea of systematically organizing information. She grew up in Manhattan and studied math at the City College of New York. She married a lawyer and followed him to Washington, but within two years the marriage was a shambles, and desperate for a change, she was drawn to the West Coast by the excitement of politics and culture.

Tesler was a rarity—the first man she met who was a single father. Not long after meeting Bender, Tesler was without a place to live, and so with his young daughter, Lisa, he moved into Bender’s cramped apartment several miles from campus. A thin man with aquiline features, a shock of curly red hair, and a beard, Tesler also blended several worlds in a way that Bender hadn’t previously encountered.

That gospel was simplicity.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>第二年，也就是 1961 年，特斯勒进入斯坦福大学，第一天，他被介绍给几位教员，他们让他使用学校的计算机。其中一台是真空管 IBM 650。没有人使用它，所以他现在有他想要的所有时间。但当他意识到他仍然是唯一使用它的人时，他对另一台学校计算机产生了好奇，那是一台基于晶体管的 Burroughs 220。他很快就愉快地投入了学校计算中心的稀缺世界，第二年夏天在斯坦福大学找到了一份计算机操作员的工作，并迅速晋升为程序员。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>In the following year, 1961, Tesler entered Stanford, and on his first day he was introduced to several faculty members who gave him access to the school’s computers.

But when he realized he continued to be the only one using it, he became curious about the other school computer, which was a transistor-based Burroughs 220. He soon plunged happily into the rarefied world of the school’s computing center, getting a job as a computer operator the next summer at Stanford and quickly advancing to become a programmer.</span></p><a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch04.html.page145"></a><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>第二年，他得到一份为乔舒亚·莱德伯格 (Joshua Lederberg) 编程的工作，莱德伯格是该大学的一名研究员，曾因探索细菌遗传物质的组织而获得 1958 年诺贝尔医学奖。为莱德伯格工作让他提前接触到了某种意义上可以称为真正“个人”计算机的机器——LINC。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The next year, he got a job programming for Joshua Lederberg, a researcher at the university who had won the 1958 Nobel Prize in medicine for exploring the organization of genetic material in bacteria.

Clark, the design of the LINC (the term first referred to Lincoln Laboratory, an early MIT electronics and computing research center, and eventually became an acronym for “Laboratory Instrument Computer”) was begun in May 1961, and the following year the machine was used for the first time to analyze neural responses from a cat at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland. Each LINC consisted of four metal modules, which together were about the size of two televisions set side by side and tilted back slightly. The machine was a twelve-bit computer and included a half-megahertz processor (in contrast to today’s three-gigahertz Intel Pentium chips, which are more than six thousand times faster), a tiny screen, and a keyboard. LINCs sold for about $43,000—a bargain for the era—and ultimately were manufactured commercially by Digital Equipment Corporation, the first minicomputer company. Fifty of the original LINCs were built, and one showed up in Lederberg’s laboratory at Stanford.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>这台机器基于分立晶体管，将数据存储在磁带上，其几项功能在现代计算标准看来十分古怪。例如，LINC 的前面板上有一个旋钮，可以减慢或加快处理器的速度，还有一个音频扬声器，用于向用户提供有关系统内部操作的反馈。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The machine, which was based on discrete transistors and which stored data on magnetic tape, had several features that would be considered quirky by modern-day computing standards. For example, the LINC had a knob on its front panel that could slow down or speed up its processor, as well as an audio speaker intended to give the user feedback on the internal operation of the system.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>从历史上看，LINC 是后来个人电脑技术发展的重要灵感来源，也对 Tesler 产生了影响。它结合了 20 世纪 50 年代麻省理工学院开始的交互式计算研究，以及计算机的全部资源将由单个用户支配的理念。尽管这在当时是闻所未闻的可能性，但 Tesler 独享了这台新机器。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Historically, the LINC was an important inspiration for much of what was to come later in personal-computer technology, and it had that impact on Tesler. It combined the research in interactive computing that had begun at MIT in the 1950s with the idea that the entire resources of a computer would be at the disposal of a single user.

There were by now a growing number of users who needed computer programs, but very few people who knew how to write them. When Tesler called the phone company to get a listing for his new business, he found that there was no category for programmers, and the phone company was unwilling to create one. He opted instead to list himself under data processing—a category in which there were only five other businesses in the Palo Alto phone book. He took an office in Town and Country Village, a shopping center across the street from Stanford University, and his first clients were graduate students and professors who needed programming assistance.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>有趣的项目层出不穷。他与斯坦福统计系主任林肯·摩西合作，对一种有争议的新麻醉剂进行了统计研究。人们曾担心这种麻醉剂不安全，但研究结果证明并非如此，特斯勒的名字也出现在研究论文上。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>There was no shortage of interesting projects.

The earliest computer-graphics displays in the 1960s generally used a monitor and associated hardware that permitted display of geometrically drawn images known as vector graphics. Modern displays, in contrast, use raster or bit-mapped graphics, where information is displayed as rows of pixels that can be switched on and off to create images and text.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>但斯坦福大学的学生有更宏伟的目标。他们的表演是斯坦福体育场的学生欢呼区——高 77 排，宽 45 个座位​​。纸牌特技可以追溯到 20 世纪 20 年代，自 20 世纪 30 年代以来一直在斯坦福大学表演。20 世纪 60 年代初，南加州大学和斯坦福大学都开发了用于安排纸牌特技的计算机程序，但仅限于简单的静态程序；计算机用于控制打印单张纸牌。两名斯坦福大学的学生开发了<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch04.html.page147"></a>开发了新的编程系统，首先在方格纸上绘制图像，然后使用 Burroughs 计算机通过拉伸、变换或改变颜色来变换图像。该系统与如今广泛用于在万维网上创建动画的 Macro-media Flash 图形编程系统非常相似。然而，在 60 年代早期，学生们使用计算机生成一系列动画并在打印机上预览它们，这可谓是一次杰作。当得到正确的顺序后，计算机会进行排序，然后打印单独的闪存卡。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>But the Stanford students had more ambitious aims. Their display was the student rooting section in Stanford Stadium—seventy-seven rows high by forty-five seats across. Card stunts dated back to the 1920s and had been performed at Stanford since the 1930s. In the early 1960s, both the University of Southern California and Stanford had developed computer programs for arranging card stunts, but only for simple static routines; the computer was used to control printing the individual cards. Two Stanford students devel<a></a>oped the new programming system, in which images were first drawn on graph paper, and the Burroughs computer was then used to transform them by stretching them, transforming them, or altering their color. It was a system that was very similar to the Macro-media Flash graphics programming system that is today used extensively to create animations on the World Wide Web. However, it was a tour de force when in the early sixties the students used the computer to generate a series of animations and preview them on a printer. When the correct sequence was arrived at, the computer would do a sort, and then print individual flash cards.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>该语言的第一个版本是数字的，学生很难理解。有移动的代码、红色的代码等等。最初的程序员来找特斯勒说：“这对他们来说太难了，所以我总是自己做所有的工作。”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The first version of the language was numeric and was proving difficult for the students to understand. There was a code for move, a code for red, and so on.

He found himself working with the student rally commission—a group of people, he realized, who had been chosen for their looks rather than their math skills.

It was excellent training for a path that would ultimately lead Tesler directly to the modern personal computer.</span></p><p class="spaceBreak" style="text-indent:0%"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="spaceBreak" style="text-indent: 0%"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent:0%"><span>斯坦福大学西边是圣克鲁斯山脉，这里经常被雾气笼罩，覆盖着一片红杉林，虽然有些零星，但仍延伸到海岸。要到达海边，只需驾车经过大学，沿着沙丘路到拉本田路，这条蜿蜒的主干道从伍德赛德的精英豪宅延伸到一个更加质朴和崎岖的世界，那里居住着城市难民和由艺术家、农民和波西米亚人组成的乡村社区。</span></p><p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%"><span>Lying west of Stanford are the Santa Cruz Mountains, which are frequently shrouded in fog and covered with a redwood forest that, though spotty, still wanders down to the coast in places.

It was a calling that fit the values his father had instilled in him early: It was important to give something back to society. However, over the next two years he found he was increasingly pulled in three conflicting directions. In addition to his professional role, which was still linked to the National Science Foundation’s attempts to increase the quality of math education, there was the self-indulgent, increasingly hippie world of the Santa Cruz Mountains, as well as the growing intensity of the antiwar demonstrations in Berkeley.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>所有这些力量都在 1966 年汇聚在一起。尽管沃伦曾经是个禁酒者，但 1966 年也是迷幻运动席卷他的一年。沃伦和他伯克利学术圈的女友一起参观了索诺玛县的一个考古发掘现场，在那里他遇到了一个向他出售 LSD 的年轻人。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>All of these forces were converging in 1966.

Rather, Warren’s home became a center of the emerging California counterculture—he saw it as rejecting the tight-ass mainstream world and a focal point for some kind of vibrant alternative community. A whole range of worlds seemed to intersect in the parties at his mountain cabin: hippies, academics, rock and rollers, and people from the nude beach scene. For Warren it fulfilled a deeply felt need. He was single with no family and divorced parents.

All around Stanford University a cauldron of political activism, alternative community, and radical education experiments was boiling. Off campus, the Free University was attempting to encompass every diverse tendency from candle making to Maoism.

There was the Stanford Workshop on Political and Social Issues (SWOPSI) and the Stanford Center for Innovation and Research in Education (SCIRE).</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>沃伦对乌托邦社区的兴趣使他进入了自由大学，在政治激进分子和嬉皮士的混乱中，他证明了自己是一个天生的温和派。他比许多参与者年长，而且已经证明自己是一个优秀的管理者。他成为了该组织的主席，但由于这是一个不支付薪水的激进志愿者组织，他被迫寻求一些支持手段。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Warren’s interest in Utopian communities drew him into the Free University, where amid the chaos of political radicals and hippies he proved to be a natural moderate.

That kind of software didn’t exist, so Tesler set out to do a better version of Runoff, creating a programming language for printing that would allow the creation of documents with footnotes, tables of contents, underlining, page numbering, and all the controls necessary to publish the highest-quality documents.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>他编写了一种名为 PUB 的语言，该程序手册的封面上装饰着一幅古老的英国酒吧的雕刻，取得了巨大的成功。从许多方面来看，它预示了 HTML（一种定义万维网并使互联网出版成为可能的标记语言），因为它是第一种使用称为“嵌入式标签”的功能的语言。当时，排版行业正在独立开发类似的语言，但它们都是针对特定机器的。Tesler 的语言是第一种可以为任何类型的设备进行排版的通用编程语言。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>He wrote a language called PUB—the cover of the manual for the program was embellished with an engraving of an old British pub—that was a great success.

It became a hotly debated subject in the late 1960s, as some of the SAIL hackers began to absorb the consequences of Moore’s Law. Early on, one faction at the lab had decided the computer of the future would be like an automobile—something that would be used as needed, and then would sit idle. The idea made no sense to SAIL’s founders, McCarthy and Earnest. Why would you want to give up all of the power that was embedded in their shared community resource? Why would you want to go off and attempt to reinvent what already worked so well? Several years later, a testy John McCarthy would use the phrase “Xerox Heresies” to describe the one worker–one computer ideology that was being promulgated just over the hill at the PARC laboratory.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>毫不奇怪，这位现代计算机分时技术之父——这一理念使虚拟“个人计算”成为现实——会认为将计算机拆分成数千台功能较弱的机器的想法是愚蠢的。事实上，每一代计算机的标志都是其从业者抵制随后的每次技术变革。大型机、小型机、个人电脑、PDA——在每次创新之初，守旧者都会与新贵展开激烈的斗争，但最终还是屈服于成本和性能的残酷现实。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>It is hardly surprising that the man who was the father of modern computer time-sharing—an idea that made virtual “personal computing” a reality—would find the idea of breaking up the computer into thousands of less powerful machines to be folly. Indeed, the hallmark of each generation of computing has been that its practitioners have resisted each subsequent shift in technology. Mainframes, minicomputers, PCs, PDAs—at the outset of each innovation, the old guard has fought a pitched battle against the upstarts, only to give in to the brutal realities of cost and performance.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>尽管麦卡锡极力反对个人电脑的想法，但他仍然热情地参与了 SAIL 关于计算未来的广泛讨论。争论不休。也许是因为微电子学的缩放效应带来的技术变革<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch04.html.page162"></a>行业的发展变化如此突然，以至于很难准确预测其未来。正是因为进步不是渐进式的，而是不连续的跳跃式的，所以硅谷大批创业型“梦想家”经常犯错。在 SAIL，关于计算未来的争论产生了意外的后果，对政治和经济世界的影响比麦卡锡或当时任何其他人都无法想象的要广泛得多。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Although McCarthy vigorously resisted the idea of the personal computer, he remained passionately engaged in the wide-ranging discussion at SAIL about the future of computing.

It is because progress is not incremental but instead happens in discontinuous leaps that Silicon Valley’s legions of entrepreneurial “visionaries” are so often wrong.

His research, with Stanford professor Martin Hellman and Ralph Merkle, a Stanford graduate student, ultimately paved the way to both privacy in the electronic world and the security needed for the commercial services made available by the World Wide Web. Public-key cryptography not only allowed the secure transmission of digital information between parties who would never meet face-to-face, it also answered Diffie’s original question by making possible digital signatures.

The insight came to him on November 11, 1966, when he saw that both programs were attempting to create something that was akin to a biological cell mechanism in which simple building blocks are used to create complex systems. As the comprehension dawned on him, he became more and more excited. Traditionally, computer programs have been divided into data structures and procedures. This was an inherently weaker approach to the design of a computation system, he decided. Now he had stumbled across an entirely new way of looking at computation in which all the components are modular, mimicking the cellular structure of living systems. Moreover, it was an idea that was intrinsically parallel—each module could be a complete independent computer. That realization led to another crucial insight. What both Simula and Sketchpad were missing, Kay realized, was another fundamental component of basic cellular mechanisms: the ability to communicate using messages.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>1 月，埃文斯为凯安排了一份咨询工作，与一位名叫埃德·钱德尔 (Ed Cheadle) 的杰出计算机硬件设计师合作。钱德尔当时正在开发一款小型台式计算机，旨在帮助他进行工程计算。这台计算机名为 Flex，它让凯有机会开始尝试一些关于编程语言的想法。1968 年 5 月，他因设计 Flex 编程语言而获得硕士学位。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>In January, Evans arranged a consulting job for Kay working with a brilliant computer hardware designer named Ed Cheadle.

Moreover, the real breakthrough, he decided, would be to create a personal dynamic <span class="italic"><span>medium</span></span>. Influenced by Papert, he realized there was no sense in waiting until high school to begin studying computers, using a drivers’ education analogy for personal computing. When computing became an ubiquitous medium, it could be extended all the way into childhood.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>1968 年 12 月，凯的研究生生涯即将结束。他的女友（后来成为他的第一任妻子）迫切希望离开摩门教徒占主导地位的犹他州的封闭世界。最终，他获得了 SAIL 的博士后奖学金。然而，当他完成犹他州的工作时，凯听说了道格·恩格尔巴特计划在旧金山举行的年度计算机科学会议上发表演讲的消息。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>By December 1968, Kay’s time in graduate school was drawing to an end.

Encouraged by Taylor, Engelbart had chosen the annual Fall Joint Computer Conference, the computer industry’s premier gathering, for Augment’s debut. In the darkened Brooks Hall Auditorium in San Francisco, all the seats were filled, and people lined the walls. On the giant screen at his back, Engelbart demonstrated a system that seemed like science fiction to a data-processing world reared on punched cards and typewriter terminals. In one stunning ninety-minute session, he showed how it was possible to edit text on a display screen, to make hypertext links from one electronic document to another, and to mix text and graphics, and even video and graphics. He also sketched out a vision of an experimental computer network to be called ARPAnet and suggested that within a year he would be able to give the same demonstration remotely to locations across the country. In short, every significant aspect of today’s computing world was revealed in a magnificent hour and a half.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>有两件事特别让观众惊叹不已<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch05.html.page175"></a>1968 年 12 月那个阴雨绵绵的星期一早上：首先，计算机已经从数字运算一跃成为一种通信和信息检索工具。其次，这台机器正在以交互方式使用，其所有资源似乎都专用于一个人！这是第一次真正意义上的个人计算。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>There were two things that particularly dazzled the audience on <a></a>that rainy Monday morning in December 1968: First, computing had made the leap from number crunching to become a communications and information-retrieval tool. Second, the machine was being used interactively with all its resources appearing to be devoted to a single individual! It was the first time that truly personal computing had been seen.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>恩格尔巴特语调轻柔，声音单调，宽敞大厅的回音使他的声音略显诡异。他身穿短袖白衬衫，系着领带，坐在办公桌前一把定制的赫尔曼米勒椅子上，向世界介绍了网络空间。他向美国最优秀的计算机科学家和硬件工程师展示了未来人们如何协同工作，即时共享复杂的数字信息，即使他们可能相隔世界。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Engelbart spoke softly in a monotone, his voice given a slightly eerie quality by the reverberations of the cavernous hall. Wearing a short-sleeved white shirt and a tie and seated at a desk on a custom-designed Herman Miller chair, he introduced the world to cyberspace. He showed the nation’s best computer scientists and hardware engineers how people would in the future work together and share complex digital information instantaneously, even though they might be a world apart.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>对于许多亲历者来说，这不仅仅是晴天霹雳：这是一种宗教体验，激发了与 23 年前 Vannevar Bush 的 Memex 文章激发 Engelbart 的那种热情一样的热情。计算才刚刚开始对社会产生影响。会议召开前的当地报纸文章指出，会议将讨论使用计算机对隐私的影响，而公共论坛“信息、计算机和政治进程”将邀请广播员 Edward P. Morgan 和圣克拉拉县众议院议员 Paul McCloskey Jr. 参加。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>For many who witnessed it, it was more than a bolt from the blue: It was a religious experience, inspiring the same kinds of passion that Vannevar Bush’s Memex article had given rise to for Engelbart twenty-three years earlier. Computing was just beginning to have an impact on society. Local newspaper articles that preceded the conference noted that there would be discussions of the privacy implications of the use of computers, and a public forum, “Information, Computers and the Political Process,” would feature broadcaster Edward P. Morgan and Santa Clara County’s member of the House of Representatives, Paul McCloskey Jr.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>但恩格尔巴特抢尽了风头。此后几天，有关此次活动的报道只字未提。多年后，用布朗大学计算机科学家安德里斯·范达姆的话来说，他的演讲仍然是“所有演示之母”。从很多方面来看，它仍然是有史以来最引人注目的计算机技术演示。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>But Engelbart stole the show. In the days afterward, the published accounts of the event described nothing else. Years later, his talk remained “the mother of all demos,” in the words of Andries van Dam, a Brown University computer scientist. In many ways, it is still the most remarkable computer-technology demonstration of all time.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span><span class="italic"><span>《旧金山纪事报》</span></span>以“未来计算机的奇妙世界”为标题，指出恩格尔巴特曾表示，他的团队有意识地避开任何人工“大脑”或会思考的计算机。<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch05.html.page176"></a>作者没有意识到增强和自动化的对立目标，但这却是演示的核心。恩格尔巴特的系统让“人处于循环之中”，这与当时许多计算机科学家的目标背道而驰。恩格尔巴特是一个异端者，正是从他的异端思想中，个人计算才得以发展。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>“Fantastic World of Tomorrow’s Computer” was the headline in the <span class="italic"><span>San Francisco Chronicle,</span></span> which noted that Engelbart had said that his group was consciously steering clear of any artificial “brain” or thinking computer. The more subtle distinction between the <a></a>opposing goals of augmentation and automation was lost on the writer, but it was at the very heart of the demonstration. Engelbart’s system kept the “man in the loop,” which was antithetical to the goals of many computer scientists of the era. Engelbart was a heretic, and it was from his heresy that personal computing grew.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>戴上麦克风耳机后，他开始告诉听众：“我希望你们能接受这种相当不寻常的设置……我将要向你们描述的研究项目可以简单概括为，如果在办公室里，你是一名脑力劳动者，有一台电脑显示器，它全天为你服务，并能立即响应你的每一个动作，你能从中获得多少价值？”恩格尔巴特说，这项新技术将是一个有趣的演示，然后他低声说了一句几乎听不见的话：“我希望如此。”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>With a microphone headset strapped on, he had begun by telling his audience, “I hope you’ll go along with this rather unusual setting…. The research program I’m going to describe to you is quickly characterizable by saying, if in your office you as an intellectual worker were supplied with a computer display backed up by a computer that was alive for you all day and was instantly responsive to every action you have, how much value could you derive from that?” The new technology would make for an interesting demonstration, Engelbart said, and then added under his breath a barely audible, “I hope.”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>就是这么简单。人与计算机的关系发生了天翻地覆的变化。从三十多年前开始，很难理解这个简单断言的力量。然而，这是个人计算产生影响的关键：组织将变得民主化，行业将发生变革，个人创造力的新浪潮将席卷全球。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>It was as simple as that. The relationship between man and computer had been turned upside down. From a distance of more than three decades, it is hard to appreciate the power of that simple assertion. However, it was the key to the consequences of personal computing: organizations would be democratized, industries transformed, and a new wave of individual creativity would sweep across the world.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>这次演示的影响远超乎任何参与者的想象。它立即取得了成功，但随着世界逐渐意识到恩格尔巴特和他的研究团队所取得的成就，它的传奇色彩也逐渐加深。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The demonstration had a far greater impact than any of the participants could imagine. It was an instant success, but then the legend grew over time as the world came to realize what Engelbart and his research team had wrought.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>演示之所以如此成功，一个原因是，在大厅另一端，站在高台上的是比尔·英格利什 (Bill English)，他是恩格尔巴特的首席工程师。恩格尔巴特可以轻而易举地挥挥手，将他的计算愿景概念化，但必须有人从头开始构建演示。这个人就是英格利什。他是一个绝对的实用主义者，拥有让事情运转起来的超凡本领。英格利什为演示找到了非凡的 Eidaphor 视频投影仪。借来的<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch05.html.page177"></a>得益于 NASA 的资助，以及 ARPA 的 Bob Taylor 的支持，Eidaphor 是唯一能够创造出 Engelbart 所设想的那种效果的技术。这是一个六英尺高的柜子，使用极其强烈的弧光，将其反射到凹面镜上，从而产生明亮的 875 线视频投影。该设备通过用电子束在油膜上形成图像来绘制每一帧，然后用雨刷反复擦拭油膜，这一事实让这一壮举更加引人注目。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>One reason the presentation worked as well as it did was because at the other end of the hall, standing on a raised platform, was Bill English, Engelbart’s lead engineer. It was easy for Engelbart to wave his hands and conceptualize his computing vision, but someone had to build the demonstration from scratch. And that someone was English. An absolute pragmatist, he had an uncanny knack for making things work. English was the one who had tracked down the remarkable Eidaphor video projector for the demonstration. On loan <a></a>from NASA, and with the blessing of Bob Taylor at ARPA, the Eidaphor was the only technology that could create the kind of effect that Engelbart had in mind. It was a six-foot-high cabinet that used a blindingly intense arc light, bouncing it off a concave mirror to make a bright, 875-line video projection. The fact that the device drew each frame by forming an image with an electron beam in a sheet of oil that was repeatedly wiped away by a windshield wiper made the feat only more remarkable.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>今年夏天，恩格尔巴特犹豫不决地向泰勒提出了这个想法，而这位高级研究计划署的官员也批准了这一盛大计划。后来，当恩格尔巴特告诉 SRI 的一位会计师，他得到了 ARPA 的批准，可以承担这笔巨额费用时，他被告知可以继续进行，但如果该项目失败，SRI 计划否认任何有关其批准的信息。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Engelbart had hesitantly gone to Taylor with the idea in the summer, and the ARPA official had given his blessing to the extravaganza. Later, when the researcher told one of SRI’s accountants that he had ARPA’s blessing for the huge expense, he had been told that it was okay to go ahead, but if the venture failed, SRI planned to deny any knowledge of its approval.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>站在观众席后面的讲台上，英格利希充当着台上的恩格尔巴特和实验室研究人员之间的纽带，研究人员通过两条视频微波链路和两条调制解调器线路从门洛帕克连接到礼堂。英格利希担任导演，通过电话与门洛帕克通话，并通过通信链路与恩格尔巴特耳边的扬声器通话，提示演示的每个部分并控制摄像机的视角。研究人员在半岛高处的天际线大道的一个战略要点放置了一辆卡车，以将微波链路中继到城市，他们还制造了两个自制的高速调制解调器——1200 波特在 1968 年是高速的，每个调制解调器只在一个方向上传输数据——将恩格尔巴特的键盘、鼠标和按键组连接到门洛帕克的 SDS-940。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>From his platform behind the audience, English served as the link between Engelbart onstage and the laboratory researchers who were connected from Menlo Park to the auditorium by two video microwave links and two modem lines. English served as the director, talking by telephone to Menlo Park and by a communication link to a speaker in Engelbart’s ear, cuing each part of the demonstration and controlling the camera views. The researchers had placed a truck at a strategic point on Skyline Boulevard, high above the Peninsula, to relay the microwave links to the city, and they had built two homebrew high-speed modems—1200 baud was high speed in 1968, and each modem carried data in only a single direction—to connect Engelbart’s keyboard, mouse, and key set to the SDS-940 in Menlo Park.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>这需要复杂的编排来混合显示屏上的图像、指向恩格尔巴特键盘的摄像机和位于门洛帕克的第二台摄像机，以显示实验室研究团队成员的演示。有时，观众会觉得恩格尔巴特并不在现场，他只是在听一些遥远的声音。事实上，他确实在现场。他可以听到英格利希在半岛上下与所有参与者交谈，这<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch05.html.page178"></a>电脑会发出不断分散注意力的背景噪音。恩格尔巴特将屏幕上的光标称为“虫子”或“跟踪点”，当他在键盘上执行命令时，背景中偶尔会发出奇怪的嗡嗡声。该小组一直在尝试使用计算机根据正在执行的操作生成不同的音调，作为一种创建听觉反馈的方式。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>It required a complicated choreography to mix the images from the display screen, a camera that was pointed at Engelbart’s keyboard, and a second camera in Menlo Park to show demonstrations by members of the laboratory research team. At times it seemed to the audience that Engelbart wasn’t quite there, that he was listening to some distant voice. And, in fact, he was. He could hear English talking to all of the participants up and down the Peninsula, which <a></a>made for constantly distracting background chatter. Engelbart referred to the on-screen cursor as a “bug” or a “tracking spot,” and there were occasionally odd buzzing sounds in the background as he executed commands at the keyboard. The group had been experimenting with using the computer to generate different tones depending upon what was being executed, as a way of creating auditory feedback.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>在介绍了项目和系统之后，恩格尔巴特邀请了来自门洛帕克的杰夫·鲁利夫森上台。他立刻出现在恩格尔巴特头顶的巨型显示屏上，一个严肃的年轻人，黑发，穿着夹克打着领带，戴着角质框眼镜，滔滔不绝地讲述着 Augment NLS 的内部结构。接下来是另一位年轻的 Augment 程序员比尔·帕克斯顿，他的视频图像缩小到显示屏角落的一个窗口中，他与恩格尔巴特讨论了使用 NLS 进行信息检索。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>After introducing the project and the system, Engelbart invited Jeff Rulifson on-screen from Menlo Park. Instantly, there he was on the giant display above Engelbart’s head, a serious young man with dark hair, a jacket and tie, and horn-rimmed glasses, holding forth on the internal structure of the Augment NLS. Next came Bill Paxton, another young Augment programmer, whose video image was shrunken into a window in the corner of the display while he discussed using the NLS for information retrieval with Engelbart.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>表面上看，这是对计算机工程壮举的枯燥技术描述。但它也是世界上前所未有的规模的交互式多媒体娱乐。计算机世界开始与反主流文化融合。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>On the surface, it was a dry technical description of a computer-engineering feat.

Raymond thought they needed a photographer, and he prevailed on Brand to take pictures. Visiting the reservation had a profound effect on the would-be photojournalist, who stumbled upon a part of America that was remarkably alien to his comfortable middle-class Midwestern roots. That visit had come shortly after his LSD experience at the International Foundation for Advanced Study in 1962, and as a result of his time spent on the reservation Brand had developed a deep interest in Native American cultures.

It seemed to him that, since the surface of the earth was curved, they actually must diverge just slightly. And then it occurred to him that despite the fact that satellites had been circling the earth <a></a>for almost a decade, he had never seen a photograph showing the entire earth’s surface. He realized that an image of the whole earth might inspire others to have a more complete sense of man’s place within the planet’s ecology and all of the implications that flowed from such a view of the world. That concept ultimately became a touchstone for the environmental movement that was to spring from Earth Day, first held on April 22, 1970.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>最终，布兰德开始呼吁 NASA 提供一张地球整个表面的照片。他制作了一个按钮，上面写着“为什么我们还没有看到一张整个地球的照片？”，并立即搭便车前往东海岸，沿途销售复印件。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Brand ultimately began calling upon NASA to deliver a photograph of the entire surface of the planet.

The Whole Earth Truck Store came into existence in Menlo Park just a few doors away from Raymond and Albrecht’s Portola Institute, where Brand was an informal fellow-in-residence. In July of 1968, the <span class="italic"><span>Whole Earth Catalog</span></span> began to take shape, initially as a six-page mimeographed list of books on topics such as tantric art, cybernetics, Indian teepees, and recreational equipment as well as product samples.

Although it resembled mainstream catalogs in many respects, it differed in a manner that struck right at a dualism that Brand himself would coin years later: that strange quality about information that was both easy and freely shareable and immensely valuable. “Information wants to be free,” he said, and then he added in typical Brandian fashion, “and it wants to be very expensive.”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>第一本《<span class="italic"><span>全球概览》</span></span>是一次反主流文化的全面巡展，内容杂乱，从巴克敏斯特·富勒开始，到《易经》结束，内容杂乱，包含各种产品描述、建议、评论和稀奇古怪的特色，看似杂乱无章。<span class="italic"><span>它</span></span>立刻就成了一本圣经，也是寻找有趣事物的意外工具。同时，它还帮助一个正在自我定义的分散社区找到了身份。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The first <span class="italic"><span>Whole Earth Catalog</span></span> was a full-on tour of the counterculture, a hodgepodge of product descriptions, advice, commentary, and quirky features laid out in a seemingly haphazard fashion, beginning with Buckminster Fuller and ending with the <span class="italic"><span>I Ching;</span></span> it became an instant bible and a serendipitous tool for finding interesting stuff. In doing so, it also helped a scattered community that was in the process of defining itself find an identity.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>“我们如同神灵，我们最好习惯它。”布兰德的介绍以借用英国人类学家埃德蒙·利奇的一句话作为开场，这句话经常被人们记住和引用。这句话确实引人注目，有点傲慢和天真，但它也完美地捕捉到了这场运动的力量感和纯真感，这场运动计划为父母的罪孽赎罪，并以新的形象重塑世界。正是这篇简短介绍的后半部分巧妙地捕捉到了即将汇集在一起​​将计算机从大型、非人性化的机构中解放出来的各种线索：“一个亲密的、个人的力量领域正在发展——个人进行自己的教育、寻找自己的灵感、塑造自己的环境、与任何感兴趣的人分享他的冒险经历的力量。《全球全图目录》正在寻求和推广有助于这一过程的工具。”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>“We are as gods and we might as well get used to it.” Brand’s introduction began with a phrase borrowed from British anthropologist Edmund Leach that is often remembered and quoted. It was certainly striking, a bit for its arrogance and naïveté, but it also perfectly captured the sense of power and innocence of the movement that planned to atone for its parents’ sins and remake the world in a new image. It was the second half of the short introduction that neatly captured the various threads that would soon come together to liberate the computer from large, impersonal institutions: “a realm of intimate, personal power is developing—power of the individual to conduct his own education, find his own inspiration, shape his own environment, and share his adventure with whoever is interested. Tools that aid this process are sought and promoted by the WHOLE EARTH CATALOG.”</span></p><a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch05.html.page182"></a><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>在第一本目录中，没有太多计算能力可供利用。HP 9100A 计算器（在标题页上称为计算机）获得了极高的评价；诺伯特·维纳的<span class="italic"><span>《控制论》</span></span>和 1966 年 9 月<span class="italic"><span>《科学美国人》</span></span>的信息版也得到了评论。这一特定领域的材料稀缺并不重要；个人控制有价值的工具的原则得到了牢固确立。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>In the first catalog, there wasn’t much computing power to tap into.

The scarcity of material in this particular area didn’t matter; the principle of valued tools controlled by the individual was established firmly.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>就在下个月即将出版第一<span class="italic"><span>本目录</span></span>时，布兰德认为自己并不是一名企业家，而是一名探索新媒体的艺术家，他立刻被计算机超越计算器的可能性所震撼。他轻松地往返于边远地区的公社和计算机实验室之间。到达 SRI 的那天，他走进戴夫·埃文斯的办公室，发现墙上贴着一张摇滚歌手詹尼斯·乔普林的巨幅海报，他知道他来对地方了。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>On the verge of publishing the first <span class="italic"><span>Catalog</span></span> the following month, Brand saw himself not so much as an entrepreneur but as an artist who was exploring new media, and he was immediately struck by the possibilities of computers that were moving beyond being calculators. He traveled easily between the communes in the backwoods and the computer laboratories. On the day he arrived at SRI, he walked into Dave Evans’s office, found a large poster of rock singer Janis Joplin on the wall, and knew he was right at home.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>布兰德还知道，斯坦福研究所深度参与了越南战争的规划和武器设计，他也意识到反战示威活动正越来越多地聚焦于斯坦福研究所与斯坦福大学的关系。然而，作为一名前步兵，他发现自己对反战活动人士没有耐心。1965 年，他与肯·克西和快乐恶作剧者一起参加了伯克利越南日委员会集会，克西受邀在会上发言。克西戴着橙色荧光假发登上舞台，吹着口琴——这与活动组织者所期望的对战争的强烈反对完全不同。布兰德对此并不介意，他认为自己在越南政治争议中属于“迷幻的一方”。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Brand also knew that SRI was deeply involved in planning and weapons design for the war in Vietnam, and he was aware of the antiwar demonstrations that were increasingly beginning to focus on the SRI–Stanford University connection. As a former infantryman, however, he found he had little patience for the antiwar activists. In 1965, he joined Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters at a Vietnam Day Committee rally in Berkeley where Kesey had been invited to speak. Kesey climbed onstage dressed in a Day-Glo orange wig and played the harmonica—hardly the passionate opposition to the war the event’s organizers had expected. That was fine with Brand, who considered himself to be on the “psychedelic side” in the political dispute over Vietnam.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>在某种程度上，布兰德的政治态度非常保守，这至少可以追溯到他在斯坦福大学读书的时候，甚至更早，可以追溯到他在东部读预科学校的时候。上世纪 50 年代，当他还是一名大学生时，他在日记中写道：“美国到底为什么要反对共产主义？这是一个重要的问题。”他认为，共产主义威胁到他的生活方式——直接威胁到他的军事生活方式——以及他的自由，甚至威胁到他的<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch05.html.page183"></a>独立思考的能力。出于这些原因，他决定，“我将尽我所能与共产主义作斗争。” <span class="xrefInternal"><span><sup><a href="#OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_not01.html.en_des_00005_00004">5</a></sup></span></span></span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>On one level, Brand had a very conservative political attitude that could be traced back at least as far as his time at Stanford and perhaps even further, to his prep school days in the east. When he was a college student in the fifties, he wrote in his journal, “Just what has the United States got against Communism, anyway? It’s an important question.” He decided that it threatened his way of life—directly, in a military sense—and his freedom, as well, even his <a></a>capacity to think for himself. For those reasons, he decided, “I will fight communism in every way I can.”<span class="xrefInternal"><span><sup><a href="#OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_not01.html.en_des_00005_00004">5</a></sup></span></span></span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>但布兰德并不是一个普通的空想家。他像泽利格一样热衷于密切参与 20 世纪 60 年代以来的一系列重要社会和技术运动。他似乎总是站在改变加州开放文化的最前沿。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>But Brand was no ordinary ideologue. He had a Zelig-like penchant for being intimately involved in a series of key social and technological movements beginning in the 1960s. He always seemed to be surfing on the edge of the most up-to-the-moment events that were transforming California’s wide-open culture.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>布兰德之所以被邀请加入 SRI，是因为 Augment 的研究人员知道他们正在着手一个超越工程和科学的项目。他们明白恩格尔巴特的演示应该涉及媒体甚至娱乐。而布兰德几乎无法理解他所看到的东西。道格·恩格尔巴特在这种甚至还没有名字的新型信息空间中四处乱窜——用鼠标和和弦键进行操控——这个想法完全令人难以置信。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Brand had been brought into SRI because the Augment researchers knew that they were embarked on a project that transcended both engineering and science. They understood that Engelbart’s demonstration should involve both media and even entertainment. Brand, for his part, was barely able to grasp what he was seeing. The notion that Doug Engelbart was bombing around—piloting with mouse and chord-key set—in this new kind of information space that didn’t even have a name yet was a totally disarming concept.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>如果他不理解计算部分，他确实给出了一些建议，这些建议很微妙，但最终对演示产生了影响。布兰德有一个奇怪的观点：他认为，你应该能够听到一个人的想法。他敦促设计师提高声音的质量，因为他希望能够听到的不仅仅是低质量的电话音频。在最后的演示中，观众既能从恩格尔巴特的耳机中听到，也能从门洛帕克听到键盘和计算机响应的声音等简单的声音，这增加了当天展示内容的影响力。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>If he didn’t get the computing part, he did have some advice to give that was subtle and yet ultimately had an impact on the demonstration. Brand had an odd perspective: You ought to be able to hear a person think, he decided. He pushed the designers to improve the quality of the sound, as he wanted to be able to hear more than low-quality telephone audio. In the final demonstration, the audience heard from both Engelbart’s headset and, from Menlo Park, simple noises like keyboards and the responsive sound of a computer, which added to the impact of what was shown that day.</span></p><p class="spaceBreak" style="text-indent:0%"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="spaceBreak" style="text-indent: 0%"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent:0%"><span>现在，布兰德回到了 SRI 位于门洛帕克的办公室，他正在用摄像机记录一种新型计算技术的诞生，恩格尔巴特在演讲结束时公开在台上感谢了他。接下来，他转向正和两个女儿坐在礼堂里的妻子巴拉德，感谢她“对一个以非常偏执的方式致力于一件非常疯狂的事情的丈夫”表现出的耐心。</span></p><p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%"><span>Now, stationed back in Menlo Park at SRI, Brand was running the camera to document the birth of a new kind of computing, and Engelbart publicly thanked him from the stage as he concluded his presentation. Next, he turned to his wife, Ballard, who was sitting in the auditorium with their two daughters, and thanked her for the patience she showed “to a husband who is dedicated in a very monomaniacal way to something that is very wild.”</span></p><a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch05.html.page184"></a><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>确实很疯狂。恩格尔巴特迷失在舞台灯光中，不知道观众的反应。但当他表演结束时，观众起立鼓掌，一瞬间他似乎不知道该如何回应。掌声经久不息。他点了几次头，然后抬头看了一眼屏幕，短暂地露出了标志性的悲伤微笑。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Wild indeed. Engelbart had been lost in the lights onstage and had no hint of how his audience was reacting. But when he finished, there was a standing ovation, and for a second he appeared uncertain of how to respond. The applause went on and on. He nodded several times before glancing up at the screen and just briefly breaking into the sad smile that was becoming his trademark.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>在门洛帕克，Augment 团队不知道演示的反响如何，因为视频不是双向的。“他们喜欢吗？”有人问。五分钟后，旧金山传来了答案：“是的，他们喜欢。”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>In Menlo Park, the Augment team had no idea how the demonstration had been received, as the video wasn’t two-way. “Did they like it?” someone asked.

He saw Brown University computer scientist Andy van Dam buttonhole Engelbart in a mob of people. At the time, van Dam cut a striking figure—he looked like a wild man, with his globe of Afro-style curly hair and a goatee. The confrontation between the two men was remarkable, because the previous year van Dam had begun developing a similar system at Brown in collaboration with Ted Nelson, the itinerant poet-sociologist who had a vision that in many ways paralleled Engelbart’s. Now van Dam was stunned to find that Engelbart’s group had completed what he and Nelson and a group of young students were just starting.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>凯看着范达姆向恩格尔巴特发难。事实上，范达姆的热情和恩格尔巴特的温和一样强烈，在凯看来，范达姆似乎迫切地想要了解这个系统的一切，好像他不相信这是可能的，而且他很生气地发现它存在。“这有多少只是演示？”他问道。“你实际<span class="italic"><span>使用</span></span>这个系统的频率是多少？”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Kay watched van Dam drill into Engelbart. Indeed, van Dam was as intense as Engelbart was mild mannered, and it looked to Kay as if van Dam had an almost desperate need to find out everything about the system, as if he didn’t believe it was possible, and he was angry to discover that it existed at all. “How much of this was just a demo?” he demanded. “And how much do you actually <span class="italic"><span>use</span></span> this system?”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>犹他州的研究生也能感受到布朗大学计算机科学家的正直。在两人对峙结束时，范达姆仍然很生气，但很明显他已经确定这个演示是真实的。他认为这是他见过的最好的东西。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The Utah graduate student could also sense the Brown computer scientist’s integrity. At the end of their confrontation, van Dam was still angry, but it was obvious that he had determined that the demonstration was the real thing.

For all of those who were present that morning, there were several notable absences, among them Raj Reddy, the graduate researcher at SAIL, and Les Earnest, SAIL’s executive officer. The two men were down the hall at the same conference, giving a competing demonstration in which Earnest presented a film of a robot that could see and hear, based on a paper that he had written with Reddy and another researcher. Afterward, no one remembered the talk, which was lost in the brilliance of Engelbart’s NLS creation.

The outside world intruded both as political and cultural chaos and in the form of a new wave of skilled software and hardware designers who were drawn to Engelbart’s ideas.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>比尔·杜瓦尔在距离恩格尔巴特实验室几英里的地方长大。他的父亲是一名物理学家，在 SRI 工作。初中时，小杜瓦尔就读于半岛学校，这是一所另类学校，琼·贝兹和她的姐姐都曾就读于这所学校，其悠久的传统可以追溯到 20 世纪 20 年代。他最初在公立学校上学，但数学和科学一直很容易学，而且当时的公立学校有不设速成班的政策。他觉得很无聊，所以在七年级时，他和朋友一起转学到半岛学校。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Bill Duvall had grown up a couple of miles away from Engelbart’s laboratory. His father was a physicist who worked at SRI. During junior high school, the younger Duvall studied at the Peninsula School, an alternative school that had been attended by Joan Baez and her sister and which had a rich tradition dating back to the 1920s. He had started in the public school system, but math and science had always come easily, and the public schools at the time had a policy of no accelerated studies. He was bored, and so in the seventh grade he jumped with a friend to the Peninsula School.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>这就像刚从监狱里被放出来一样。教职员工都是他在公立学校里永远找不到的人。和平主义者、琼·贝兹的导师艾拉·桑德珀尔是他的老师之一。学习是学生自由追求的事情，而不是被强迫的。八年级时，杜瓦尔从课本上自学了微积分。学会自学被证明是他一生中最重要的一课。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>It was like being let out of prison. The staff consisted of the type of people he would have never found in the public school system. Ira Sandperl, the pacifist who had been Joan Baez’s mentor, was one of his teachers. Learning was something that the students were free to pursue, rather than having it forced upon them. In the eighth grade, Duvall taught himself calculus from a textbook. Learning how to learn on his own proved one of the most important lessons of his life.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>不幸的是，当时没有半岛高中，因此杜瓦尔在九年级时回到公立学校，并度过了他认为是一生中最不快乐的四年。在伍德赛德高中，任何有数学和科学天赋的人都会被归类为书呆子，并被社会排斥。杜瓦尔拒绝成为贱民，他独自出去参加田径比赛和自行车比赛。最后，由于他在科学和数学方面仍然是前两三名学生之一，他仍然是一个被排斥的人。<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch05.html.page188"></a>为了自我保护，他开始沉迷于音乐，经常每天为学校乐队练习六个小时的铜管乐器。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Unfortunately, there was no Peninsula high school, and so in the ninth grade Duvall returned to public school and endured what he considered to be the four unhappiest years of his life. At Woodside High School, anyone who had a natural ability for math and science was classified as a nerd and treated as a social outcast. Duvall resisted becoming a pariah and he went out for track and raced bicycles on his own. In the end, because he was nevertheless one of the top two or three students in science and math, he remained an outcast. <a></a>In self-defense, he withdrew into music, often practicing brass instruments for the school band six hours per day.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>他申请大学的时间很晚，而且只申请了伯克利和哈佛。哈佛的面试简直是一场灾难。他去了一位身着蓝色西装的哈佛校友的豪宅，立刻意识到自己穿着旧牛仔裤很不合时宜。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>He applied late to college and only to Berkeley and Harvard. The Harvard interview was a complete disaster. He went to the mansion of a preppie, blue-blazer-clad Harvard alum and immediately realized that he was out of place in his old jeans.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>他被伯克利大学录取，并于 1963 年秋天以新生的身份入学，正好赶上言论自由运动。然而，在大学里，他比在高中时更加迷茫。伯克利大学规模庞大，他没有得到任何指导。相反，他的定位来自学生运动的混乱，从中他学到了两件事。首先，这里有一个真正的政治体制。其次，他发现了一个<span class="italic"><span>爱丽丝梦游仙境的</span></span>世界，虽然他从小学开始就被教导言论自由在美国的重要性，但体制却说：“好吧，不，那个人不能在这里说话。”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>He was accepted at Berkeley and arrived as a freshman in the fall of 1963, just in time to take part in the Free Speech Movement. At the university, however, he felt even more lost than in high school. Berkeley was a huge institution, and he received no mentoring. Instead, his orientation came from the chaos of the student movement, from which he learned two things. First, there was a real political establishment. Second, he discovered an <span class="italic"><span>Alice in Wonderland</span></span> world in which, although he had been taught since grade school the importance of free speech in America, the establishment was saying, “Well, no, that person can’t speak here.”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>这是一个令人震惊的认识。他并不认为这个制度是邪恶的，但他清楚地看到，有一种秩序不会轻易改变，而当权者肯定不会改变世界。他决定，只要把自己置于既定秩序之外，他就能改变一切。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>It was a jarring realization. It wasn’t so much that the system was evil, but he saw clearly that there was an order that wasn’t going to change easily, and the establishment certainly wasn’t going to change the world. He decided he could change things by situating himself outside of the established order.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>但尽管他参加了示威游行，他从未认为自己是一名激进分子。他坚信的价值观之一是每个人都有权坚持自己的立场，他觉得劝阻别人改变立场有点愧疚。对于 60 年代夹在学生和伯克利防暴警察队伍中间的人来说，这不是一个好品质。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>But while he participated in the demonstrations, he never thought of himself as an activist. One of the values that he held deeply was that each person was entitled to his own position, and he felt slightly guilty in attempting to talk anyone out of a position. It wasn’t a good quality for someone caught between the ranks of the students and the Berkeley riot police during the sixties.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>但杜瓦尔极力反对越南战争，他认为这是一代人的反常行为。二战塑造了整整一代美国人；他们成为英雄，成为指挥官，并取得了胜利。这是他们人生的巅峰。他认为，越南战争是一群即将陷入中年危机的美国人留下的遗产，为了应对这一危机，他们发动了另一场战争。没有其他合理的解释。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>But Duvall was extremely opposed to the war in Vietnam, which he came to see as a generational aberration. An entire American generation had been shaped by World War II; they got to be heroes, they got to be in command, and they won. It had been the high point of their lives. Vietnam, he thought, was the legacy of a group of Americans that was reaching its midlife crisis, and to grapple with it they were waging another war. There was no other reasonable explanation.</span></p><a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch05.html.page189"></a><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>高中时，杜瓦尔沉迷于音乐；在伯克利，他沉迷于计算机。当时，伯克利大学还没有设立计算机科学系，所以没过多久，他就修完了学校提供的所有计算机课程。他发现自己对计算机世界充满热情，他的父亲是斯坦福研究院的物理学家，1965 年，杜瓦尔在大二暑假为他安排了一份数学系的工作。自从他踏入计算机黑客的世界后，很长一段时间里，他的生活里就再也没有其他事情了。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>While in high school, Duvall had taken refuge in music; at Berkeley, it was computing. The university had not yet created a computer-science department, and so it wasn’t long before he had taken all the computing courses that the school offered. It was a world he found he was entirely passionate about, and his father, who was a physicist at SRI, got him a job working there in the math department in 1965 during the summer after his sophomore year. Once he stepped into the world of computer hacking, there wasn’t anything else in his life for a long time.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>他回到伯克利学习了一个学期，然后退学并于 1966 年全职加入 SRI。虽然离开学校使他有资格参加征兵，但通过为一家国防承包商工作，他得以维持暂缓服兵役的权利。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>He went back to Berkeley for a semester but then dropped out and joined SRI full time in 1966. Although leaving school made him eligible for the draft, by working for a defense contractor he was able to maintain his draft deferment.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>他的第一份工作是修改 SRI Burroughs 大型机的操作系统，使其能够分时共享多个用户。和许多项目一样，这个项目没有任何进展。之后，他作为 SRI 顾问与 Burroughs 和英国国家省级银行合作，但未能如愿。第二年，当他回到门洛帕克时，他仍然在 SRI 工作，但他需要找点事情做，而早期的机器人实验 Shaky the Robot 似乎是一个很棒的项目。但事实证明，它也令人失望。不久之后，杜瓦尔决定不再打算再做卑微的程序员了。他的好奇心转移到了人工智能实验室走廊尽头那群古怪的程序员身上。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>His first job was to modify the operating system of the SRI Burroughs mainframe to enable it to time-share multiple users. Like many projects, it never went anywhere. That was followed by an abortive stint as an SRI consultant working with Burroughs and the National Provincial Bank in England. When he returned to Menlo Park the following year, he still had a job at SRI, but he needed to find something to do and Shaky the Robot, an early robotics experiment, seemed like a great project. It, too, proved to be a disappointment. Before long, Duvall decided that he had no intention of ever working again as a menial programmer. His curiosity shifted to the quirky group of programmers down the hall from the AI laboratory.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>即使在布鲁克斯大厅演示之后，在 SRI 内部，参与 Augment 项目也并不被视为特别好的职业选择。杜瓦尔收到的建议是：“嘿，你正在认真研究机器人的未来，这是一项将产生重大影响的工作。你不想去大厅和那些不知道自己在做什么的怪人一起工作。”但对杜瓦尔来说，感觉不同。他已经亲自发现，计算最有趣的方面与处理数字关系不大。甚至在他去英国之前，他就已经意识到计算机最适合用于呈现和传达信息。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Even after the Brooks Hall demonstration, within SRI, working on the Augment project wasn’t seen as a particularly good career move. The counsel Duvall received was, “Hey, you’re doing this serious work on the future of robotics, something that’s going to make a difference. You don’t want to go down the hall and work with those freaks who don’t know what they are doing.” But to Duvall it felt different. He had already discovered for himself that the most interesting aspects of computing had little to do with crunching numbers. Even before he had gone to England, he had realized that computers were best used for presenting and communicating information.</span></p><a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch05.html.page190"></a><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>那是 1969 年，道格·恩格尔巴特 (Doug Engelbart) 已经花了六年时间来实现他的愿景。他组建了一支忠诚的程序员和硬件设计师团队，杜瓦尔发现他们既是工程师文化的一部分，也是反主流文化的一部分。在某些方面，这是一个充满热情的世界，但在其他方面，这是一个充满政治色彩的研究小组。杜瓦尔和恩格尔巴特的首席软件设计师之一杰夫·鲁利夫森 (Jeff Rulifson) 之间很快就擦出了火花。杜瓦尔认为，那些有自己明确技术观点的人对鲁利夫森构成了威胁。两人之间的敌意越来越深，至少根据杜瓦尔的说法，鲁利夫森向杜瓦尔隐瞒了源代码——基本的编程指令。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>It was 1969, and Doug Engelbart had been developing his vision for six years. He had built a loyal group of programmers and hardware designers, what Duvall found to be part engineering culture, part counterculture. In some ways, it was a welcoming world, and in others it was a research group that was as full of politics as any other. Sparks quickly flew between Duvall and Jeff Rulifson, who was one of Engelbart’s lead software designers. The way Duvall saw it was that people who had their own clear technical point of view threatened Rulifson. The animosity between the two men grew to the point, at least according to Duvall, that Rulifson withheld source code—the basic programming instructions—from Duvall.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>但杜瓦尔也在 Augment Group 找到了盟友和朋友。他住在拉本田红杉林的山上，邻居是年轻的技术作家戴维·卡塞雷斯。两人都是单身，两人都拥有同一款车——另类的三缸萨博 96。当时，它们在美国是不同寻常的车辆，车主往往对它们有着狂热的崇拜，它们以在欧洲跑车拉力赛中出色的操控性能而闻名。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>But Duvall also found allies and friends in the Augment Group. He was living over the hill in the redwood forests of La Honda, where his neighbor was David Casseres, the young technical writer. Both men were single, and both of them also owned the same kind of car—offbeat three-cylinder Saab 96s. They were unusual vehicles in the United States at the time, and their owners tended to have a cult devotion to the machines, which were known for their handling prowess in European sports-car rallies.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>比尔·杜瓦尔刚到恩格尔巴特的实验室不久，就遇到了一位年轻的伯克利物理系学生，这位学生也在想办法逃避征兵，同时找点有趣的事情做。哈维·莱特曼毕业于伯克利，和杜瓦尔一样，他也是言论自由运动的老兵，曾在斯普劳尔大厅被捕。大学毕业后，他对自己享有的特权地位感到有点愧疚，但他真的不想去越南。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Shortly after Bill Duvall arrived at Engelbart’s lab, he was joined by a young Berkeley physics student who was also looking for a way to avoid the draft and at the same time find something interesting to do. Harvey Lehtman had graduated from Berkeley, and like Duvall he was a veteran of the Free Speech Movement, having been arrested at Sproul Hall. After college, he was tugged a bit by feelings of guilt over his privileged status, but he really didn’t want to go to Vietnam.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>他得以参观门洛帕克实验室，并与 Augment 团队的许多成员进行了愉快的交谈。他喜欢他们，他们也喜欢他。只有一个小问题：莱特曼对计算机几乎一无所知。这次访问没有结果，但莱特曼对计算的热爱已经感染了他。他发现了加州大学圣地亚哥分校正在启动的物理学和信息学新课程。他进入研究生院，并<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch05.html.page191"></a>被赋予教授计算机科学课程的责任。由于 Donald Knuth 的《<span class="italic"><span>计算机编程艺术》</span></span>第一卷最近刚刚出版，他得到了一本，并在整个学期中勉强领先于班上的所有人。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>He was able to visit the Menlo Park laboratory and had a good conversation with a number of the members of the Augment team.

The first RFC was based on the group’s discussions and outlined a set of understandings about how the host computers at the four sites would communicate through intermediate data processors known as IMPs, which had been developed for the new network at Bolt, Beranek and Newman in Cambridge.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>RFC 1 中还有一些更能说明问题的内容，它实际上是现代互联网的奠基性文件。在论文的最后，克罗克概述了两个“实验”。第一个实验要求 SRI 修改其 NLS 软件，以便可以通过电传打字机远程操作。然后所有站点都将远程使用 NLS。第二个实验更加雄心勃勃。SRI 被要求为完整版 NLS 编写一个更雄心勃勃的“前端”，其中包括图形。“加州大学洛杉矶分校和犹他州将使用带图形的 NLS，”报告总结道。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>There was something even more revealing about RFC 1, which was essentially the founding document of what was to become the modern Internet. At the end of the paper, Crocker outlined two “experiments.” The first called for SRI to modify its NLS software so that it could be operated remotely by teletypes. All of the sites would then use NLS remotely. The second experiment was even more ambitious. SRI was instructed to write a more ambitious “front end” for the complete version of NLS, one that would include graphics. “UCLA and Utah will use NLS with graphics,” the report concluded.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>它就藏在一份报纸里，上面写着一个计算机网络，它将覆盖全球，以全新的方式将人们联系在一起。道格·恩格尔巴特 (Doug Engelbart) 的 NLS 工具旨在成为第一个“杀手级应用”。这个术语在十年后变得流行起来。它指的是一种将推动计算行业新一轮增长的软件应用程序。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>There it was, buried in the paper that was to launch a computer network that would stretch around the globe and tie together people in fundamentally new ways.

And in the midst of the chaos, Doug Engelbart felt that he was beginning to lose control of his vision, the Augmentation Framework.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>一切似乎都存在争议，甚至实验室的名称也是如此。多年来，实验室一直被称为增强人类智力研究中心 (AHIRC)。尽管这个名称准确地表达了恩格尔巴特的愿景，但对他的许多年轻研究人员来说，它似乎有点头重脚轻。在低矮的“瑜伽”工作站，比尔·杜瓦尔开始悬挂相当于海盗旗的东西，展示缩写为 ARC，即增强研究中心。最后，经过多次辩论，恩格尔巴特同意更改名称。此后，人们偶尔亲切地称他为诺亚。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Everything seemed to be in dispute, even the name of the laboratory, which had for several years been the Augmented Human Intellect Research Center (AHIRC). Although it expressed Englebart’s vision precisely, it seemed top-heavy to many of his young researchers. At his low “yoga” workstation, Bill Duvall began flying what amounted to a pirate flag by displaying an abbreviated ARC, for Augmentation Research Center. Finally, after much debate Engelbart agreed to the name change. Thereafter, he was occasionally referred to affectionately as Noah.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>尽管如此，对于恩格尔巴特来说，这是一段越来越痛苦的时光，他感到被孤立，因为他被团队推来推去。他<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch05.html.page201"></a>感觉每个人都想朝着不同的方向发展，没有人愿意就他心爱的框架与他交谈。程序员们单独见面，女人也单独见面，事情似乎越来越不受他的控制。多年后，他将这段时期称为“终结的开始”，并回忆起它带来的痛苦。他开始感到越来越孤独和孤立。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Nonetheless, it was an increasingly painful time for Engelbart, who felt isolated as he was pushed and pulled about by his team. He <a></a>felt that everyone wanted to go in different directions, and nobody was willing to talk to him in terms of his beloved framework. The programmers met separately, the women met separately, and things increasingly seemed to be beyond his control. Years later, he referred to the period as the “beginning of the end” and recalled the pain it gave rise to. He began to feel increasingly lonely and isolated.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>在尝试建立该组织的过程中，恩格尔巴特发现他不知道如何让组织扩大规模，同时又能专注于自己的使命。这有点像第一次把车钥匙交给青少年，却发现她马上就开着车去了海滩。当他精心培育的团队努力夺取对他系统的控制权时，他感到越来越沮丧。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>In trying to build the organization, Engelbart had found that he didn’t understand how to make it scale up while remaining focused on his mission. It was a little bit like giving your teenager the keys to the car for the first time and finding that she has immediately taken it to the beach. He felt a growing sense of frustration as his carefully nurtured group struggled to seize control of his system.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>就在 Augment 实验室经历其最快的发展时期，事情开始变得一团糟。ARC 从一群吉普赛人变成了一个具有实际组织结构的真正组织。恩格尔巴特正在寻求帮助来控制他那支吵闹的工作团队，并感到被那些认为 ARC 应该以不同方式运作的人所打击。恩格尔巴特对自己无法向研究人员传达自己的想法感到沮丧，于是找到了吉姆·法迪曼，这位年轻的心理学家曾在斯坦福大学研究生院研究过 LSD 的影响，并曾在迈伦·斯托拉罗夫的国际高等研究基金会工作过。恩格尔巴特三年前在尝试迷幻药时认识了他，现在他们又重新建立了联系。一年多来，法迪曼一直担任研究人员的顾问，研究人员称他为“团队心理医生”。他每周只来一两天，试图通过非正式的“走动”方式观察实验室的运作，理清团队动态。他会走进办公室，关上门，说：“告诉我你的感受。”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Things began unraveling just as the Augment lab was going through its period of fastest growth. ARC went from being a band of gypsies to a real organization with an actual organizational structure. Engelbart was looking for help in containing his obstreperous work group and felt hammered by people who thought that ARC should be run differently. Frustrated that he could not convey his vision to his researchers, Engelbart sought out Jim Fadiman, the young psychologist who had studied the effects of LSD in graduate school at Stanford and who had worked at Myron Stolaroff’s International Foundation for Advanced Study. Engelbart had met him three years earlier when he had experimented with psychedelics, and now he renewed his connection. For more than a year, Fadiman served as a consultant for the researchers, who came to refer to him as the “group shrink.” Coming in just one or two days a week, he attempted to sort out the group dynamics with an informal “walk around” approach to observing the workings of the lab. He would stroll into an office and close the door and say, “Tell me how you’re feeling.”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>法迪曼发现，这里混杂着一些正统工程师和反主流文化人士，真是奇怪。他有些困惑地注意到，恩格尔巴特的一位秘书在每位应聘者被聘用之前，悄悄地为他们准备了一份星座图，但结果却秘而不宣。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>What Fadiman discovered was an odd mélange of straight engineers and counterculture types.

The psychologist set about creating responsible managers so that every decision in the ARC group didn’t need to go through its leader. He could tell that the SRI computer scientist had a vision that he saw quite clearly but was much less obvious to those who worked for him. To many of the young programmers and hardware designers, it seemed as if they had been commanded to follow King Arthur, who was always in the mist. Fadiman could feel their devotion to the cause; the problem was sorting out and actually implementing the vision.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>他还欣赏恩格尔巴特的独特之处——他的热情如此强烈，几乎是一种心理状态。法迪曼参加了 Augment 会议，并充当了主持人，观察团队成员的反应，当研究人员脸上开始出现茫然的表情时，他会温和地阻止恩格尔巴特。然后他会说，“我不认为某某明白这一点。”他从不碰电脑；他只是坐在那里听，当团队陷入混乱时，他试图让团队回到正轨。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>He could also appreciate that Engelbart was unique—his passion was so strong it was almost a psychological state. Fadiman came to Augment meetings and acted as a facilitator, watching the reactions of the team members, gently stopping Engelbart when blank expressions began to form on the faces of his researchers. He would then say, “I don’t think so-and-so understood that.” He never touched the computers; he simply sat in and listened and attempted to get the group back on track when it threatened to descend into confusion.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>最能体现恩格尔巴特的最初设想与实验室中弥漫的探索和异议的新氛围之间的脱节的事件是戴夫·埃文斯 (Dave Evans) 试图在 Augment 研究人员和受到《全球概览》鼓舞的反主流文化社区之间建立思想交流<span class="italic"><span>。</span></span>尽管埃文斯与恩格尔巴特关系密切，但他也是实验室成员之一，与斯图尔特·布兰德 (Stewart Brand) 以及吉姆·法迪曼 (Jim Fadiman) 以及他正在探索的人类潜能理念有联系。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The event that best symbolized the disconnect between Engelbart’s original vision and the new atmosphere of exploration and dissent that was sweeping through his laboratory was an attempt by Dave Evans to create a meeting of the minds between the Augment researchers and the counterculture community animated by the <span class="italic"><span>Whole Earth Catalog.</span></span> Although Evans was close to Engelbart, he was also one of the members of the lab who was connected to Stewart Brand as well as to Jim Fadiman and the human-potential ideas he was exploring.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>埃文斯决定成为信息技术、SRI 的超级正统世界与半岛上蓬勃发展的另类社会的狂野自由世界之间的接口。11<span class="xrefInternal"><span><sup><a href="#OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_not01.html.en_des_00005_00010">他</a></sup></span></span>认为布兰德正在探索的许多关于社区的想法和恩格尔巴特关于“自力更生社区”的想法是同一个连续体，<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch05.html.page203"></a>于是他开始积极鼓励两个世界之间的对话。他相信恩格尔巴特有一颗善于接受的心。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Evans decided that he would become the interface between the super-straight world of information technology, SRI, and the wild and free world of the embryonic alternative society that was blossoming on the Peninsula.<span class="xrefInternal"><span><sup><a href="#OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_not01.html.en_des_00005_00010">11</a></sup></span></span> He felt that a lot of the ideas about community that Brand was exploring and the ideas that Engelbart had about a “bootstrapped community” were on the same continuum, <a></a>and so he started to actively encourage a dialogue between the two worlds.

Evans continued in his quest and in doing so became one of the main players in organizing the Paradam Conference, an event held on a farm near Santa Barbara the weekend after the Woodstock music festival.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>这次会议基于 1928 年由法国登山家、诗人、超现实主义者、乔治·伊万诺维奇·葛吉夫的学生雷内·道马尔提出的理念。该理念基于现代世界存在一座圣山的理念——一座从定义上讲不可能攀登的山峰。道马尔在他的小说《<span class="italic"><span>模拟山》</span></span>中写道：“一座山要想扮演模拟山的角色，它的山顶必须是人迹罕至的，但山脚却可以供人类攀爬。它必须是独一无二的，而且必须存在于地理上。通往无形之门必须是可见的。”埃文斯认为，这是对恩格尔巴特在试图扩展人类智慧力量时面临的挑战的完美哲学表达。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The conference was based on ideas put forward in 1928 by René Daumal, the French alpinist, poet, surrealist, and pupil of George Ivanovich Gurdjieff. The philosophy was based on the idea of the existence of a sacred mountain for the modern world—a peak that is, by definition, impossible to climb. In his novel <span class="italic"><span>Mount Analogue,</span></span> Daumal wrote: “For a mountain to play the role of Mount Analogue, its summit must be inaccessible, but its base accessible to human beings as nature has made them. It must be unique, and it must exist geographically. The door to the invisible must be visible.” Evans believed this was a perfect philosophical representation for the challenge that Engelbart had set before him in attempting to scale the power of the human intellect.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>此次活动聚集了六位 Augment 研究人员，包括 Evans、English、Duvall、Irby 和其他几位研究人员，以及 Stewart Brand、Steve Baer 和 Steve Durkee。Paradam（该术语的意思是“透过小镜头看世界”）旨在将两种社区联系在一起。Evans 认为，如果 Engelbart 想要超越 SRI 的计算机科学领域，他的自力更生愿景就需要吸引一大批人加入。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The event brought together a group of half a dozen of the Augment researchers, including Evans, English, Duvall, Irby, and several others, with Stewart Brand, Steve Baer, and Steve Durkee. Paradam—the term meant “a view through a small lens”—was an effort to tie the two kinds of communities together. Evans believed Engelbart’s bootstrapping vision depended on getting a whole host of people on board if he was ever to reach beyond the computer-science types at SRI.</span></p><a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch05.html.page204"></a><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>活动本身非常成功。参加活动的还有来自太平洋高中（一所位于斯坦福后面山区的另类学校）的学生，以及当时位于洛杉矶附近山顶的公社 Hog Farm 负责烹饪。一群新时代建筑师 Texas Inflatables 创造了一个可供穿过的未来派塑料环境。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The event itself was a success.

The Texas Inflatables, a group of New Age architects, created a futuristic plastic environment to walk through.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>从很多方面来说，这都是一个分水岭。在 Paradam 之前，Augment Group 的重点一直是硬件和软件工具；现在，它正转向技术与人类工具和系统的混合。发明鼠标并证明它在人体工程学上更优越是一回事。试图说服人们团队合作并遵循与根深蒂固的行为相悖的程序，以努力寻找提高生产力的方法，则完全是另一回事。在反主流文化和反战抗议日益混乱的情况下，试图做到这一点就更加困难了。Augment 实验室正在开发自己的真正能量，但 Engelbart 无法应对不属于他的折衷愿景。尽管他受到邀请，但 Engelbart 没有参加周末的静修会。他不喜欢这个想法。这只是他失去对愿景控制的另一个症状。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>It was a watershed in many ways. Up until the time of Paradam, the focus of the Augment Group had been on the hardware and software tools; now it was shifting toward a mix of technology and human tools and systems. It was one thing to invent the mouse and prove it was ergonomically superior. It was something else entirely to try to persuade people to work in teams and follow procedures that went against deeply ingrained behaviors in an effort to find ways to increase productivity. It was even harder to attempt to do this in the midst of the growing chaos of the counterculture and the antiwar protests. The Augment lab was developing a real energy of its own, but Engelbart couldn’t cope with an eclectic vision that wasn’t his. Although he was invited, Engelbart didn’t attend the weekend retreat. He didn’t like the idea. It was just another symptom of his loss of control of his vision.</span></p></div></div></div></div>

Fred Moore had won his war of conscience with the University of California, and in the fall of 1962, after the school had finally made ROTC voluntary, he had reentered as a junior, majoring in mathematics.

In the aftermath of the Cuban missile crisis, he participated in the racially integrated Quebec-Washington-Guantánamo Walk for Peace. The walk began in 1963 in Quebec with groups from other cities expanding its numbers. In Atlanta, some of the marchers were beaten and jailed, and civil rights became a significant issue.

The rest disappeared into the night.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>最终，这个夜晚将成为弗雷德·摩尔的闪亮时刻。他刚从墨西哥旅行回来，全身心投入到他创建的一个名为“学校抵抗”的项目，该项目源于他在高中组织的征兵抵抗以及智利激进教育家伊万·伊里奇的一些非学校化思想。摩尔几乎身无分文，住在米德半岛一所房子的车库里，他搭车来到城里，当晚口袋里只有两美元。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>In the end, the evening would be Fred Moore’s shining moment. He had just returned from a trip to Mexico, and he was deeply involved in a project he had created called “Skool Resistance,” which had grown from his draft resistance organizing in high schools as well as from some of the deschooling ideas of Ivan Illich, the radical Chilean educator. Moore, who was almost totally broke and living in a garage in a house on the Midpeninsula, had gotten a ride to the city and arrived that evening with two dollars in his pocket.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>但午夜过后，当人们讨论如何分配这笔钱时，摩尔生气了。他认为，这就像金钱在世界其他地方所做的所有坏事一样。早些时候，他走到麦克风前，从口袋里掏出一张美元钞票，举到空中，然后烧毁了它。这有点像青年皮士杰里·鲁宾和艾比·霍夫曼在纽约证券交易所的地板上撒美元。他认为，问题不在于钱，而在于人。他可以看到，他如此鄙视的金钱被当作救世主，人们被收买，这是很常见的。争论很激烈，这只是通常的沮丧。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>But after midnight, when the dispersal of the money was being debated, Moore got angry. This was just like all the bad things that money did everywhere else in the world, he decided. Early on he had gone up to the microphone, removed one of the dollar bills from his pocket, held it up in the air, and burned it. It was a little bit like the Yippies Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman showering dollars onto the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. The point, he argued, was not about money, it was about people. He could see that the money that he so despised was being greeted as a savior and that people were being bought, which was typical. There were big arguments, and it was just the usual downer.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>争论还在继续，时间越来越晚。<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch06.html.page223"></a>开始有人离开，似乎没人知道该如何促成群体共识。在会场上，弗雷德·摩尔不断向人们讲述他通过分享信息直接帮助人们的想法。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The argument continued, and the hour grew later and later.

Out on the floor, Fred Moore kept talking to people about his idea of helping people directly by sharing information.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>他再次走到麦克风前，试图阐明自己的观点：“现在差点发生的事情发生在这个我不认识的年轻人身上，他开始谈论他想做的一个项目，但他不想要钱。他想要帮助；他想和其他人聚在一起。人们大喊这不合时宜……实际上，有那么一刻，我们几乎要开始行动了。如果我们要创造一种变化——在一个不断变化的新世界，或者无论我们想称之为‘新时代’，那么这将是因为我们将共同努力，我们将互相帮助。” <span class="xrefInternal"><span><sup><a href="#OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_not01.html.en_des_00006_00010">11</a></sup></span></span></span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>He went up to the microphone again and tried to make his point: “Now what almost happened with this young person here, who I don’t know, he started to talk about a project that he wants to do in which he didn’t want money for. He wanted help; he wanted to get together with others. And people yelled that was out of order…. Actually, for a moment there we were almost getting down to it. If we are going to build a change—in a changing new world, or whatever we want to call it, ‘new age,’ then it’s going to be because we are going to work together and we are going to help each other.”<span class="xrefInternal"><span><sup><a href="#OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_not01.html.en_des_00006_00010">11</a></sup></span></span></span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>就是这样。摩尔对金钱的失望让他开始清晰地思考如何建立替代性机构。我们可以称其为弗雷德·摩尔的“无金钱经济学理论”。虽然当时没有人意识到这一点，但几年后，它却成为他建立计算机俱乐部以自由共享资源和信息的核心。这导致了硅谷最大的讽刺之一：一位拒绝将物质财富作为目的的流动活动家最终点燃了“二十世纪最大的合法资本积累：个人电脑行业”的火花，风险投资家约翰·多尔 (John Doerr) 称之为。事实上，摩尔也成为了开源软件运动未被认可的守护神，而开源软件运动又成为计算机行业的一股主要力量。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>There it was. Out of Moore’s frustration with money he was developing a clear idea of how you might go about building alternative institutions. Call it Fred Moore’s No Money Theory of Economics. Although no one realized it at the time, several years later it would become the heart of his initiative to build a computer club to share resources and information freely. It was to lead to one of Silicon Valley’s supreme ironies: That an itinerant activist who rejected material wealth as an end in itself ended up lighting the spark of what became the “largest legal accumulation of capital in the twentieth century: the PC industry,” as venture capitalist John Doerr labeled it. Indeed Moore would also become the unrecognized patron saint of the open-source software movement, which in turn has become a major force in the computer industry.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>但当晚，已过午夜，仍未做出决定。终于有人站在麦克风前，朗读《<span class="italic"><span>易经》</span></span>，上面写道：“谋事不顺，祸从口出。”这不是一个好兆头。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>That evening, however, it was well past midnight and still no decision was reached.

Watson had been a professor at Stanford for several years, and before that had worked with Ed Feigenbaum, then a young computer scientist at Berkeley who would later become a leading AI researcher.

He faced a tremendous barrier in trying to communicate his vision in language that ordinary mortals could understand. A firm skeptic, Watson dismissed the grander vision that more powerful, augmented minds would solve all the world’s problems, but at the same time he decided the technology, methods, procedures, and human organization that had emerged might be truly useful.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>作为网络工作组的 SRI 代表，沃森参与了 ARPAnet 社区早期的“协议之战”，当时东西海岸的研究人员都在努力构建网络并使其发挥作用。他想知道，如何才能让外界可以使用 NLS？这一目标促使沃森与 ARC 程序员约翰·梅尔文 (John Melvyn) 共同构思了 Telnet 协议，该协议使远程用户能够通过网络登录到远程计算机。最终，是 Telnet、电子邮件和 ftp，而不是 NLS，产生了导致计算机网络急剧扩张的需求。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>As the SRI representative to the Network Working Group, Watson got involved in the early “protocol wars” in the ARPAnet community as researchers on both coasts struggled to build the network and make it useful.

ARPA was under some pressure to show that its new network was actually viable, and articles had already appeared in the computer trade press questioning the entire notion of the packet switching that was at its heart. This was a technique for breaking up digital data into small “packets” so that each packet could be routed separately through a computer network and then resent if necessary. It made it possible to route around network nodes that had stopped functioning, making the network more reliable. Roberts had decreed that in October 1972 there would be an event in Washington, D.C., that would show off the network, in much the same fashion that Engelbart had shown off NLS in 1968 in San Francisco. And so, during the year NWG worked hard to build new software protocols that would make possible new features. When the demonstration happened that fall in the ballroom of the Sheraton hotel in Washington, it was another turning point. People could sit and use the new network.

And so, in the fall of 1971, when one appeared in the Stanford University Tresidder Union coffeehouse, it caused a sensation. In a dimly lit student hangout there was suddenly a luminous computer video screen that showed a white star field on a black background. It was seductive, at least for a group of mostly college-age young men suddenly confronted by an interactive fantasy machine radically different from television. The appearance of the world’s first coin-operated video game was even more striking because it was so incongruous. Although the Stanford campus was anything but bohemian, the Tresidder Union coffeehouse in the late sixties felt like a close cousin of Harvard Square or Bleecker Street. A dark room with coffee tables and a counter for food and drinks, it was routinely inhabited by the shaggy shock troops of the counterculture and the antiwar movement, and on weekends it was possible to find high school students looking for something beyond suburban Palo Alto.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>现在，他们中间出现了一个奇怪的盒子，里面有两个操纵杆和一个磷光屏幕，屏幕上可以显示一对二维微型宇宙飞船的轮廓，只需花费一角钱就可以决斗。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Now into their midst came this strange box with two joysticks and a phosphorescent screen on which a pair of two-dimensional outlines of tiny spaceships could duel for the price of a dime.</span></p><a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch07.html.page244"></a><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>这款投币式电子游戏是加州理工大学学生休·塔克 (Hugh Tuck) 的创意，他是斯坦福大学计算机科学系学生比尔·皮茨 (Bill Pitts) 的高中好友，比尔曾试图闯入 SAIL。皮茨在大学期间就了解了 Spacewar，当时他还没有在校园后面的山上发现 SAIL。他曾在波利亚大厅的计算机中心看到过这款游戏，觉得这款游戏非常神奇。有人告诉他，如果他在午夜后来，只需加载程序即可玩，于是那天晚上他凌晨 1 点就到了<span class="smallCaps"><span>，</span></span>找到<span class="smallCaps"><span>了</span></span>纸带，很快就沉浸在巴克·罗杰斯 (Buck Rogers) 创造的想象世界中 Spacewar。很快，他被一个非常愤怒的研究生从沉思中惊醒，这位研究生在他开始玩之前启动了一个大型磁带备份，结果发现 Spacewar 杀死了她的程序！</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The coin-operated video game was the brainchild of a Cal Poly student named Hugh Tuck, who had been a high school friend of Bill Pitts, the Stanford computer-science student who had tried to break into SAIL.

He had seen it running at the computer center in Polya Hall, and thought the game was totally magical.

As a result, the game was usually relegated to periods when the machines were more or less idle.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>然而两年后，皮茨被桑尼维尔导弹承包商洛克希德公司聘为系统程序员。他被聘为 PDP-10 计算机的程序员，这台计算机是他在 SAIL 掌握的。唯一的问题是洛克希德公司一直没有时间购买 PDP-10，这让他无事可做。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Two years later, however, Pitts had been hired at Lockheed, the Sunnyvale missile contractor, as a systems programmer.

After studying the new PDP-11 for a while, Pitts suddenly recalled his friend Tuck’s assessment. So he called Tuck, and with funding from Tuck’s family, the two young men founded Computer Recreations in June 1971.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>PDP-11 售价约为 12,000 美元，惠普静电显示器和相关设备又增加了 8,000 美元。因此，两人决定以 20,000 美元的价格制造出他们的第一个原型。两位创始人同意以五五开的合作关系进行合作，皮茨负责技术工作，塔克提供资金。他们自认为是熟练的营销人员，并意识到在美国参与越南战争的高峰时期，“战争”可能不是校园里特别流行的术语，因此他们将投币式太空大战改名为“银河游戏”，并开始着手工作。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The PDP-11 cost about $12,000, and a Hewlett-Packard electrostatic display and related equipment added another $8,000. So for $20,000 the two decided they could pull off building their first prototype. The founders agreed on a fifty-fifty partnership, with Pitts doing the technical work and Tuck providing the money. Fancying themselves to be adept marketers and realizing that at the height of the U.S. involvement in Vietnam, “war” might not be an especially popular term on campus, they renamed the coin-operated version of Spacewar “Galaxy Game” and set to work.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>皮茨开始使用麻省理工学院斯拉格·拉塞尔和他的朋友最初开发的源代码进行编程。他想复制《太空大战》最初的外观和感觉，但也加入了一些自己的特色。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Pitts began programming using the source code that had originally been developed by Slug Russell and his friends at MIT.

The game consisted of just the HP display, set on its back and pointing straight up.

Nolan Bushnell had played Spacewar as an engineering student at the University of Utah. After graduating, he moved to California, first working for Ampex and then eventually bringing his own dream of coin-operated video games to a small arcade company called Nutting and Associates. Bushnell’s version of Spacewar was to be called Computer Space.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>就在这两家小公司忙于设计游戏时，布什内尔听说了皮茨和塔克，于是邀请他们来参观。他告诉他们，他听说他们花了很多钱购买一台 PDP-11 来运行《太空大战》，并向他们展示了他正在建造的东西。他说，整个东西，包括外壳和电子设备，预计成本不到一千美元。皮茨对布什内尔的原型印象深刻，尽管他认为这是对原版《太空大战》的可怕嘲讽。布什内尔为了省钱偷工减料，游戏并不十分有趣。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>It was while both small companies were busy designing their games that Bushnell heard about Pitts and Tuck, and so he invited them over for a visit. He told them that he had heard they were spending a lot of money on a PDP-11 to run Spacewar and showed them what he was building. The whole thing, including the case and the electronics, was intended to cost less than one thousand dollars, he said. Pitts was genuinely impressed with Bushnell’s prototype, though he decided it was a horrible travesty of the original Spacewar. Bushnell had cut corners to save money and the game wasn’t very interesting.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>《电脑空间》于 1972 年问世。这款游戏在商业上遭遇了失败，但布什内尔后来创立了雅达利公司。他的下一款游戏《Pong》大获成功，引发了电脑街机和家庭视频游戏的繁荣。相比之下，皮茨和塔克挣扎了近八年，最终放弃了他们的生意。他们原本打算用他们那台昂贵的机器来了解市场，并找出以多低的成本建造生产单元。他们将游戏定价为一角钱，或者三台游戏机售价为四分之一美元；如果你赢了，你可以继续免费玩。他们的策略是，他们不会因为游戏费用太高而赶走人们，而是邀请他们进来，说服他们在机器前坐上几个小时。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Computer Space was introduced in 1972. It was a commercial failure, but Bushnell went on to found Atari. His next game, Pong, was a huge success, touching off a boom in computer-based arcade and home video gaming. In contrast, Pitts and Tuck struggled for almost eight years before finally giving up on their business. They had originally intended to use their single expensive machine as a means to learn about the market and figure out how cheaply they could build production units. They had priced their games at a dime, or three for a quarter; if you won you could continue to play for free. Their strategy was that, rather than driving people away because it was too expensive to play, they would invite them in and persuade them to sit in front of the machines for hours.</span></p><a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch07.html.page247"></a><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>然而，当他们看到第一台机器引起了如此大的轰动时，他们放弃了原计划，开始建造第二台机器。他们将新系统搬到了加州大学伯克利分校，但在那里，它并没有像斯坦福大学最初安装的那样受到欢迎，所以他们把它安装在了桑尼维尔一家受欢迎的酒吧里。不幸的是，它仍然没有引起斯坦福大学对这款游戏的热情。（Galaxy Game 的一个问题是，它要求用户阅读一组看起来像法律文档大小的说明，这意味着它不适合大众。）Galaxy Game 的某些方面在斯坦福大学引起了轰动。它是一个先兆，暗示了人们对计算作为一种新媒介的渴望，这将直接导致个人电脑的出现。最后，皮茨承担了偿还塔克家族 65,000 美元投资的个人责任，并在 Tresidder 咖啡馆维护该系统，直到 1978 年债务结清。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>When they saw how much excitement the first machine generated, however, they abandoned their original plan and set out to build a second one. They moved the new system to the University of California at Berkeley, where it didn’t receive the same favorable reaction as the original Stanford installation, so they installed it instead in a popular bar in Sunnyvale. Unfortunately it still didn’t generate the enthusiasm that greeted the game at Stanford. (One problem with Galaxy Game was that it required the user to read a set of instructions that looked like a legal-sized document, which meant it didn’t play well to the masses.) Something about Galaxy Game had clicked at Stanford. It was a precursor that hinted at the hunger for computing as a new medium that would lead directly to the personal computer. In the end, Pitts made it his personal responsibility to pay off the Tuck family investment of $65,000 and maintained the system at the Tresidder coffeehouse until 1978, when the debt was settled.</span></p><p class="spaceBreak" style="text-indent:0%"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="spaceBreak" style="text-indent: 0%"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent:0%"><span>即使在斯坦福大学反战抗议的混乱时期，《银河游戏》也大获成功。1971 年，越南战争再次升级，并在美国校园掀起反对浪潮。尼克松政府正准备入侵老挝，以切断胡志明小道，这让国内民众越来越担心，美国军人很快就会在另一个亚洲国家作战。</span></p><p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%"><span>Galaxy Game was a huge hit even during the chaos of antiwar protest at Stanford.

Unhappy at SAIL, by 1971 he was preparing to head off to Carnegie Mellon University, where two of the nation’s most prominent computer scientists, Allen Newell and Gordon Bell, had been actively recruiting him to come build his beloved Dynabook—the portable computing machine that had gradually emerged from his computers-for-kids fantasies. He had met the two researchers when ARPA’s technology office director, Larry Roberts, had put him in charge of the idea of a “Super AI” computer for the ARPAnet. It had been one of Roberts’s and Bob Taylor’s schemes to create “magnets” that would attract people to use the new network. The idea flourished in 1970 and 1971, and as a result, even while he was a postdoctoral researcher at SAIL, Kay was able to travel widely and meet many of the reigning AI and computer-design gurus.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>然而，当时 Kay 正全身心投入他的“临时” Dynabook 设计项目，并正在制作计算机模型来传达他的便携式梦想。Bell 和 Newell 对这个想法非常感兴趣，因此招募了他。1970 年末，他接受了他们的邀请，当时他刚开始为刚开始建立 PARC 的 Bob Taylor 提供咨询服务。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>At the time, however, Kay was deeply into his “interim” Dynabook design project and was mocking up computers to communicate his portable fantasy.

By April and May, PARC was literally throbbing with potential and energy, and it was obvious that the team that Taylor had recruited was going to have an impact on the world. Kay wanted to be part of that adventure. Even better, Taylor, who was familiar with Kay’s Flex machine because the two had overlapped at Utah, advised Kay simply to “follow your instincts.” He had nothing less than carte blanche to pursue his ideas in concert with the best computer designers in the world.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>Kay 成为了一位出色的创意整合者。此外，他<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch07.html.page256"></a>他是第一个从艺术家而非工程师的角度来设计计算机的人。加上他对缩放原理含义的早期深刻理解，他还向恩格尔巴特的个人计算机作为交通工具的概念迈出了重要的一步。他将个人计算视为一种全新的媒介。在以这种方式思考计算机时，他想起了阅读过阿尔杜斯·马努蒂乌斯的见解，后者在印刷机发明 40 年后确定了现代书籍的尺寸，因为他认为书籍必须足够小才能装进马鞍袋。20 世纪明显的类比是现代计算机不应大于笔记本。这是一个强大的概念，最初只有少数人理解，比如凯和利弗莫尔实验室的超级计算大师西德·费恩巴赫。然而，一旦凯有了这个想法，他就不可能摆脱它了。他广泛地宣传这一理念，使其成为未来 30 年推动硅谷发展的仅有的两三个真正“富有远见”的想法之一。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Kay became a brilliant synthesizer of ideas. Additionally, he was <a></a>the first person to approach the design of computers from the point of view of an artist rather than that of an engineer. Coupled with an early and profound understanding of the implication of the scaling principle, he also took an important step beyond Engelbart’s notion of personal-computer-as-vehicle. He conceived of personal computing as an entirely new medium. In thinking about the computer in this way, he remembered reading about the insight of Aldus Manutius, who some forty years after the invention of the printing press established the dimensions of the modern book by understanding that it must be small enough to fit into a saddlebag. The obvious twentieth-century analogy was that a modern computer should be no larger than a notebook. It was a powerful notion, one that was originally apprehended only by a handful of people, people like Kay and Sid Fernbach, the Livermore labs’ supercomputing guru. Once Kay had the concept, though, it was impossible for him to shake it.

He pointed out that the group’s resources had already been spent on MAXC and that the whole notion fell outside of the lab’s charter.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>Kay 非常沮丧。他来参加会议时充满信心，认为自己的想法是显而易见的下一步，但现在，短短几分钟内，他最热衷的事情就被彻底摧毁了。他偷偷溜出房间，回到办公室后，他哭了十五分钟。这场危机迫使 Kay 重新安排日程，重新开始。他求助于比尔·英格利什，后者已经成为他的哥哥和顾问。英格利什勾勒出一种涉及教育研究的新方法，这种方法可能使这位年轻的计算机科学家的想法在企业研究实验室的稀缺世界中得到认可。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Kay was devastated. He had come to the meeting feeling confident that his concepts were the obvious next step, and now, in a few short minutes, the things he believed in most passionately had been thoroughly eviscerated. He slunk out of the room and once back in his office simply broke down and cried for fifteen minutes. The crisis forced Kay to reset his agenda and start over. He turned to Bill English, who had already become something of an older brother and adviser. English sketched out a new approach involving educational research that might make it possible for the young computer scientist’s ideas to gain acceptance in the rarefied world of a corporate-research laboratory.</span></p><a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch07.html.page264"></a><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>于是 Kay 振作起来，开始计划如何继续前进，即使没有满是电脑的实验室。他手头有点钱，于是开始思考如何为孩子们搭建一个成本更低的临时环境。他决定，他仍然可以利用 POLOS 研究，于是在夏天，他开始认真使用资深 NLS 硬件设计师 Roger Bates 发明的 Nova 字符生成器。该设备基本上允许在计算机屏幕上显示多种字体。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>So Kay picked himself up and began scheming how he could go forward, even without a lab full of computers. He had a little bit of money, and so he began thinking about ways in which he could put together an even less costly interim environment for kids. He could still piggyback off the POLOS research, he decided, and so in the summer he began working in earnest using the Nova character generator that veteran NLS hardware designer Roger Bates had come up with. The device basically allowed the display of multiple fonts on a computer screen.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>到夏末，凯的团队已经能够完美地完成图形动画和计算机绘画系统的首次演示。他们还尝试使用 Nova 制作音乐合成器，并拼凑了一个演示，提供三种不同的高品质数字音乐声音——这还不够，但这是一个开始。那年夏天，比尔·杜瓦尔 (Bill Duvall) 来到 English 参与 POLOS 项目，并重写了 NLS 文本编辑器。凯逐渐开始将所有东西整合到他设想的有朝一日可能成为个人计算系统的东西中，他最终在办公室隔壁的房间里安装的 Nova 800 上运行了一个可行的演示。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>By the end of the summer, Kay’s group was able to perfect the first demonstrations of graphical animation and a computer paint system. They also played around with the idea of a musical synthesizer using the Nova and cobbled together a demonstration that offered three separate voices of high-quality digital music—which wasn’t quite enough, but it was a start. That summer, Bill Duvall had come to work for English on the POLOS project and had rewritten the NLS text editor. Kay gradually began to tie everything together into what he envisioned might one day be a personal-computing system, and he reached a point where he had a workable demo running on the Nova 800 installed in the room next to his office.</span></p><p class="spaceBreak" style="text-indent:0%"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="spaceBreak" style="text-indent: 0%"><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent:0%"><span>后来，8 月的一天，在另一个 PARC 实验室工作的 Chuck Thacker 和 Butler Lampson 出现在凯的办公室门口，问道：“艾伦，你的预算里有钱吗？”</span></p><p class="paraNoIndent" style="text-indent: 0%"><span>Then one day in August, Chuck Thacker and Butler Lampson, who were working in one of the other PARC laboratories, showed up at Kay’s office door and asked, “Alan, do you have any money in your budget?”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>“是的，”他回答道。“我计划用大约 23 万美元购买一些与 Nova 配合使用的终端。”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>“Yeah,” he replied. “I have about $230,000 I’m planning to use for a handful of these terminals to work with the Nova.”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>他们问：“你希望我们如何制造你的小机器？”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>“How would you like us to build your little machine?” they said.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>从表面上看，这是一个令人惊讶的提议，因为这两位设计师比 Kay 更正统，他们渴望一种完全不同的计算风格：Big Fast Iron。与此同时，Kay 的项目是一个古怪的小项目，他们有点喜欢这个想法。更多<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch07.html.page265"></a>此外，萨克一直对帮助孩子们学习计算机的想法情有独钟，并曾在凯的早期项目中给予帮助。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>On the face of it, it was a surprising offer, because the two designers were far more orthodox than Kay and aspired to a radically different style of computing: Big Fast Iron.

More<a></a>over, Thacker had always had a bit of a soft spot for the idea of helping children with computing and had assisted Kay with his earlier projects.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>幕后还有另一个因素在起作用。鲍勃·泰勒多年来一直在催促他的研究人员制造一台他认为是“基于显示器的计算机”。他面临的障碍是，那个时代的设计师仍然深深沉浸在约翰·麦卡锡开创的计算隐喻中：计算机是昂贵的设备，需要共享。尽管巴特勒和萨克最初不理会他，但他们最终还是接受了这个想法。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Behind the scenes, there was another factor at work. Bob Taylor had been nagging his researchers to build what he thought of as a “display-based computer” for several years. The barrier that he faced was that the designers of the era were still deeply immersed in the metaphor for computing that had been pioneered by John McCarthy: Computers were expensive devices that were to be shared. Although Butler and Thacker had ignored him at first, they had finally come around to the idea.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>泰勒所学的专业是计算机设计中人为因素的新科学，他痴迷于人机之间的互动性和高带宽通信等理念。对于多年来一直使用早期计算机附带的缓慢而笨重的终端的人来说，大显示屏将改变计算的本质，这是显而易见的。1968 年，泰勒和利克莱德在《科学与技术》杂志上发表了他们的论文《计算机作为一种通信设备》，这一未来愿景由此形成<span class="italic"><span>。</span></span>该杂志的封面是两人坐在五角大楼办公室的照片，两人各自坐在自己的电脑屏幕前<span class="xrefInternal"><span><sup><a href="#OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_not01.html.en_des_00007_00006">。7</a></sup></span></span></span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Taylor, whose training was in the new science of human factors in computer design, was obsessed with ideas such as interactivity and high-bandwidth communication between humans and machines. It was obvious, to someone who had spent years working at the slow and clunky terminals attached to early computers, that a large display would change the very nature of computing. This vision of the future had been codified in 1968 when Taylor and Licklider published their essay “The Computer as a Communication Device” in the journal <span class="italic"><span>Science and Technology.</span></span> At the front of the publication was a picture of the two men sitting in their Pentagon office, each in front of his own computer screen.<span class="xrefInternal"><span><sup><a href="#OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_not01.html.en_des_00007_00006">7</a></sup></span></span></span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>于是他们想出了一个计划，趁着杰瑞·艾尔金德被调去公司工作几个月的时候，快速设计出这台机器。后来，这两位电脑设计师向凯承认，他们的动机至少部分是萨克与施乐另一位工程师打赌说，如果一台电脑足够简单，他可以在三个月内设计出来。萨克赢了赌注<span class="xrefInternal"><span><sup><a href="#OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_not01.html.en_des_00007_00007">。8</a></sup></span></span></span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>So the plan was hatched to do the machine quickly on the side, while Jerry Elkind had been called away for several months to serve on a corporate task force.

What the Alto represented was a fresh start in computing based on the untried assumption that everything the <a></a>computer was capable of doing was intended for a single user. It had a black-and-white display with a slight bluish hue, and it was controlled from a keyboard and a mouse. It was as radical inside as outside. For example, two-thirds of the Alto’s memory was dedicated to its display rather than its programs, an idea that would have been unthinkable in previous computers. Moreover, almost all of the computer’s processing power was dedicated to the display of information on the screen instead of the actual program. The Alto stood the entire history of computing on its head.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>对于某些人来说，适应需要很长时间。许多施乐公司的高管前来参观 Alto，他们的反应是：“嗯，这很好，但是我们不能让三四个人使用它吗，因为它有点贵。”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>For some, it would take a long time to make the adjustment. A number of high-ranking Xerox executives came to observe the Alto, and their reaction was, “Well, this is nice, but can’t we have three or four people using it, because it’s kind of expensive.”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>当然，这并没有切中要点。1972 年底，兰普森在一份题为《为什么是 Alto》的备忘录中对这台电脑做出了解释。他写道：“如果我们关于廉价、功能强大的个人电脑的实用性的理论是正确的，我们应该能够在 Alto 上令人信服地证明它们。如果它们是错误的，我们可以找出原因。”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Which, of course, was missing the point. At the end of 1972, Lampson had offered an explanation for the computer in a memorandum entitled “Why Alto.” “If our theories about the utility of cheap, powerful personal computers are correct, we should be able to demonstrate them convincingly on Alto,” he wrote. “If they are wrong, we can find out why.”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>当 Alto 于 1973 年 4 月问世时，首次演示中包含一幅图形：<span class="italic"><span>芝麻街</span></span>人物饼干怪兽一手拿着饼干，另一手拿着字母“C”。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>When the Alto came to life in April 1973, the first demonstration included a graphic of the <span class="italic"><span>Sesame Street</span></span> character Cookie Monster holding a cookie in one hand and the letter “C” in the other.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>然而，早在 Cookie Monster 诞生之前，这台尚未完全诞生的机器上生成的第一个图形显示就是<span class="italic"><span>小熊维尼的第一页图像，这</span></span>完全符合 Alan Kay 的风格，看起来与书本的真实第一页一模一样，小熊维尼的图形装饰融入了文本中。这些小熊是 Kay 最喜欢的咆哮之一的成果，他敦促他的程序员想办法在显示屏上显示可变宽度的字体。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Even before the Cookie Monster, though, and in true Alan Kay style, the very first graphical display generated on the still-not-completely born machine was the image of the first page of <span class="italic"><span>Winnie-the-Pooh,</span></span> looking identical to the real first page of the book, with the embellishment of little graphical Pooh bears blended into the text.

Stewart Brand had been hanging around the lab with the photographer, talking to people, and Shoch had a notion that trouble was exactly what his visits might lead to.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span><span class="italic"><span>他想，这可不是什么好事，</span></span>于是便低下头埋头于笔记本中。就在此时，莱波维茨拍下了 PARC 研究小组在公司办公室里休息的照片，而这个办公室看起来更像是大学宿舍。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span><span class="italic"><span>This can’t be good,</span></span> he thought, and ducked his head into his notebook just as Leibovitz snapped a shot of a PARC research group relaxing in a corporate office setting that appeared more like a college dorm room.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>Shoch 的直觉是正确的。当这则故事出现在这本摇滚杂志上时，它在位于康涅狄格州斯坦福德的施乐公司总部引起了强烈反应。这家复印机公司的主营业务是企业市场，而布兰德将计算的未来比作迷幻药是它最不想看到的。斯坦福德最初的反应是，任何读过《<span class="italic"><span>滚石》</span></span>的人一定是不负责任、不洗澡、穿凉鞋的嬉皮士——而不是施乐的目标客户。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Shoch’s instincts were correct. When the story appeared in the rock-and-roll magazine, it touched off an explosive reaction at Xerox corporate headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut. The copier company’s bread and butter was the corporate marketplace, and Brand’s comparison of the future of computing to psychedelics was the last thing it wanted to see in print. The initial reaction from Stamford was that anyone who read <span class="italic"><span>Rolling Stone</span></span> must be an irresponsible, no-bathing, sandal-wearing hippie—not Xerox’s target customer.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>这篇文章最终在向施乐高层解释西海岸计算机文化方面发挥了积极作用，但从短期来看<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch07.html.page268"></a>实验室经理被叫到地毯上，实验室被严密封锁，禁止访客进入。布兰德揭露了不断扩张的高科技世界中存在的断层线和分歧。过去是传统世界，技术的存在是为了服务于企业。现在，出现了一些新的东西：西方的文化叛逆者正在打破计算的模式，同时创造一种新的媒介。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>The piece ultimately played a positive role in explaining the West Coast computing culture to the Xerox brass, but in the short run the <a></a>lab managers were called on the carpet, and the lab was tightly locked down to visitors.

In fact, he had been complaining about “modes” since the first time he had used an interactive computer system. Most programs at the time used separate modes to execute different kinds of tasks. In a word processor, for example, you needed to enter a special mode to center a block of text, one that was separate from the mode for entering the text. Tesler believed that modes made learning too difficult for unskilled computer users.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>他不同意恩格尔巴特的观点，即计算<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch07.html.page271"></a>工具所能提供的功能如此强大，以至于花在掌握复杂系统上的时间是值得的。恩格尔巴特的观点是，如果人们愿意花三年时间学习一门语言，十年时间学习数学，数年时间学习阅读，那么他们应该愿意花六个月时间学习如何使用计算机。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>He disputed Engelbart’s view that the leverage the computing <a></a>tools would provide would be so great that the time spent mastering a complex system would be justified.

People stampeded to the front of the room for a copy, and he held them back, making the hobbyists who had ordered their Altairs but had not yet received them stand in line behind those who already had a machine.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>索科尔曾参加过第一次 Homebrew 会议，但没有在弗雷德·摩尔传阅的名单上签名，后来他成了沃兹尼亚克和约翰·德雷珀的好朋友。他与许多业余爱好者一样，认为软件开发商向他们收取 500 美元的费用，而这种编程语言在学术界是免费且广泛使用的。当时已经有许多版本的 BASIC 适用于大型机和小型计算机，以及 PCC 志愿者编写的 Tiny BASIC。业余爱好者认为收取象征性的费用或将软件费用与硬件购买捆绑在一起是合理的，但支付巨额费用的想法对他们来说是非常令人反感的。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Sokol, who had attended the first Homebrew meeting but hadn’t signed his name to the list that Fred Moore had passed around, had become a good friend of both Wozniak and John Draper. He shared the attitude of many of the hobbyists that they were being ripped off by software developers who were charging five hundred dollars for a programming language that was freely and widely available within the academic world. There were already many versions of BASIC that had been written for larger mainframe and minicomputers, as well as PCC’s volunteer-written Tiny BASIC. The hobbyists thought it reasonable to charge perhaps a nominal fee or even bundle the cost of the software as part of the purchase of the hardware, but the idea of paying a huge fee was highly offensive to them.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>与此同时，这起盗窃事件激怒了 20 岁的比尔·盖茨，他认为这一行为只会让他的小公司受到公然的伤害。他给计算机爱好者写了一封愤怒的信，这封信被许多出版物转载，包括《人民计算机公司季刊》。盖茨抱怨道：“大多数计算机爱好者肯定知道，你们大多数人都在偷窃自己的软件。硬件必须付费，但软件是可以共享的东西。谁在乎开发软件的人是否得到报酬？”这是纯粹的比尔·盖茨式的攻击——对计算机爱好者的攻击充满攻击性和讽刺性。后来，在受到广泛批评后，他写了“第二封也是最后一封信”，指出他不是 MITS 的员工，但不会放弃他最初的立场。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>At the same time, the theft outraged a twenty-year-old Bill Gates, who saw nothing in the stunt but the outright victimization of his tiny company. He wrote an angry letter to the computer hobbyists, which was reprinted in a number of publications, including the People’s Computer Company quarterly. “As the majority of hobbyists must be aware, most of you steal your software,” Gates complained. “Hardware must be paid for, but software is something to share. Who cares if the people who worked on it get paid?” It was pure Bill Gates—an aggressive and sarcastic attack on the hobbyists. Later, after he was widely criticized, he wrote “A Second and Final Letter,” noting that he was not a MITS employee but was not backing down from his original stand.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>盖茨与无政府主义的程序员和硬件修理工之间的最初冲突形成了基本的紧张局势，这种紧张局势不仅笼罩着计算机行业，而且现在还笼罩着音乐界、其他技术行业、好莱坞和整个<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch08.html.page312"></a>出版界也是如此。个人电脑时代初的一场对抗暴露了一条断层线，如今已成为世界经济面临的最激烈冲突。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>This initial confrontation between Gates and the anarchic cadre of programmers and hardware tinkerers forged a basic tension that has enveloped not just the computer industry but now the music world, other technology industries, Hollywood, and the entire <a></a>publishing world as well. A confrontation at the dawn of the personal-computer era exposed a fault line that today has become the bitterest conflict facing the world’s economy.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>一方面，硅谷长期以来一直受到作家迈克尔·马龙 (Michael Malone) 所说的“大成就”的驱动——更简单地说，就是贪婪。事实上，在门洛帕克举办首次家庭电脑俱乐部会议后不久，这个业余爱好者聚会就开始涌现出苹果、奥斯本电脑、Cromemco 和北极星等公司，这些公司的根源直接或间接地源于俱乐部首次会议中捕捉到的热情。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>On one hand, Silicon Valley has long been motivated by what author Michael Malone called “The Big Score”—more simply put, greed. In fact, it was not long after the Homebrew Computer Club’s first meeting in Menlo Park that the hobbyist conclave began spawning names such as Apple, Osborne Computer, Cromemco, and North Star, owing their roots, directly or indirectly, to the enthusiasm that was captured in the initial club meetings.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>与此同时，硅谷长期以来也一直受到弗雷德·摩尔对自由分享信息的热情所表达的更理想主义动机的驱动。20 世纪 60 年代和 70 年代初期，这两种动机在斯坦福大学周围碰撞，形成了个人电脑行业的精神。今天，过去与现代计算机行业之间仍然有着直接的联系。其理想主义的一面在 Linux 中得到了清晰的体现——Linux 是一款由志愿程序员开发和支持的免费操作系统。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>At the same time, the Valley has also long been driven by the more idealistic motive expressed by Fred Moore’s passion for sharing information freely. The collision of the two motives during the sixties and early seventies around Stanford forged the ethos of the personal-computing industry. Today there remains a direct connection between that past and the modern computer industry. Its idealistic side finds clear expression in Linux—a freely available operating system that has been developed and supported by volunteer programmers.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>斯图尔特·布兰德最清楚地表达了其中的根本矛盾：“信息想要免费，”他说，“但信息也想要变得非常昂贵。”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Stewart Brand expressed the fundamental tension most clearly: “Information wants to be free,” he said, “and information also wants to be very expensive.”</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>这是三十年前围绕斯坦福大学的各种力量碰撞留下的遗产。这种碰撞产生的冲突至今仍在重塑消费电子、数字娱乐和计算机行业的格局。随着数字计算机日益成为现代生活各个方面的主导，这种冲突将发挥更大的作用。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>That is the legacy of the forces that collided three decades ago around Stanford. The collision created a conflict that is still reshaping the landscape in the consumer electronics, digital entertainment, and computer industries. And it will become even more of a factor as digital computers increasingly define every aspect of modern life.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>它的起源在于道格·恩格尔巴特、弗雷德·摩尔和迈伦·斯托拉罗夫的不同激情。恩格尔巴特和摩尔是同一枚硬币的两面，他们都致力于一个理想，几乎排除了生活中的其他一切。两人都深深地觉得自己是局外人。斯托拉罗夫对探索人类思维潜力的热情，<a id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_ch08.html.page313"></a>与此同时，它与一种意图夺取并重塑现有工具的文化完美契合。斯托拉罗夫对计算机历史的影响当然不如恩格尔巴特和摩尔那样直接。但他对创造力和迷幻药的痴迷释放出的力量从未得到充分认可。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>Its origin lies in the separate passions of Doug Engelbart, Fred Moore, and Myron Stolaroff. Engelbart and Moore were two sides of the same coin, both committed to an ideal to the exclusion of almost everything else in their lives. Both felt deeply they were outsiders. Stolaroff’s zeal for exploring the potential of the human mind, <a></a>meanwhile, dovetailed perfectly with a culture intent on seizing and remaking the tools of the establishment in a new image. Certainly Stolaroff’s impact on the history of the computer was less direct than those of Engelbart and Moore. But his obsession with creativity and psychedelics unleashed forces the impact of which has never been adequately acknowledged.</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent:5%"><span>这三位名人以各自的方式为个人电脑奠定了基础，而个人电脑在过去 30 年中又催生了信息经济。如今，信息经济体现了三位名人的一些梦想。</span></p><p class="para" style="text-indent: 5%"><span>In their individual ways, all three men helped lay the groundwork for the personal computer, which in turn during the past three decades has given risen to the information economy.

In league with Hollywood and publishers, Microsoft and Intel have now embarked on a crusade to build computer software and hardware that wraps information with a protective layer of encryption designed to prevent sharing via computer networks. At the same time, the open-source software community has begun attempting to redefine the idea of copyright, more in keeping with the spirit of the framers of the Constitution. The computer hackers’ urge to share and the entrepreneurs desire for wealth—it is a confrontation that will inevitably define new technology revolutions. The stage is set for a clash of values that echo the very forces that created Silicon Valley.</span></p></div></div></div></div>

It was first reported in Stewart Brand’s seminal <span class="italic"><span>Rolling Stone</span></span> article about PARC and SAIL in 1972 and attributed to Alan Kay. However, Kay does not remember if he used the phrase first, while Chuck Thacker has a clear recollection of exclaiming, “He sat on stage for an hour and a half dealing lightning with both hands,” after watching a video of Engelbart in 1970 or 1971. Robert Taylor, director of the computer-science laboratory at PARC, also remembers Thacker using the phrase first. Thus it is ironic that Michael Hiltzik chose the phrase “Dealers of Lightning” as the title of his thorough history of Xerox PARC, when in fact the term was first used to describe Engelbart’s work.</span></span></span></p><p class="endnote" style="text-indent:-5%;margin-left:5%"><span><span class="endnoteNumber" id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_not01.html.en_des_00005_00001"><span>2.</span></span><span class="endnotePara"><span>“全球展望者：斯图尔特·布兰德”，<span class="italic"><span>《卫报》</span></span>（伦敦），2001 年 8 月 4 日，第 6 页。</span></span></span></p><p class="endnote" style="text-indent: -5%; margin-left: 5%;"><span><span class="endnoteNumber"><span>2.</span></span><span class="endnotePara"><span>“Whole Earth Visionary: Stewart Brand,” <span class="italic"><span>The Guardian</span></span> (London), August 4, 2001, p. 6.</span></span></span></p><p class="endnote" style="text-indent:-5%;margin-left:5%"><span><span class="endnoteNumber" id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_not01.html.en_des_00005_00002"><span>3.</span></span><span class="endnotePara"><span>Sam Binkley，《消费水瓶座：1968-1980 年新阶层的市场与道德界限》，博士论文，新学院大学，2002 年。</span></span></span></p><p class="endnote" style="text-indent: -5%; margin-left: 5%;"><span><span class="endnoteNumber"><span>3.</span></span><span class="endnotePara"><span>Sam Binkley, “Consuming Aquarius: Markets and the Moral Boundaries of the New Class, 1968–1980,” Ph.D. dissertation, New School University, 2002.</span></span></span></p><p class="endnote" style="text-indent:-5%;margin-left:5%"><span><span class="endnoteNumber" id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_not01.html.en_des_00005_00003"><span>4.</span></span><span class="endnotePara"><span><span class="italic"><span>《全球概览：工具使用权，三十周年庆典</span></span>》（加利福尼亚州圣拉斐尔：Point Foundation，1998 年），第 2 页。</span></span></span></p><p class="endnote" style="text-indent: -5%; margin-left: 5%;"><span><span class="endnoteNumber"><span>4.</span></span><span class="endnotePara"><span><span class="italic"><span>Whole Earth Catalog: Access to Tools, Thirtieth Anniversary Celebration</span></span> (San Rafael, Calif.: Point Foundation, 1998), p. 2.</span></span></span></p><p class="endnote" style="text-indent:-5%;margin-left:5%"><span><span class="endnoteNumber" id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_not01.html.en_des_00005_00004"><span>5.</span></span><span class="endnotePara"><span>斯图尔特·布兰德，个人日记，斯坦福大学特藏，1957 年 3 月 24 日。</span></span></span></p><p class="endnote" style="text-indent: -5%; margin-left: 5%;"><span><span class="endnoteNumber"><span>5.</span></span><span class="endnotePara"><span>Stewart Brand, personal journals, Stanford University Special Collections, March 24, 1957.</span></span></span></p><p class="endnote" style="text-indent:-5%;margin-left:5%"><span><span class="endnoteNumber" id="OEBPS/whatthedormousesaid_not01.html.en_des_00005_00005"><span>6.</span></span><span class="endnotePara"><span>Charles Irby，《增强知识研讨会》，《<span class="italic"><span>个人工作站历史</span></span>》 ，Adele Goldberg 编辑（马萨诸塞州雷丁：Addison-Wesley，1988 年），第 185 页。</span></span></span></p><p class="endnote" style="text-indent: -5%; margin-left: 5%;"><span><span class="endnoteNumber"><span>6.</span></span><span class="endnotePara"><span>Charles Irby, “The Augmented Knowledge Workshop,” in <span class="italic"><span>A History of Personal Workstations</span></span>, ed.
