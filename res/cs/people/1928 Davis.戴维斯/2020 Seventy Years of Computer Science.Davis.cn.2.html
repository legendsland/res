1950 年 5 月，我将打字的博士论文提交给了普林斯顿大学的注册主任，这距 2020 年 5 月正好过去了 70 年。在本文中，我将尝试对这 70 年间我作为参与者和观察者与计算机科学的互动进行非常个人化的调查。
</p><p>
I delivered my typewritten doctoral dissertation to the Princeton University
registrar in May 1950, just seventy years before May 2020. In this essay I will
try to provide a very personal survey of my interactions with computer science,
as participant and as observer, over this seventy year period.
</p>
<p>
我的博士论文题目是《论递归不可解性理论》。1935 年，阿隆佐·丘奇 1 宣称，定义在自然数上的递归函数正是那些可通过算法计算的函数。哥德尔定义了这类函数，丘奇的学生克莱恩发现了这类函数的各种替代表述。丘奇和克莱恩还研究了一类函数，即以非常不同的方式定义的 λ 可定义函数，并已证明这两类函数是相同的。与此同时，在英国，艾伦·图灵 2 的表述（就后来被称为图灵机而言）已被图灵证明与上述两种表述等价。EL Post 3 有一个非常接近图灵表述的表述，这是他独立开发的。 20 世纪 20 年代，波斯特还研究了一种截然不同的形式主义，即他的规范和正常生产系统，并提出它们提供了另一种他期望与其他三种系统等同的公式。
</p><p>
The title of my dissertation was On the Theory of Recursive Unsolvability. In
1935 Alonzo Church1 had declared that the recursive functions, deﬁned on the
natural numbers, are precisely those that are algorithmically computable. It was
G¨odel who had deﬁned this class, and Church’s student Kleene had found various
alternative formulations of the class. Church and Kleene had also studied a class
of functions, the λ–deﬁnable functions, deﬁned in a very diﬀerent manner, and
it had been proved that the two classes were the same. Meanwhile in England,
Alan Turing’s2 formulation, in terms of what came to be called Turing machines,
was proved by Turing to be equivalent to these other two. E. L. Post3 had
a formulation very close to Turing’s that he had developed independently. Post
had also worked on a quite diﬀerent formalism, his canonical and normal systems
of productions, during the 1920s and proposed them as providing yet another
formulation he expected to be equivalent to the other three.
</p>
<p>
在我的论文中，我基于克莱尼版本的哥德尔公式研究了递归函数理论的各个方面。我证明了波斯特的正则系统与其他公式等价，并且利用波斯特将正则系统简化为正则系统的方法，得到了正则系统的无解问题。以这个问题为基础，我得到了第一个涉及丢番图方程的无解问题。这是计算机科学吗？在距离普林斯顿校园一英里半的地方，高等研究院的冯·诺依曼计算机于 1950 年建成，两年后才能投入使用。但我对此只是模糊地意识到。无论如何，我从未想过它与我的论文有任何关系。然而，哥德尔从早期的“原始”递归发展到克莱尼所说的“一般”递归，相当于在编程语言中除了简单的循环结构外，还包含while循环。我的论文的很大一部分以图灵机的语言写成，发表在我 1958 年出版的《可计算性和不可解性》一书中。当 Dover 于 1982 年重印这本书时，《计算评论》称这本书是“计算机科学的少数经典之一”。此外，乔姆斯基的形式语言类别层次结构明确基于 Post 的生成系统。
</p><p>
In my dissertation I studied various aspects of the theory of recursive func-
tions basing myself on Kleene’s version of G¨odel’s formulation. I proved that
Post’s canonical systems were equivalent to the other formulations and, using
Post’s reduction of canonical to normal systems, obtained an unsolvable problem
for normal systems. With this problem as a basis, I obtained my ﬁrst unsolvable
problem involving Diophantine equations. Was this computer science? A mile
and a half away from the Princeton campus, von Neumann’s computer at the
Institute for Advanced Study was being built in 1950, not to be operational for
another two years. But I was aware of this only dimly if at all. In any case, the
thought that it had any relation to my dissertation would never have occurred
to me. Still G¨odel’s advance to what Kleene called “general” recursion from the
earlier “primitive” recursion corresponds to including while loops in program-
ming languages in addition to simple looping constructs. A substantial part of
my dissertation was to appear, couched in the language of Turing machines,
in my book, Computability and Unsolvability, of 1958. In Computing Reviews
this book was called “one of the few classics of computer science” when Dover
reprinted it in 1982. Also, Chomsky’s hierarchy of classes of formal languages
was based explicitly on Post’s production systems.

1950 年秋天，我的个人生活陷入了巨大的混乱，我来到了伊利诺伊州南部的玉米地里，在那里我担任伊利诺伊大学香槟分校的博士后。在春季学期，我有机会教授一门关于递归函数的研究生课程。我喜欢图灵机的直观感觉，因此决定以图灵机为基础进行演讲，而不是以我论文中的一般递归为基础。为了展示复杂算法可以编码为图灵机，我在黑板上写了很多特定的图灵机代码。一个和我一样刚刚获得数学博士学位的 Ed Moore 一直在旁听这门课程，他在一次课程结束后走到教室前面，向我展示了如何改进我编写的一些代码。然后他说：“我们在街对面有一台这样的机器。”他指的是 ORDVAC，这是伊利诺伊大学制造的一台计算机，与普林斯顿的冯·诺依曼机器非常相似。
</p><p>
In the fall of 1950, amid considerable turmoil in my personal life, I found
myself amid the corn ﬁelds of southern Illinois, where I had moved to take up a
postdoc position at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. In the spring
semester I was able to teach a graduate course on recursive functions. I liked
the intuitive feeling of Turing machines and decided to base my presentation on
them rather than on the general recursions in my dissertation. In showing that
complicated algorithms could be coded for Turing machines, I was writing lots
of speciﬁc Turing machine code on the blackboard. A freshly minted PhD in
mathematics like me, Ed Moore, who had been auditing the course, came to the
front of the room after one of the sessions and showed me how I could improve
some of the code I had written. Then he said, “We have one of those across the
street.” He was referring to the ORDVAC, a computer built at the University of
Illinois pretty much along the lines of von Neumann’s machine in Princeton.
</p>
<p>
我加入 ORDVAC 的契机是朝鲜战争。当杜鲁门决定从军事上抵抗朝鲜入侵时，一群伊利诺伊大学的学者（主要是物理学家）加入了进来，试图利用他们的科学知识来支持这项努力。我被招募到这个新组织——控制系统实验室，我接受了这份工作。一开始，空气中充满了各种令人陶醉的想法：维纳的控制论、香农的计算理论，以及具有未知潜力的计算机。最终，他们决定建立一个系统原型，让 ORDVAC 控制物理设备。具体来说，就是实时驾驶 100 架飞机。编写程序的任务就交给了我。
</p><p>
What brought me to the ORDVAC was the Korean War. When Truman
decided to militarily oppose the invasion of South Korea from the north, a group
of University of Illinois academics, mostly physicists, joined to try to use their
scientiﬁc knowledge to aid the eﬀort. I was recruited for this new organization,
the Control Systems Laboratory, and I accepted the oﬀer. To begin with, there
was a heady brew of ideas in the air: Wiener’s cybernetics, Shannon’s theory of
computation, and computers with their unknown potential. Eventually it was
decided to build a prototype of a system in which the ORDVAC controlled
physical devices. Speciﬁcally, it was to navigate 100 airplanes in real time. And
the task of writing the program that would do this was given to me.
</p>
<p>
ORDVAC 是基于威廉姆存储器构建的，其中数据以电荷的形式存储在阴极射线管 (CRT) 的表面。共有 40 个小型 CRT，每个 CRT 能够以 32 × 32 阵列的形式存储 1024 位数据。因此总内存为 5 KB。内存访问或加法需要 40 毫秒，而乘法或除法需要整整一毫秒。我的程序将响应“雷达”信息，通过计算每架飞机的航向并将其传输给飞机来提供“飞机”的位置信息。计算包括排序部分，其中每个雷达输入与相应的飞机匹配，以及计算航向的部分。
</p><p>
The ORDVAC was built around a William’s memory in which data was
stored as electric charge on the surface of cathode ray tubes (CRTs). There
were 40 small CRTs each capable of storing 1024 bits in a 32 × 32 array. So the
total memory was 5 KB. A memory access or an addition required 40 ms, and
a multiplication or a division required a full millisecond. My program was to
respond to “radar” information providing position information of the “planes”
by computing a heading for each plane and transmitting it to the plane. The
computation consisted of a sorting part, in which each radar input was matched
with the corresponding plane, and a part in which the headings were computed.
</p>
<p>
第一部分我使用了归并排序算法。第二部分我得到了年轻物理学家 Marius Cohen 的帮助，他找到了一种算法，只需一次除法，无需乘法，就能以足够的精度计算正弦函数。所有这些都必须定期中断，以拦截传入的雷达数据。我必须根据执行指令所需的已发布时间，根据手工计算将这些中断放置在代码中。
</p><p>
I used a merge-sort algorithm for the ﬁrst part. For the second part I had the help
of a young physicist, Marius Cohen, who found an algorithm for computing the
sine function to suﬃcient accuracy using just one division and no multiplications.
All of this had to be interrupted regularly to intercept incoming radar data.
I had to place these interruptions in the code based on a hand calculation using
the published times required for the instructions to be carried out.
</p>
<p>
ORDVAC 的程序是用绝对二进制机器语言编写的，没有像汇编语言那样的语言。ORDVAC 没有索引寄存器，因此循环控制需要代码自己操作。尽管如此，我发现编程很有趣。我也很清楚，它本质上与我在课堂上编写图灵机所从事的活动相同。但直到一段时间后我才明白其中的联系有多么紧密。这很有趣，但这不是我自己的工作。当我能够在普林斯顿高等研究院获得两年的支持时，我热切地抓住了这个机会。
</p><p>
Programs for the ORDVAC were written in absolute binary machine lan-
guage, with nothing like an assembly language available. The ORDVAC had no
index register so control of loops required the code to operate on itself. Nev-
ertheless I found programming lots of fun. Also it was clear to me that it was
essentially the same activity that I had been engaged in in the classroom pro-
gramming Turing machines. But it would be some time before I came to under-
stand how intimate the connection is. It was fun, but it wasn’t my own work.
When I was able to obtain support for two years at the Institute for Advanced
Study in Princeton, I eagerly seized the opportunity.
</p>
<p>
回到普林斯顿，我怀着怀孕的妻子弗吉尼亚（我在香槟-厄巴纳认识她并和她结婚），可以自由地思考一些与哥德尔不完备性有关的想法。我还开始写一本书，后来成为《可计算性和不可解性》。我想把可计算性展示为一门成熟的学科，具有多种应用。以图灵机为基础，我希望它与计算机实践的联系能够显现出来。在高等研究院的两年任期结束之前，我能够把一份完整的手写稿带给打字员。我知道我的笔迹很难，但尽管如此，我对打字员的拙劣工作感到沮丧。每一页都需要多次修改，当我把修改后的打字稿带回打字员那里时，他们拒绝处理它。我想，在打印出爱因斯坦、哥德尔和冯·诺依曼等人的作品后，他们觉得有权忽视这位 26 岁访客的需求。打字稿在柜子里搁置了两年多。
</p><p>
Back in Princeton with my pregnant wife Virginia, whom I had met and
married in Champaign-Urbana, I was free to work out some of my ideas related
to G¨odel incompleteness. I also began working on the book that was to become
Computability and Unsolvability. I wanted to show computability as a full-ﬂedged
subject in its own right with diverse applications. Basing it on Turing machines, I
wanted the connections with computer practice to emerge. Before my two years
at the Institute for Advanced Study were up, I was able to bring a complete
handwritten manuscript to the typists. I knew that my handwriting had diﬃcul-
ties, but nevertheless I was dismayed by the poor job the typists had done. Every
page needed many corrections, and when I brought the corrected typescript back
to the typists, they refused to have anything to do with it. I suppose that after
typing the work of such as Einstein, G¨odel, and von Neumann, they felt enti-
tled to ignore the needs of 26 year old mere visitor. The typescript languished in
closets for over two years.
</p>
<p>
根据资助条款，我可以选择找一份暑期工作，而我们当然需要钱。1953 年夏天，我在贝尔实验室工作，从普林斯顿到那里通勤很方便。我的导师是克劳德·香农，我在香槟-厄巴纳读过他关于信息论的基本论文。最先告诉我 ORDVAC 的埃德·摩尔也在那里。香农设计了一台只有两个状态的通用图灵机。他提出了一个问题：能否提供通用性的精确定义？他指出，除非仔细指定输入/输出，否则图灵机可能仅因为输入数据的编码方式而表现出通用行为。我很喜欢这个问题，并写了两篇论文。
</p><p>
The terms of my support gave me the option of seeking summer employment,
and we certainly needed the money. In the summer of 1953 I worked at Bell Labs,
an easy commute from Princeton. My supervisor was Claude Shannon whose
fundamental tract on information theory I had read in Champaign-Urbana. Ed
Moore, who had ﬁrst told me about the ORDVAC, was there as well. Shan-
non had designed a universal Turing machine with only two states. He raised
the question: Can one provide a precise deﬁnition of universality? He pointed
out that unless the input/output is carefully speciﬁed, a Turing machine might
exhibit universal behavior only because of the way input data was coded. I liked
the problem and wrote two papers about it.
</p>
<p>
接下来的那个夏天，我设法获得了一个项目的资金，该项目旨在为普雷斯堡算术编写决策程序。我被允许使用高等研究院的计算机来完成这个项目。我完成了这个项目，然后我们就出发了，开车穿越全国来到加州戴维斯，我将在那里担任加州大学一所分校的数学助理教授。虽然当时加州大学并没有太多的智力活动，但
</p><p>
For the following summer I had managed to receive funding for a project to
program the decision procedure for Presburger arithmetic. I had permission to
use the Institute for Advanced Study computer for the purpose. I completed the
project, and we were oﬀ, driving across the country to Davis, California where I
was going to be an assistant professor of mathematics at one of the campuses of
the University of California. While there wasn’t much intellectual activity in the
</p>
<p>
在 80 英里外的伯克利市戴维斯数学系，伟大的逻辑学家阿尔弗雷德·塔斯基领导着一群杰出的年轻学者。当我被邀请在伯克利数学系的每周座谈会上发言时，我借此机会表达了我对可计算性理论作为数学的一个独立分支的看法。在座的塔斯基在演讲后的讨论中强烈反对我的观点。
</p><p>
Davis mathematics department, in Berkeley, 80 miles away, the great logician
Alfred Tarski led an outstanding group of young scholars. When I was invited to
speak at the weekly colloquium of the Berkeley mathematics department, I took
the opportunity to express my view of computability theory as an autonomous
branch of mathematics. Tarski, who was in the audience, took strong exception
during the discussion after my talk.
</p>
<p>
在我和弗吉尼亚被阵痛惊醒后，我们的第二个儿子内森于凌晨 4 点在家中出生。除了我们，家里唯一的人就是内森两岁的弟弟哈罗德。弗吉尼亚的产科医生远在伯克利，我们只能靠一本产科教科书来应对。在我写这篇文章的时候，哈罗德和内森已经是六十多岁的男人了。
</p><p>
After Virginia and I were awakened by the onset of labor, our second son
Nathan was born at home at 4AM. Other than us, the only person in the house
was Nathan’s two year old brother Harold. Virginia’s obstetrician was far away
in Berkeley, and we made do with an obstetric textbook. As I write, Harold and
Nathan are men well into their sixties.
</p>
<p>
我们在戴维斯只呆了一年，就搬到了俄亥俄州哥伦布市，我再次担任数学助理教授，教授基础学科。一年后，我们又离开了。我热切地接受了伦斯勒理工学院在康涅狄格州东部建立的哈特福德研究生中心的邀请。我在那里呆了三年，硕果累累。那里的教职员工大约有十几个，只有我们三个人教数学，这是一个非常有趣的地方，学生都很成熟，与我在戴维斯和哥伦布教的那些不到 20 岁的学生截然不同。
</p><p>
We remained in Davis for just one year and moved to Columbus, Ohio, where
I was again an assistant professor of mathematics teaching elementary subjects.
Again we left after a year. I eagerly accepted an oﬀer from the Hartford Grad-
uate Center that Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute had established in Eastern
Connecticut. I remained there for three very fruitful years. With a faculty of
perhaps a dozen, with only three of us teaching mathematics, it was quite an
interesting place with mature students, quite diﬀerent from those, not yet 20,
that I had been teaching in Davis and Columbus.
</p>
<p>
那里的秘书们都很乐意提供帮助，他们出色地完成了我的《可计算性和不可解性》手稿的修改工作，使之适合提交给出版商。麦格劳-希尔出版社向我提供了合同，并将它发表在他们的“信息处理和计算机”系列丛书中。我在前言中写道：
</p><p>
The secretaries there were eager to be helpful and did an excellent job of
turning my manuscript for Computability and Unsolvability into proper shape for
being submitted to a publisher. McGraw-Hill oﬀered me a contract and published
it in their series on “Information Processing and Computers”. In my preface I
wrote:
</p>
<p>
通用图灵机的存在……证实了以下信念……可以构建一台可在其上进行编程的“通用”数字计算机……适用于任何可以想象的确定性数字计算机。
</p><p>
The existence of universal Turing machines . . . conﬁrms the belief . . . that
it is possible to construct a single “all-purpose” digital computer on which
can be programmed . . . for any conceivable deterministic digital computer.
</p>
<p>
直到四分之一个世纪过去了，我才明白图灵的通用计算机抽象模型与物理计算机之间的关系有多么密切，前者是后者的前身。
</p><p>
A quarter of a century was to go by before I came to understand just how
intimate was the relationship between Turing’s abstract model of a universal
computer and physical computers, that the former was the progenitor of the
latter.
</p>
<p>
本书从可计算性作为一门独立学科的角度来写。该观点在应用部分得到了强化，其中有关于逻辑、代数和数论的章节。塔斯基在反对我在伯克利演讲中所说的话时表达了同样有效的观点，即可计算性是可定义性理论的一个分支，而可定义性理论是数理逻辑的一部分。
</p><p>
The book was written from the point of view of computability as an indepen-
dent discipline. This view was reinforced by a section on applications with chap-
ters on logic, algebra, and number theory. Tarski’s equally valid view, expressed
when he objected to what I had said in my Berkeley talk, was that computability
is a branch of deﬁnability theory which is part of mathematical logic.
</p>
<p>
当然，在本书写作时，计算机科学这门学科还不存在。然而，计算机科学在很多方面都得益于可计算性理论。它提供了两种计算模型，即图灵机和寄存器机，它们在量化特定算法的渐近复杂性方面非常有用。此外，复杂性类多项式时间、NP 完全性和多项式时间层次的级别都是通过类比可计算性理论中的类别来定义的。
</p><p>
Of course at the time this book was written, the academic discipline of com-
puter science didn’t yet exist. Nevertheless computer science is indebted to com-
putability theory in several ways. It supplied two models of computation, the
Turing macine and the register machine that proved useful in quantifying the
asymptotic complexity of speciﬁc algorithms. Also, the complexity classes poly-
time, NP-completeness, and the levels of the poly-time hierarchy were all deﬁned
by analogy with categories from computability theory.
</p>
<p>
1957 年夏天（《可计算性与不可解性》出版的前一年），在纽约市西北 220 英里的伊萨卡市的康奈尔大学举行了为期五周的“逻辑研究所”会议。85 位逻辑学家出席了会议，几乎全部来自美国。新兴计算机世界的影响已经显而易见。Alonzo Church 的讲座题目是“递归算法在电路合成问题中的应用”。我介绍了我的 Presburger 算术程序。Abraham Robinson 讨论了“证明一个定理（由人、逻辑学家和计算机完成）”。Rabin 和 Scott 在有限自动机方面的基础工作得到了介绍。IBM 派出了一个由 13 人组成的代表团参加“研究所”。除其他外，他们还介绍了 FORTRAN，这引发了争论：与使用汇编语言相比，使用这种“高级”语言编程效率的损失是否可以接受。总共 82 场演讲中，有 19 场明确涉及计算机科学方面。
</p><p>
In the summer of 1957 (a year before Computability and Unsolvability was
published) there was a remarkable ﬁve week “Institute for Logic” at Cornell
University in Ithaca, 220 miles northwest of New York City. 85 logicians
attended, almost all from the U.S. The inﬂuence of the newly developing world
of computers was already evident. Alonzo Church lectured on “Application of
Recursive Arithmetic to the Problem of Circuit Synthesis”. I spoke about my
program for Presburger arithmetic. Abraham Robinson discussed “Proving a
Theorem (As Done by Man, Logician, and Computer)”. Rabin and Scott’s fun-
damental work on ﬁnite automata was presented. IBM sent a contingent of 13 to
the “Institute”. Among other things they presented FORTRAN, initiating con-
troversy on whether the loss of eﬃciency in programming in such a “high level”
language compared to using assembly language was supportable. Altogether of
the 82 talks presented, 19 had a deﬁnite computer science aspect.

我和普林斯顿大学的年轻哲学家希拉里·普特南成为了好朋友，我们决定在逻辑学院学习期间和家人一起住在伊萨卡的一间小房子里。我们几乎每天都在一起，这直接导致了我们富有成效的合作。我研究过我所谓的丢番图集。如果存在多项式 p(a, x1, x2, . . . , xn)，并且当且仅当存在自然数 x1, x2, . . . , xn 使得 p(a, x1, x2, . . . , xn) = 0，则自然数集 S 是丢番图集。在我的论文中，我曾推测，每个可列出的自然数集4（即存在生成集合成员列表的算法）也是丢番图集。我朝着证明这个猜想迈出了第一小步。很容易看出，如果这个猜想成立，那么希尔伯特在 1900 年提出的 23 个问题中的第十个就会得到解答。希拉里和我开始研究这个猜想；我们找到了一种新方法，得出了一个不错的定理，我们很高兴在研究所展示这个定理。我不会声称这是计算机科学，但在我们的合作记录中不可能忽略它。
</p><p>
I had become friendly with Hilary Putnam, a young philosopher at Princeton,
and we decided to share a small house in Ithaca with our families for the duration
of the Logic Institute. We were together nearly every day, and this led directly to
our fruitful collaboration. I had studied what I had called Diophantine sets. A set
S of natural numbers is Diophantine if there is a polynomial p(a, x1, x2, . . . , xn)
such that a ∈ S if and only if there are natural numbers x1, x2, . . . , xn for which
p(a, x1, x2, . . . , xn) = 0. In my dissertation I had conjectured that every set of
natural numbers which is listable4, in the sense that there is an algorithm that
generates a list of the members of the set, is also Diophantine. I had taken a ﬁrst
small step towards proving this conjecture. It was easy to see that the truth of
the conjecture would yield a solution to the tenth of the 23 problems that Hilbert
famously had proposed in 1900. Hilary and I began working on this conjecture;
we found a new approach yielding a nice theorem that we were pleased to present
at the Institute. I would not claim that this was computer science, but it would
be impossible to omit it from any account of our collaboration.
</p>
<p>
我们对所取得的成果感到非常满意，因此决定寻求资金，以便我们在夏季一起工作。由于专家们认为我的猜想不太可能成真，我们认为为此寻求资金是没有希望的。因此，我们决定写一份关于计算机生成定理证明的提案。具体来说，我们提议研究一阶逻辑的证明程序。我们提议的程序包括一种算法，用于解决后来被称为 SAT 的可满足性问题。我们写了一份提案，但如果我们希望在接下来的夏天一起工作，那么提交给资助机构已经太晚了。希拉里的一位朋友建议我们把它寄给国家安全局 (NSA)。我们俩都没有听说过这个机构，但为了不失去什么，我们把它提交给了他们。一个电话邀请我去马里兰州的国家安全局总部。当我告诉他们我从未听说过这个机构时，他们笑了，说他们的宣传办公室做得很好。 NSA 不会一直默默无闻。当他们中的两个人叛逃到苏联时，这件事成了头条新闻。当我们谈到我们的提议时，他们明确表示他们对一阶逻辑的证明程序不感兴趣，但他们对 SAT 感兴趣。
</p><p>
We were so pleased by what we had accomplished that we decided to seek
funding enabling us to work together during the summer months. Because the
experts regarded my conjecture as very unlikely to be true, we thought it would
be hopeless to seek funding for that. So we decided instead to write a proposal
for work on computer generated proofs of theorems. Speciﬁcally we proposed
to work on a proof procedure for ﬁrst order logic. Our proposed procedure was
to include an algorithm for what has come to be called SAT, the satisﬁability
problem. We wrote a proposal, but it was too late for submission to the funding
agencies if we hoped to work together the following summer. A friend of Hilary
suggested we send it to the National Security Agency (NSA). Neither of us had
heard of this agency, but, nothing to lose, we submitted it to them. A phone
call came inviting me to visit the NSA’s headquarters in Maryland. When I told
them that I had never heard of the agency, they laughed and said their publicity
oﬃce was doing a good job. The NSA was not to remain so obscure for long. It
became front-page news when two of their people defected to the Soviet Union.
When we talked about our proposal, they made it clear that they had no
interest in proof procedures for ﬁrst order logic, but they were interested in SAT.
</p>
<p>
他们警告我，这是一个难题，并怀疑我们能否在一个夏天内取得很大进展。但是，如果我们愿意只研究 SAT，他们愿意资助我们的提案。我立即同意了。我们在夏末提交给他们的报告 5，没有提到资助机构，正如他们所要求的那样。该报告介绍了一种技术，即首先将要测试可满足性的布尔公式转换为合取范式。这相当于一个析取子句列表，这种格式得到了广泛的使用。报告提供了各种可满足性测试技术，并附有示例。
</p><p>
They warned me that it is a diﬃcult problem and doubted that we could make
much headway in one summer. However if we were willing to work only on
SAT, they were prepared to fund our proposal. I agreed at once. Our report5
submitted to them at the end of the summer, made no mention of the funding
agency, as they had requested. The report introduced the technique of initially
transforming a Boolean formula being tested for satisﬁability into conjunctive
normal form. This amounted to a list of disjunctive clauses, a format that came
into widespread use. Various techniques were oﬀered for satisﬁability testing with
examples.
</p>
<p>
接下来的夏天，我们得到了一个旨在支持基础科学的机构的资助。我们不受任何限制，开始研究我的猜想：每个可列表集都是丢番图。我们设法找到了一个较弱结果的证明：每个可列表集都是指数丢番图，这意味着代数表达式中允许使用可变指数。6 有关我们报告中与我的猜想相关的部分，请参阅 [18] 第 411-430 页。在撰写报告时，我们想起我们向该机构提出的提案要求进行机器定理证明。因此，使用我们去年夏天报告中的一些算法，以及对 Herbrand 宇宙（我后来在 [2] 中引入的一个术语）的详尽搜索，我们得到了证明程序。我们将其写成了报告，一时兴起，我将其提交给了 ACM 杂志。他们发表了它 [14]，它无疑是我发表的被引用次数最多的论文，也是“戴维斯-普特南程序”的来源。我们向这两个机构提交的报告的纸质版保存在 Donald Knuth 维护的档案中。Julia 告诉我，当她将我们的报告副本带给俄罗斯数学家时，他们惊讶地发现美国空军资助了丢番图集的研究，而这项研究不太可能产生任何实际应用。
</p><p>
The following summer, we had funding from an agency whose mission was to
support fundamental science. Not constrained, we set to work on my conjecture
that every listable set is Diophantine. We managed to ﬁnd a proof of the weaker
result that every listable set is exponential Diophantine, meaning that variable
exponents were permitted in the algebraic expression.6 For the part of our report
related to my conjecture, see [18] pp. 411–430. While we were writing our report,
we recalled that our proposal to the agency called for work on machine theorem
proving. So using a selection of the algorithms from our report of the previous
summer together with an exhaustive search of the Herbrand universe (a term
I later introduced in [2]), we had our proof procedure. We wrote it up for our
report, and, on a whim, I submitted it to the Journal of the ACM. They published
it [14] and it is easily the most cited of my publications, the source of the “Davis-
Putnam procedure”. Hard copies of our reports to the two agencies are in an
archive maintained by Donald Knuth. Julia told me that when she brought a
copy of our report for the Russian mathematicians, they were astonished that
the US Air Force funded research on Diophantine sets, research that was very
unlikely to lead to any practical applications.

1959 年春，我意外地收到一封信，信中说纽约大学数学与力学研究所将给我一年的职位。我以前也曾向他们打过招呼，但他们当时的提议并不令人满意。这个研究所完全是由理查德·库朗 (Richard Courant) 创立的。库朗是犹太人，他曾是哥廷根数学研究所的主要创始人之一，后来被该研究所开除。库朗来到纽约大学时，那里没有重要的数学研究活动；他着手弥补这一缺陷，而且确实成功了。库朗去世后，他的研究所被恰当地重新命名为：库朗数学科学研究所。我非常高兴地接受了这个提议。我可以自由地进行自己的研究，可以教授研究生的数理逻辑课程，还可以使用 IBM 704 计算机。我们确信我们会在纽约呆很长时间，于是我们切断了与康涅狄格州的联系，搬进了纽约上西区一间俯瞰哈德逊河的公寓。
</p><p>
In the spring of 1959, I was surprised to receive a letter oﬀering me a year
appointment at the Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics at New York Uni-
versity (NYU). I had ﬂirted with them before, but their oﬀer at that time had
been unsatisfactory. This institute was totally the creation of Richard Courant.
A Jew, he had been expelled from the mathematical institute at G¨ottingen of
which he had been a principal founder. There was no mathematical research
activity of consequence at NYU when Courant arrived; he set out to remedy
that, and he certainly succeeded. After his death, his institute was ﬁttingly
renamed: the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. I was very happy to
accept the oﬀer. I was free to do my own research, I could teach a graduate
course in mathematical logic, and I would have access to an IBM 704 computer.
Convinced that we would be in New York for a long time, we cut our ties to
Connecticut, and moved into an apartment overlooking the Hudson River, on
the upper west side of New York.
</p>
<p>
由于能够使用 IBM 704，我很想看看 Hilary 和我开发的证明程序在物理计算机上的表现。我找到了两位非常优秀的同事，他们都是研究生，Donald Loveland7 和 George Logemann，负责实际编程。我们很快发现 Davis-Putnam 一阶逻辑证明程序存在缺陷。除了最简单的问题之外，内存都会不堪重负。我们决定利用磁带驱动器形式的外部存储，通过更改算法来利用它们。我们将 [14] 中的规则 III（后来称为二进制解析）替换为规则 III∗，我们称之为“分裂”，这导致了 SAT 的分而治之算法，后来被称为 DPLL。当出现两种情况时，算法会将其中一种情况放入堆栈，并处理另一种情况。8 Loveland-Logemann 程序结合了 SAT 的 DPLL 算法，与之前的尝试相比有了很大的改进，但仍然远远不够。论文 [17]（Loveland 本人是作者之一）更详细地讨论了这段历史，并结合当代 SAT 求解器对其进行了更新。
</p><p>
My access to the IBM 704, tempted me to see how the proof procedure
Hilary and I had developed, would do on a physical computer. I was provided
with two excellent colleagues, both graduate students, Donald Loveland7 and
George Logemann, to do the actual programming. The deﬁciencies of the Davis-
Putnam proof procedure for ﬁrst order logic were soon made clear. On any
but the simplest problems, the memory was overwhelmed. We decided to take
advantage of the availability of external storage in the form of tape drives, by
changing the algorithm to make use of them We replaced Rule III from [14]
(which was what would later be called binary resolution) with Rule III∗, we called
“splitting”, which led to the divide-and-conquer algorithm for SAT that came
to be called DPLL. When a split into two cases occurs, the algorithm places one
of them on a stack and attends to the other.8 The Loveland-Logemann program
incorporating the DPLL algorithm for SAT was a substantial improvement over
the previous attempt, but still fell far short. The paper [17], with Loveland
himself one of the authors, discusses this history in more detail, and brings it
up to date in connection with contemporary SAT solvers.
</p>
<p>
我们的经验表明，任何重大进展都需要控制原子公式替换实例的指数增长。当时通过邮件寄来的 Dag Prawitz 的论文 [19] 的副本包含了一个重要线索。尽管论文中的实际证明过程过于繁琐，无法成为有用的计算机程序的基础，但它确实强调了替换的重要性，这些替换使文字对相互否定。这一点在我在美国数学学会赞助的研讨会上发表演讲时写的文章 [2] 中得到了强调。艾伦·罗宾逊 (Alan Robinson) 的解决原则 [20] 指出了一个新的令人信服的方向，从我们的工作中汲取了互补文字的重要性，以及以子句合取的形式输入，每个子句由文字析取组成。我想这就是为什么 Siekmann 和 Wrightson 在他们的文集 [21] 中授予我的 [2] 一颗星，以表示这是一篇重要的文章。我在[3]中更详细地讨论了这一历史。
</p><p>
Our experience made it clear that any serious progress would require taming
the exponential growth of substitution instances of atomic formulas. A copy of
Dag Prawitz’s paper [19], that arrived by postal mail at this time, contained
an important clue. Although the actual proof procedure in the paper was far
too unwieldy to be the basis of a useful computer program, it did highlight the
signiﬁcance of substitutions that make pairs of literals negations of one another.
This was emphasized in my article [2] written in connection with a talk I gave at
a symposium sponsored by the American Mathematical Society. Alan Robinson’s
resolution principle [20] that pointed to a new compelling direction, took from
our work the importance of complementary literals as well input in the form of
a conjunction of clauses, each consisting of a disjunction of literals. I think that
is why Siekmann and Wrightson awarded my [2] a star, signifying an important
article, in their anthology [21]. I discuss the history more fully in [3].

正如我所希望和预料的那样，我获得了纽约大学的终身教职。然而，一个意想不到的好消息传来。纽约市华盛顿高地社区的叶史瓦学院长期以来一直提供

As I had hoped and rather expected, I was oﬀered a tenure-track position at
NYU. However, a better oﬀer came from an unexpected quarter. Yeshiva College
in the Washington Height neighborhood of New York City had long been oﬀering
</p>
<p>
本科教育结合了美国文科课程和传统正统犹太教拉比培训。然而，叶史瓦学院已成为叶史瓦大学，在许多领域提供世俗研究生教育。当我在纽约大学访问的一年即将结束时，我收到了新成立的叶史瓦大学科学研究生院的录取通知。这份录取通知比我从纽约大学收到的录取通知更有吸引力。我将教授的研究生课程主题将包括我自己的专业。我很乐意接受。库朗研究所慷慨地继续提供 IBM 704 以及洛夫兰和洛格曼的才华，我们得以完成我们的项目。
</p><p>
an undergraduate education that combined an American liberal arts curriculum
with traditional orthodox Jewish rabbinical training. However, Yeshiva College
had become Yeshiva University oﬀering secular graduate education in a number
of areas. As my year as a visitor at NYU was nearing its end, I received an oﬀer
from the newly founded Graduate School of Science at Yeshiva University. It was
a much more attractive oﬀer than the one I had received from NYU. The topics
of the graduate courses I would be teaching would include my own specialty. I
was happy to accept. The Courant Institute graciously continued to make the
IBM 704 and the talents of Loveland and Logemann available, and we were able
to complete our project.
</p>
<p>
1965 年，出于多种原因，我离开了 Yeshiva。我回到了纽约大学，那里是我 1996 年退休前的学术故乡。我是一个机械定理证明项目的首席研究员，但当时我在纽约大学的同事 Don Loveland 抓住了这个机会，让他的模型消除程序得以实施。这篇论文 [16] 就是我与多位合作者共同努力的成果。
</p><p>
In 1965, for a number of reasons, it was time to leave Yeshiva. I returned to
NYU which was to be my academic home until I retired in 1996. I was Primcipal
Investigator on a mechanical theorem-proving project, but it was Don Loveland,
at that time a colleague at NYU, who seized the opportunity to see his model
elimination procedure implemented. The paper [16] with a number of collabora-
tors, was the result of this eﬀort.

1969 年春天，我住在伦敦，正在休假，收到了一封来自 Courant 研究所所长 J¨urgen Moser 的信。Courant 正在组建一个新的计算机科学系，由我的老朋友兼同事 Jack Schwartz 担任系主任。信中邀请我加入，经过一番深思熟虑后，我同意了。我发现自己参与了新系在 Courant 研究所中寻找自己位置的努力。这个过程并非没有一定程度的摩擦。该系不仅希望在 Courant 传统中凭借尖端基础研究取得成功，而且还开设了一个很快变得非常受欢迎的本科专业。需要教授这些学生的教师为我们提供了聘请有前途的新教师的机会。
</p><p>
In the spring of 1969, I was living in London, on sabbatical leave, when
a letter arrived from J¨urgen Moser, Director of the Courant Institute. A new
department of computer science was being formed at Courant with my old friend
and colleague Jack Schwartz as chair. The letter asked me to join, and, after
some soul searching, I accepted. I found myself involved in the eﬀorts of the
new department to ﬁnd its place in the Courant Institute. This did not proceed
without a certain amount of friction. The department not only hoped to achieve
success with cutting edge fundamental research in the Courant tradition, but
also oﬀered an undergraduate major that quickly became very popular. The
need for faculty to teach these students provided us with the opportunity to hire
promising new faculty.
</p>
<p>
1976-77 学年，我又一次放假了。我在伯克利度过了两个夏天，很想再去那里呆一年。为了多赚点钱，我向约翰·麦卡锡（他曾是普林斯顿的同学）咨询暑期工作。他建议我坐飞机去演讲。我认为杰克·施瓦茨提出的关于证明检验器可扩展性的问题是一个合适的话题。我记得在飞机上解决了一些简单的细节问题。7 月份，我在斯坦福大学约翰的人工智能实验室工作得很愉快。我喜欢约翰营造的游戏氛围。到处都是终端，不使用时会显示“带我去，我是你的”。我被鼓励使用理查德·韦劳赫最近开发的 FOL 证明检验器。使用这个系统，我从集合论的公理中开发了鸽巢原理的完整形式证明。我觉得能够坐在键盘前开发完整的形式化证明是一件很棒的事情，但我对需要经过许多艰苦的微小步骤来证明非常明显的推论感到恼火。FOL 形式化了一阶逻辑的“自然演绎”版本。执行推理的标准范例是删除量词、应用命题演算并替换量词。我意识到，从 Herbrand 证明的角度来看，每个小推论都可以使用每个子句不超过一个替换实例来执行。我认为这种可能性为推论显而易见的含义提供了合理的描述。斯坦福大学的一名本科生使用贝尔实验室开发的链接合取定理证明器的 LISP 源代码，成功地将“显而易见”的功能作为 FOL 的附加功能实现。我发现，有了这个工具，我对鸽巢原理的证明时间就缩短了 10 倍。这项工作在 1981 年于温哥华举行的第七届国际人工智能大会上进行了描述 [4]。10
</p><p>
For the academic year 1976–77, I was again on sabbatical leave. I had spent
two summers in Berkeley and was eager to try a whole year. To earn a little
extra money, I approached John McCarthy (who had been a fellow student at
Princeton) about a summer job. He suggested that I ﬂy out and give a talk. I
thought a question that Jack Schwartz had posed about extensibility of proof
checkers would be an appropriate topic. I remember working out the easy details
on the plane.9 I had an enjoyable time working at for the month of July at John’s
Artiﬁcial Intelligence Laboratory at Stanford University. I loved the atmosphere
of play that John had fostered. The terminals that were everywhere proclaimed
“Take me, I’m yours”, when not in use. I was encouraged to work with the FOL
proof checker that had recently been developed by Richard Weyhrauch. Using
this system, I developed a complete formal proof of the pigeon-hole principle from
axioms for set theory. I found it neat to be able to sit at a keyboard and actually
develop a complete formal proof, but I was irritated by the need to pass through
many painstaking tiny steps to justify inferences that were quite obvious. FOL
formalized a “natural deduction” version of First Order Logic. The standard
paradigm for carrying out inferences was to strip quantiﬁers, apply propositional
calculus, and replace quantiﬁers. I realized that from the viewpoint of Herbrand
proofs, each of these mini-deductions could be carried out using no more than one
substitution instance of each clause. I decided that this very possibility provided
a reasonable characterization of what it means for an inference to be obvious.
Using the LISP source code for the linked-conjunct theorem prover that had been
developed at Bell Labs, a Stanford undergraduate successfully implemented an
“obvious” facility as an add-on to FOL. I found that having this facility available,
cut the length of my proof of the pigeon-hole principle by a factor of 10. This
work was described at the Seventh Joint International Congress on Artiﬁcial
Intelligence held in Vancouver in 1981 [4].10
</p>
<p>
计算机科学系的政策是，在新员工进入本系工作第三年时，对他们进行一次评估，以帮助他们和我们初步了解他们在第六年后获得终身教职的前景。我大概是在 1980 年被委以重任，对 Elaine Weyuker 的工作进行评估。她在罗格斯大学获得的博士学位是理论计算机科学。在阅读她最近的研究论文时，我惊讶地发现，她正以理论家的眼光看待一个非常实际的问题：软件测试。程序员肯定会试图消除他们编写的程序中的错误。但很难提前设想一个给定程序将在哪些不同的环境和其他情况下使用。通常，在将程序发布给公众之前，会通过收集一组输入数据，然后在每个输入上运行程序来测试程序。众所周知，出于理论和实践原因，使用一组有限的输入运行程序无法保证程序的正确性。因此，“质量保证”专业人员试图收集他们认为“足够”的测试数据。Elaine 正在研究“足够”的概念。
</p><p>
It became the Computer Science Department’s policy to provide our new
hires with a review as they were completing their third year with us, to help
them and us with an initial indication of their prospects for achieving tenure
after their sixth year. It must have been around 1980 that I was given the task of
conducting such a review of the work of Elaine Weyuker. Her PhD from Rutgers
had been in theoretical computer science. Reading her recent research papers, I
was surprised that she was looking, with a theoretician’s eye, at a very practical
problem: software testing. Programmers will certainly try to eliminate the bugs
from the programs they write. But it is very diﬃcult to envision in advance all
the various environments and other circumstances in which a given program will
be used. Generally, before a program is released to the public, it is tested by
assembling a set of input data, and then running the program on each of these
inputs. It is well understood that for both theoretical and practical reasons,
running a program with a ﬁnite set of inputs can not guarantee the correctness
of a program. So, “quality assurance” professionals attempt to assemble test data
that they regard as “adequate”. Elaine was studying this notion of adequacy.
</p>
<p>
她的工作给我留下了深刻的印象，同时也对以客观方式研究的可能性感到好奇，而客观研究这一概念在实践中是基于直觉和经验主观对待的。我们很快就开始了合作。除了一本理论计算机科学教科书外，我们还撰写了三篇联合论文。[11] 关注的是测试一个预期输入输出行为未知的程序的问题。在这种情况下，无法判断一组测试数据生成的输出是否正确。这篇论文仍然被引用。我们的 [12] 和 [13] 建议了充分性的正式定义，其基于这样的直觉：一组充分的测试数据应该将被测试的程序与所有其他程序区分开来，但那些输入输出与给定程序等同的程序除外。
</p><p>
I was both impressed by her work and intrigued by the possibility of studying
in an objective manner, a notion treated in practice subjectively based on intu-
ition and experience. We soon began a collaboration. In addition to a textbook
on theoretical computer science, we wrote three joint papers. [11] is concerned
with the problem of testing a program whose expected input-output behavior is
not known. In such a case one couldn’t tell whether the output generated by a
set of test data is correct. This paper is still cited. Our [12] and [13] suggested
formal deﬁnitions of adequacy based on the intuition that an adequate set of test
data should separate the program being tested from all other programs with the
exception of those input-output equivalent to the given program.
</p>
<p>
1977 年《计算机杂志》上发表的一篇题​​为《另一台图灵机》的文章引起了我的注意。在此之前，图灵的名字在现代数字计算机起源的历史记载中很少被提及。尽管我确信图灵对计算本质的探索以及他建造的通用机器为它们提供了理论基础，但我不知道这种联系有多么具体。从这篇文章中我了解到，图灵 1946 年的 Ace 报告包含了存储程序计算机的完整设计，包括电子电路，甚至还估算了它的总价格。1986 年，同一作者 Brian Carpenter 和 Doran 出版了图灵一些以前未发表的手稿的合集，包括 ACE 报告本身以及图灵在 1947 年 2 月向伦敦数学学会发表的一次精彩演讲的文本 [1]。在演讲中，图灵明确地将万能存储程序计算机的想法与他的通用机器概念联系起来。此外，他还对计算机的未来功能给出了广阔的展望。
</p><p>
An article entitled The Other Turing Machine that appeared in the Computer
Journal in 1977 caught my attention. Up to that point, Turing’s name had
scarcely been mentioned in historical accounts of the origin of modern digital
computers. Although I was convinced that Turing’s exploration of the nature
of computation with his construction of a universal machine had provided their
theoretical underpinnings, I had no idea how concrete the connection was. From
the article I learned that Turing’s Ace Report of 1946 contained the complete
design of a stored program computer, including the electronic circuits, and even
estimated its total price. In 1986, the same authors, Brian Carpenter and Doran,
published a collection of some of Turing’s previously unpublished manuscripts
including the ACE report itself as well as the text of a remarkable lecture that
Turing had delivered to the London Mathematical Society in February 1947 [1].
In the lecture, Turing explicitly tied the idea of an all-purpose stored program
computer to his concept of a universal machine. In addition he provided an
expansive vision of the future capabilities of the computer.
</p>
<p>
到那时，我才明白，关于冯·诺依曼是否应该分享“存储程序概念”的功劳的争论是完全错误的。冯·诺依曼曾参与希尔伯特基础程序的研究，他是最早认识到哥德尔不可判定性意义的人之一，他肯定理解图灵理论研究的实际意义。此外，作为一名逻辑学家，我也不禁意识到图灵工作的历史传统。我认为让受过教育的公众了解其中的一些内容很重要。我决心写一本书来讲述这个故事。我申请并获得了古根海姆奖，以资助必要的研究。我的《通用计算机》于 2000 年出版[6,7]。在我的导言中，我写道
</p><p>
By this time, it was clear to me that the debate over whether von Neu-
mann should share the credit for the “stored program concept” was entirely
misplaced. Von Neumann who had worked on Hilbert’s foundational program
and who was among the ﬁrst to recognize the signiﬁcance of G¨odel undecidabil-
ity, would surely have understood the practical relevance of Turing’s theoretical
investigations. Also, as a logician, I could not help being aware of the histori-
cal tradition in which Turing worked. I thought that it was important that the
educated public become aware of some of this. I was determined to write a book
that would tell this story. I applied for and received a Guggenheim award to
fund the necessary research. My “Universal Computer” was published in 2000
[6,7]. In my Introduction I wrote
</p>
<p>
冯·诺依曼作为一名逻辑学家的专业知识以及他从英国逻辑学家艾伦·图灵那里学到的知识使他能够理解计算机是逻辑机器这一基本事实。它的电路体现了几个世纪以来一群杰出的逻辑学家的精辟见解。如今，当计算机技术以惊人的速度发展时，我们钦佩工程师们真正非凡的成就，却很容易忽视那些使这一切成为可能的逻辑学家的想法。
</p><p>
It was von Neumann’s expertise as a logician and what he had learned
from the English logician Alan Turing that enabled him to understand
the fundamental fact that a computing machine is a logic machine. In
its circuits are embodied the distilled insights of a remarkable collection
of logicians, developed over centuries. Nowadays, when computer technol-
ogy is advancing with such breathtaking rapidity, as we admire the truly
remarkable accomplishments of the engineers, it is all too easy to overlook
the logicians whose ideas made it all possible.
</p>
<p>
2012 年为纪念图灵百年诞辰出版了第二版。2018 年出版的第三版让我有机会撰写关于使用深度学习技术进行围棋计算机的显著成功的文章。
</p><p>
There was a second edition for Turing’s centenary in 2012. A third edition of 2018
gave me the opportunity to write about the remarkable success of Go-playing
computers using deep learning technology.
</p>
<p>
但我有些操之过急了。这本书是为受过教育的公众而写的。但首先，我想向同行们说明图灵在现代计算机起源中的关键作用。在我的文章 [5] 中，我试图做到这一点，同时在开头部分简要介绍了莱布尼茨，以免忽视图灵工作的历史基础。11 图灵的作用逐渐得到认可。当我的书 [6] 出版时，我可以引用《时代》杂志的话来说明这一点。卡彭特和多兰的作品在这一变化中发挥了关键作用，安德鲁·霍奇斯的图灵传记也发挥了重要作用。想到我的文章也可能发挥了作用，我会感到非常欣慰。
</p><p>
But I’m getting ahead of myself. The book was to be for the educated pub-
lic. But ﬁrst, I wanted to make the case for Turing’s crucial role in the origin
of the modern computer to fellow professionals. In my essay [5] I tried to do
this, while including a brief initial section on Leibniz, so as not to neglect the
historical underpinning of Turing’s work.11 Gradually Turing’s role came to be
recognized. By the time my book [6] appeared, I could quote Time magazine
to that eﬀect. The work of Carpenter and Doran played a crucial role in this
change, as did Andrew Hodges’s masterful biography of Turing. I would ﬁnd it
extremely gratifying to think that my essay might also have played a part.
</p>
<p>
我很惊讶地收到了图灵传记作者安德鲁·霍奇斯 (Andrew Hodges) 的一封电子邮件，他提醒我注意哲学家杰克·科普兰 (Jack Copeland) 最近发表的文章，其中涉及图灵在其普林斯顿大学论文中引入的“神谕”概念。科普兰提出，是时候将这种神谕作为物理现实来获取，以便能够计算丘奇-图灵论题意义上无法计算的事物。在 1999 年《科学美国人》的一篇热门文章（与黛安·普劳德富特 (Diane Proudfoot) 合著）中，他宣布：“开始寻找”神谕。他甚至提出了一种电容器，用于存储电荷，其值是一个无限精度的实数，可以用作神谕。任何读过图灵论文并稍加理解的人都会明白，图灵的神谕是一种数学抽象，是为了特定的数学目的而引入的。而就科普兰电容器而言，自二十世纪初以来，人们就已经了解到电荷由整数个电子组成。
</p><p>
I was surprised by an email message from Andrew Hodges, Turing’s biog-
rapher, calling my attention to recent publications by the philosopher Jack
Copeland that concerned Turing’s introduction of the notion of an “oracle” in his
Princeton dissertation. Copeland, was proposing that it was time to obtain such
an oracle as a physical reality in order to be able to compute things that were
uncomputable in the sense of the Church-Turing Thesis. In a popular article in
the Scientiﬁc American 1999 (coauthored with Diane Proudfoot), he announced:
“the search is on” for an oracle. He even proposed a capacitor storing a charge
whose value was an inﬁnite precision real number that could serve as the oracle.
Anyone who read Turing’s dissertation with a modicum of comprehension would
have understood that Turing’s oracle was a mathematical abstraction introduced
for a speciﬁc mathematical purpose. And, as far as Copeland’s capacitor is con-
cerned, since the early years of the twentieth century, it has been understood
that an electric charge consists of an integer number of electrons.

之前，我曾被 Hava Siegelmann 在 1995 年《科学》杂志上发表的一篇题​​为《超越图灵极限的计算》的文章所震惊。《科学》是美国科学促进会的一份非常有声望的期刊，人们习惯于在杂志上看到生物科学领域的重要研究。Siegelmann 的文章并没有给我留下深刻的印象。她确实可以生成一个接受双字母表上的任何语言的网络。秘诀在于，将所需的语言编码为一个无限精度的实数，然后将其用作网络中的一个“神经元”的权重。实际上，语言被内置到接受它的网络中。她在《神经网络和模拟计算：超越图灵极限》（Birkh¨auser，波士顿，1999 年）一书中重申了她的观点。我在 [8] 中写到了这一切，并认为事情到此结束。

I had previously been astonished by an article by Hava Siegelmann in Science
1995 with the title Computation Beyond the Turing Limit. Science is the very
prestigious journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science,
where one is used to seeing important research in the biological sciences. I was not
impressed by Siegelmann’s article. It was certainly true that given any language
on a two-letter alphabet, she could produce one of her networks that would
accept it. The secret was that the desired language was coded into an inﬁnite
precision real number which was then used as a weight in one of the “neurons”
in her net. In eﬀect the language was built into the net that accepted it. She
reiterated her claim in her book, Neural Networks and Analog Computation:
Beyond the Turing Limit, Birkh¨auser, Boston 1999. I wrote about all of this in
[8], and thought that was the end of the matter.

然而，似乎有一场超级计算运动。有许多人考虑计算不可计算的东西，他们不惧在有限的时间内尝试做无数的事情。有量子绝热冷却来解决希尔伯特第十问题，有些人确信我们的大脑已经是超级计算机了。在旧金山举行的美国数学学会会议上，有一个关于超级计算的特别会议。在告别这种胡说八道之前，我又写了两篇关于这种胡说八道的文章。
</p><p>
However, it seemed that there was a hypercomputation movement. There
were various people who thought about computing the uncomputable, unde-
terred by the prospect of trying to do inﬁnitely many things in a ﬁnite mount
of time. There was quantum adiabatic cooling to solve Hilbert’s tenth problem
and some who were convinced that our brains are already hypercomputers. At
a meeting of the American Mathematical Society in San Francisco, there was a
special session on hypercomputation. I wrote two additional articles about this
nonsense before saying farewell to it.

理论计算机科学家似乎普遍相信 P (cid:3)=NP。长期以来，我都觉得这种信念是错误的。通常给出的启发式论证依赖于将 P 视为存在可计算算法来确定成员资格的语言类。但显然，如果 c 和/或 k 很大，则以 cpk 为时间界限的算法完全无用。在我关于这个主题的讲座中，我谈到了线性规划，它提供了一个有用的教训。线性规划曾经被认为可能是 NP 难问题，但结果却是 P 难问题。感谢 Margaret Wright，我展示了一个大型线性规划问题的例子，对于该问题，旧的指数时间单纯形法比最好的“障碍”多项时间算法表现更好。我不知道命题 P = NP 是否正确。可能是 P (cid:3)= NP 是正确的，但由于严重的技术困难，它尚未得到证明。但我认为同样有可能的是，它没有被证明是因为它是错误的。也许存在一个多项式时间算法，用于在时间限制内具有大指数的 SAT。我对希尔伯特第十问题的经验以及人们对我们试图做的事情的态度使我相信，我们对高阶多项式的直觉并不十分可靠。
</p><p>
It seems to be an article of faith among theoretical computer scientists that
P (cid:3)= NP. It has long seemed to me that this faith is misplaced. The heuristic
arguments usually given depend on regarding P as the class of languages for
which computationally feasible algorithms exist for deciding membership. But
obviously an algorithm with cpk as a time bound is utterly useless if c and/or k
are large. In my lectures on this topic, I talk about linear programming as pro-
viding a useful lesson. Once thought to likely be NP-hard, linear programming
turned out to be in P. Courtesy of Margaret Wright, I show an example of a
large linear programming problem for which the old exponential time simplex
method does better than the best “barrier” poly-time algorithm. I have no idea
whether the proposition P = NP is true. It may be that P (cid:3)= NP is true, and
that it hasn’t been proved because of serious technical diﬃculties. But I think
it is equally likely that it hasn’t been proved because it is false. Perhaps there
is a poly-time algorithm for SAT with a large exponent in the time bound. My
experience with Hilbert’s tenth problem and people’s attitudes to what we were
trying to do, has led me to believe that our intuitions about polynomials of high
degree are not very reliable.

2012 年是阿兰·图灵诞辰 100 周年。因此，那一年，能够就图灵相关主题发表演讲的演讲者非常抢手。我曾到过九个相距很远的地方发表演讲，最远的要数意大利的比萨和秘鲁的阿雷基帕。第一次是在根特，第二次是在波士顿。我的演讲题目是“普遍性无处不在”[9]。图灵的抽象计算模型通过为他的设备提供无限的内存，仅用几个非常基本的操作就能实现普遍性。这表明，物理设备接近普遍性的程度，关键取决于为其提供尽可能多的内存。图灵在 1947 年的演讲中非常明确地强调了这一点 [1]，随着内存越来越大，我们的设备能做的事情也越来越多，这一点显而易见。因为只需很少的基本操作就能实现普遍性，所以在想象巴贝奇的分析机或布莱切利园解密工作中建造的巨像具有无限内存之后，再追溯其普遍性是没有意义的。DNA 的非编码部分是否包含计算能力？也许在进化中发挥作用？我厚颜无耻地沿着这些思路推测。2018 年是我的 90 岁生日。欧洲可计算性组织在基尔举行的会议上，计算历史和哲学特别会议庆祝了我的生日。我的发言题目是“图灵的愿景和深度学习”。我记得图灵曾想象过有一天计算机会将其原始程序修改到程序员不再理解它在做什么的程度。尽管如此，图灵表示，它可能做得很好。在古老的围棋游戏中取得如此显著成功的神经网络程序员正处于这样的境地。自动驾驶汽车的程序员也是如此。因此，将图灵七十年前的想象与当今最先进的技术成果结合起来似乎是结束这个故事的绝佳方式。

2012 was the year of Alan Turing’s 100th birthday. So speakers who were
able to give a lecture on a Turing-related subject were in considerable demand
that year. I gave nine talks in places as far apart as Pisa in Italy and Arequipa in
Peru. First in Ghent and then in Boston. my topic was Universality is Ubiquitous
[9]. Turing’s abstract model of computation had been able to achieve universality
with just a few very rudimentary basic operations by providing his devices with
unlimited memory. This suggested that the extent to which a physical device
can approximate universality will depend critically on providing it with as large
a memory as possible. Turing quite explicitly emphasized this in his address
of 1947 [1], and it is evident in the expanding suite of things our devices can
do as larger and larger memories are provided. Because so little is required of
basic operations to achieve universality, it is pointless to retroactively confer
universality on Babbage’s analytic engine or the Colossus built in the Bletchley
Park decryption eﬀort, after imagining them provided with an inﬁnite memory.
Do the non-coding parts of the DNA contain a computational capability?
Perhaps playing a role in evolution? I shamelessly speculated along those lines.
My 90th birthday occurred in 2018. The special session on history and philos-
phy of computation at the meeting in Kiel of the Computability in Europe orga-
nization honored my birthday. I spoke on “Turing’s Vision and Deep Learning”.
I recalled that Turing had imagined a time when a computer would have mod-
iﬁed its original program to such an extent that the programmers would no
longer understand what it was doing. Nevertheless, Turing suggested, it might
be doing good work. The programmers of the neural nets that have achieved such
remarkable success with the ancient game of Go ﬁnd themselves in exactly this
position. Likewise the programmers of self-driving cars. Thus, bringing together
Turing’s imaginings seventy years ago with some of the most advanced current
technological achievements seems an excellent way to end this story.

6 我们的证明有一个缺陷。它利用了这样一个事实：存在完全由素数组成的任意长的算术级数。这一事实直到 2004 年才得到证明（由 Ben Green 和 Terrence Tao 证明）；所以我们不得不称之为假设。我们将我们的工作成果提交给了我们的资助机构——美国空军科学研究办公室。我们还将其提交给数学研究期刊发表。此外，我们还将副本发送给了 Julia Robinson，她的方法极大地影响了我们的方法。令我们高兴的是，她成功地修改了证明，因此不需要这个尚未证明的命题。我们撤回了论文，定理以我们三人为作者发表。从新结果可以看出，如果能找到一个满足 Julia 提出的两个简单条件的多项式，我的猜想就会成立。我们三人花了十年时间才找到这样一个多项式，后来我们得知，22 岁的尤里·马蒂亚塞维奇真的找到了。他证明了他的方程满足朱莉娅条件，虽然证明过程很简单，但却非常复杂和优美。
</p><p>
6 Our proof had a ﬂaw. It used the fact that there are arbitrarily long arithmetic
progressions consisting entirely of prime numbers. This fact was only proved in 2004
(by Ben Green and Terrence Tao); so we had to call it a hypothesis. We wrote
our work up for our funding agency, the Oﬃce of Scientiﬁc Research of the US Air
Force. We also submitted it for publication to a mathematical research journal. In
addition we sent a copy to Julia Robinson whose methods had greatly inﬂuenced
our approach. To our delight she succeeded in modifying the proof so it did not
need this as yet unproved proposition. We withdrew our paper, and the theorem
was published with the three of us as authors. It followed from the new result that
my conjecture would follow if a single polynomial could be found that satisﬁed two
simple conditions that Julia had proposed. After the three of us had been trying for
a decade to ﬁnd such a polynomial, we learned that Yuri Matiyasevich, at the age
of 22, had actually done it. His proof that his equation satisﬁed Julia’s conditions,
though quite elementary, was intricate and beautiful.
