<p class="epigraph">“看哪！人类生活在一种地下洞穴中，洞穴的开口朝向光明，一直延伸到洞穴的各处；他们从小就住在这里，腿和脖子都被锁链锁住，动弹不得，只能看到前方；因为锁链的排列方式使他们无法转动头部。在他们身后上方远处，火光熊熊，火与囚犯之间有一条高架通道；如果你仔细看，你会看到，沿路有一堵矮墙，就像木偶演员面前的屏风，他们在上面表演木偶。</p><p class="epigraph">"Behold! human beings living in a sort of underground den, which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all across the den; they have been here from their childhood, and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move, and can only see before them; for the chains are arranged in such a manner as to prevent them from turning round their heads. At a distance above and behind them the light of a fire is blazing, and between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way; and you will see, if you look, a low wall built along the way, like the screen which marionette players have before them, over which they show the puppets.</p>
<p class="epigraph">“我明白了，”他说。</p><p class="epigraph">I see, he said.</p>
<p class="epigraph">我说，你看见了吗，人们沿着墙走来走去，手里拿着从墙那边冒出来的器皿；还有人和动物的雕像，是用木头、石头和各种材料制成的；正如你所预料的那样，有些囚犯在说话，而有些则保持沉默？</p><p class="epigraph">And do you see, I said, men passing along the wall carrying vessels, which appear over the wall; also figures of men and animals, made of wood and stone and various materials; and some of the prisoners, as you would expect, are talking, and some of them are silent?</p>
<p class="epigraph">他说：“这是一个奇怪的形象，他们也是奇怪的囚犯。”</p><p class="epigraph">This is a strange image, he said, and they are strange prisoners.</p>
<p class="epigraph">就像我们一样，我回答道；他们只能看到自己的影子，或者彼此的影子，而这些影子被火光投射在洞穴对面的墙壁上？</p><p class="epigraph">Like ourselves, I replied; and they see only their own shadows, or the shadows of one another, which the fire throws on the opposite wall of the cave?</p>
<p class="epigraph">没错，他说：如果不允许他们移动头部，他们怎么能看到除了阴影以外的任何东西呢？</p><p class="epigraph">True, he said: how could they see anything but the shadows if they were never allowed to move their heads?</p>
<p class="epigraph">而对于以同样方式运送的物体，他们只能看到阴影吗？</p><p class="epigraph">And of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would see only the shadows?</p>
<p class="epigraph">“是的，”他说道。</p><p class="epigraph">Yes, he said.</p>
<p class="epigraph">如果他们能够互相交谈，他们难道不会认为自己说出了他们面前真正存在的事物吗？”——《柏拉图理想国》第七卷（乔伊特译本）。</p><p class="epigraph">And if they were able to talk with one another, would they not suppose that they were naming what was actually before them?" —The Republic of Plato, Book Seven. (Jowett Translation.)</p>

<p class="normal3">1914 年，有一座海岛，岛上居住着一些英国人、法国人和德国人。岛上没有电报，英国邮轮每六十天才来一次。九月份，邮轮还没有来，岛民们还在谈论最新一期的报纸，上面报道了卡约夫人因枪杀加斯通·卡尔梅特而即将接受审判的消息。因此，九月中旬的一天，整个殖民地都聚集在码头上，听船长宣读判决结果，他们比平时更加​​热切。他们得知，六个多星期以来，英国人和法国人一直在为维护条约的神圣性而与德国人作战。六个星期以来，他们一直表现得像朋友一样，但实际上他们是敌人。</p><p class="normal3">There is an island in the ocean where in 1914 a few Englishmen, Frenchmen, and Germans lived. No cable reaches that island, and the British mail steamer comes but once in sixty days. In September it had not yet come, and the islanders were still talking about the latest newspaper which told about the approaching trial of Madame Caillaux for the shooting of Gaston Calmette. It was, therefore, with more than usual eagerness that the whole colony assembled at the quay on a day in mid-September to hear from the captain what the verdict had been. They learned that for over six weeks now those of them who were English and those of them who were French had been fighting in behalf of the sanctity of treaties against those of them who were Germans. For six strange weeks they had acted as if they were friends, when in fact they were enemies.</p>
<p class="normal3">但他们的困境与欧洲大多数人的困境并无太大不同。他们被误认为是六个星期，而在大陆上，间隔可能只有六天或六个小时。间隔是存在的。有那么一刻，人们照常生活的欧洲景象与即将使他们的生活陷入混乱的欧洲完全不符。每个人都有一段时期，他们仍在适应一个不再存在的环境。直到 7 月 25 日，世界各地的人们还在制造他们无法运输的商品，购买他们无法进口的商品，规划职业，考虑企业，怀抱希望和期望，所有人都相信已知的世界就是它本来的样子。人们正在写书来描述那个世界。他们相信自己头脑中的画面。四年多后，在一个星期四的早上，传来了停战的消息，人们宣泄了他们无法言喻的宽慰，因为屠杀结束了。然而，在真正停战前的五天里，尽管人们庆祝战争的结束，但数千名年轻人却在战场上丧生。</p><p class="normal3">But their plight was not so different from that of most of the population of Europe. They had been mistaken for six weeks, on the continent the interval may have been only six days or six hours. There was an interval. There was a moment when the picture of Europe on which men were conducting their business as usual, did not in any way correspond to the Europe which was about to make a jumble of their lives. There was a time for each man when he was still adjusted to an environment that no longer existed. All over the world as late as July 25th men were making goods that they would not be able to ship, buying goods they would not be able to import, careers were being planned, enterprises contemplated, hopes and expectations entertained, all in the belief that the world as known was the world as it was. Men were writing books describing that world. They trusted the picture in their heads. And then over four years later, on a Thursday morning, came the news of an armistice, and people gave vent to their unutterable relief that the slaughter was over. Yet in the five days before the real armistice came, though the end of the war had been celebrated, several thousand young men died on the battlefields.</p>
<p class="normal3">回顾过去，我们可以看到，我们是多么间接地了解我们所处的环境。我们可以看到，关于环境的消息时而快时而慢；但无论我们认为是真实的画面，我们都会把它当作环境本身来对待。对于我们现在所依据的信念，我们很难记住这一点，但对于其他民族和其他时代，我们自以为很容易看出他们曾经对荒谬的世界图景极其认真。我们坚持认为，由于我们后见之明，他们需要知道的世界和他们所知道的世界往往是两个完全矛盾的东西。我们还可以看到，虽然他们在他们想象的世界中统治和战斗、贸易和改革，但他们在现实世界中取得了成果，或者没有取得任何成果。他们前往印度群岛，发现了美洲。他们诊断邪恶，绞死老妇人。他们认为他们可以通过一直卖东西而不买东西来致富。一位哈里发遵从他认为是真主的旨意，烧毁了亚历山大图书馆。</p><p class="normal3">Looking back we can see how indirectly we know the environment in which nevertheless we live. We can see that the news of it comes to us now fast, now slowly; but that whatever we believe to be a true picture, we treat as if it were the environment itself. It is harder to remember that about the beliefs upon which we are now acting, but in respect to other peoples and other ages we flatter ourselves that it is easy to see when they were in deadly earnest about ludicrous pictures of the world. We insist, because of our superior hindsight, that the world as they needed to know it, and the world as they did know it, were often two quite contradictory things. We can see, too, that while they governed and fought, traded and reformed in the world as they imagined it to be, they produced results, or failed to produce any, in the world as it was. They started for the Indies and found America. They diagnosed evil and hanged old women. They thought they could grow rich by always selling and never buying. A caliph, obeying what he conceived to be the Will of Allah, burned the library at Alexandria.</p>
<p class="normal3">圣安布罗斯在公元 389 年左右写道，柏拉图洞穴中那位坚决拒绝回头的囚犯的案例。“讨论地球的性质和位置并不能帮助我们对来世充满希望。只要知道圣经所说的就足够了。‘他将地球悬在虚无之上’（约伯记 26. 7）。那么，为什么要争论他是将地球悬在空中还是悬在水面上，并引发关于稀薄的空气如何支撑地球的争论；或者，为什么如果在水面上，地球就不会坠落到海底？……不是因为地球在中间，仿佛悬浮在平衡中，而是因为上帝的威严通过他的意志法则约束着它，它才能在不稳定和虚无之上保持稳定。”</p><p class="normal3">Writing about the year 389, St. Ambrose stated the case for the prisoner in Plato's cave who resolutely declines to turn his head. "To discuss the nature and position of the earth does not help us in our hope of the life to come. It is enough to know what Scripture states. 'That He hung up the earth upon nothing' (Job xxvi. 7). Why then argue whether He hung it up in air or upon the water, and raise a controversy as to how the thin air could sustain the earth; or why, if upon the waters, the earth does not go crashing down to the bottom?… Not because the earth is in the middle, as if suspended on even balance, but because the majesty of God constrains it by the law of His will, does it endure stable upon the unstable and the void."</p>
<p class="normal3">它对我们对来生的希望没有帮助。只要知道圣经所说的就足够了。那为什么要争论呢？但在圣安布罗斯之后的一个半世纪，人们仍然对对跖点的问题感到困惑。因此，一位以科学成就闻名的僧侣科斯马斯被委派撰写《基督教地形志》，或“基督教对世界的看法”。很明显，他确切地知道人们对他的期望，因为他所有的结论都是基于他所读的圣经。因此，看起来，世界是一个扁平的平行四边形，东西宽度是从东到西的两倍是从北到南的长度。，中心是被海洋包围的地球，而海洋又被另一个地球包围，人类在大洪水之前就生活在那里。另一个地球是诺亚的登船港。北方是一座高高的圆锥形山，太阳和月亮围绕着它旋转。当太阳在山后面时，就是夜晚。天空被粘在外层地球的边缘上。它由四面高墙组成，四面墙相接形成一个凹形屋顶，因此地球就是宇宙的底部。天空的另一边是一片海洋，构成了“苍穹之上的水”。天上的海洋和宇宙的最终屋顶之间的空间属于有福之人。天地之间的空间居住着天使。最后，既然圣保罗说所有人都是生活在“地球表面”，他们怎么能生活在对跖点应该在的背面呢？面对这样的一段话，我们被告知，一个基督徒不应该“甚至谈论对跖点”。</p><p class="normal3">It does not help us in our hope of the life to come. It is enough to know what Scripture states. Why then argue? But a century and a half after St. Ambrose, opinion was still troubled, on this occasion by the problem of the antipodes. A monk named Cosmas, famous for his scientific attainments, was therefore deputed to write a Christian Topography, or "Christian Opinion concerning the World." It is clear that he knew exactly what was expected of him, for he based all his conclusions on the Scriptures as he read them. It appears, then, that the world is a flat parallelogram, twice as broad from east to west as it is long from north to south., In the center is the earth surrounded by ocean, which is in turn surrounded by another earth, where men lived before the deluge. This other earth was Noah's port of embarkation. In the north is a high conical mountain around which revolve the sun and moon. When the sun is behind the mountain it is night. The sky is glued to the edges of the outer earth. It consists of four high walls which meet in a concave roof, so that the earth is the floor of the universe. There is an ocean on the other side of the sky, constituting the "waters that are above the firmament." The space between the celestial ocean and the ultimate roof of the universe belongs to the blest. The space between the earth and sky is inhabited by the angels. Finally, since St. Paul said that all men are made to live upon the "face of the earth" how could they live on the back where the Antipodes are supposed to be? With such a passage before his eyes, a Christian, we are told, should not 'even speak of the Antipodes.'"</p>
<p class="normal3">他更不应该去对跖点；任何基督教王子也不应该给他一艘船去试航；任何虔诚的水手也不想试航。对于科斯马斯来说，他的地图一点也不荒谬。只有记住他绝对相信这是宇宙的地图，我们才能开始理解他为什么会害怕麦哲伦、皮里或那个冒着与天使和天穹相撞的风险在七英里高空飞行的飞行员。同样，我们最好地理解战争和政治的狂暴，记住几乎每个党派都绝对相信自己对反对派的描述，它把事实当作事实，而不是事实，而是它所认为的事实。因此，就像哈姆雷特一样，它会在沙沙作响的窗帘后面刺伤波洛尼厄斯，以为他是国王，也许会像哈姆雷特一样补充道：</p><p class="normal3">Far less should he go to the Antipodes; nor should any Christian prince give him a ship to try; nor would any pious mariner wish to try. For Cosmas there was nothing in the least absurd about his map. Only by remembering his absolute conviction that this was the map of the universe can we begin to understand how he would have dreaded Magellan or Peary or the aviator who risked a collision with the angels and the vault of heaven by flying seven miles up in the air. In the same way we can best understand the furies of war and politics by remembering that almost the whole of each party believes absolutely in its picture of the opposition, that it takes as fact, not what is, but what it supposes to be the fact. And that therefore, like Hamlet, it will stab Polonius behind the rustling curtain, thinking him the king, and perhaps like Hamlet add:</p>

<p class="normal3">伟人，即使在生前，通常也只是通过虚构的人物形象才为公众所知。因此，俗话说，没有人是自己贴身男仆眼中的英雄，这话有一定道理。这话只有一点道理，因为贴身男仆和私人秘书自己也常常沉浸在虚构的人物形象中。当然，皇室人物是人为塑造的人物形象。无论他们自己相信自己的公众形象，还是仅仅让内侍来操纵，他们至少有两个不同的自我，公众自我和王室自我，私人自我和人性自我。伟人的传记或多或少都很容易落入这两个自我的历史中。官方传记作者重现公众生活，揭露真相的回忆录重现另一个。例如，《查恩伍德的林肯》是一幅高贵的肖像，不是真实存在的人，而是一个充满意义的史诗人物，他与埃涅阿斯或圣乔治在现实层面上大体相同。奥利弗的《汉密尔顿》是一幅宏伟的抽象画，是思想的雕塑，奥利弗先生本人称之为“一篇关于美国联邦的论文”。它是联邦制治国方略的正式纪念碑，很难算是一个人的传记。有时人们在自以为揭示内心世界时，会创造自己的外表。雷平顿的日记和玛戈特·阿斯奎斯的日记是一种自画像，其中最能揭示亲密细节的，是作者如何看待自己的指标。</p><p class="normal3">Great men, even during their lifetime, are usually known to the public only through a fictitious personality. Hence the modicum of truth in the old saying that no man is a hero to his valet. There is only a modicum of truth, for the valet, and the private secretary, are often immersed in the fiction themselves. Royal personages are, of course, constructed personalities. Whether they themselves believe in their public character, or whether they merely permit the chamberlain to stage-manage it, there are at least two distinct selves, the public and regal self, the private and human. The biographies of great people fall more or less readily into the histories of these two selves. The official biographer reproduces the public life, the revealing memoir the other. The Charnwood Lincoln, for example, is a noble portrait, not of an actual human being, but of an epic figure, replete with significance, who moves on much the same level of reality as Aeneas or St. George. Oliver's Hamilton is a majestic abstraction, the sculpture of an idea, "an essay" as Mr. Oliver himself calls it, "on American union." It is a formal monument to the state-craft of federalism, hardly the biography of a person. Sometimes people create their own facade when they think they are revealing the interior scene. The Repington diaries and Margot Asquith's are a species of self-portraiture in which the intimate detail is most revealing as an index of how the authors like to think about themselves.</p>
<p class="normal3">但最有趣的描绘是人们心中自发浮现的。斯特雷奇先生说，维多利亚登基时，“外界掀起了一股巨大的热情浪潮。情感和浪漫开始流行；看到这位天真、谦逊、金发碧眼、脸颊粉红的小女王驾着马车穿过首都，旁观者心中充满了深情的忠诚。最让所有人印象深刻的是维多利亚女王和她的叔叔们之间的对比。那些卑鄙的老人，放荡、自私、固执、荒谬，他们永远背负着债务、混乱和声名狼藉的负担——他们像冬天的雪一样消失了，终于，春天来了，他们头戴王冠，容光焕发。”</p><p class="normal3">But the most interesting kind of portraiture is that which arises spontaneously in people's minds. When Victoria came to the throne, says Mr. Strachey, "among the outside public there was a great wave of enthusiasm. Sentiment and romance were coming into fashion; and the spectacle of the little girl-queen, innocent, modest, with fair hair and pink cheeks, driving through her capital, filled the hearts of the beholders with raptures of affectionate loyalty. What, above all, struck everybody with overwhelming force was the contrast between Queen Victoria and her uncles. The nasty old men, debauched and selfish, pigheaded and ridiculous, with their perpetual burden of debts, confusions, and disreputabilities—they had vanished like the snows of winter and here at last, crowned and radiant, was the spring."</p>
<p class="normal3">让·德·皮埃尔弗先生亲眼目睹了人们对英雄的崇拜，因为他是霞飞将军麾下一名参谋军官，而当时霞飞将军声名鹊起：</p><p class="normal3">M. Jean de Pierrefeu saw hero-worship at first hand, for he was an officer on Joffre's staff at the moment of that soldier's greatest fame:</p>
<p class="normal3">“两年来，全世界都对缅因战役的胜利者表示了近乎神圣的敬意。行李搬运工几乎被箱子、包裹和信件的重量压弯了腰，这些箱子、包裹和信件都是陌生人寄给他的，他们疯狂地向他表达了他们的钦佩。我认为，除了霞飞将军，没有一位战争指挥官能够理解荣耀的真正含义。他们给他送来了来自世界所有著名糖果商的糖果盒、香槟盒、各种年份的上等葡萄酒、水果、野味、装饰品和用具、衣服、吸烟材料、墨水瓶、镇纸。每个地区都送来了各自的特产。画家送来了画作，雕塑家送来了雕像，亲爱的老太太送来了棉被或袜子，牧羊人在小屋里为他雕刻了烟斗。世界上所有敌视德国的制造商都运来了他们的产品，哈瓦那送来了雪茄，葡萄牙送来了波特酒。我认识一位理发师，他除了做这件事之外，没有更好的事情可做。用他所爱之人的头发为将军画一幅肖像；一个职业书法家也有同样的想法，但肖像是由成千上万个赞美将军的小字组成的。至于书信，他收集了各种文字、各种国家、各种方言的信，这些信充满深情、感激、爱意和崇拜。他们称他为世界的救世主、祖国之父、上帝的使者、人类的恩人等等……不仅法国人，还有美国人、阿根廷人、澳大利亚人等等……成千上万的孩子在父母不知情的情况下拿起笔写信告诉他他们的爱：他们中的大多数人称他为我们的父亲。他们的倾诉、他们的崇拜、这些从成千上万颗心中发出的解脱的叹息，都令人感动不已，因为野蛮的失败。对于所有这些天真的小灵魂来说，霞飞​​就像圣乔治击垮了恶龙。当然，他为人类良知体现了善良战胜邪恶、光明战胜黑暗的胜利。</p><p class="normal3">"For two years, the entire world paid an almost divine homage to the victor of the Maine. The baggage-master literally bent under the weight of the boxes, of the packages and letters which unknown people sent him with a frantic testimonial of their admiration. I think that outside of General Joffre, no commander in the war has been able to realize a comparable idea of what glory is. They sent him boxes of candy from all the great confectioners of the world, boxes of champagne, fine wines of every vintage, fruits, game, ornaments and utensils, clothes, smoking materials, inkstands, paperweights. Every territory sent its specialty. The painter sent his picture, the sculptor his statuette, the dear old lady a comforter or socks, the shepherd in his hut carved a pipe for his sake. All the manufacturers of the world who were hostile to Germany shipped their products, Havana its cigars, Portugal its port wine. I have known a hairdresser who had nothing better to do than to make a portrait of the General out of hair belonging to persons who were dear to him; a professional penman had the same idea, but the features were composed of thousands of little phrases in tiny characters which sang the praise of the General. As to letters, he had them in all scripts, from all countries, written in every dialect, affectionate letters, grateful, overflowing with love, filled with adoration. They called him Savior of the World, Father of his Country, Agent of God, Benefactor of Humanity, etc…. And not only Frenchmen, but Americans, Argentinians, Australians, etc. etc…. Thousands of little children, without their parents' knowledge, took pen in hand and wrote to tell him their love: most of them called him Our Father. And there was poignancy about their effusions, their adoration, these sighs of deliverance that escaped from thousands of hearts at the defeat of barbarism. To all these naif little souls, Joffre seemed like St. George crushing the dragon. Certainly he incarnated for the conscience of mankind the victory of good over evil, of light over darkness.</p>
<p class="normal3">疯子、傻瓜、半疯子和疯子都把他们黑暗的大脑转向他，就像转向理性本身一样。我读过一封信，信的作者是一位住在悉尼的人，他恳求将军救他脱离敌人；另一位新西兰人请求将军派一些士兵去一位欠他十英镑却不肯还钱的绅士家。</p><p class="normal3">Lunatics, simpletons, the half-crazy and the crazy turned their darkened brains toward him as toward reason itself. I have read the letter of a person living in Sydney, who begged the General to save him from his enemies; another, a New Zealander, requested him to send some soldiers to the house of a gentleman who owed him ten pounds and would not pay.</p>
<p class="normal3">最后，数百名年轻女孩克服了性别的羞怯，要求订婚，并要求家人不知道这件事；其他人只希望为他服务。”</p><p class="normal3">Finally, some hundreds of young girls, overcoming the timidity of their sex, asked for engagements, their families not to know about it; others wished only to serve him."</p>
<p class="normal3">理想中的霞飞，是他本人、他的参谋和部队所取得的胜利、战争的绝望、个人的悲伤和未来胜利的希望的综合产物。但是，除了英雄崇拜之外，还有驱魔。通过英雄化身的机制，魔鬼也诞生了。如果一切善行都来自霞飞、福煦、威尔逊或罗斯福，那么一切恶行都源自德皇威廉、列宁和托洛茨基。他们无所不能地行恶，正如英雄无所不能地行善一样。在许多头脑简单、心怀恐惧的人看来，世界上任何政治挫折、罢工、阻挠、神秘死亡或神秘火灾，其原因都与这些个人的恶行根源有关。</p><p class="normal3">This ideal Joffre was compounded out of the victory won by him, his staff and his troops, the despair of the war, the personal sorrows, and the hope of future victory. But beside hero-worship there is the exorcism of devils. By the same mechanism through which heroes are incarnated, devils are made. If everything good was to come from Joffre, Foch, Wilson, or Roosevelt, everything evil originated in the Kaiser Wilhelm, Lenin and Trotsky. They were as omnipotent for evil as the heroes were omnipotent for good. To many simple and frightened minds there was no political reverse, no strike, no obstruction, no mysterious death or mysterious conflagration anywhere in the world of which the causes did not wind back to these personal sources of evil.</p>

<p class="normal3">全世界范围内如此集中于一个象征性人物的现象非常罕见，足以引人注目，每位作者都对这种引人注目、无可辩驳的例子情有独钟。战争的活体解剖揭示了这样的例子，但这并不是凭空而来的。在更正常的公共生活中，象征性图像对行为的支配作用丝毫不减，但每个象征的包容性却远不如前者，因为有太多相互竞争的象征。不仅每个象征都缺乏感情，因为它最多只代表一部分人口，而且即使在这一部分人口中，对个人差异的压制也少得多。在安全程度适中的时候，公众舆论的象征会受到制约、比较和争论。它们来来去去，融合在一起，然后被遗忘，永远无法完美地组织整个群体的情感。毕竟，只剩下一种人类活动，即整个群体实现神圣的统一。它发生在战争的中间阶段，恐惧、好斗和仇恨已经完全控制了精神，要么压制其他所有本能，要么将其征用，而且在感到疲倦之前。</p><p class="normal3">Worldwide concentration of this kind on a symbolic personality is rare enough to be clearly remarkable, and every author has a weakness for the striking and irrefutable example. The vivisection of war reveals such examples, but it does not make them out of nothing. In a more normal public life, symbolic pictures are no less governant of behavior, but each symbol is far less inclusive because there are so many competing ones. Not only is each symbol charged with less feeling because at most it represents only a part of the population, but even within that part there is infinitely less suppression of individual difference. The symbols of public opinion, in times of moderate security, are subject to check and comparison and argument. They come and go, coalesce and are forgotten, never organizing perfectly the emotion of the whole group. There is, after all, just one human activity left in which whole populations accomplish the union sacrée. It occurs in those middle phases of a war when fear, pugnacity, and hatred have secured complete dominion of the spirit, either to crush every other instinct or to enlist it, and before weariness is felt.</p>
<p class="normal3">在几乎所有其他时候，甚至在战争陷入僵局时，人们都会被激起更广泛的情感，从而产生冲突、选择、犹豫和妥协。我们将会看到，公众舆论的象征意义通常带有这种利益平衡的标志。例如，想想停战后，不稳定且绝非成功建立的盟国团结象征是如何迅速消失的，紧接着，每个国家对另一个国家的象征形象也几乎立即瓦解：英国是公法的捍卫者，法国是自由的边疆，美国是十字军。然后想想每个国家内部，随着党派和阶级冲突以及个人野心开始激起被推迟的问题，其自身的象征形象是如何逐渐瓦解的。然后想想领导人的象征形象是如何逐渐消失的，因为威尔逊、克列孟梭、劳合乔治一个接一个地不再是人类希望的化身，而仅仅成为一个幻灭世界的谈判者和管理者。</p><p class="normal3">At almost all other times, and even in war when it is deadlocked, a sufficiently greater range of feelings is aroused to establish conflict, choice, hesitation, and compromise. The symbolism of public opinion usually bears, as we shall see, the marks of this balancing of interest. Think, for example, of how rapidly, after the armistice, the precarious and by no means successfully established symbol of Allied Unity disappeared, how it was followed almost immediately by the breakdown of each nation's symbolic picture of the other: Britain the Defender of Public Law, France watching at the Frontier of Freedom, America the Crusader. And think then of how within each nation the symbolic picture of itself frayed out, as party and class conflict and personal ambition began to stir postponed issues. And then of how the symbolic pictures of the leaders gave way, as one by one, Wilson, Clemenceau, Lloyd George, ceased to be the incarnation of human hope, and became merely the negotiators and administrators for a disillusioned world.</p>
<p class="normal3">显然，我们对此感到遗憾，认为这是和平的软性弊端之一，还是对此表示赞赏，认为这是恢复理智，这都无关紧要。我们对虚构和象征的首要关注是忘记它们对现有社会秩序的价值，而只是把它们看作人类交流机制的重要组成部分。现在，在任何一个利益不完全自足、规模如此之小以至于每个人都能知道所发生的一切事情的社会中，思想处理的是看不见的、难以理解的事件。戈弗草原的谢尔温小姐知道法国正在发生一场战争，并试图想象它。她从未去过法国，当然也从未去过现在的战线。</p><p class="normal3">Whether we regret this as one of the soft evils of peace or applaud it as a return to sanity is obviously no matter here. Our first concern with fictions and symbols is to forget their value to the existing social order, and to think of them simply as an important part of the machinery of human communication. Now in any society that is not completely self-contained in its interests and so small that everyone can know all about everything that happens, ideas deal with events that are out of sight and hard to grasp. Miss Sherwin of Gopher Prairie, is aware that a war is raging in France and tries to conceive it. She has never been to France, and certainly she has never been along what is now the battlefront.</p>
<p class="normal3">她见过法国和德国士兵的照片，但她无法想象三百万大军的规模。事实上，没有人能想象到，专业人士也不想尝试。他们认为，他们应该是两百个师。但谢尔温小姐无法看到战争地图的顺序，所以如果她要思考战争，她会把霞飞和德皇视为一对一决斗的对象。也许，如果你能用她心灵之眼看到她所看到的东西，那么从构图中看，这幅图像可能与十八世纪一位伟大士兵的版画没有什么不同。他勇敢地站在那里，镇定自若，比真人还大，后面是一支由小人物组成的阴暗军队，蜿蜒进入风景中。伟人似乎也对这些期望毫不在意。皮埃尔弗先生讲述了一位摄影师拜访霞飞的经历。将军在他的“中产阶级办公室里，坐在没有文件的工作台前签名。突然，他注意到墙上没有地图。但根据普遍的观念，不可能想象一个没有地图的将军，所以他把几张地图放在了画像的位置，然后很快就把地图拿走了。”</p><p class="normal3">Pictures of French and German soldiers she has seen, but it is impossible for her to imagine three million men. No one, in fact, can imagine them, and the professionals do not try. They think of them as, say, two hundred divisions. But Miss Sherwin has no access to the order of battle maps, and so if she is to think about the war, she fastens upon Joffre and the Kaiser as if they were engaged in a personal duel. Perhaps if you could see what she sees with her mind's eye, the image in its composition might be not unlike an Eighteenth Century engraving of a great soldier. He stands there boldly unruffled and more than life size, with a shadowy army of tiny little figures winding off into the landscape behind. Nor it seems are great men oblivious to these expectations. M. de Pierrefeu tells of a photographer's visit to Joffre. The General was in his "middle class office, before the worktable without papers, where he sat down to write his signature. Suddenly it was noticed that there were no maps on the walls. But since according to popular ideas it is not possible to think of a general without maps, a few were placed in position for the picture, and removed soon afterwards."</p>
<p class="normal3">一个人对于自己未曾经历过的事件，唯一能有的感觉，就是被他对该事件的心理形象所激起的感觉。这就是为什么，除非我们知道别人自以为知道什么，否则我们无法真正理解他们的行为。我曾见过一个在宾夕法尼亚州一个矿业小镇长大的小女孩，当一阵风吹碎了厨房的窗玻璃时，她突然从完全的快乐状态陷入了悲伤之中。几个小时里，她一直悲痛欲绝，我也无法理解她。但当她能说话时，我才知道，如果窗玻璃碎了，就意味着一位近亲去世了。因此，她是在悼念她的父亲，是他吓得她离家出走。当然，电报查询很快就证实了，她的父亲还活着。但在电报来之前，玻璃碎裂对那个女孩来说是一个真实的信息。为什么它是真实的，只有经过一位熟练的精神病医生的长期调查才能揭晓。但即便是最漫不经心的观察者也能看出，这个女孩因家庭问题而极度不安，她根据一个外部事实、一个记忆中的迷信以及对父亲的悔恨、恐惧和爱，产生了一个完全虚构的幻觉。</p><p class="normal3">The only feeling that anyone can have about an event he does not experience is the feeling aroused by his mental image of that event. That is why until we know what others think they know, we cannot truly understand their acts. I have seen a young girl, brought up in a Pennsylvania mining town, plunged suddenly from entire cheerfulness into a paroxysm of grief when a gust of wind cracked the kitchen window-pane. For hours she was inconsolable, and to me incomprehensible. But when she was able to talk, it transpired that if a window-pane broke it meant that a close relative had died. She was, therefore, mourning for her father, who had frightened her into running away from home. The father was, of course, quite thoroughly alive as a telegraphic inquiry soon proved. But until the telegram came, the cracked glass was an authentic message to that girl. Why it was authentic only a prolonged investigation by a skilled psychiatrist could show. But even the most casual observer could see that the girl, enormously upset by her family troubles, had hallucinated a complete fiction out of one external fact, a remembered superstition, and a turmoil of remorse, and fear and love for her father.</p>
<p class="normal3">在这些情况下，反常只是程度问题。当一位被家门口爆炸的炸弹吓坏了的司法部长通过阅读革命文学说服自己革命将在 1920 年 5 月 1 日发生时，我们认识到，同样的机制正在发挥作用。当然，战争提供了许多这种模式的例子：偶然的事实、创造性的想象力、相信的意愿，以及在这三个要素中，对现实的伪造，对此有强烈的本能反应。因为很明显，在某些情况下，人们对虚构的反应与对现实的反应一样强烈，而且在许多情况下，他们帮助创造了他们所反应的虚构。让那些不相信 1914 年 8 月穿越英国的俄罗斯军队的人投下第一块石头，不接受任何没有直接证据的暴行故事，从未在没有证据的地方看到阴谋、叛徒或间谍的人。让他扔一块石头，他从不把他听到的、知道的并不比他多的人说的话当作真正的内幕真相来传递。</p><p class="normal3">Abnormality in these instances is only a matter of degree. When an Attorney-General, who has been frightened by a bomb exploded on his doorstep, convinces himself by the reading of revolutionary literature that a revolution is to happen on the first of May 1920, we recognize that much the same mechanism is at work. The war, of course, furnished many examples of this pattern: the casual fact, the creative imagination, the will to believe, and out of these three elements, a counterfeit of reality to which there was a violent instinctive response. For it is clear enough that under certain conditions men respond as powerfully to fictions as they do to realities, and that in many cases they help to create the very fictions to which they respond. Let him cast the first stone who did not believe in the Russian army that passed through England in August, 1914, did not accept any tale of atrocities without direct proof, and never saw a plot, a traitor, or a spy where there was none. Let him cast a stone who never passed on as the real inside truth what he had heard someone say who knew no more than he did.</p>
<p class="normal3">在所有这些例子中，我们必须特别注意一个共同因素。那就是在人与环境之间插入了一个伪环境。人的行为是对那个伪环境的反应。但因为这<i class="calibre10">是</i>
 行为，所以后果（如果是行为的话）不是在刺激行为的伪环境中起作用，而是在行动发生的真实环境中起作用。如果行为不是实际行为，而是我们大致称之为思想和情感的行为，那么虚构世界的结构可能要过很长时间才会出现任何明显的断裂。但是，当伪事实的刺激导致对事物或其他人采取行动时，矛盾很快就会产生。然后就会产生撞到石墙上的感觉，从经验中学习的感觉，并目睹赫伯特·斯宾塞的悲剧——一个美丽的理论被一群残酷的事实所谋杀，这种不适简而言之就是适应不良。因为在社会生活的层面上，所谓的人对环境的适应是通过虚构的媒介进行的。</p><p class="normal3">In all these instances we must note particularly one common factor. It is the insertion between man and his environment of a pseudo-environment. To that pseudo-environment his behavior is a response. But because it <i class="calibre10">is</i>
 behavior, the consequences, if they are acts, operate not in the pseudo-environment where the behavior is stimulated, but in the real environment where action eventuates. If the behavior is not a practical act, but what we call roughly thought and emotion, it may be a long time before there is any noticeable break in the texture of the fictitious world. But when the stimulus of the pseudo-fact results in action on things or other people, contradiction soon develops. Then comes the sensation of butting one's head against a stone wall, of learning by experience, and witnessing Herbert Spencer's tragedy of the murder of a Beautiful Theory by a Gang of Brutal Facts, the discomfort in short of a maladjustment. For certainly, at the level of social life, what is called the adjustment of man to his environment takes place through the medium of fictions.</p>
<p class="normal3">我所说的虚构并不是指谎言。我指的是人类自己或多或少对环境的描述。虚构的范围从完全的幻觉到科学家完全有意识地使用示意图，或者他决定对于他的特定问题，超出一定小数位的准确性并不重要。一部虚构作品几乎可以具有任何程度的保真度，只要可以考虑到保真度，虚构就不会误导人。事实上，人类文化在很大程度上是对威廉·詹姆斯所说的“我们思想的随机辐射和重新安置”的选择、重新排列、模式的追踪和风格化。使用虚构的替代方案是直接接触感觉的起伏。这不是一个真正的替代方案，因为无论有时用完全无辜的眼光看问题是多么令人耳目一新，无辜本身并不是智慧，尽管它是智慧的源泉和矫正者。因为现实环境总体来说太大、太复杂、太短暂，无法直接了解。我们没有能力处理如此微妙、如此多样、如此多的排列组合。虽然我们必须在那种环境中行动，但我们必须先在更简单的模型上重建它，然后才能处理它。要周游世界，人们必须有世界地图。他们一直面临的困难是确保地图上没有标明他们自己的需要或别人的需要，而是标明波希米亚海岸。</p><p class="normal3">By fictions I do not mean lies. I mean a representation of the environment which is in lesser or greater degree made by man himself. The range of fiction extends all the way from complete hallucination to the scientists' perfectly self-conscious use of a schematic model, or his decision that for his particular problem accuracy beyond a certain number of decimal places is not important. A work of fiction may have almost any degree of fidelity, and so long as the degree of fidelity can be taken into account, fiction is not misleading. In fact, human culture is very largely the selection, the rearrangement, the tracing of patterns upon, and the stylizing of, what William James called "the random irradiations and resettlements of our ideas." The alternative to the use of fictions is direct exposure to the ebb and flow of sensation. That is not a real alternative, for however refreshing it is to see at times with a perfectly innocent eye, innocence itself is not wisdom, though a source and corrective of wisdom. For the real environment is altogether too big, too complex, and too fleeting for direct acquaintance. We are not equipped to deal with so much subtlety, so much variety, so many permutations and combinations. And although we have to act in that environment, we have to reconstruct it on a simpler model before we can manage with it. To traverse the world men must have maps of the world. Their persistent difficulty is to secure maps on which their own need, or someone else's need, has not sketched in the coast of Bohemia.</p>

<p class="normal3">舆论分析家必须首先认识到行动场景、该场景的人类画面以及人类对该画面在行动场景中产生的反应之间的三角关系。这就像一出由演员们自己的经历所启发的戏剧，其中的情节在演员的真实生活中发生，而不仅仅是在舞台角色中发生。电影经常巧妙地强调这种内在动机和外在行为的双重戏剧。两个男人在争吵，表面上是为了钱，但他们的激情却无法解释。然后画面淡出，两个男人中一个或另一个用心灵之眼看到的东西被重新演绎。桌子对面，他们为钱而争吵。在记忆中，他们回到了年轻的时候，当时女孩为了另一个男人抛弃了他。外部戏剧得到了解释：英雄并不贪婪；英雄陷入了爱情。</p><p class="normal3">The analyst of public opinion must begin then, by recognizing the triangular relationship between the scene of action, the human picture of that scene, and the human response to that picture working itself out upon the scene of action. It is like a play suggested to the actors by their own experience, in which the plot is transacted in the real lives of the actors, and not merely in their stage parts. The moving picture often emphasizes with great skill this double drama of interior motive and external behavior. Two men are quarreling, ostensibly about some money, but their passion is inexplicable. Then the picture fades out and what one or the other of the two men sees with his mind's eye is reënacted. Across the table they were quarreling about money. In memory they are back in their youth when the girl jilted him for the other man. The exterior drama is explained: the hero is not greedy; the hero is in love.</p>
<p class="normal3">美国参议院也上演了类似的一幕。1919 年 9 月 29 日早餐时，一些参议员在《<i class="calibre10">华盛顿邮报》</i>上读到一篇
 关于美国海军陆战队登陆达尔马提亚海岸的新闻报道。该报称：</p><p class="normal3">A scene not so different was played in the United States Senate. At breakfast on the morning of September 29, 1919, some of the Senators read a news dispatch in the <i class="calibre10">Washington Post</i>
 about the landing of American marines on the Dalmatian coast. The newspaper said:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal">事实已确立</p>
<p class="normal3">“以下重要事实似乎已经<i class="calibre10">确定</i>

<p class="normal">丹尼尔斯不知情的情况下</p>
<p class="normal3">“当电报到达时，丹尼尔斯先生被指控拥有独家控制权的部队在不知情的情况下发动了相当于海战的行动，这无疑让他处于一种特殊的境地。英国<i class="calibre10">海军部完全意识到，英国海军部可能希望向海军少将安德鲁斯发出命令，</i>
 让他代表英国及其盟国采取行动，因为如果要控制住邓南遮的追随者，就需要一些国家做出牺牲。</p>
<p class="normal3">“人们进一步意识到，<i class="calibre10">根据新的国际联盟计划，外国人将能够在紧急情况下指挥美国海军力量，</i>
 无论是否得到美国海军部的同意……”等等（斜体字是我的）。</p>
</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal">FACTS NOW ESTABLISHED</p>
<p class="normal3">"The following important facts appear already <i class="calibre10">established</i>

<p class="normal">WITHOUT DANIELS' KNOWLEDGE</p>
<p class="normal3">"Mr. Daniels was admittedly placed in a peculiar position when cables reached here stating that the forces over which he is presumed to have exclusive control were carrying on what amounted to naval warfare without his knowledge.

</blockquote>
<p class="normal3">第一位发表评论的参议员是宾夕法尼亚州的诺克斯先生。他愤怒地要求进行调查。接下来发言的康涅狄格州的布兰德吉先生的愤怒已经激起了人们的轻信。诺克斯先生愤怒地想知道报道是否属实，而布兰德吉先生半分钟后想知道如果海军陆战队被杀会发生什么。诺克斯先生对这个问题很感兴趣，忘记了他要求进行调查，然后回答道。如果美国海军陆战队被杀，那将是一场战争。辩论的气氛仍然是有条件的。辩论继续进行。伊利诺伊州的麦考密克先生提醒参议院，威尔逊政府倾向于发动未经授权的小规模战争。他重复了西奥多·罗斯福关于“发动和平”的俏皮话。更多的辩论。布兰德吉先生指出，海军陆战队的行为是“根据某个最高委员会的命令”，但他不记得谁代表美国在该机构中。美国宪法并不承认最高委员会的存在。因此印第安纳州的纽先生提交了一份决议，呼吁人们提供事实依据。</p><p class="normal3">The first Senator to comment is Mr. Knox of Pennsylvania. Indignantly he demands investigation. In Mr. Brandegee of Connecticut, who spoke next, indignation has already stimulated credulity. Where Mr. Knox indignantly wishes to know if the report is true, Mr. Brandegee, a half a minute later, would like to know what would have happened if marines had been killed. Mr. Knox, interested in the question, forgets that he asked for an inquiry, and replies. If American marines had been killed, it would be war. The mood of the debate is still conditional. Debate proceeds. Mr. McCormick of Illinois reminds the Senate that the Wilson administration is prone to the waging of small unauthorized wars. He repeats Theodore Roosevelt's quip about "waging peace." More debate. Mr. Brandegee notes that the marines acted "under orders of a Supreme Council sitting somewhere," but he cannot recall who represents the United States on that body. The Supreme Council is unknown to the Constitution of the United States. Therefore Mr. New of Indiana submits a resolution calling for the facts.</p>
<p class="normal3">到目前为止，参议员们仍然模糊地意识到他们正在讨论一个谣言。作为律师，他们仍然记得一些证据。但作为热血男子，他们已经体验到了与美国海军陆战队被外国政府命令参战且未经国会同意这一事实相符的所有愤慨。从情感上讲，他们想相信这一点，因为他们是与国际联盟作斗争的共和党人。这激怒了民主党领袖、内布拉斯加州的希区柯克先生。他为最高委员会辩护：最高委员会是在战争权力下行事。和平尚未达成，因为共和党人在拖延。因此，这一行动是必要的和合法的。双方现在都认为报告是真实的，他们得出的结论是他们党派偏见的结论。然而，这一非同寻常的假设正处于一场关于调查假设真实性的决议的辩论中。它揭示了即使是训练有素的律师，也很难在收到回报之前暂停回应。回应是即时的。虚构被当作真相，因为虚构是迫切需要的。</p><p class="normal3">So far the Senators still recognize vaguely that they are discussing a rumor. Being lawyers they still remember some of the forms of evidence. But as red-blooded men they already experience all the indignation which is appropriate to the fact that American marines have been ordered into war by a foreign government and without the consent of Congress. Emotionally they want to believe it, because they are Republicans fighting the League of Nations. This arouses the Democratic leader, Mr. Hitchcock of Nebraska. He defends the Supreme Council: it was acting under the war powers. Peace has not yet been concluded because the Republicans are delaying it. Therefore the action was necessary and legal. Both sides now assume that the report is true, and the conclusions they draw are the conclusions of their partisanship. Yet this extraordinary assumption is in a debate over a resolution to investigate the truth of the assumption. It reveals how difficult it is, even for trained lawyers, to suspend response until the returns are in. The response is instantaneous. The fiction is taken for truth because the fiction is badly needed.</p>
<p class="normal3">几天后，一份官方报告显示，海军陆战队登陆并非奉英国政府或最高委员会之命。他们并没有与意大利人作战。他们是应意大利政府的要求登陆以保护意大利人的，意大利当局还正式向美国指挥官表示感谢。海军陆战队并未与意大利交战。他们的行动符合既定的国际惯例，与国际联盟无关。</p><p class="normal3">A few days later an official report showed that the marines were not landed by order of the British Government or of the Supreme Council. They had not been fighting the Italians. They had been landed at the request of the Italian Government to protect Italians, and the American commander had been officially thanked by the Italian authorities. The marines were not at war with Italy. They had acted according to an established international practice which had nothing to do with the League of Nations.</p>
<p class="normal3">战争的战场是亚得里亚海。华盛顿参议员们脑海中浮现出这一场景，而这个人可能有意欺骗他们，他根本不关心亚得里亚海，而是关心打败联盟。参议院对这一场景的反应是加强对联盟的党派分歧。</p><p class="normal3">The scene of action was the Adriatic. The picture of that scene in the Senators' heads at Washington was furnished, in this case probably with intent to deceive, by a man who cared nothing about the Adriatic, but much about defeating the League. To this picture the Senate responded by a strengthening of its partisan differences over the League.</p>

<p class="normal3">参议院在这一特定情况下是否高于或低于其正常标准，无需判断。参议院与众议院或其他议会相比是否更胜一筹也无需判断。目前，我只想思考一下全世界范围内的奇观，人们受到来自其伪环境的刺激而对其环境采取行动。因为当充分考虑到蓄意欺诈时，政治学仍然需要解释这样的事实：两个国家相互攻击，双方都确信自己是在自卫，或者两个处于战争状态的阶级都确信自己代表了共同利益。我们可能会说，他们生活在不同的世界里。更准确地说，他们生活在同一个世界里，但他们的思想和感受却不同。</p><p class="normal3">Whether in this particular case the Senate was above or below its normal standard, it is not necessary to decide. Nor whether the Senate compares favorably with the House, or with other parliaments. At the moment, I should like to think only about the world-wide spectacle of men acting upon their environment, moved by stimuli from their pseudo-environments. For when full allowance has been made for deliberate fraud, political science has still to account for such facts as two nations attacking one another, each convinced that it is acting in self-defense, or two classes at war each certain that it speaks for the common interest. They live, we are likely to say, in different worlds. More accurately, they live in the same world, but they think and feel in different ones.</p>
<p class="normal3">正是在这些特殊的世界，正是在这些私人或团体、阶级、省级、职业、国家或宗派的产物中，人类在大社会中进行政治调整。它们的多样性和复杂性是无法描述的。然而，这些虚构决定了人类政治行为的很大一部分。我们必须考虑大约五十个主权议会，它们至少由一百个立法机构组成。它们属于至少五十个省级和市级议会的等级制度，这些议会及其行政、管理和立法机构构成了地球上的正式权力。但这还不足以揭示政治生活的复杂性。因为在这些无数的权力中心中，每一个都有政党，这些政党本身就是根植于阶级、派别、集团和氏族的等级制度；在这些政党中，有个别政治家，每个人都是联系、记忆、恐惧和希望之网的个人中心。</p><p class="normal3">It is to these special worlds, it is to these private or group, or class, or provincial, or occupational, or national, or sectarian artifacts, that the political adjustment of mankind in the Great Society takes place. Their variety and complication are impossible to describe. Yet these fictions determine a very great part of men's political behavior. We must think of perhaps fifty sovereign parliaments consisting of at least a hundred legislative bodies. With them belong at least fifty hierarchies of provincial and municipal assemblies, which with their executive, administrative and legislative organs, constitute formal authority on earth. But that does not begin to reveal the complexity of political life. For in each of these innumerable centers of authority there are parties, and these parties are themselves hierarchies with their roots in classes, sections, cliques and clans; and within these are the individual politicians, each the personal center of a web of connection and memory and fear and hope.</p>
<p class="normal3">不知何故，出于通常必然难以理解的原因，作为统治、妥协或勾结的结果，这些政治机构发出命令，调动军队或缔结和平，征兵，征税，流放，监禁，保护财产或没收财产，鼓励一种企业并阻止另一种企业，促进移民或阻碍移民，改善通讯或审查移民，建立学校，组建海军，宣布“政策”和“命运”，设置经济壁垒，创造财产或毁灭财产，将一个民族置于另一个民族的统治之下，或偏袒一个阶级而反对另一个阶级。对于这些决定中的每一个，某些事实观点被认为是决定性的，某些情况观点被接受为推理的基础和情感的刺激。事实观点是什么？为什么是那个？</p><p class="normal3">Somehow or other, for reasons often necessarily obscure, as the result of domination or compromise or a logroll, there emerge from these political bodies commands, which set armies in motion or make peace, conscript life, tax, exile, imprison, protect property or confiscate it, encourage one kind of enterprise and discourage another, facilitate immigration or obstruct it, improve communication or censor it, establish schools, build navies, proclaim "policies," and "destiny," raise economic barriers, make property or unmake it, bring one people under the rule of another, or favor one class as against another. For each of these decisions some view of the facts is taken to be conclusive, some view of the circumstances is accepted as the basis of inference and as the stimulus of feeling. What view of the facts, and why that one?</p>
<p class="normal3">然而，这还不足以说明真正的复杂性。正式的政治结构存在于社会环境中，其中有无数大大小小的公司和机构、自愿和半自愿的协会、国家、省、城市和社区团体，这些团体往往做出政治机构所记录的决定。这些决定是基于什么做出的？</p><p class="normal3">And yet even this does not begin to exhaust the real complexity. The formal political structure exists in a social environment, where there are innumerable large and small corporations and institutions, voluntary and semi-voluntary associations, national, provincial, urban and neighborhood groupings, which often as not make the decision that the political body registers. On what are these decisions based?</p>
<p class="normal3">切斯特顿先生说：“现代社会本质上是不安全的，因为它建立在这样一种观念上：所有人都会因为不同的原因做同样的事情……就像任何罪犯的头脑中都可能存在着孤独犯罪的地狱一样，任何郊区办事员的家里或帽子下都可能存在着一种完全不同的哲学。第一个人可能是一个彻底的唯物主义者，觉得自己的身体就像一台制造自己思想的可怕机器。他可能会听从自己的想法，就像听钟表沉闷的滴答声一样。隔壁的人可能是一个基督教科学家，认为自己的身体在某种程度上比自己的影子更不真实。他可能几乎把自己的胳膊和腿看作是幻觉，就像震颤性谵妄梦中的蛇一样。街上的第三个人可能不是基督教科学家，相反，他是一个基督徒。他可能生活在一个童话故事里，就像他的邻居所说的那样；一个秘密但坚实的童话故事，充满了超凡脱俗的朋友的面孔和存在。第四个人可能是神智论者，也很可能是个素食主义者；我不明白为什么我不能满足于想象第五个人是魔鬼崇拜者……现在，无论这种多样性是否有价值，这种团结都是不可靠的。期望所有的人永远都在思考不同的事情，却做同样的事情，这是一种值得怀疑的推测。它不是建立在交流上，甚至不是建立在惯例上，而是建立在巧合上。四个人可能在同一盏灯柱下相遇；一个人把它漆成豌豆绿色，作为一项伟大的市政改革的一部分；一个人在它的灯光下阅读他的祈祷书；一个人在酒精的狂热中偶然热情地拥抱它；最后一个人只是因为豌豆绿色的灯柱是他和年轻女士约会的显眼地点。但期望这种情况夜复一夜地发生是不明智的……”</p><p class="normal3">"Modern society," says Mr. Chesterton, "is intrinsically insecure because it is based on the notion that all men will do the same thing for different reasons…. And as within the head of any convict may be the hell of a quite solitary crime, so in the house or under the hat of any suburban clerk may be the limbo of a quite separate philosophy. The first man may be a complete Materialist and feel his own body as a horrible machine manufacturing his own mind. He may listen to his thoughts as to the dull ticking of a clock. The man next door may be a Christian Scientist and regard his own body as somehow rather less substantial than his own shadow. He may come almost to regard his own arms and legs as delusions like moving serpents in the dream of delirium tremens. The third man in the street may not be a Christian Scientist but, on the contrary, a Christian. He may live in a fairy tale as his neighbors would say; a secret but solid fairy tale full of the faces and presences of unearthly friends. The fourth man may be a theosophist, and only too probably a vegetarian; and I do not see why I should not gratify myself with the fancy that the fifth man is a devil worshiper…. Now whether or not this sort of variety is valuable, this sort of unity is shaky. To expect that all men for all time will go on thinking different things, and yet doing the same things, is a doubtful speculation. It is not founding society on a communion, or even on a convention, but rather on a coincidence. Four men may meet under the same lamp post; one to paint it pea green as part of a great municipal reform; one to read his breviary in the light of it; one to embrace it with accidental ardour in a fit of alcoholic enthusiasm; and the last merely because the pea green post is a conspicuous point of rendezvous with his young lady. But to expect this to happen night after night is unwise…."</p>
<p class="normal3">路灯柱旁的四个人代表着政府、政党、公司、社团、社会团体、行业和专业、大学、教派和世界各国。想象一下立法者投票通过一项将影响远方人民的法令，政治家做出决定。想想看，巴黎和会重新划定了欧洲的边界，驻外大使试图了解本国政府和外国政府的意图，在落后国家做特许经营的推销员，要求开战的编辑，要求警察规范娱乐活动的牧师，俱乐部休息室决定罢工，缝纫圈准备规范学校，九名法官决定俄勒冈州的立法机构是否可以规定妇女的工作时间，内阁会议决定承认政府，政党代表大会选举候选人并撰写政纲，两千七百万选民投票，科克的爱尔兰人思考着贝尔法斯特的爱尔兰人，第三国际计划重建整个人类社会，董事会面临一系列员工的要求，男孩选择职业，商人估计下一季的供需，投机者预测市场走向，银行家决定是否为新企业提供信贷，广告商、广告读者……想想不同类型的美国人对“大英帝国”、“法国”、“俄罗斯”或“墨西哥”的看法。这与切斯特顿先生的四个站在豌豆绿色灯柱旁的人没什么不同。</p><p class="normal3">For the four men at the lamp post substitute the governments, the parties, the corporations, the societies, the social sets, the trades and professions, universities, sects, and nationalities of the world. Think of the legislator voting a statute that will affect distant peoples, a statesman coming to a decision. Think of the Peace Conference reconstituting the frontiers of Europe, an ambassador in a foreign country trying to discern the intentions of his own government and of the foreign government, a promoter working a concession in a backward country, an editor demanding a war, a clergyman calling on the police to regulate amusement, a club lounging-room making up its mind about a strike, a sewing circle preparing to regulate the schools, nine judges deciding whether a legislature in Oregon may fix the working hours of women, a cabinet meeting to decide on the recognition of a government, a party convention choosing a candidate and writing a platform, twenty-seven million voters casting their ballots, an Irishman in Cork thinking about an Irishman in Belfast, a Third International planning to reconstruct the whole of human society, a board of directors confronted with a set of their employees' demands, a boy choosing a career, a merchant estimating supply and demand for the coming season, a speculator predicting the course of the market, a banker deciding whether to put credit behind a new enterprise, the advertiser, the reader of advertisments…. Think of the different sorts of Americans thinking about their notions of "The British Empire" or "France" or "Russia" or "Mexico." It is not so different from Mr. Chesterton's four men at the pea green lamp post.</p>

<p class="normal3">因此，在我们陷入关于人类先天差异的晦涩难懂的丛林之前，我们最好将注意力集中在人类对世界的认知上的巨大差异上。我并不怀疑存在着重要的生物学差异。由于人类是动物，所以如果没有差异才奇怪。但是作为理性的生物，在行为所响应的环境之间存在可测量的相似性之前，对比较行为进行概括是比肤浅更糟糕的。</p><p class="normal3">And so before we involve ourselves in the jungle of obscurities about the innate differences of men, we shall do well to fix our attention upon the extraordinary differences in what men know of the world. I do not doubt that there are important biological differences. Since man is an animal it would be strange if there were not. But as rational beings it is worse than shallow to generalize at all about comparative behavior until there is a measurable similarity between the environments to which behavior is a response.</p>
<p class="normal3">这一思想的实用价值在于，它为关于先天与后天、先天品质与环境的古老争论引入了亟需的改进。因为伪环境是“人性”与“条件”的混合体。在我看来，它表明，从我们观察到的人类行为中，对人类现在和将来的状态，或对社会的必要条件进行高谈阔论是毫无用处的。因为我们不知道人类会如何回应伟大社会的事实。我们真正知道的只是，他们如何回应可以公平地称为最不充分的伟大社会图景。基于这样的证据，我们无法诚实地得出关于人类或伟大社会的结论。</p><p class="normal3">The pragmatic value of this idea is that it introduces a much needed refinement into the ancient controversy about nature and nurture, innate quality and environment. For the pseudo-environment is a hybrid compounded of "human nature" and "conditions." To my mind it shows the uselessness of pontificating about what man is and always will be from what we observe man to be doing, or about what are the necessary conditions of society. For we do not know how men would behave in response to the facts of the Great Society. All that we really know is how they behave in response to what can fairly be called a most inadequate picture of the Great Society. No conclusion about man or the Great Society can honestly be made on evidence like that.</p>
<p class="normal3">那么，这就是我们探究的线索。我们假设每个人的行为都不是建立在直接和确定的知识之上，而是基于他自己制作的或别人给他的图片。如果他的地图告诉他世界是平的，他就不会航行到他认为是地球边缘的地方，因为害怕掉下去。如果他的地图上有一个永葆青春的喷泉，庞塞·德莱昂就会去寻找它。如果有人挖出看起来像金子的黄土，他会在一段时间内表现得像找到了金子一样。想象世界的方式决定了人们在某一特定时刻会做什么。它并不决定他们会取得什么成就。它决定了他们的努力、他们的感受、他们的希望，而不是他们的成就和结果。那些最大声宣扬他们的“唯物主义”和蔑视“空想家”的人，即马克思主义共产主义者，把他们的全部希望寄托在什么上面？寄托在通过宣传形成一个阶级意识群体上面。但是，宣传如果不是为了改变人们所反应的画面，用一种社会模式取代另一种社会模式，那又是什么呢？阶级意识不就是认识世界的一种方式吗？民族意识不就是另一种方式吗？吉丁斯教授的种类意识不就是相信我们在众多人中认出某些属于我们种类的人的过程吗？</p><p class="normal3">This, then, will be the clue to our inquiry. We shall assume that what each man does is based not on direct and certain knowledge, but on pictures made by himself or given to him. If his atlas tells him that the world is flat he will not sail near what he believes to be the edge of our planet for fear of falling off. If his maps include a fountain of eternal youth, a Ponce de Leon will go in quest of it. If someone digs up yellow dirt that looks like gold, he will for a time act exactly as if he had found gold. The way in which the world is imagined determines at any particular moment what men will do. It does not determine what they will achieve. It determines their effort, their feelings, their hopes, not their accomplishments and results. The very men who most loudly proclaim their "materialism" and their contempt for "ideologues," the Marxian communists, place their entire hope on what? On the formation by propaganda of a class-conscious group. But what is propaganda, if not the effort to alter the picture to which men respond, to substitute one social pattern for another? What is class consciousness but a way of realizing the world? National consciousness but another way? And Professor Giddings' consciousness of kind, but a process of believing that we recognize among the multitude certain ones marked as our kind?</p>
<p class="normal3">尝试将社会生活解释为追求快乐和避免痛苦。你很快就会说享乐主义者是在自问自答，因为即使假设人类确实追求这些目标，关键问题仍未触及，即为什么他认为一种方式而不是另一种方式更可能带来快乐。人类良知的指导能解释这一点吗？那么他是如何拥有他所拥有的特定良知的呢？经济自利理论呢？但是，人们是如何以一种方式而不是另一种方式来构想他们的利益的呢？对安全、声望、统治或模糊地称为自我实现的渴望？人们如何构想他们的安全，他们认为什么是声望，他们如何找出统治的手段，或者他们希望实现的自我概念是什么？快乐、痛苦、良知、获取、保护、提升、控制，无疑是人们行为方式的某些名称。可能存在朝着这些目标努力的本能倾向。但是，任何关于目的的陈述，或任何关于寻求目的的倾向的描述，都无法解释由此产生的行为。人类进行理论研究这一事实本身就证明了他们的拟态环境，即他们对世界的内在表征，是思想、情感和行动的决定性因素。因为，如果现实与人类反应之间的联系是直接的、即时的，而不是间接的、推断的，那么优柔寡断和失败就不复存在了，而且（如果我们每个人都像子宫里的婴儿一样紧密地融入这个世界），萧伯纳先生就无法说，除了生命的最初九个月之外，没有一个人能像植物一样管理好自己的事务。</p><p class="normal3">Try to explain social life as the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. You will soon be saying that the hedonist begs the question, for even supposing that man does pursue these ends, the crucial problem of why he thinks one course rather than another likely to produce pleasure, is untouched. Does the guidance of man's conscience explain? How then does he happen to have the particular conscience which he has? The theory of economic self-interest? But how do men come to conceive their interest in one way rather than another? The desire for security, or prestige, or domination, or what is vaguely called self-realization? How do men conceive their security, what do they consider prestige, how do they figure out the means of domination, or what is the notion of self which they wish to realize? Pleasure, pain, conscience, acquisition, protection, enhancement, mastery, are undoubtedly names for some of the ways people act. There may be instinctive dispositions which work toward such ends. But no statement of the end, or any description of the tendencies to seek it, can explain the behavior which results. The very fact that men theorize at all is proof that their pseudo-environments, their interior representations of the world, are a determining element in thought, feeling, and action. For if the connection between reality and human response were direct and immediate, rather than indirect and inferred, indecision and failure would be unknown, and (if each of us fitted as snugly into the world as the child in the womb), Mr. Bernard Shaw would not have been able to say that except for the first nine months of its existence no human being manages its affairs as well as a plant.</p>
<p class="normal3">将精神分析方案应用于政治思想的主要困难就在于此。弗洛伊德学派关注的是不同个体对其他个体和具体环境的不适应。他们认为，如果能够理顺内部错乱，那么对于显然正常的关系，就不会出现多少或根本不会混淆。但舆论处理的是间接、看不见的和令人费解的事实，它们并不明显。舆论所指的情况仅被称为意见。另一方面，精神分析学家几乎总是假设环境是可知的，即使不可知，至少也是可以忍受的，任何头脑清醒的人都可以理解。他的这一假设就是舆论问题。社会分析家不会理所当然地认为环境是显而易见的，而是最关心的是研究如何构想更大的政治环境，以及如何更成功地构想它。精神分析家研究对 X 的适应，他称之为环境；社会分析家研究 X，他称之为伪环境。</p><p class="normal3">The chief difficulty in adapting the psychoanalytic scheme to political thought arises in this connection. The Freudians are concerned with the maladjustment of distinct individuals to other individuals and to concrete circumstances. They have assumed that if internal derangements could be straightened out, there would be little or no confusion about what is the obviously normal relationship. But public opinion deals with indirect, unseen, and puzzling facts, and there is nothing obvious about them. The situations to which public opinions refer are known only as opinions. The psychoanalyst, on the other hand, almost always assumes that the environment is knowable, and if not knowable then at least bearable, to any unclouded intelligence. This assumption of his is the problem of public opinion. Instead of taking for granted an environment that is readily known, the social analyst is most concerned in studying how the larger political environment is conceived, and how it can be conceived more successfully. The psychoanalyst examines the adjustment to an X, called by him the environment; the social analyst examines the X, called by him the pseudo-environment.</p>
<p class="normal3">当然，他永远都受益于新心理学，这不仅是因为如果正确运用，它能够极大地帮助人们自力更生，无论发生什么，而且因为对梦境、幻想和合理化的研究揭示了伪环境是如何形成的。但他不能将现有社会秩序中所谓的“正常生物学职业”或外部“摆脱宗教压制和教条惯例”的职业作为自己的标准。对于社会学家来说，什么是正常的社会职业？还是摆脱压制和惯例的职业？保守派批评家确实假设前者，浪漫派批评家假设后者。但在假设这些时，他们把整个世界视为理所当然。他们实际上是在说，社会要么符合他们对正常的看法，要么符合他们对自由的看法。这两种想法都只是公众意见，虽然作为医生的心理分析师可能会假设这些观点，但社会学家可能不会将现有公众意见的产物作为研究公众意见的标准。</p><p class="normal3">He is, of course, permanently and constantly in debt to the new psychology, not only because when rightly applied it so greatly helps people to stand on their own feet, come what may, but because the study of dreams, fantasy and rationalization has thrown light on how the pseudo-environment is put together. But he cannot assume as his criterion either what is called a "normal biological career" within the existing social order, or a career "freed from religious suppression and dogmatic conventions" outside. What for a sociologist is a normal social career? Or one freed from suppressions and conventions? Conservative critics do, to be sure, assume the first, and romantic ones the second. But in assuming them they are taking the whole world for granted. They are saying in effect either that society is the sort of thing which corresponds to their idea of what is normal, or the sort of thing which corresponds to their idea of what is free. Both ideas are merely public opinions, and while the psychoanalyst as physician may perhaps assume them, the sociologist may not take the products of existing public opinion as criteria by which to study public opinion.</p>

<p class="normal3">我们在政治上必须面对的世界是遥不可及、看不见、想不到的。我们必须去探索、报道和想象它。人不是亚里士多德式的神，一眼就能看透一切存在。人是进化的产物，能够跨越足够多的现实来维持生存，并抓住时间尺度上只有片刻的洞察力和幸福。然而，正是这种生物发明了各种方法，可以看到肉眼看不到的东西，听到耳朵听不到的东西，称量巨大质量和无限小质量，计算和分离比他个人能记住的更多的物品。他正在学习用他的头脑去观察他永远看不到、触摸不到、闻不到、听到或记住的广阔世界。渐渐地，他在脑海中为自己描绘出一幅超出他能力范围的世界的可靠画面。</p><p class="normal3">The world that we have to deal with politically is out of reach, out of sight, out of mind. It has to be explored, reported, and imagined. Man is no Aristotelian god contemplating all existence at one glance. He is the creature of an evolution who can just about span a sufficient portion of reality to manage his survival, and snatch what on the scale of time are but a few moments of insight and happiness. Yet this same creature has invented ways of seeing what no naked eye could see, of hearing what no ear could hear, of weighing immense masses and infinitesimal ones, of counting and separating more items than he can individually remember. He is learning to see with his mind vast portions of the world that he could never see, touch, smell, hear, or remember. Gradually he makes for himself a trustworthy picture inside his head of the world beyond his reach.</p>
<p class="normal3">外部世界的特征与其他人的行为有关，只要这种行为与我们的行为有关、取决于我们或令我们感兴趣，我们便大致称其为公共事务。这些人头脑中的画面，他们自己、他人、他们的需要、目的和关系的画面，就是他们的公众意见。由一群人或以团体名义行事的个人所采取行动的画面，就是大写的公众意见。因此，在接下来的章节中，我们将首先探讨为什么内心的画面在人们与外部世界打交道时常常误导他们的原因。在这个标题下，我们将首先考虑限制他们获取事实的主要因素。它们是人为的审查制度、社会接触的限制、每天用于关注公共事务的时间相对匮乏、由于必须将事件压缩为非常短的信息而产生的扭曲、使用少量词汇来表达复杂世界的困难，以及最终对面对那些似乎威胁到人们既定生活常规的事实的恐惧。</p><p class="normal3">Those features of the world outside which have to do with the behavior of other human beings, in so far as that behavior crosses ours, is dependent upon us, or is interesting to us, we call roughly public affairs. The pictures inside the heads of these human beings, the pictures of themselves, of others, of their needs, purposes, and relationship, are their public opinions. Those pictures which are acted upon by groups of people, or by individuals acting in the name of groups, are Public Opinion with capital letters. And so in the chapters which follow we shall inquire first into some of the reasons why the picture inside so often misleads men in their dealings with the world outside. Under this heading we shall consider first the chief factors which limit their access to the facts. They are the artificial censorships, the limitations of social contact, the comparatively meager time available in each day for paying attention to public affairs, the distortion arising because events have to be compressed into very short messages, the difficulty of making a small vocabulary express a complicated world, and finally the fear of facing those facts which would seem to threaten the established routine of men's lives.</p>
<p class="normal3">然后，分析从这些或多或少的外部限制转向了这样一个问题：这些来自外部的信息如何受到储存的图像、先入之见和偏见的影响，这些图像、先入之见和偏见解释、充实了这些信息，并反过来强有力地指导了我们的注意力和我们的视野本身。从这里开始，它开始研究在个人身上，有限的来自外部的信息如何形成一种刻板印象，并与他所感受和构想的自己的利益相一致。在接下来的章节中，它研究了意见如何结晶为所谓的公众舆论，国家意志、集体思想、社会目的或无论你选择如何称呼它，是如何形成的。</p><p class="normal3">The analysis then turns from these more or less external limitations to the question of how this trickle of messages from the outside is affected by the stored up images, the preconceptions, and prejudices which interpret, fill them out, and in their turn powerfully direct the play of our attention, and our vision itself. From this it proceeds to examine how in the individual person the limited messages from outside, formed into a pattern of stereotypes, are identified with his own interests as he feels and conceives them. In the succeeding sections it examines how opinions are crystallized into what is called Public Opinion, how a National Will, a Group Mind, a Social Purpose, or whatever you choose to call it, is formed.</p>
<p class="normal3">前五部分构成本书的描述部分。接下来是对传统民主舆论理论的分析。论点的实质是，民主的原始形式从未认真面对过由于人们头脑中的画面并不自动与外部世界对应而产生的问题。然后，由于民主理论受到社会主义思想家的批评，接下来是对英国行会社会主义者提出的最先进和最连贯的批评的审查。我的目的是找出这些改革者是否考虑到了舆论的主要困难。我的结论是，他们和最初的民主主义者一样完全忽视了这些困难，因为他们也认为，在一个复杂得多的文明中，人们心中神秘地存在着一种超出他们能力范围的世界知识。</p><p class="normal3">The first five parts constitute the descriptive section of the book. There follows an analysis of the traditional democratic theory of public opinion. The substance of the argument is that democracy in its original form never seriously faced the problem which arises because the pictures inside people's heads do not automatically correspond with the world outside. And then, because the democratic theory is under criticism by socialist thinkers, there follows an examination of the most advanced and coherent of these criticisms, as made by the English Guild Socialists. My purpose here is to find out whether these reformers take into account the main difficulties of public opinion. My conclusion is that they ignore the difficulties, as completely as did the original democrats, because they, too, assume, and in a much more complicated civilization, that somehow mysteriously there exists in the hearts of men a knowledge of the world beyond their reach.</p>
<p class="normal3">我认为，无论选举的基础是什么，代议制政府，无论是在通常所说的政治中，还是在工业中，都无法成功运作，除非有一个独立的、专业的组织，使那些必须做出决定的人能够理解看不见的事实。因此，我试图论证，只有认真接受个人代表必须由看不见的事实代表来补充的原则，才能实现令人满意的权力下放，并使我们摆脱每个人都必须对所有公共事务有自己的看法这一无法容忍和无法实现的虚构。有人认为，新闻界的问题之所以混乱，是因为批评者和辩护者希望新闻界能够实现这一虚构，希望它弥补民主理论中没有预见到的一切，而读者希望这一奇迹能够不费吹灰之力地实现。民主人士认为报纸是解决自身缺陷的灵丹妙药，而对新闻性质和新闻业经济基础的分析似乎表明，报纸必然且不可避免地反映并因此或多或少地加剧了舆论组织缺陷。我的结论是，舆论必须为新闻界组织起来，才能健全，而不是像今天这样由新闻界组织。我认为，这种组织首先是政治科学的任务，政治科学已赢得了其作为制定者的地位，在真正的决策之前，而不是在决策之后成为辩护者、批评家或记者。我试图指出，政府和工业的困惑正在合谋为政治科学提供这个巨大的机会来丰富自己并为公众服务。当然，我希望这些页面能帮助一些人更生动地认识到这个机会，从而更有意识地追求它。</p><p class="normal3">I argue that representative government, either in what is ordinarily called politics, or in industry, cannot be worked successfully, no matter what the basis of election, unless there is an independent, expert organization for making the unseen facts intelligible to those who have to make the decisions. I attempt, therefore, to argue that the serious acceptance of the principle that personal representation must be supplemented by representation of the unseen facts would alone permit a satisfactory decentralization, and allow us to escape from the intolerable and unworkable fiction that each of us must acquire a competent opinion about all public affairs. It is argued that the problem of the press is confused because the critics and the apologists expect the press to realize this fiction, expect it to make up for all that was not foreseen in the theory of democracy, and that the readers expect this miracle to be performed at no cost or trouble to themselves. The newspapers are regarded by democrats as a panacea for their own defects, whereas analysis of the nature of news and of the economic basis of journalism seems to show that the newspapers necessarily and inevitably reflect, and therefore, in greater or lesser measure, intensify, the defective organization of public opinion. My conclusion is that public opinions must be organized for the press if they are to be sound, not by the press as is the case today. This organization I conceive to be in the first instance the task of a political science that has won its proper place as formulator, in advance of real decision, instead of apologist, critic, or reporter after the decision has been made. I try to indicate that the perplexities of government and industry are conspiring to give political science this enormous opportunity to enrich itself and to serve the public. And, of course, I hope that these pages will help a few people to realize that opportunity more vividly, and therefore to pursue it more consciously.</p>

<p class="normal3">在历史上最伟大的战役之一最可怕的时刻，一位将军主持编辑会议的画面看起来更像是《巧克力士兵》中的场景，而不是现实生活中的一页。然而，我们从编辑法国公报的军官那里直接得知，这些会议是战争业务的常规部分；在凡尔登战役最糟糕的时刻，霞飞将军和他的内阁开会并争论第二天早上要在报纸上刊登的名词、形容词和动词。</p><p class="normal3">The picture of a general presiding over an editorial conference at the most terrible hour of one of the great battles of history seems more like a scene from The Chocolate Soldier than a page from life. Yet we know at first hand from the officer who edited the French communiqués that these conferences were a regular part of the business of war; that in the worst moment of Verdun, General Joffre and his cabinet met and argued over the nouns, adjectives, and verbs that were to be printed in the newspapers the next morning.</p>
<p class="normal3">“23 日（1916 年 2 月）晚间公报的编辑工作是在一种戏剧性的气氛中进行的，”皮埃尔弗先生说。总理办公室的贝尔特洛先生刚刚接到部长的电话，要求佩尔将军加强报告并强调敌人攻击的规模。必须让公众做好最坏的准备，以防事态演变成一场灾难。这种焦虑清楚地表明，无论是在总部还是在战争部，政府都没有找到信心的理由。贝尔特洛先生讲话时，佩尔将军在做笔记。他递给我一张写有政府意愿的文件，以及冯·戴姆林将军发布的命令，该命令是从一些俘虏身上找到的，其中指出这次袭击是确保和平的最高攻势。巧妙地利用了所有这些，以表明德国正在发动一场巨大的、史无前例的攻击，并希望从这场攻击的成功中结束战争。这样做的逻辑是，没人会对我们的撤军感到惊讶。半小时后，当我带着手稿下楼时，发现少将、雅宁将军、杜邦上校和雷诺阿尔中校聚集在克洛岱尔上校的办公室里，因为他不在。佩莱将军担心我无法给人留下理想的印象，亲自准备了一份拟议的公报。我读了我刚刚读过的内容。人们发现它太温和了。另一方面，佩莱将军的命令似乎太令人震惊了。我故意省略了冯·戴姆林的命令。把它写进公报<i class="calibre10">就会打破公众习惯的格式</i>
 ，就会把它变成一种恳求。它似乎在说：“你认为我们怎么能抵抗呢？”有理由担心，公众会因为这种语气的变化而分心，认为一切都完了。我解释了我的理由并建议将戴姆林的文本以单独的说明的形式提供给报纸。</p><p class="normal3">"The evening communiqué of the twenty-third (February 1916)" says M. de Pierrefeu, "was edited in a dramatic atmosphere. M. Berthelot, of the Prime Minister's office, had just telephoned by order of the minister asking General Pelle to strengthen the report and to emphasize the proportions of the enemy's attack. It was necessary to prepare the public for the worst outcome in case the affair turned into a catastrophe. This anxiety showed clearly that neither at G. H. Q. nor at the Ministry of War had the Government found reason for confidence. As M. Berthelot spoke, General Pelle made notes. He handed me the paper on which he had written the Government's wishes, together with the order of the day issued by General von Deimling and found on some prisoners, in which it was stated that this attack was the supreme offensive to secure peace. Skilfully used, all this was to demonstrate that Germany was letting loose a gigantic effort, an effort without precedent, and that from its success she hoped for the end of the war. The logic of this was that nobody need be surprised at our withdrawal. When, a half hour later, I went down with my manuscript, I found gathered together in Colonel Claudel's office, he being away, the major-general, General Janin, Colonel Dupont, and Lieutenant-Colonel Renouard. Fearing that I would not succeed in giving the desired impression, General Pellé had himself prepared a proposed communiqué. I read what I had just done. It was found to be too moderate. General Pellé's, on the other hand, seemed too alarming. I had purposely omitted von Deimling's order of the day. To put it into the communiqué <i class="calibre10">would be to break with the formula to which the public was accustomed</i>
 , would be to transform it into a kind of pleading. It would seem to say: 'How do you suppose we can resist?' There was reason to fear that the public would be distracted by this change of tone and would believe that everything was lost. I explained my reasons and suggested giving Deimling's text to the newspapers in the form of a separate note.</p>
<p class="normal3">“意见分歧很大，佩莱将军请德·卡斯特尔诺将军前来做最后决定。将军面带微笑，平静而又心情愉快地到来，对这种新型的战争文学会议说了几句好话，并查看了文本。他选择了更简单的一个，更加强调了第一个短语，插入了‘正如预期的那样’的字眼，这提供了令人放心的品质，并且断然反对插入冯·戴姆林的命令，但赞成以特别说明的形式将其传达给新闻界……” 霞飞将军当晚仔细阅读了公报并批准了它。</p><p class="normal3">"Opinion being divided, General Pellé went to ask General de Castelnau to come and decide finally. The General arrived smiling, quiet and good humored, said a few pleasant words about this new kind of literary council of war, and looked at the texts. He chose the simpler one, gave more weight to the first phrase, inserted the words 'as had been anticipated,' which supply a reassuring quality, and was flatly against inserting von Deimling's order, but was for transmitting it to the press in a special note … " General Joffre that evening read the communiqué carefully and approved it.</p>
<p class="normal3">几个小时之内，全世界就会读到这两三百字。它们会在人们的脑海中描绘出凡尔登山坡上正在发生的事情，在那幅画前，人们会感到鼓舞或绝望。布列斯特的店主、洛林的农民、波旁宫的议员、阿姆斯特丹或明尼阿波利斯的编辑都必须保持希望，但又要准备好接受可能的失败，而不要惊慌失措。因此，他们被告知，法国指挥部对失地并不感到意外。他们被教导要把这件事看作严重的事情，但并不奇怪。事实上，法国总参谋部并没有为德国的进攻做好充分的准备。支援战壕没有挖好，替代道路没有修建，铁丝网也没有。但承认这一点会在平民的脑海中唤起画面，很可能把逆转变成灾难。最高指挥部可能会感到失望，但仍然可以振作起来；国内外的人们都心存疑虑，没有专业人士那样的专心致志，他们可能因为听了整篇报道就忘记了战争，因为派系和反派之间就军官的能力展开了混战。因此，当局没有让公众根据将军们知道的所有事实采取行动，而是只提出某些事实，而且这些事实只能以最有可能稳定人民的方式提出。</p><p class="normal3">Within a few hours those two or three hundred words would be read all over the world. They would paint a picture in men's minds of what was happening on the slopes of Verdun, and in front of that picture people would take heart or despair. The shopkeeper in Brest, the peasant in Lorraine, the deputy in the Palais Bourbon, the editor in Amsterdam or Minneapolis had to be kept in hope, and yet prepared to accept possible defeat without yielding to panic. They are told, therefore, that the loss of ground is no surprise to the French Command. They are taught to regard the affair as serious, but not strange. Now, as a matter of fact, the French General Staff was not fully prepared for the German offensive. Supporting trenches had not been dug, alternative roads had not been built, barbed wire was lacking. But to confess that would have aroused images in the heads of civilians that might well have turned a reverse into a disaster. The High Command could be disappointed, and yet pull itself together; the people at home and abroad, full of uncertainties, and with none of the professional man's singleness of purpose, might on the basis of a complete story have lost sight of the war in a melee of faction and counter-faction about the competence of the officers. Instead, therefore, of letting the public act on all the facts which the generals knew, the authorities presented only certain facts, and these only in such a way as would be most likely to steady the people.</p>
<p class="normal3">在这种情况下，布置模拟环境的人知道真实情况。但几天后发生了一起事件，法国参谋部对此并不知晓真相。德国人宣布，前一天下午他们已通过突袭占领了杜奥蒙特堡。在尚蒂伊的法国总部，没有人能理解这个消息。因为在 25 日早上，在第 20 军团交战后，战斗形势有所好转。前线的报告没有提到杜奥蒙特堡的情况。但调查显示，德国的报告是真实的，尽管目前还没有人知道这座堡垒是如何被占领的。与此同时，德国的公报正在世界各地传播，法国必须说点什么。总部如此解释。“尚蒂伊对袭击的发生方式一无所知，我们在 26 日晚上的公报中设想了一个袭击计划，这个计划肯定有千分之一的机会是真的。”这场假想战役的公报如下：</p><p class="normal3">In this case the men who arranged the pseudo-environment knew what the real one was. But a few days later an incident occurred about which the French Staff did not know the truth. The Germans announced that on the previous afternoon they had taken Fort Douaumont by assault. At French headquarters in Chantilly no one could understand this news. For on the morning of the twenty-fifth, after the engagement of the XXth corps, the battle had taken a turn for the better. Reports from the front said nothing about Douaumont. But inquiry showed that the German report was true, though no one as yet knew how the fort had been taken. In the meantime, the German communiqué was being flashed around the world, and the French had to say something. So headquarters explained. "In the midst of total ignorance at Chantilly about the way the attack had taken place, we imagined, in the evening communiqué of the 26th, a plan of the attack which certainly had a thousand to one chance of being true." The communiqué of this imaginary battle read:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">“杜奥蒙特堡周围正在发生一场激烈的战斗，该堡是旧凡尔登防御组织的前哨。敌人今早占领了该阵地，在几次进攻失败并遭受重大损失后，我方部队再次进攻并越过该阵地，但敌人未能将其击退。”</p>
</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">"A bitter struggle is taking place around Fort de Douaumont which is an advanced post of the old defensive organization of Verdun. The position taken this morning by the enemy, after several unsuccessful assaults that cost him very heavy losses, has been reached again and passed by our troops whom the enemy has not been able to drive back."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="normal3">实际情况与法国和德国的描述都不一样。在更换部队时，由于命令混乱，不知何故忘记了阵地。只有一名炮兵指挥官和几个士兵留在堡垒中。一些德国士兵看到门开着，就爬进了堡垒，把里面的所有人都俘虏了。过了一会儿，山坡上的法国人被堡垒的枪击吓坏了。杜奥蒙特没有发生战斗，也没有人员伤亡。法军也没有像公报中说的那样越过堡垒。他们确实在堡垒的两边，但堡垒在敌人手中。</p><p class="normal3">What had actually happened differed from both the French and German accounts. While changing troops in the line, the position had somehow been forgotten in a confusion of orders. Only a battery commander and a few men remained in the fort. Some German soldiers, seeing the door open, had crawled into the fort, and taken everyone inside prisoner. A little later the French who were on the slopes of the hill were horrified at being shot at from the fort. There had been no battle at Douaumont and no losses. Nor had the French troops advanced beyond it as the communiqués seemed to say. They were beyond it on either side, to be sure, but the fort was in enemy hands.</p>
<p class="normal3">然而，从公报中，每个人都相信要塞已被半包围。公报没有明确说明这一点，但“媒体一如既往地加快了步伐。”军事作家得出结论，德国人很快就必须投降。几天后，他们开始自问，为什么驻军由于缺乏食物而还没有投降。“必须通过新闻局要求他们放弃包围主题。”</p><p class="normal3">Yet from the communiqué everyone believed that the fort was half surrounded. The words did not explicitly say so, but "the press, as usual, forced the pace." Military writers concluded that the Germans would soon have to surrender. In a few days they began to ask themselves why the garrison, since it lacked food, had not yet surrendered. "It was necessary through the press bureau to request them to drop the encirclement theme."</p>

<p class="normal3">法国公报的编辑告诉我们，随着战斗的拖延，他和他的同事开始通过不断强调德国人的惨重损失来消除他们的顽固性。必须记住，在当时，事实上直到 1917 年末，所有同盟国人民对战争的正统看法是，战争将由“消耗战”决定。没有人相信运动战。人们坚持认为战略和外交都不起作用。这只是杀死德国人的问题。公众或多或少相信这一教条，但面对德国的惊人胜利，他们不得不不断被提醒这一点。</p><p class="normal3">The editor of the French communiqué tells us that as the battle dragged out, his colleagues and he set out to neutralize the pertinacity of the Germans by continual insistence on their terrible losses. It is necessary to remember that at this time, and in fact until late in 1917, the orthodox view of the war for all the Allied peoples was that it would be decided by "attrition." Nobody believed in a war of movement. It was insisted that strategy did not count, or diplomacy. It was simply a matter of killing Germans. The general public more or less believed the dogma, but it had constantly to be reminded of it in face of spectacular German successes.</p>
<blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">“几乎每一天都有公报……公报似乎公正地将惨重损失归咎于德国人，称其为惨重损失，称其为血腥牺牲、尸体成堆、百夫长。同样，无线电通讯也不断使用凡尔登情报局的统计数据，该局局长科因泰少校发明了一种计算德国损失的方法，显然产生了惊人的结果。每两周，数字就会增加十万左右。这些 30 万、40 万、50 万的伤亡，分为每日、每周、每月的损失，以各种方式重复，产生了惊人的效果。我们的公式几乎没有变化：‘根据战俘的说法，德国在进攻过程中的损失相当大’……‘事实证明损失很大’……‘敌人因损失而精疲力竭，没有再次发动进攻’……某些公式后来因为过度使用而被放弃，每天都在使用：‘在我们的炮火和机枪火力下’…… “被我们的大炮和机枪扫射”……不断的重复给中立国和德国本身留下了深刻的印象，并有助于创造一个血腥的背景，尽管瑙恩（德国无线电）否认这一点，并徒劳地试图消除这种不断重复的恶劣影响。</p>
</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">"Almost no day passed but the communiqué…. ascribed to the Germans with some appearance of justice heavy losses, extremely heavy, spoke of bloody sacrifices, heaps of corpses, hecatombs. Likewise the wireless constantly used the statistics of the intelligence bureau at Verdun, whose chief, Major Cointet, had invented a method of calculating German losses which obviously produced marvelous results. Every fortnight the figures increased a hundred thousand or so. These 300,000, 400,000, 500,000 casualties put out, divided into daily, weekly, monthly losses, repeated in all sorts of ways, produced a striking effect. Our formulae varied little: 'according to prisoners the German losses in the course of the attack have been considerable' … 'it is proved that the losses' … 'the enemy exhausted by his losses has not renewed the attack' … Certain formulae, later abandoned because they had been overworked, were used each day: 'under our artillery and machine gun fire' … 'mowed down by our artillery and machine gun fire' … Constant repetition impressed the neutrals and Germany itself, and helped to create a bloody background in spite of the denials from Nauen (the German wireless) which tried vainly to destroy the bad effect of this perpetual repetition."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="normal3">法国司令部希望通过这些报告公开确立其论点，并为审查人员提供指导，其论点如下：</p><p class="normal3">The thesis of the French Command, which it wished to establish publicly by these reports, was formulated as follows for the guidance of the censors:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">“这次进攻将与我们的对手的现役部队交战，而对手的兵力正在减少。我们得知，1916 年的部队已经投入前线。剩下的是已经征召的 1917 年部队，以及第三类部队（45 岁以上的男性或康复者）。几周后，被这次进攻搞得精疲力竭的德国军队将发现自己面对的是联军的全部兵力（一千万对七百万）。”</p>
</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">"This offensive engages the active forces of our opponent whose manpower is declining. We have learned that the class of 1916 is already at the front. There will remain the 1917 class already being called up, and the resources of the third category (men above forty-five, or convalescents). In a few weeks, the German forces exhausted by this effort, will find themselves confronted with all the forces of the coalition (ten millions against seven millions)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="normal3">根据皮埃尔弗先生的说法，法国指挥部已经转变了这种信念。“由于思维异常，我们只看到了敌人的减员；而我们的部队似乎没有受到减员的影响。尼维尔将军也同意这种想法。我们在 1917 年看到了结果。”</p><p class="normal3">According to M. de Pierrefeu, the French command had converted itself to this belief. "By an extraordinary aberration of mind, only the attrition of the enemy was seen; it appeared that our forces were not subject to attrition. General Nivelle shared these ideas. We saw the result in 1917."</p>
<p class="normal3">我们学会了称之为宣传。一群人可以阻止独立人士了解事件，并根据自己的目的安排新闻。在这种情况下，其目的是爱国的，但这丝毫不影响论点。他们利用自己的权力让盟军公众以他们希望的方式看待事件。在世界各地传播的科因特少校的伤亡数字也属于同一类别。他们的目的是激起一种特殊的推论，即消耗战对法国有利。但这种推论并不是以论点的形式得出的。它几乎自动地产生于在凡尔登周围的山丘上屠杀无数德国人的心理画面。通过将死去的德国人置于画面的焦点，并省略提及法国人的死亡，建立了一种非常特殊的战斗观点。这种观点旨在抵消德国领土扩张的影响以及持续进攻所造成的强大印象。这种观点也倾向于让公众默许盟军实施的士气低落的防御战略。公众已经习惯了战争由大规模战略行动、侧翼攻击、包围和戏剧性投降组成的想法，他们逐渐忘记了这种想法，转而相信通过拼死一搏就能赢得战争的可怕想法。总参谋部通过控制前线的所有新闻，用符合这一战略的事实观点取而代之。</p><p class="normal3">We have learned to call this propaganda. A group of men, who can prevent independent access to the event, arrange the news of it to suit their purpose. That the purpose was in this case patriotic does not affect the argument at all. They used their power to make the Allied publics see affairs as they desired them to be seen. The casualty figures of Major Cointet which were spread about the world are of the same order. They were intended to provoke a particular kind of inference, namely that the war of attrition was going in favor of the French. But the inference is not drawn in the form of argument. It results almost automatically from the creation of a mental picture of endless Germans slaughtered on the hills about Verdun. By putting the dead Germans in the focus of the picture, and by omitting to mention the French dead, a very special view of the battle was built up. It was a view designed to neutralize the effects of German territorial advances and the impression of power which the persistence of the offensive was making. It was also a view that tended to make the public acquiesce in the demoralizing defensive strategy imposed upon the Allied armies. For the public, accustomed to the idea that war consists of great strategic movements, flank attacks, encirclements, and dramatic surrenders, had gradually to forget that picture in favor of the terrible idea that by matching lives the war would be won. Through its control over all news from the front, the General Staff substituted a view of the facts that comported with this strategy.</p>
<p class="normal3">军队总参谋部的位置十分稳固，因此它可以在很大范围内控制公众的看法。它控制前往前线的记者的选择，控制他们在前线的行动，阅读和审查他们从前线发来的消息，并操作电报。军队背后的政府通过控制电报和护照、邮件、海关和封锁来加强控制。它通过对出版商、公众会议和特工的合法权力来加强控制。但对于军队来说，控制远非完美。敌人的通讯总是存在，在无线电时代，中立者无法避免这种通讯。最重要的是士兵的谈话，这些谈话从前线传回来，在他们休假时四处传播。军队是一个难以驾驭的东西。这就是为什么海军和外交审查几乎总是更加完善的原因。知道发生了什么的人更少，他们的行为更容易受到监督。</p><p class="normal3">The General Staff of an army in the field is so placed that within wide limits it can control what the public will perceive. It controls the selection of correspondents who go to the front, controls their movements at the front, reads and censors their messages from the front, and operates the wires. The Government behind the army by its command of cables and passports, mails and custom houses and blockades increases the control. It emphasizes it by legal power over publishers, over public meetings, and by its secret service. But in the case of an army the control is far from perfect. There is always the enemy's communiqué, which in these days of wireless cannot be kept away from neutrals. Above all there is the talk of the soldiers, which blows back from the front, and is spread about when they are on leave. An army is an unwieldy thing. And that is why the naval and diplomatic censorship is almost always much more complete. Fewer people know what is going on, and their acts are more easily supervised.</p>

<p class="normal3">如果没有某种形式的审查制度，严格意义上的宣传就不可能实现。为了进行宣传，必须在公众和事件之间设置某种障碍。在任何人创造他认为明智或理想的伪环境之前，必须限制对真实环境的访问。因为虽然有直接访问权的人可能会误解他们所看到的内容，但没有人可以决定他们如何误解它，除非他能决定他们应该从哪里看，看什么。军事审查制度是最简单的障碍形式，但绝不是最重要的，因为它是已知的，因此在一定程度上被同意和忽视。</p><p class="normal3">Without some form of censorship, propaganda in the strict sense of the word is impossible. In order to conduct a propaganda there must be some barrier between the public and the event. Access to the real environment must be limited, before anyone can create a pseudo-environment that he thinks wise or desirable. For while people who have direct access can misconceive what they see, no one else can decide how they shall misconceive it, unless he can decide where they shall look, and at what. The military censorship is the simplest form of barrier, but by no means the most important, because it is known to exist, and is therefore in certain measure agreed to and discounted.</p>
<p class="normal3">在不同时期和针对不同主题，一些人会实施某种保密标准，而另一些人则会接受这种标准。由于公开不“符合公众利益”而被隐瞒的事情，与由于被认为不属于公众事务而被隐瞒的事情之间的界限逐渐模糊。构成个人私事的概念是灵活的。因此，一个人的财产数额被视为私事，所得税法中对此做出了仔细的规定，以尽可能地保密。一块土地的出售不是私人的，但价格可能是私人的。薪水通常比工资更私密，收入比遗产更私密。一个人的信用评级只在有限的范围内流通。大公司的利润比小公司的利润更公开。某些类型的对话，如夫妻之间、律师与客户之间、医生与病人之间、牧师与领圣餐者之间的对话，是享有特权的。董事会议通常是私人的。许多政治会议也是如此。内阁会议上、大使致国务卿的信中、私人采访中或在餐桌上所说的大部分内容都是隐私。许多人认为雇主和雇员之间的合同是隐私的。曾几何时，所有公司的事务都被视为隐私，就如今天一个人的神学一样。在那之前也有一段时间，他的神学被认为像他的眼睛颜色一样公开。但另一方面，传染病曾一度像人的消化过程一样隐私。隐私概念的历史将是一个有趣的故事。有时这些概念会发生剧烈冲突，就像布尔什维克公布秘密条约时，或者休斯先生调查人寿保险公司时，或者某人的丑闻从《城市话题》版面泄露到赫斯特先生的报纸头版时一样。</p><p class="normal3">At different times and for different subjects some men impose and other men accept a particular standard of secrecy. The frontier between what is concealed because publication is not, as we say, "compatible with the public interest" fades gradually into what is concealed because it is believed to be none of the public's business. The notion of what constitutes a person's private affairs is elastic. Thus the amount of a man's fortune is considered a private affair, and careful provision is made in the income tax law to keep it as private as possible. The sale of a piece of land is not private, but the price may be. Salaries are generally treated as more private than wages, incomes as more private than inheritances. A person's credit rating is given only a limited circulation. The profits of big corporations are more public than those of small firms. Certain kinds of conversation, between man and wife, lawyer and client, doctor and patient, priest and communicant, are privileged. Directors' meetings are generally private. So are many political conferences. Most of what is said at a cabinet meeting, or by an ambassador to the Secretary of State, or at private interviews, or dinner tables, is private. Many people regard the contract between employer and employee as private. There was a time when the affairs of all corporations were held to be as private as a man's theology is to-day. There was a time before that when his theology was held to be as public a matter as the color of his eyes. But infectious diseases, on the other hand, were once as private as the processes of a man's digestion. The history of the notion of privacy would be an entertaining tale. Sometimes the notions violently conflict, as they did when the bolsheviks published the secret treaties, or when Mr. Hughes investigated the life insurance companies, or when somebody's scandal exudes from the pages of Town Topics to the front pages of Mr. Hearst's newspapers.</p>
<p class="normal3">无论隐私的原因是好是坏，障碍都是存在的。在所谓的公共事务领域，各种地方都要求隐私。因此，问问自己你是如何得到你的观点所依据的事实的，这往往非常有启发性。谁真正看到、听到、感受到、计算、命名了你有意见的事情？是告诉你的人，还是告诉他的人，还是更远的人？他被允许看到多少？当他告诉你法国有这样或那样的想法时，他观察了法国的哪个部分？他是如何观察的？他观察的时候在哪里？他被允许与哪些法国人交谈，他读了哪些报纸，他们从哪里知道他们所说的？你可以问自己这些问题，但你很少能回答。然而，它们会提醒你，你的公众意见与它所涉及的事件之间往往存在着距离。提醒本身就是一种保护。</p><p class="normal3">Whether the reasons for privacy are good or bad, the barriers exist. Privacy is insisted upon at all kinds of places in the area of what is called public affairs. It is often very illuminating, therefore, to ask yourself how you got at the facts on which you base your opinion. Who actually saw, heard, felt, counted, named the thing, about which you have an opinion? Was it the man who told you, or the man who told him, or someone still further removed? And how much was he permitted to see? When he informs you that France thinks this and that, what part of France did he watch? How was he able to watch it? Where was he when he watched it? What Frenchmen was he permitted to talk to, what newspapers did he read, and where did they learn what they say? You can ask yourself these questions, but you can rarely answer them. They will remind you, however, of the distance which often separates your public opinion from the event with which it deals. And the reminder is itself a protection.</p>

<p class="normal3">尽管审查制度和隐私权从源头上拦截了大量信息，但大量的事实却根本无法传遍整个公众，或者只能以非常缓慢的速度传遍整个公众。因为思想的传播受到非常明显的限制。</p><p class="normal3">While censorship and privacy intercept much information at its source, a very much larger body of fact never reaches the whole public at all, or only very slowly. For there are very distinct limits upon the circulation of ideas.</p>
<p class="normal3">我们可以粗略估计一下，要让“每个人”都了解美国政府的宣传工作需要付出多大的努力。回想一下，在美国参战之前，战争已经持续了两年半，数百万的印刷品已经流传开来，无数的演讲也已经发表，让我们来看看克里尔先生对他“为人们的思想、为征服他们的信念”而战的描述，以便“美国主义的福音能够传遍全球的每一个角落”。</p><p class="normal3">A rough estimate of the effort it takes to reach "everybody" can be had by considering the Government's propaganda during the war. Remembering that the war had run over two years and a half before America entered it, that millions upon millions of printed pages had been circulated and untold speeches had been delivered, let us turn to Mr. Creel's account of his fight "for the minds of men, for the conquest of their convictions" in order that "the gospel of Americanism might be carried to every corner of the globe."</p>
<p class="normal3">克里尔先生必须组建一个机构，包括一个新闻部，据他说，该部发布了六千多份新闻稿，还必须招募七万五千名“四分钟”记者，他们至少要向三亿多人发表七十五万五千一百九十次演讲。童子军将威尔逊总统演讲的注释副本分发给美国的居民。双周刊被寄给六十万名教师。二十万张幻灯片用于插图讲座。海报、橱窗卡、报纸广告、漫画、印章和纽扣的设计共计一千四百三十八种。商会、教堂、兄弟会、学校都被用作分发渠道。然而，我还没有开始公正地评价克里尔先生的努力，因为他的努力并不包括麦卡杜先生为自由公债进行的庞大组织工作，也不包括胡佛先生关于食品的广泛宣传，也不包括红十字会、基督教青年会、救世军、哥伦布骑士团和犹太人福利委员会的活动，更不用说爱国团体的独立工作，例如和平执行联盟、自由国家协会联盟和国家安全联盟，也不包括同盟国和沉没民族的宣传局的活动。</p><p class="normal3">Mr. Creel had to assemble machinery which included a Division of News that issued, he tells us, more than six thousand releases, had to enlist seventy-five thousand Four Minute Men who delivered at least seven hundred and fifty-five thousand, one hundred and ninety speeches to an aggregate of over three hundred million people. Boy scouts delivered annotated copies of President Wilson's addresses to the householders of America. Fortnightly periodicals were sent to six hundred thousand teachers. Two hundred thousand lantern slides were furnished for illustrated lectures. Fourteen hundred and thirty-eight different designs were turned out for posters, window cards, newspaper advertisements, cartoons, seals and buttons. The chambers of commerce, the churches, fraternal societies, schools, were used as channels of distribution. Yet Mr. Creel's effort, to which I have not begun to do justice, did not include Mr. McAdoo's stupendous organization for the Liberty Loans, nor Mr. Hoover's far reaching propaganda about food, nor the campaigns of the Red Cross, the Y. M. C. A., Salvation Army, Knights of Columbus, Jewish Welfare Board, not to mention the independent work of patriotic societies, like the League to Enforce Peace, the League of Free Nations Association, the National Security League, nor the activity of the publicity bureaus of the Allies and of the submerged nationalities.</p>
<p class="normal3">这可能是最大规模、最密集的努力，目的是迅速向全国人民传达一套相当统一的思想。旧式的宣传工作进展较慢，也许更可靠，但从未如此具有包容性。现在，如果在危机时刻需要采取如此极端的措施才能接触到每个人，那么更正常的渠道对人们的思想有多开放？政府一直在努力，我相信，在战争持续期间，它在很大程度上成功地创造了一种几乎可以称为全美统一的舆论。但想想需要付出的艰苦努力、复杂的智慧、资金和人员。和平时期不存在这样的情况，因此，整个地区、庞大的群体、贫民窟、飞地和阶级对正在发生的事情知之甚少。</p><p class="normal3">Probably this is the largest and the most intensive effort to carry quickly a fairly uniform set of ideas to all the people of a nation. The older proselyting worked more slowly, perhaps more surely, but never so inclusively. Now if it required such extreme measures to reach everybody in time of crisis, how open are the more normal channels to men's minds? The Administration was trying, and while the war continued it very largely succeeded, I believe, in creating something that might almost be called one public opinion all over America. But think of the dogged work, the complicated ingenuity, the money and the personnel that were required. Nothing like that exists in time of peace, and as a corollary there are whole sections, there are vast groups, ghettoes, enclaves and classes that hear only vaguely about much that is going on.</p>
<p class="normal3">他们生活在常规中，只顾自己的事情，不参与大事，很少与自己同类的人打交道，很少读书。当然，旅行和贸易、邮件、电报、无线电、铁路、公路、轮船、汽车，以及下一代飞机，对思想的传播有着最大的影响。这些都以最复杂的方式影响着信息和观点的供应和质量。它们本身都受到技术、经济和政治条件的影响。每当政府放宽护照办理手续或海关检查，每当开通一条新铁路或新港口，建立一条新的航运线路，每当费率上涨或下降，邮件运输速度加快或减慢，电报不受审查并变得更便宜，公路修建、拓宽或改善，思想的传播都会受到影响。关税表和补贴影响商业企业的方向，从而影响人类合同的性质。因此，正如马萨诸塞州塞勒姆的情况一样，造船工艺的改变可能会使整个城市从一个国际影响力汇聚的中心沦为一个优雅的省级城镇。更快捷的交通带来的直接影响并不一定是好的。例如，很难说法国的铁路系统高度集中在巴黎，对法国人民来说是一件纯粹的好事。</p><p class="normal3">They live in grooves, are shut in among their own affairs, barred out of larger affairs, meet few people not of their own sort, read little. Travel and trade, the mails, the wires, and radio, railroads, highways, ships, motor cars, and in the coming generation aeroplanes, are, of course, of the utmost influence on the circulation of ideas. Each of these affects the supply and the quality of information and opinion in a most intricate way. Each is itself affected by technical, by economic, by political conditions. Every time a government relaxes the passport ceremonies or the customs inspection, every time a new railway or a new port is opened, a new shipping line established, every time rates go up or down, the mails move faster or more slowly, the cables are uncensored and made less expensive, highways built, or widened, or improved, the circulation of ideas is influenced. Tariff schedules and subsidies affect the direction of commercial enterprise, and therefore the nature of human contracts. And so it may well happen, as it did for example in the case of Salem, Massachusetts, that a change in the art of shipbuilding will reduce a whole city from a center where international influences converge to a genteel provincial town. All the immediate effects of more rapid transit are not necessarily good. It would be difficult to say, for example, that the railroad system of France, so highly centralized upon Paris, has been an unmixed blessing to the French people.</p>
<p class="normal3">毫无疑问，通讯手段引发的问题至关重要，而国际联盟计划最具建设性的特征之一就是对铁路运输和出海通道的研究。对电缆、港口、加油站、山口、运河、海峡、河道、码头、市场的垄断，其意义远不止一群商人致富或一个政府的威望。它意味着对新闻和观点交流的阻碍。但垄断并不是唯一的障碍。成本和可用供应是更大的障碍，因为如果旅行或交易的成本过高，如果对设施的需求超过供应，即使没有垄断，障碍也会存在。</p><p class="normal3">It is certainly true that problems arising out of the means of communication are of the utmost importance, and one of the most constructive features of the program of the League of Nations has been the study given to railroad transit and access to the sea. The monopolizing of cables, of ports, fuel stations, mountain passes, canals, straits, river courses, terminals, market places means a good deal more than the enrichment of a group of business men, or the prestige of a government. It means a barrier upon the exchange of news and opinion. But monopoly is not the only barrier. Cost and available supply are even greater ones, for if the cost of travelling or trading is prohibitive, if the demand for facilities exceeds the supply, the barriers exist even without monopoly.</p>

<p class="normal3">一个人的收入多少对他接触周围世界的能力有很大影响。有了钱，他几乎可以克服所有有形的沟通障碍，可以旅行、购买书籍和期刊，并关注世界上几乎所有已知的事实。个人收入和社会收入决定了可能的沟通量。但人们的想法决定了收入的用途，而这反过来又会影响他们长期的收入。因此，也存在限制，尽管这些限制是真实存在的，因为它们往往是自我强加和自我放纵的。</p><p class="normal3">The size of a man's income has considerable effect on his access to the world beyond his neighborhood. With money he can overcome almost every tangible obstacle of communication, he can travel, buy books and periodicals, and bring within the range of his attention almost any known fact of the world. The income of the individual, and the income of the community determine the amount of communication that is possible. But men's ideas determine how that income shall be spent, and that in turn affects in the long run the amount of income they will have. Thus also there are limitations, none the less real, because they are often self-imposed and self-indulgent.</p>
<p class="normal3">有一部分主权人士把大部分的闲暇时间和闲钱都花在开车和比较汽车、桥牌和事后分析、电影和通俗小说上，总是和同样的人交谈，就同样的老话题进行细微的改动。他们不能说真的遭受审查或保密、高昂的费用或沟通困难的折磨。他们患有贫血症，对人类世界缺乏兴趣和好奇心。他们没有接触外部世界的问题。有趣的世界在等着他们去探索，但他们却不进去。</p><p class="normal3">There are portions of the sovereign people who spend most of their spare time and spare money on motoring and comparing motor cars, on bridge-whist and post-mortems, on moving-pictures and potboilers, talking always to the same people with minute variations on the same old themes. They cannot really be said to suffer from censorship, or secrecy, the high cost or the difficulty of communication. They suffer from anemia, from lack of appetite and curiosity for the human scene. Theirs is no problem of access to the world outside. Worlds of interest are waiting for them to explore, and they do not enter.</p>
<p class="normal3">他们像被牵着走一样，按照自己社交圈子里的法律和信条，在固定的熟人圈子内活动。在男人中，在生意场上、在俱乐部和吸烟车厢里的谈话圈子比他们所属的圈子要广。在女人中，社交圈子和谈话圈子往往几乎相同。从阅读、演讲和谈话圈子中得到的想法汇聚在社交圈子里，被整理、接受、拒绝、判断和认可。在讨论的每个阶段，最终都会决定哪些权威和哪些信息来源是可以接受的，哪些不可以。</p><p class="normal3">They move, as if on a leash, within a fixed radius of acquaintances according to the law and the gospel of their social set. Among men the circle of talk in business and at the club and in the smoking car is wider than the set to which they belong. Among women the social set and the circle of talk are frequently almost identical. It is in the social set that ideas derived from reading and lectures and from the circle of talk converge, are sorted out, accepted, rejected, judged and sanctioned. There it is finally decided in each phase of a discussion which authorities and which sources of information are admissible, and which not.</p>
<p class="normal3">我们的社会群体由“人们在说”这句话中的人组成；他们的认可对我们来说最为重要。在大城市里，兴趣广泛、行动自如的男男女女，社会群体并没有如此严格的界定。但即使在大城市，也有社区和村庄，里面有自给自足的社会群体。在较小的社区里，从早餐后到晚餐前，可能会有更自由的流动，更真诚的团契。但尽管如此，很少有人不知道他们真正属于哪个群体，哪个不属于。</p><p class="normal3">Our social set consists of those who figure as people in the phrase "people are saying"; they are the people whose approval matters most intimately to us. In big cities among men and women of wide interests and with the means for moving about, the social set is not so rigidly defined. But even in big cities, there are quarters and nests of villages containing self-sufficing social sets. In smaller communities there may exist a freer circulation, a more genuine fellowship from after breakfast to before dinner. But few people do not know, nevertheless, which set they really belong to, and which not.</p>
<p class="normal3">通常，社会阶层的显著特征是假定子女可以通婚。与阶层外的人通婚至少需要一段时间的犹豫，然后才能批准订婚。每个社会阶层都对自己在社会阶层等级中的相对位置有着相当清晰的认识。在同一级别的阶层之间，交往很容易，个人很快被接受，热情好客是正常的，不会感到尴尬。但在“较高”或“较低”阶层之间的接触中，总是存在着相互的犹豫、淡淡的不适和对差异的意识。可以肯定的是，在像美国这样的社会中，个人可以相当自由地从一个阶层转移到另一个阶层，特别是在没有种族障碍、经济地位变化如此迅速的地方。</p><p class="normal3">Usually the distinguishing mark of a social set is the presumption that the children may intermarry. To marry outside the set involves, at the very least, a moment of doubt before the engagement can be approved. Each social set has a fairly clear picture of its relative position in the hierarchy of social sets. Between sets at the same level, association is easy, individuals are quickly accepted, hospitality is normal and unembarrassed. But in contact between sets that are "higher" or "lower," there is always reciprocal hesitation, a faint malaise, and a consciousness of difference. To be sure in a society like that of the United States, individuals move somewhat freely out of one set into another, especially where there is no racial barrier and where economic position changes so rapidly.</p>
<p class="normal3">然而，经济地位并不是用收入多少来衡量的。因为至少在第一代人中，决定社会地位的不是收入，而是一个人的工作性质，而这可能需要一两代人的时间才能从家庭传统中消失。因此，银行、法律、医学、公用事业、报纸、教会、大型零售、经纪、制造业的社会价值与推销、监管、专业技术工作、护理、学校教学、店铺管理不同；而这些职业与管道工、司机、裁缝、分包或速记员的社会价值又不同，就像这些职业与管家、女仆、电影操作员或火车司机不同一样。然而，财务回报并不一定与这些等级相一致。</p><p class="normal3">Economic position, however, is not measured by the amount of income. For in the first generation, at least, it is not income that determines social standing, but the character of a man's work, and it may take a generation or two before this fades out of the family tradition. Thus banking, law, medicine, public utilities, newspapers, the church, large retailing, brokerage, manufacture, are rated at a different social value from salesmanship, superintendence, expert technical work, nursing, school teaching, shop keeping; and those, in turn, are rated as differently from plumbing, being a chauffeur, dressmaking, subcontracting, or stenography, as these are from being a butler, lady's maid, a moving picture operator, or a locomotive engineer. And yet the financial return does not necessarily coincide with these gradations.</p>

<p class="normal3">无论入会标准如何，社会群体一旦形成，就不仅仅是一个经济阶层，而更接近于一个生物氏族。成员资格与爱情、婚姻和孩子密切相关，或者更确切地说，与其中涉及的态度和愿望密切相关。因此，在社会群体中，意见与家庭传统、体面、礼节、尊严、品味和形式等准则相冲突，这些准则构成了社会群体的自我形象，这一形象被刻意植入孩子们的心中。在这幅形象中，很大一部分空间被默许为一个权威版本，即每个群体在内心被要求接受为其他群体的社会地位。越是庸俗的人，越是要求外在地表达应有的尊重，其他人则体面而敏感地对自己知道这种尊重是无形存在的保持沉默。但是，当发生婚姻、战争或社会动乱时，这种认识就会变得明显，成为特罗特所称的群体本能之下的一大堆倾向的集合。</p><p class="normal3">Whatever the tests of admission, the social set when formed is not a mere economic class, but something which more nearly resembles a biological clan. Membership is intimately connected with love, marriage and children, or, to speak more exactly, with the attitudes and desires that are involved. In the social set, therefore, opinions encounter the canons of Family Tradition, Respectability, Propriety, Dignity, Taste and Form, which make up the social set's picture of itself, a picture assiduously implanted in the children. In this picture a large space is tacitly given to an authorized version of what each set is called upon inwardly to accept as the social standing of the others. The more vulgar press for an outward expression of the deference due, the others are decently and sensitively silent about their own knowledge that such deference invisibly exists. But that knowledge, becoming overt when there is a marriage, a war, or a social upheaval, is the nexus of a large bundle of dispositions classified by Trotter under the general term instinct of the herd.</p>
<p class="normal3">在每个社会团体中，都有像《纯真年代》中的范德卢顿夫妇和曼森·明戈特夫人那样的预言家，他们被公认为该社会模式的守护者和解释者。他们说，如果范德卢顿夫妇接纳你，你就成功了。他们邀请你参加他们的活动是到达和地位的崇高标志。大学社团的选举经过仔细的分级，等级普遍接受，决定了谁在大学里名列前茅。肩负最终优生责任的社会领袖特别敏感。他们不仅必须密切注意是什么造就了他们团体的完整性，而且还必须培养一种特殊的天赋，了解其他社会团体在做什么。他们充当着某种外交部的角色。当一个团体的大多数成员都自满地生活在这个团体中，从所有实际目的来看，都把它视为世界时，社会领袖必须将对自己团体解剖结构的深入了解与对其在团体等级制度中地位的持久意识结合起来。</p><p class="normal3">Within each social set there are augurs like the van der Luydens and Mrs. Manson Mingott in "The Age of Innocence," who are recognized as the custodians and the interpreters of its social pattern. You are made, they say, if the van der Luydens take you up. The invitations to their functions are the high sign of arrival and status. The elections to college societies, carefully graded and the gradations universally accepted, determine who is who in college. The social leaders, weighted with the ultimate eugenic responsibility, are peculiarly sensitive. Not only must they be watchfully aware of what makes for the integrity of their set, but they have to cultivate a special gift for knowing what other social sets are doing. They act as a kind of ministry of foreign affairs. Where most of the members of a set live complacently within the set, regarding it for all practical purposes as the world, the social leaders must combine an intimate knowledge of the anatomy of their own set with a persistent sense of its place in the hierarchy of sets.</p>
<p class="normal3">事实上，社会阶层是由社会领袖们团结在一起的。在任何一个层面上，都有一些几乎可以称为社会领袖的社会群体。但从纵向上看，社会的实际团结，就其通过社会联系团结在一起而言，是由那些经常被怀疑的例外人士完成的，他们就像《纯真年代》中的朱利叶斯·博福特和埃伦·奥兰斯卡一样进进出出。因此，建立了从一个群体到另一个群体的个人渠道，塔德的模仿定律就是通过这些渠道发挥作用的。但对于大部分人口来说，没有这样的渠道。对他们来说，社会的专利描述和上流社会的动态画面必须发挥作用。他们可能会发展出自己的社会阶层，几乎不被人注意，就像黑人和“外国人”一样，但在那些始终认为自己是“国家”的被同化的群众中，尽管群体之间存在很大的分离性，但仍存在着各种各样的个人联系，标准就是通过这些联系流通的。</p><p class="normal3">The hierarchy, in fact, is bound together by the social leaders. At any one level there is something which might almost be called a social set of the social leaders. But vertically the actual binding together of society, in so far as it is bound together at all by social contact, is accomplished by those exceptional people, frequently suspect, who like Julius Beaufort and Ellen Olenska in "The Age of Innocence" move in and out. Thus there come to be established personal channels from one set to another, through which Tarde's laws of imitation operate. But for large sections of the population there are no such channels. For them the patented accounts of society and the moving pictures of high life have to serve. They may develop a social hierarchy of their own, almost unnoticed, as have the Negroes and the "foreign element," but among that assimilated mass which always considers itself the "nation," there is in spite of the great separateness of sets, a variety of personal contacts through which a circulation of standards takes place.</p>
<p class="normal3">有些圈子的位置恰到好处，以至于成为罗斯教授所说的“传统文化的辐射点”。因此，社会地位较高的人可能会被社会地位较低的人模仿，掌权者可能会被下属模仿，成功的人可能会被不太成功的人模仿，富人可能会被穷人模仿，城市可能会被乡村模仿。但模仿并不止于边界。强大的、社会地位较高的、成功的、富有的城市社会阶层在整个西半球基本上是国际性的，在许多方面，伦敦是它的中心。它的成员包括世界上最有影响力的人，包括外交阶层、高级金融界、陆军和海军的上层圈子、一些教会的王子、一些大报的老板，以及他们的妻子、母亲和女儿，她们挥舞着邀请权杖。它既是一个伟大的谈话圈子，也是一个真正的社交圈子。但它的重要性来自于这样一个事实：在这里，公共事务和私人事务之间的区别终于几乎消失了。这个群体的私事就是公共事务，公共事务就是他们的私事，通常是他们的家庭事务。正如哲学家所说，玛格特·阿斯奎斯的禁锢与皇室的禁锢一样，与关税法案或议会辩论处于同一个话语领域。</p><p class="normal3">Some of the sets are so placed that they become what Professor Ross has called "radiant points of conventionality." Thus the social superior is likely to be imitated by the social inferior, the holder of power is imitated by subordinates, the more successful by the less successful, the rich by the poor, the city by the country. But imitation does not stop at frontiers. The powerful, socially superior, successful, rich, urban social set is fundamentally international throughout the western hemisphere, and in many ways London is its center. It counts among its membership the most influential people in the world, containing as it does the diplomatic set, high finance, the upper circles of the army and the navy, some princes of the church, a few great newspaper proprietors, their wives and mothers and daughters who wield the scepter of invitation. It is at once a great circle of talk and a real social set. But its importance comes from the fact that here at last the distinction between public and private affairs practically disappears. The private affairs of this set are public matters, and public matters are its private, often its family affairs. The confinements of Margot Asquith like the confinements of royalty are, as the philosophers say, in much the same universe of discourse as a tariff bill or a parliamentary debate.</p>
<p class="normal3">在政府的很多领域，这个社会阶层并不感兴趣，至少在美国，它对国家政府的控制只是时有时无。但它在外交事务上的权力始终很大，在战争时期，它的威望也大大提高。这很自然，因为这些世界主义者与外界有着大多数人所不具备的联系。他们在首都共进晚餐，他们的民族荣誉感不仅仅是抽象的概念；这是一种被朋友冷落或认可的具体体验。对于戈弗草原的肯尼科特博士来说，温斯顿怎么想并不重要，而埃兹拉·斯托博迪怎么想则很重要，但对于女儿嫁给斯威辛伯爵的明戈特夫人来说，她看望女儿或招待温斯顿本人就很重要了。肯尼科特博士和明戈特夫人都对社会敏感，但明戈特夫人对统治世界的社会阶层敏感，而肯尼科特博士的社会阶层只在 Gopher Prairie 统治。但在影响大社会更大关系的问题上，肯尼科特博士经常会坚持他认为纯粹是他个人的观点，尽管事实上，这种观点已经从上流社会渗透到 Gopher Prairie，在通过地方社会阶层时发生了变化。</p><p class="normal3">There are large areas of governments in which this social set is not interested, and in America, at least, it has exercised only a fluctuating control over the national government. But its power in foreign affairs is always very great, and in war time its prestige is enormously enhanced. That is natural enough because these cosmopolitans have a contact with the outer world that most people do not possess. They have dined with each other in the capitals, and their sense of national honor is no mere abstraction; it is a concrete experience of being snubbed or approved by their friends. To Dr. Kennicott of Gopher Prairie it matters mighty little what Winston thinks and a great deal what Ezra Stowbody thinks, but to Mrs. Mingott with a daughter married to the Earl of Swithin it matters a lot when she visits her daughter, or entertains Winston himself. Dr. Kennicott and Mrs. Mingott are both socially sensitive, but Mrs. Mingott is sensitive to a social set that governs the world, while Dr. Kennicott's social set governs only in Gopher Prairie. But in matters that effect the larger relationships of the Great Society, Dr. Kennicott will often be found holding what he thinks is purely his own opinion, though, as a matter of fact, it has trickled down to Gopher Prairie from High Society, transmuted on its passage through the provincial social sets.</p>

<p class="normal3">试图解释社会组织并不是我们研究的一部分。我们只需要记住，社会群体在我们与世界的精神接触中扮演了多大的角色，它如何决定什么是可接受的，以及如何决定如何判断。每个群体或多或少地自行决定其直接管辖范围内的事务。最重要的是，它决定了判断的具体执行。但判断本身是建立在可能从过去继承下来、从其他社会群体传播或模仿的模式之上的。最高社会群体由那些体现大社会领导地位的人组成。与几乎所有其他社会群体相比，这些社会群体的大部分意见都是关于地方事务的直接意见，在这个最高社会中，战争与和平、社会战略和政治权力的最终分配等重大决定，都是在一个圈子里（至少可能是个人熟人）的亲密经历。</p><p class="normal3">It is no part of our inquiry to attempt an account of the social tissue. We need only fix in mind how big is the part played by the social set in our spiritual contact with the world, how it tends to fix what is admissible, and to determine how it shall be judged. Affairs within its immediate competence each set more or less determines for itself. Above all it determines the detailed administration of the judgment. But the judgment itself is formed on patterns that may be inherited from the past, transmitted or imitated from other social sets. The highest social set consists of those who embody the leadership of the Great Society. As against almost every other social set where the bulk of the opinions are first hand only about local affairs, in this Highest Society the big decisions of war and peace, of social strategy and the ultimate distribution of political power, are intimate experiences within a circle of what, potentially at least, are personal acquaintances.</p>
<p class="normal3">由于位置和接触在决定什么可以看到、听到、阅读和体验，以及什么是可以看、听到、阅读和知道的方面起着如此重要的作用，因此道德判断比建设性思想更为普遍也就不足为奇了。然而，在真正有效的思考中，首要的需要是清算判断，重新获得纯真的眼光，理清感情，保持好奇心和开放的心胸。人类的历史就是这样，大社会规模的政治观点需要一定程度的无私的平静，而这种平静是任何人都很难长期获得的。我们关心公共事务，但又沉浸在自己的私人事务中。我们能抽出时间和注意力来努力不把意见视为理所当然，而且我们经常受到干扰。</p><p class="normal3">Since position and contact play so big a part in determining what can be seen, heard, read, and experienced, as well as what it is permissible to see, hear, read, and know, it is no wonder that moral judgment is so much more common than constructive thought. Yet in truly effective thinking the prime necessity is to liquidate judgments, regain an innocent eye, disentangle feelings, be curious and open-hearted. Man's history being what it is, political opinion on the scale of the Great Society requires an amount of selfless equanimity rarely attainable by any one for any length of time. We are concerned in public affairs, but immersed in our private ones. The time and attention are limited that we can spare for the labor of not taking opinions for granted, and we are subject to constant interruption.</p>

<p class="normal3">当然，我们只能粗略估计人们每天对公共事务的关注程度。但有趣的是，我所研究的三个估计值虽然在不同时间、不同地点、使用不同方法得出，但结果却相当吻合。</p><p class="normal3">NATURALLY it is possible to make a rough estimate only of the amount of attention people give each day to informing themselves about public affairs. Yet it is interesting that three estimates that I have examined agree tolerably well, though they were made at different times, in different places, and by different methods.</p>
<p class="normal3">霍奇基斯和弗兰肯向纽约市 1761 名男女大学生发放了一份问卷，除了少数人之外，其他人都给出了答案。斯科特对芝加哥的四千名知名商人和专业人士进行了问卷调查，收到了两千三百人的回复。在所有回答调查问卷的人中，有百分之七十到百分之七十五的人认为他们每天花一刻钟的时间阅读报纸。只有百分之四的芝加哥人猜测他们花的时间少于这个数字，百分之二十五的人猜测他们花的时间更多。在纽约人中，略高于百分之八的人认为他们花在阅读报纸上的时间少于十五分钟，而十七分半钟则更多。</p><p class="normal3">A questionnaire was sent by Hotchkiss and Franken to 1761 men and women college students in New York City, and answers came from all but a few. Scott used a questionnaire on four thousand prominent business and professional men in Chicago and received replies from twenty-three hundred. Between seventy and seventy-five percent of all those who replied to either inquiry thought they spent a quarter of an hour a day reading newspapers. Only four percent of the Chicago group guessed at less than this and twenty-five percent guessed at more. Among the New Yorkers a little over eight percent figured their newspaper reading at less than fifteen minutes, and seventeen and a half at more.</p>
<p class="normal3">很少有人能准确了解十五分钟，所以这些数字不能照字面意思理解。此外，商人、专业人士和大学生大多容易产生一种奇怪的偏见，担心自己在报纸上花费了太多时间，也许还隐约怀疑他们想被人认为是阅读速度快的人。这些数字可以合理地理解为，在选定的群体中，超过四分之三的人对外界印刷新闻的关注程度相当低。</p><p class="normal3">Very few people have an accurate idea of fifteen minutes, so the figures are not to be taken literally. Moreover, business men, professional people, and college students are most of them liable to a curious little bias against appearing to spend too much time over the newspapers, and perhaps also to a faint suspicion of a desire to be known as rapid readers. All that the figures can justly be taken to mean is that over three quarters of those in the selected groups rate rather low the attention they give to printed news of the outer world.</p>
<p class="normal3">这些时间估计值相当好地通过一个不太主观的测试得到了证实。斯科特问芝加哥人每天读多少份报纸，他得到的答案是</p><p class="normal3">These time estimates are fairly well confirmed by a test which is less subjective. Scott asked his Chicagoans how many papers they read each day, and was told that</p>

<p class="normal3">更难猜测时间是如何分配的。这些大学生被要求说出“最让你感兴趣的五个专题”。将近 20% 的人投票给“一般新闻”，将近 15% 的人投票给社论，将近 12% 的人投票给“政治”，8% 多一点的人投票给金融，停战两年后，6% 多一点的人投票给外国新闻，3.5% 的人投票给当地新闻，近 3% 的人投票给商业新闻，而只有四分之一的人投票给“劳工”新闻。还有一部分人说他们最感兴趣的是体育、专题文章、戏剧、广告、卡通、书评、“准确性”、音乐、“道德基调”、社会、简洁、艺术、故事、航运、学校新闻、“时事新闻”、印刷品。除了这些之外，大约 67.5% 的人选择最有趣的专题是涉及公共事务的新闻和观点。</p><p class="normal3">It is still more difficult to guess how the time is distributed. The college students were asked to name "the five features which interest you most." Just under twenty percent voted for "general news," just under fifteen for editorials, just under twelve for "politics," a little over eight for finance, not two years after the armistice a little over six for foreign news, three and a half for local, nearly three for business, and a quarter of one percent for news about "labor." A scattering said they were most interested in sports, special articles, the theatre, advertisements, cartoons, book reviews, "accuracy," music, "ethical tone," society, brevity, art, stories, shipping, school news, "current news," print. Disregarding these, about sixty-seven and a half percent picked as the most interesting features news and opinion that dealt with public affairs.</p>
<p class="normal3">这是一个男女混合的大学生群体。女生比男生对一般新闻、外国新闻、地方新闻、政治、社论、戏剧、音乐、艺术、故事、漫画、广告和“道德基调”更感兴趣。而男生则更热衷于金融、体育、商业版面、“准确性”和“简洁性”。这些歧视与文化和道德、男子气概和果断的理想过于吻合，让人不禁怀疑这些回答的绝对客观性。</p><p class="normal3">This was a mixed college group. The girls professed greater interest than the boys in general news, foreign news, local news, politics, editorials, the theatre, music, art, stories, cartoons, advertisements, and "ethical tone." The boys on the other hand were more absorbed in finance, sports, business page, "accuracy" and "brevity." These discriminations correspond a little too closely with the ideals of what is cultured and moral, manly and decisive, not to make one suspect the utter objectivity of the replies.</p>
<p class="normal3">然而，他们与斯科特的芝加哥商界和专业人士的回答非常吻合。他们被问到的不是他们最感兴趣的内容，而是他们为什么喜欢这份报纸而不是另一份。近 71% 的人有意识地根据当地新闻（17.8%）、政治新闻（15.8%）、金融新闻（11.3%）、外国新闻（9.5%）、综合新闻（7.2%）或社论新闻（9%）来选择报纸。另外 30% 的人根据与公共事务无关的理由来选择报纸。从不到七成的人根据道德基调来选择报纸，到最关心幽默的百分之二十的人，不一而足。</p><p class="normal3">Yet they agree fairly well with the replies of Scott's Chicago business and professional men. They were asked, not what features interested them most, but why they preferred one newspaper to another. Nearly seventy-one percent based their conscious preference on local news (17.8%), or political (15.8%) or financial (11.3%), or foreign (9.5%), or general (7.2%), or editorials (9%). The other thirty percent decided on grounds not connected with public affairs. They ranged from not quite seven who decided for ethical tone, down to one twentieth of one percent who cared most about humor.</p>
<p class="normal3">这些偏好与报纸为各种主题提供的版面如何对应？遗憾的是，在进行问卷调查时，没有收集到芝加哥和纽约小组阅读的报纸的这方面数据。但威尔科克斯在二十多年前做了一个有趣的分析。他研究了十四个大城市的一百一十份报纸，并对九千多栏内容进行了分类。</p><p class="normal3">How do these preferences correspond with the space given by newspapers to various subjects? Unfortunately there are no data collected on this point for the newspapers read by the Chicago and New York groups at the time the questionnaires were made. But there is an interesting analysis made over twenty years ago by Wilcox. He studied one hundred and ten newspapers in fourteen large cities, and classified the subject matter of over nine thousand columns.</p>

<p class="normal3">在这个修改后的表格中，如果把可能涉及公共事务的项目加起来，也就是战争、外交、政治、杂项、商业新闻和观点，你会发现，1900 年编辑的版面中，共有 76.5% 的篇幅用于描述 1916 年芝加哥商人偏爱某份报纸的 70.6% 的原因，以及 1920 年 67.5% 的纽约大学学生最感兴趣的五个专题。</p><p class="normal3">In this revised table if you add up the items which may be supposed to deal with public affairs, that is to say war, foreign, political, miscellaneous, business news, and opinion, you find a total of 76.5% of the edited space devoted in 1900 to the 70.6% of reasons given by Chicago business men in 1916 for preferring a particular newspaper, and to the five features which most interested 67.5% of the New York College students in 1920.</p>
<p class="normal3">这似乎表明，今天大城市的商人和大学生的品味仍然或多或少与二十年前大城市报纸编辑的平均判断相符。自那时以来，专题新闻的比例无疑有所增加，报纸的发行量和规模也随之增加。因此，如果你今天能从比大学生或商人和专业人士更典型的群体那里获得准确的答复，你会发现他们花在公共事务上的时间比例更小，版面比例也更小。另一方面，你会发现普通人花在报纸上的时间超过一刻钟，虽然公共事务版面的比例比二十年前要少，但净量却更大。</p><p class="normal3">This would seem to show that the tastes of business men and college students in big cities to-day still correspond more or less to the averaged judgments of newspaper editors in big cities twenty years ago. Since that time the proportion of features to news has undoubtedly increased, and so has the circulation and the size of newspapers. Therefore, if to-day you could secure accurate replies from more typical groups than college students or business and professional men, you would expect to find a smaller percentage of time devoted to public affairs, as well as a smaller percentage of space. On the other hand you would expect to find that the average man spends more than the quarter of an hour on his newspaper, and that while the percentage of space given to public affairs is less than twenty years ago the net amount is greater.</p>
<p class="normal3">这些数据并不复杂。它们只是帮助我们更加具体地了解每天为获取我们的观点数据所付出的努力。当然，报纸不是唯一的手段，但肯定是主要的手段。杂志、公共论坛、肖托夸、教堂、政治集会、工会会议、妇女俱乐部和电影院的新闻连续剧补充了新闻。但从最有利的估计来看，我们任何人每天直接接触来自看不见的环境的信息的时间都很短。</p><p class="normal3">No elaborate deductions are to be drawn from these figures. They help merely to make somewhat more concrete our notions of the effort that goes day by day into acquiring the data of our opinions. The newspapers are, of course, not the only means, but they are certainly the principal ones. Magazines, the public forum, the chautauqua, the church, political gatherings, trade union meetings, women's clubs, and news serials in the moving picture houses supplement the press. But taking it all at the most favorable estimate, the time each day is small when any of us is directly exposed to information from our unseen environment.</p>

<p class="normal3">"Washington, Dec. 23—A statement charging Japanese military authorities with deeds more 'frightful and barbarous' than anything ever alleged to have occurred in Belgium during the war was issued here to-day by the Korean Commission, based, the Commission said, on authentic reports received by it from Manchuria."</p>

<p class="normal3">在这里，目击者向“真实报道”的制作者报告，而他们的准确性无人知晓；而制作者又将报告传送给五千英里外的一个委员会。委员会准备一份声明，可能太长而无法发表，记者从中挑选出一份三英寸半长的印刷品。必须以一种让读者判断新闻有多大分量的方式表达其含义。</p><p class="normal3">Here eyewitnesses, their accuracy unknown, report to the makers of 'authentic reports'; they in turn transmit these to a commission five thousand miles away. It prepares a statement, probably much too long for publication, from which a correspondent culls an item of print three and a half inches long. The meaning has to be telescoped in such a way as to permit the reader to judge how much weight to give to the news.</p>
<p class="normal3">令人怀疑的是，一位文笔大师能否将完全公正所要求的所有真实要素都浓缩到一篇有关几个月来在朝鲜发生的事情的百字报道中。因为语言绝不是表达意义的完美载体。词语就像货币一样，被反复使用，今天唤起一组图像，明天又唤起另一组图像。完全无法确定同一个词语在读者心中唤起的想法与在记者心中唤起的想法完全相同。从理论上讲，如果每个事实和每个关系都有一个独特的名称，并且每个人都同意这些名称，那么就可以进行无误解的交流。在精密科学中，有一种实现这一理想的方法，这也是为什么在所有形式的全球合作中，科学探究是最有效的部分原因。</p><p class="normal3">It is doubtful whether a supreme master of style could pack all the elements of truth that complete justice would demand into a hundred word account of what had happened in Korea during the course of several months. For language is by no means a perfect vehicle of meanings. Words, like currency, are turned over and over again, to evoke one set of images to-day, another to-morrow. There is no certainty whatever that the same word will call out exactly the same idea in the reader's mind as it did in the reporter's. Theoretically, if each fact and each relation had a name that was unique, and if everyone had agreed on the names, it would be possible to communicate without misunderstanding. In the exact sciences there is an approach to this ideal, and that is part of the reason why of all forms of world-wide cooperation, scientific inquiry is the most effective.</p>
<p class="normal3">人们所能掌握的词汇比他们所能表达的想法要少，正如让·保罗所说，语言是一本褪色的隐喻词典。记者面对着五十万读者，而他对读者的印象却很模糊，演讲者的话传遍了偏远的村庄和海外，他们不能指望几句话就能表达出全部的意思。“劳合·乔治的话被误解了，传达得也很糟糕，”白里安先生在众议院说，“似乎让泛德主义者觉得是时候开始行动了。”英国首相用英语向全世界发表讲话，用自己的语言向各种各样的人表达自己的意思，这些人会从这些话中看到自己的意思。无论他说的话多么丰富或微妙——或者说，他说的话越丰富、越微妙，他的意思就越会受到损害，因为它会被冲进标准语言中，然后再传播到外来人的头脑中。</p><p class="normal3">Men command fewer words than they have ideas to express, and language, as Jean Paul said, is a dictionary of faded metaphors. The journalist addressing half a million readers of whom he has only a dim picture, the speaker whose words are flashed to remote villages and overseas, cannot hope that a few phrases will carry the whole burden of their meaning. "The words of Lloyd George, badly understood and badly transmitted," said M. Briand to the Chamber of Deputies, "seemed to give the Pan-Germanists the idea that the time had come to start something." A British Prime Minister, speaking in English to the whole attentive world, speaks his own meaning in his own words to all kinds of people who will see their meaning in those words. No matter how rich or subtle—or rather the more rich and the more subtle that which he has to say, the more his meaning will suffer as it is sluiced into standard speech and then distributed again among alien minds.</p>
<p class="normal3">1921 年 5 月，上西里西亚的科尔凡蒂起义导致英法关系紧张。《曼彻斯特卫报》的伦敦通讯（1921 年 5 月 20 日）包含以下内容：</p><p class="normal3">In May of 1921, relations between England and France were strained by the insurrection of M. Korfanty in Upper Silesia. The London Correspondence of the Manchester Guardian (May 20, 1921), contained the following item:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">“法语和英语的词语交流。”</p>
<p class="normal3">“在熟悉法国人生活方式和性格的人士中，我发现一种倾向，认为在目前的危机中，我们的新闻界和公众舆论表现出了过度的敏感，法国媒体的语言生动活泼，有时甚至有些过激。一位消息灵通的中立观察家以以下方式向我提出了这一观点。</p>
<p class="normal3">“词语就像金钱一样，是价值的象征。因此，它们代表着意义，就像金钱一样，它们的代表价值会上下波动。法语单词“etonnant”被 Bossuet 用在了具有可怕意义的词上，但如今它已经失去了意义。英语单词“awful”也有类似的情况。有些国家天生倾向于轻描淡写，而有些国家则倾向于夸大其词。英国人汤米所说的不健康的地方，只有意大利士兵才能用丰富的词汇和热情的模仿来描述。轻描淡写的国家保持了其语言货币的健全。夸大其词的国家则遭受语言通货膨胀的困扰。</p>
<p class="normal3">“‘杰出的学者’、‘聪明的作家’等表达必须翻译成法语‘伟大的学者’、‘精致的大师’。这只是一个交换问题，就像在法国，一英镑可以兑换 46 法郎，但人们知道这不会增加其在国内的价值。阅读法国媒体的英国人应该努力想出一种类似于银行家将法郎兑换回英镑的心理操作，同时不要忘记，虽然在正常情况下，兑换的金额是 25，但由于战争，现在兑换的金额是 46。因为战争不仅影响货币兑换，也影响词汇兑换。</p>
<p class="normal3">“我希望这一论点能够起到双向作用，法国人不会忽视英国人的沉默寡言和他们丰富的表达能力具有同等的价值。”</p>
</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">"The Franco-English Exchange in Words.</p>
<p class="normal3">"In quarters well acquainted with French ways and character I find a tendency to think that undue sensibility has been shown by our press and public opinion in the lively and at times intemperate language of the French press through the present crisis. The point was put to me by a well-informed neutral observer in the following manner.</p>
<p class="normal3">"Words, like money, are tokens of value. They represent meaning, therefore, and just as money, their representative value goes up and down. The French word 'etonnant' was used by Bossuet with a terrible weight of meaning which it has lost to-day. A similar thing can be observed with the English word 'awful.' Some nations constitutionally tend to understate, others to overstate. What the British Tommy called an unhealthy place could only be described by an Italian soldier by means of a rich vocabulary aided with an exuberant mimicry. Nations that understate keep their word-currency sound. Nations that overstate suffer from inflation in their language.</p>
<p class="normal3">"Expressions such as 'a distinguished scholar,' 'a clever writer,' must be translated into French as 'a great savant,' 'an exquisite master.' It is a mere matter of exchange, just as in France one pound pays 46 francs, and yet one knows that that does not increase its value at home. Englishmen reading the French press should endeavour to work out a mental operation similar to that of the banker who puts back francs into pounds, and not forget in so doing that while in normal times the change was 25 it is now 46 on account of the war. For there is a war fluctuation on word exchanges as well as on money exchanges.</p>
<p class="normal3">"The argument, one hopes, works both ways, and Frenchmen do not fail to realize that there is as much value behind English reticence as behind their own exuberance of expression."</p>

<p class="normal3">数百万正在观察他的人几乎完全不会读书。还有数百万人能读懂文字，但不能理解文字。在那些既能读懂文字的人中，我们可以假设有四分之三的人每天有半个小时的时间可以花在阅读上。对他们来说，这样获得的文字是一系列思想的线索，最终可能会产生难以言喻的后果。我们让阅读的文字唤起的思想必然构成我们意见的原始数据的大部分。世界是巨大的，与我们有关的情况是错综复杂的，信息很少，意见的大部分必须在想象中构建。</p><p class="normal3">Millions of those who are watching him can read hardly at all. Millions more can read the words but cannot understand them. Of those who can both read and understand, a good three-quarters we may assume have some part of half an hour a day to spare for the subject. To them the words so acquired are the cue for a whole train of ideas on which ultimately a vote of untold consequences may be based. Necessarily the ideas which we allow the words we read to evoke form the biggest part of the original data of our opinions. The world is vast, the situations that concern us are intricate, the messages are few, the biggest part of opinion must be constructed in the imagination.</p>
<p class="normal3">当我们使用“墨西哥”这个词时，它会在纽约居民的脑海中唤起什么样的画面？很可能，它是沙子、仙人掌、油井、油贩、喝朗姆酒的印第安人、留着蓬乱胡须、拥有主权的暴躁老骑士的混合体，或者也许是让·雅克式的田园牧歌式的农民，他们被烟雾缭绕的工业主义前景所困扰，为人权而战。“日本”这个词会让人想起什么？是一群斜眼黄种人，周围环绕着黄祸、新娘、扇子、武士、万岁、艺术和樱花吗？还是“外星人”这个词？根据 1920 年一组新英格兰大学生的写作，外星人是这样的：</p><p class="normal3">When we use the word "Mexico" what picture does it evoke in a resident of New York? Likely as not, it is some composite of sand, cactus, oil wells, greasers, rum-drinking Indians, testy old cavaliers flourishing whiskers and sovereignty, or perhaps an idyllic peasantry à la Jean Jacques, assailed by the prospect of smoky industrialism, and fighting for the Rights of Man. What does the word "Japan" evoke? Is it a vague horde of slant-eyed yellow men, surrounded by Yellow Perils, picture brides, fans, Samurai, banzais, art, and cherry blossoms? Or the word "alien"? According to a group of New England college students, writing in the year 1920, an alien was the following:</p>
<p class="normal3">“对这个国家怀有敌意的人。”</p><p class="normal3">"A person hostile to this country."</p>
<p class="normal3">“一个反对政府的人。”</p><p class="normal3">"A person against the government."</p>
<p class="normal3">“站在对立面的人。”</p><p class="normal3">"A person who is on the opposite side."</p>
<p class="normal3">“来自一个不友好国家的公民。”</p><p class="normal3">"A native of an unfriendly country."</p>
<p class="normal3">“一个正在打仗的外国人。”</p><p class="normal3">"A foreigner at war."</p>
<p class="normal3">“试图危害其所在国家的外国人。”</p><p class="normal3">"A foreigner who tries to do harm to the country he is in."</p>
<p class="normal3">“来自异乡的敌人。”</p><p class="normal3">"An enemy from a foreign land."</p>
<p class="normal3">“一个人对抗一个国家。”等等……</p><p class="normal3">"A person against a country." etc….</p>
<p class="normal3">然而，“外来”一词是一个非常准确的法律术语，比主权、独立、国家荣誉、权利、防御、侵略、帝国主义、资本主义、社会主义等词语准确得多，对于这些词语，我们很容易表示“支持”或“反对”。</p><p class="normal3">Yet the word alien is an unusually exact legal term, far more exact than words like sovereignty, independence, national honor, rights, defense, aggression, imperialism, capitalism, socialism, about which we so readily take sides "for" or "against."</p>

<p class="normal3">能够区分表面的相似性、注意差异并欣赏多样性的能力就是头脑的清醒。这是一种相对的能力。然而，清醒程度的差异是巨大的，比如新生儿和正在研究花朵的植物学家之间的差异。对婴儿来说，他自己的脚趾、父亲的手表、桌上的灯、天上的月亮和一本漂亮的亮黄色居伊·德·莫泊桑的作品之间几乎没有什么区别。对许多联盟俱乐部的成员来说，民主党人、社会主义者、无政府主义者和窃贼之间没有明显的区别，而对一个非常老练的无政府主义者来说，巴枯宁、托尔斯泰和克鲁泡特金之间有着天壤之别。这些例子表明，在婴儿中建立对莫泊桑的正确舆论，或在联盟俱乐部中建立对民主党人的正确舆论是多么困难。</p><p class="normal3">The power to dissociate superficial analogies, attend to differences and appreciate variety is lucidity of mind. It is a relative faculty. Yet the differences in lucidity are extensive, say as between a newly born infant and a botanist examining a flower. To the infant there is precious little difference between his own toes, his father's watch, the lamp on the table, the moon in the sky, and a nice bright yellow edition of Guy de Maupassant. To many a member of the Union League Club there is no remarkable difference between a Democrat, a Socialist, an anarchist, and a burglar, while to a highly sophisticated anarchist there is a whole universe of difference between Bakunin, Tolstoi, and Kropotkin. These examples show how difficult it might be to secure a sound public opinion about de Maupassant among babies, or about Democrats in the Union League Club.</p>
<p class="normal3">一个仅仅乘坐别人汽车的人，可能无法比福特、出租车和汽车更细致地辨别。但是，如果这个人拥有并驾驶汽车，让他像心理分析学家所说的那样，将自己的性欲投射到汽车上，他就会通过观察一个街区外的汽车尾部来描述化油器的不同。这就是为什么当谈话从“一般话题”转向一个人自己的爱好时，人们常常会感到如此轻松。这就像从客厅里的风景转向户外的耕地。这是画家对自己想象中应该看到的事物的不经意记忆的情绪反应的描绘之后，回到三维世界。</p><p class="normal3">A man who merely rides in other people's automobiles may not rise to finer discrimination than between a Ford, a taxicab, and an automobile. But let that same man own a car and drive it, let him, as the psychoanalysts would say, project his libido upon automobiles, and he will describe a difference in carburetors by looking at the rear end of a car a city block away. That is why it is often such a relief when the talk turns from "general topics" to a man's own hobby. It is like turning from the landscape in the parlor to the ploughed field outdoors. It is a return to the three dimensional world, after a sojourn in the painter's portrayal of his own emotional response to his own inattentive memory of what he imagines he ought to have seen.</p>
<p class="normal3">费伦齐说，我们很容易识别出两个只是部分相似的事物：儿童比成人更容易识别，原始或停滞的思维比成熟的思维更容易识别。意识在儿童身上首次出现时，似乎是一种难以控制的感觉混合体。儿童没有时间感，几乎没有空间感，他们伸手去拿吊灯就像伸手去拿母亲的乳房一样自信，一开始的期待也几乎相同。功能只是非常缓慢地才定义自己。对于完全没有经验的人来说，这是一个连贯而无差别的世界，正如有人谈到一个哲学家学派时所说的那样，在这个世界上，所有事实都是生来自由和平等的。那些属于这个世界的事实尚未与那些碰巧在意识流中并排的事实分开。</p><p class="normal3">We easily identify, says Ferenczi, two only partially similar things: the child more easily than the adult, the primitive or arrested mind more readily than the mature. As it first appears in the child, consciousness seems to be an unmanageable mixture of sensations. The child has no sense of time, and almost none of space, it reaches for the chandelier with the same confidence that it reaches for its mother's breast, and at first with almost the same expectation. Only very gradually does function define itself. To complete inexperience this is a coherent and undifferentiated world, in which, as someone has said of a school of philosophers, all facts are born free and equal. Those facts which belong together in the world have not yet been separated from those which happen to lie side by side in the stream of consciousness.</p>
<p class="normal3">费伦齐说，起初，婴儿通过哭闹得到一些想要的东西。这是“神奇幻觉全能期”。在第二阶段，孩子指向自己想要的东西，然后东西就被给了。“借助神奇的手势获得全能。”后来，孩子学会说话，提出自己想要的东西，并部分成功。“神奇思想和神奇词语期”。每个阶段可能持续存在，但有时会重叠，有时才可见，例如，在那些我们中很少有人完全摆脱的无害迷信中。在每个阶段，部分成功往往会证实这种行为方式，而失败往往会刺激另一种行为方式的发展。许多个人、政党甚至国家似乎很少能超越经验的神奇组织。但在最先进的民族中，更先进的部分，反复失败后的反复试验导致了一项新原则的发明。他们了解到，月亮不会因为向它咆哮而移动。农作物不是靠春节或共和党多数从土壤中长出来的，而是靠阳光、水分、种子、肥料和耕作。</p><p class="normal3">At first, says Ferenczi, the baby gets some of the things it wants by crying for them. This is "the period of magical hallucinatory omnipotence." In its second phase the child points to the things it wants, and they are given to it. "Omnipotence by the help of magic gestures." Later, the child learns to talk, asks for what it wishes, and is partially successful. "The period of magic thoughts and magic words." Each phase may persist for certain situations, though overlaid and only visible at times, as for example, in the little harmless superstitions from which few of us are wholly free. In each phase, partial success tends to confirm that way of acting, while failure tends to stimulate the development of another. Many individuals, parties, and even nations, rarely appear to transcend the magical organization of experience. But in the more advanced sections of the most advanced peoples, trial and error after repeated failure has led to the invention of a new principle. The moon, they learn, is not moved by baying at it. Crops are not raised from the soil by spring festivals or Republican majorities, but by sunlight, moisture, seeds, fertilizer, and cultivation.</p>
<p class="normal3">考虑到费伦齐的反应类别的纯图式价值，我们认为至关重要的品质是区分粗略感知和模糊类比的能力。这种能力已在实验室条件下进行了研究。苏黎世联想研究清楚地表明，轻微的精神疲劳、注意力的内在干扰或外部干扰往往会“降低”反应的质量。非常“平坦”类型的一个例子是叮当联想（猫帽），这是对声音的反应，而不是对刺激词的意义的反应。例如，一项测试显示，在第二组一百次反应中叮当声增加了 9%。现在叮当声几乎是一种重复，是一种非常原始的类比形式。</p><p class="normal3">Allowing for the purely schematic value of Ferenczi's categories of response, the quality which we note as critical is the power to discriminate among crude perceptions and vague analogies. This power has been studied under laboratory conditions. The Zurich Association Studies indicate clearly that slight mental fatigue, an inner disturbance of attention or an external distraction, tend to "flatten" the quality of the response. An example of the very "flat" type is the clang association (cat-hat), a reaction to the sound and not to the sense of the stimulant word. One test, for example, shows a 9% increase of clang in the second series of a hundred reactions. Now the clang is almost a repetition, a very primitive form of analogy.</p>

<p class="normal3">如果实验室相对简单的条件可以如此轻易地消除歧视，那么城市生活又会有什么影响呢？在实验室里，疲劳是相当轻微的，分心也相当微不足道。两者都由受试者的兴趣和自我意识来平衡。然而，如果节拍器的节奏会压抑智力，那么工厂里八到十二个小时的噪音、气味和炎热，或者日复一日的打字机、电话铃声和关门声，会对根据在有轨电车和地铁上阅读的报纸形成的政治判断产生什么影响呢？在喧嚣中，能听到什么不尖叫的声音，在一般的强光中，能看见什么不像电灯一样闪烁的东西吗？城市居民的生活缺乏孤独、安静和安逸。夜晚喧嚣而火热。大城市的人们受到无休止的声音的侵袭，有时猛烈而刺耳，有时陷入未完成的节奏，但永无止境，无情无义。在现代工业主义下，思想在喧嚣中继续进行。如果说它的辨别力往往平淡无奇、愚蠢无比，至少这里有一小部分原因。主权人民在经验和实验都表明思想最困难的情况下决定生死和幸福。当条件使它成为负担时，“无法忍受的思想负担”就是一种负担。当条件有利时，它就不是负担。思考和跳舞一样令人兴奋，同样自然。</p><p class="normal3">If the comparatively simple conditions of a laboratory can so readily flatten out discrimination, what must be the effect of city life? In the laboratory the fatigue is slight enough, the distraction rather trivial. Both are balanced in measure by the subject's interest and self-consciousness. Yet if the beat of a metronome will depress intelligence, what do eight or twelve hours of noise, odor, and heat in a factory, or day upon day among chattering typewriters and telephone bells and slamming doors, do to the political judgments formed on the basis of newspapers read in street-cars and subways? Can anything be heard in the hubbub that does not shriek, or be seen in the general glare that does not flash like an electric sign? The life of the city dweller lacks solitude, silence, ease. The nights are noisy and ablaze. The people of a big city are assaulted by incessant sound, now violent and jagged, now falling into unfinished rhythms, but endless and remorseless. Under modern industrialism thought goes on in a bath of noise. If its discriminations are often flat and foolish, here at least is some small part of the reason. The sovereign people determines life and death and happiness under conditions where experience and experiment alike show thought to be most difficult. "The intolerable burden of thought" is a burden when the conditions make it burdensome. It is no burden when the conditions are favorable. It is as exhilarating to think as it is to dance, and just as natural.</p>
<p class="normal3">每一个从事思考工作的人都知道，他必须在一天中的某些时间里为自己创造一片寂静。但在我们奉承为文明的那种混乱中，公民在最糟糕的条件下从事着危险的政府工作。对这一事实的模糊认识激发了人们争取缩短工作日、延长假期、在工厂和办公室中争取光线、空气、秩序、阳光和尊严的运动。但如果要提高我们生活的智力质量，那仅仅是一个开始。只要这么多工作是无休止的，对工人来说，是漫无目的的例行公事，是一种使用一组肌肉以单调模式进行的自动化，他的整个生活就会趋向于一种自动化，在这种自动化中，除非用雷声宣布，否则没有什么特别的与其他事物的区别。只要他白天甚至晚上都被囚禁在人群中，他的注意力就会闪烁和放松。它不会牢固地坚持并清楚地定义出他是各种烦恼的受害者，在一个需要通风的家庭中，远离繁重的劳作、尖叫的孩子、喧闹的谈话、难以消化的食物、污浊的空气和令人窒息的装饰品。</p><p class="normal3">Every man whose business it is to think knows that he must for part of the day create about himself a pool of silence. But in that helter-skelter which we flatter by the name of civilization, the citizen performs the perilous business of government under the worst possible conditions. A faint recognition of this truth inspires the movement for a shorter work day, for longer vacations, for light, air, order, sunlight and dignity in factories and offices. But if the intellectual quality of our life is to be improved that is only the merest beginning. So long as so many jobs are an endless and, for the worker, an aimless routine, a kind of automatism using one set of muscles in one monotonous pattern, his whole life will tend towards an automatism in which nothing is particularly to be distinguished from anything else unless it is announced with a thunderclap. So long as he is physically imprisoned in crowds by day and even by night his attention will flicker and relax. It will not hold fast and define clearly where he is the victim of all sorts of pother, in a home which needs to be ventilated of its welter of drudgery, shrieking children, raucous assertions, indigestible food, bad air, and suffocating ornament.</p>
<p class="normal3">偶尔，我们也许会走进一栋安静宽敞的建筑，走进一个现代舞台艺术已经消除了干扰的剧院，或者去海边，或者去一个安静的地方，我们会想起我们这个时代的普通城市生活是多么混乱、多么反复无常、多么多余和喧嚣。我们学会理解为什么我们混乱的大脑无法准确把握事物，为什么它们会被标题和流行语所困扰，为什么它们经常无法区分事物或辨别表面上的差异。</p><p class="normal3">Occasionally perhaps we enter a building which is composed and spacious; we go to a theatre where modern stagecraft has cut away distraction, or go to sea, or into a quiet place, and we remember how cluttered, how capricious, how superfluous and clamorous is the ordinary urban life of our time. We learn to understand why our addled minds seize so little with precision, why they are caught up and tossed about in a kind of tarantella by headlines and catch-words, why so often they cannot tell things apart or discern identity in apparent differences.</p>

<p class="normal3">但这种外部的混乱因内部的混乱而变得更加复杂。实验表明，我们所谓的情绪冲突会扰乱联想的速度、准确性和智力质量。以五分之一秒为单位测量，一系列包含中性和热词的一百个刺激可能会显示出 5 到 32 之间的变化，甚至完全没有反应。显然，我们的舆论断断续续地接触着各种各样的情结；野心和经济利益、个人仇恨、种族偏见、阶级感情等等。它们以各种各样的方式扭曲我们的阅读、思考、谈话和行为。</p><p class="normal3">But this external disorder is complicated further by internal. Experiment shows that the speed, the accuracy, and the intellectual quality of association is deranged by what we are taught to call emotional conflicts. Measured in fifths of a second, a series of a hundred stimuli containing both neutral and hot words may show a variation as between 5 and 32 or even a total failure to respond at all. Obviously our public opinion is in intermittent contact with complexes of all sorts; with ambition and economic interest, personal animosity, racial prejudice, class feeling and what not. They distort our reading, our thinking, our talking and our behavior in a great variety of ways.</p>
<p class="normal3">最后，由于意见并不局限于社会普通成员，因为对于选举、宣传和追随者而言，人数就是力量，因此注意力的质量进一步下降。完全文盲、智力低下、严重神经质、营养不良和沮丧的人的数量非常可观，有理由认为，这一数量比我们通常认为的要多得多。因此，在智力上是孩子或野蛮人、生活充满纠结的人、活力耗尽的人、闭门不出的人以及经验上对所讨论问题毫无了解的人中，广泛的民众诉求得以传播。公众舆论之流被他们阻挡在误解的小漩涡中，在那里，它被偏见和牵强的类比所玷污。</p><p class="normal3">And finally since opinions do not stop at the normal members of society, since for the purposes of an election, a propaganda, a following, numbers constitute power, the quality of attention is still further depressed. The mass of absolutely illiterate, of feeble-minded, grossly neurotic, undernourished and frustrated individuals, is very considerable, much more considerable there is reason to think than we generally suppose. Thus a wide popular appeal is circulated among persons who are mentally children or barbarians, people whose lives are a morass of entanglements, people whose vitality is exhausted, shut-in people, and people whose experience has comprehended no factor in the problem under discussion. The stream of public opinion is stopped by them in little eddies of misunderstanding, where it is discolored with prejudice and far fetched analogy.</p>
<p class="normal3">“广泛诉求”考虑了联想的质量，针对的是广泛分布的敏感性。“狭隘”或“特殊”诉求是针对不常见的敏感性。但同一个人对不同的刺激或不同时间的相同刺激的反应可能非常不同。人类的敏感性就像阿尔卑斯山国家。有孤立的山峰，有广阔但分离的高原，还有几乎对全人类都相当连续的更深的地层。因此，敏感性达到那些山峰稀薄大气层的个人，在弗雷格和皮亚诺之间存在着巨大的差异，或者萨塞塔的早期和晚期之间存在着巨大的差异，他们在另一个诉求层面上可能是坚定的共和党人，当他们挨饿和害怕时，与任何其他挨饿和害怕的人没有区别。难怪发行量大的杂志比起其他任何标志更青睐漂亮女孩的脸，漂亮到足以令人着迷，但又足够天真无邪，可以被接受。因为刺激作用的“心理层面”决定了公众是潜在的大群体还是小群体。</p><p class="normal3">A "broad appeal" takes account of the quality of association, and is made to those susceptibilities which are widely distributed. A "narrow" or a "special" appeal is one made to those susceptibilities which are uncommon. But the same individual may respond with very different quality to different stimuli, or to the same stimuli at different times. Human susceptibilities are like an alpine country. There are isolated peaks, there are extensive but separated plateaus, and there are deeper strata which are quite continuous for nearly all mankind. Thus the individuals whose susceptibilities reach the rarefied atmosphere of those peaks where there exists an exquisitive difference between Frege and Peano, or between Sassetta's earlier and later periods, may be good stanch Republicans at another level of appeal, and when they are starving and afraid, indistinguishable from any other starving and frightened person. No wonder that the magazines with the large circulations prefer the face of a pretty girl to any other trade mark, a face, pretty enough to be alluring, but innocent enough to be acceptable. For the "psychic level" on which the stimulus acts determines whether the public is to be potentially a large or a small one.</p>

<p class="normal3">因此，我们的公众舆论所面对的环境受到多种因素的影响，一方面是审查制度和隐私，另一方面是物质和社会障碍，另一方面是注意力不集中、语言贫乏、注意力分散、无意识的情感组合、磨损、暴力和单调。这些限制我们进入该环境的因素，加上事实本身的模糊性和复杂性，阻碍了清晰和公正的认知，用误导性的虚构取代可行的想法，使我们无法对那些有意识地试图误导的人进行充分的制约。</p><p class="normal3">Thus the environment with which our public opinions deal is refracted in many ways, by censorship and privacy at the source, by physical and social barriers at the other end, by scanty attention, by the poverty of language, by distraction, by unconscious constellations of feeling, by wear and tear, violence, monotony. These limitations upon our access to that environment combine with the obscurity and complexity of the facts themselves to thwart clearness and justice of perception, to substitute misleading fictions for workable ideas, and to deprive us of adequate checks upon those who consciously strive to mislead.</p>

<p class="normal3">我们每个人都生活和工作在地球表面的一小部分，活动在一个小圈子里，而我们熟识的人却寥寥无几。对于任何具有广泛影响的公共事件，我们最多只能看到一个阶段和一个方面。对于起草条约、制定法律和发布命令的知名人士来说，情况也是如此，对于那些为他们制定条约、颁布法律、下达命令的人来说也是如此。我们的观点必然会涵盖比我们能够直接观察到的更大的空间、更长的时间范围和更多的事物。因此，它们必须从其他人的报道和我们所能想象的内容中拼凑起来。</p><p class="normal3">Each of us lives and works on a small part of the earth's surface, moves in a small circle, and of these acquaintances knows only a few intimately. Of any public event that has wide effects we see at best only a phase and an aspect. This is as true of the eminent insiders who draft treaties, make laws, and issue orders, as it is of those who have treaties framed for them, laws promulgated to them, orders given at them. Inevitably our opinions cover a bigger space, a longer reach of time, a greater number of things, than we can directly observe. They have, therefore, to be pieced together out of what others have reported and what we can imagine.</p>
<p class="normal3">然而，即使是目击者，带回的也不是一幅朴素的场景图景。经验似乎表明，他自己会把一些东西带到现场，后来又从现场拿走，他想象的事件描述往往是事件的变形。意识中很少有事实似乎只是给出的。意识中的大多数事实似乎都是部分形成的。报告是知者和被知者的共同产物，其中观察者的角色总是有选择性的，而且通常具有创造性。我们看到的事实取决于我们所处的位置和我们眼睛的习惯。</p><p class="normal3">Yet even the eyewitness does not bring back a naéve picture of the scene. For experience seems to show that he himself brings something to the scene which later he takes away from it, that oftener than not what he imagines to be the account of an event is really a transfiguration of it. Few facts in consciousness seem to be merely given. Most facts in consciousness seem to be partly made. A report is the joint product of the knower and known, in which the role of the observer is always selective and usually creative. The facts we see depend on where we are placed, and the habits of our eyes.</p>
<p class="normal3">陌生的场景就像婴儿的世界，“一片繁花似锦、嗡嗡作响的巨大混乱。”约翰·杜威先生说，任何新事物对成年人的冲击都是如此，只要它真的是新奇的。 “我们听不懂的外语总是听起来像胡言乱语，无法确定一组明确、清晰、个性化的声音。拥挤街道上的乡下人、海上的旱鸭子、在复杂游戏中专家之间的比赛中对运动一无所知的人，都是进一步的例子。把一个没有经验的人放在工厂里，一开始，工作对他来说似乎是毫无意义的杂乱无章。众所周知，在来访的陌生人看来，所有来自不同种族的陌生人都长得一样。外来者在羊群中只能感觉到大小或颜色的巨大差异，而牧羊人眼中的每只羊都是完全个性化的。弥漫的模糊和不加区别地移动的吸力是我们听不懂的东西的特征。因此，从事物中获取意义的问题，或者（换句话说）形成简单理解习惯的问题，就是将（1）<i class="calibre10">明确性</i>
 和<i class="calibre10">区别性</i>
 以及（2）<i class="calibre10">一致性</i>
 或<i class="calibre10">稳定性</i>
 的意义引入到原本模糊和摇摆不定的事物中的问题。”</p><p class="normal3">An unfamiliar scene is like the baby's world, "one great, blooming, buzzing confusion." This is the way, says Mr. John Dewey, that any new thing strikes an adult, so far as the thing is really new and strange. "Foreign languages that we do not understand always seem jibberings, babblings, in which it is impossible to fix a definite, clear-cut, individualized group of sounds. The countryman in the crowded street, the landlubber at sea, the ignoramus in sport at a contest between experts in a complicated game, are further instances. Put an inexperienced man in a factory, and at first the work seems to him a meaningless medley. All strangers of another race proverbially look alike to the visiting stranger. Only gross differences of size or color are perceived by an outsider in a flock of sheep, each of which is perfectly individualized to the shepherd. A diffusive blur and an indiscriminately shifting suction characterize what we do not understand. The problem of the acquisition of meaning by things, or (stated in another way) of forming habits of simple apprehension, is thus the problem of introducing (1) <i class="calibre10">definiteness</i>
 and <i class="calibre10">distinction</i>
 and (2) <i class="calibre10">consistency</i>
 or <i class="calibre10">stability</i>
 of meaning into what is otherwise vague and wavering."</p>
<p class="normal3">但引入的明确性和一致性取决于引入者。在后面的一篇文章中，杜威举了一个例子，说明经验丰富的门外汉和化学家对金属一词的定义有多么不同。“光滑、坚硬、光泽和光亮，相对于其大小而言很重……经锤击和拉伸而不断裂、受热变软、受冷变硬、保持既定形状和形式、抗压和腐蚀等实用特性可能都包括在内”门外汉的定义中。但化学家很可能会忽略这些美学和实用特性，将金属定义为“任何与氧结合形成碱的化学元素”。</p><p class="normal3">But the kind of definiteness and consistency introduced depends upon who introduces them. In a later passage Dewey gives an example of how differently an experienced layman and a chemist might define the word metal. "Smoothness, hardness, glossiness, and brilliancy, heavy weight for its size … the serviceable properties of capacity for being hammered and pulled without breaking, of being softened by heat and hardened by cold, of retaining the shape and form given, of resistance to pressure and decay, would probably be included" in the layman's definition. But the chemist would likely as not ignore these esthetic and utilitarian qualities, and define a metal as "any chemical element that enters into combination with oxygen so as to form a base."</p>
<p class="normal3">在大多数情况下，我们并不是先观察，然后定义，而是先定义，然后观察。在外部世界繁华喧闹的混乱中，我们挑选出我们的文化已经为我们定义的东西，我们倾向于以我们的文化为我们定型的形式来感知我们所挑选的东西。在巴黎集会解决人类事务的伟人中，有多少人能够看到他们周围的欧洲，而不是他们对欧洲的承诺？如果有人能看透克列孟梭先生的思想，他会发现那里有 1919 年欧洲的形象，还是在长期好斗的存在中积累和硬化的大量刻板思想？他看到的是 1919 年的德国人，还是他自 1871 年以来学会看到的德国类型？他看到了这种类型，在从德国传来的报道中，他把那些符合他心中类型的报道放在了心里。如果一个容克分子大声咆哮，那他就是真正的德国人；如果一个劳工领袖承认帝国的罪行，那他就不是真正的德国人。</p><p class="normal3">For the most part we do not first see, and then define, we define first and then see. In the great blooming, buzzing confusion of the outer world we pick out what our culture has already defined for us, and we tend to perceive that which we have picked out in the form stereotyped for us by our culture. Of the great men who assembled at Paris to settle the affairs of mankind, how many were there who were able to see much of the Europe about them, rather than their commitments about Europe? Could anyone have penetrated the mind of M. Clemenceau, would he have found there images of the Europe of 1919, or a great sediment of stereotyped ideas accumulated and hardened in a long and pugnacious existence? Did he see the Germans of 1919, or the German type as he had learned to see it since 1871? He saw the type, and among the reports that came to him from Germany, he took to heart those reports, and, it seems, those only, which fitted the type that was in his mind. If a junker blustered, that was an authentic German; if a labor leader confessed the guilt of the empire, he was not an authentic German.</p>
<p class="normal3">在哥廷根举行的心理学大会上，一群可能受过训练的观察员进行了一项有趣的实验。</p><p class="normal3">At a Congress of Psychology in Göttingen an interesting experiment was made with a crowd of presumably trained observers.</p>
<blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">“在国会开会的大厅不远处，有一个公众庆祝活动和化装舞会。突然，大厅的门被打开了，一个小丑冲了进来，一个手持左轮手枪的黑人疯狂地追赶着他。他们在房间中间停下来打斗；小丑倒下了，黑人跳到他身上，开枪了，然后两人都冲出了大厅。整个事件不到二十秒就结束了。</p>
<p class="normal3">“总统要求在场人员立即写一份报告，因为肯定会有司法调查。提交了 40 份报告。只有一份在主要事实方面有不到 20% 的错误；14 份有 20% 到 40% 的错误；12 份有 40% 到 50% 的错误；13 份超过 50%。此外，在 24 份报告中，10% 的细节纯属虚构，10 份报告中这一比例超过这一比例，6 份报告中这一比例降低。简而言之，四分之一的记录是虚假的。</p>
<p class="normal3">“不用说，整个场景都是事先安排好的，甚至还拍了照片。十份虚假报道可以归入故事和传说的范畴；二十四份报道有一半是传说，六份接近确切证据。”</p>
</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">"Not far from the hall in which the Congress was sitting there was a public fete with a masked ball. Suddenly the door of the hall was thrown open and a clown rushed in madly pursued by a negro, revolver in hand. They stopped in the middle of the room fighting; the clown fell, the negro leapt upon him, fired, and then both rushed out of the hall. The whole incident hardly lasted twenty seconds.</p>
<p class="normal3">"The President asked those present to write immediately a report since there was sure to be a judicial inquiry. Forty reports were sent in. Only one had less than 20% of mistakes in regard to the principal facts; fourteen had 20% to 40% of mistakes; twelve from 40% to 50%; thirteen more than 50%. Moreover in twenty-four accounts 10% of the details were pure inventions and this proportion was exceeded in ten accounts and diminished in six. Briefly a quarter of the accounts were false.</p>
<p class="normal3">"It goes without saying that the whole scene had been arranged and even photographed in advance. The ten false reports may then be relegated to the category of tales and legends; twenty-four accounts are half legendary, and six have a value approximating to exact evidence."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="normal3">因此，在 40 名训练有素的观察员中，他们负责记录刚刚发生在他们眼前的场景，超过一半的人看到了没有发生的场景。那么他们看到了什么？人们会认为，讲述发生的事情比编造没有发生的事情更容易。他们看到了他们对这种斗殴的刻板印象。他们所有人在一生中都获得了一系列斗殴的形象，这些形象在他们眼前闪烁。在一个人的身上，这些形象取代了不到 20% 的实际场景，在 13 个人身上，取代了一半以上。在 40 名观察员中，有 34 人的刻板印象取代了至少十分之一的场景。</p><p class="normal3">Thus out of forty trained observers writing a responsible account of a scene that had just happened before their eyes, more than a majority saw a scene that had not taken place. What then did they see? One would suppose it was easier to tell what had occurred, than to invent something which had not occurred. They saw their stereotype of such a brawl. All of them had in the course of their lives acquired a series of images of brawls, and these images flickered before their eyes. In one man these images displaced less than 20% of the actual scene, in thirteen men more than half. In thirty-four out of the forty observers the stereotypes preempted at least one-tenth of the scene.</p>
<p class="normal3">一位著名的艺术评论家曾说过：“由于物体几乎可以呈现出无数种形状……由于我们的不敏感和注意力不集中，如果没有艺术赋予的刻板形状，事物几乎不会具有如此明确和清晰的特征和轮廓，以至于我们可以随意回忆起它们。”事实远不止如此，因为赋予世界的刻板形状不仅来自艺术（绘画、雕塑和文学），还来自我们的道德准则、社会哲学和政治鼓动。在贝伦森先生的以下段落中，用“政治”、“商业”和“社会”等词代替“艺术”一词，句子同样正确：“……除非我们多年来致力于研究所有艺术流派，教会我们用自己的眼睛去观察，否则我们很快就会养成习惯，把我们看到的任何东西塑造成从我们熟悉的一种艺术中借用的形式。这就是我们对艺术现实的标准。让任何人给我们形状和颜色，而我们无法在我们微不足道的陈腐形式和色彩库存中立即匹配，我们会摇头，因为他无法复制我们知道的东西，或者我们指责他不诚实。”</p><p class="normal3">A distinguished art critic has said that "what with the almost numberless shapes assumed by an object. … What with our insensitiveness and inattention, things scarcely would have for us features and outlines so determined and clear that we could recall them at will, but for the stereotyped shapes art has lent them." The truth is even broader than that, for the stereotyped shapes lent to the world come not merely from art, in the sense of painting and sculpture and literature, but from our moral codes and our social philosophies and our political agitations as well. Substitute in the following passage of Mr. Berenson's the words 'politics,' 'business,' and 'society,' for the word 'art' and the sentences will be no less true: "… unless years devoted to the study of all schools of art have taught us also to see with our own eyes, we soon fall into the habit of moulding whatever we look at into the forms borrowed from the one art with which we are acquainted. There is our standard of artistic reality. Let anyone give us shapes and colors which we cannot instantly match in our paltry stock of hackneyed forms and tints, and we shake our heads at his failure to reproduce things as we know they certainly are, or we accuse him of insincerity."</p>
<p class="normal3">贝伦森先生谈到，当画家“不能像我们一样想象物体”时，我们会感到不快，也谈到欣赏中世纪艺术的困难，因为从那时起，“我们想象形式的方式发生了千变万化”。他接着指出，在人物形象方面，我们是如何被教导去看待我们所看到的。“多纳泰罗和马萨乔创造了新的人物形象，并得到了人文主义者的认可，新的人物形象，新的特征……向当时的统治阶级展示了最有可能在人类力量的战斗中获胜的人物类型……谁有能力突破这种新的视觉标准，从混乱的事物中选择出比天才们所确定的更能表达现实的形状？没有人有这样的能力。人们不得不以这种方式看待事物，而不是其他方式，只看到所描绘的形状，只热爱所呈现的理想……”</p><p class="normal3">Mr. Berenson speaks of our displeasure when a painter "does not visualize objects exactly as we do," and of the difficulty of appreciating the art of the Middle Ages because since then "our manner of visualizing forms has changed in a thousand ways." He goes on to show how in regard to the human figure we have been taught to see what we do see. "Created by Donatello and Masaccio, and sanctioned by the Humanists, the new canon of the human figure, the new cast of features … presented to the ruling classes of that time the type of human being most likely to win the day in the combat of human forces… Who had the power to break through this new standard of vision and, out of the chaos of things, to select shapes more definitely expressive of reality than those fixed by men of genius? No one had such power. People had perforce to see things in that way and in no other, and to see only the shapes depicted, to love only the ideals presented…."</p>

<p class="normal3">如果我们不能完全理解他人的行为，除非我们知道他们自以为知道什么，那么为了公正起见，我们不仅要评估他们掌握的信息，还要评估他们过滤这些信息的思维方式。因为公认的类型、当前的模式、标准版本，会在信息进入意识的过程中拦截信息。例如，美国化至少表面上是用美国刻板印象取代欧洲刻板印象。因此，农民可能会把他的地主看作庄园主，把他的雇主看作当地的巨头，而美国化教会了他按照美国标准看待地主和雇主。这构成了思想的改变，实际上，当接种成功时，就是视野的改变。他的眼睛看到了不同的景象。一位和蔼可亲的女士承认，刻板印象是如此重要，以至于当她不纵容刻板印象时，她至少无法接受人类的兄弟情谊和上帝的父亲身份：“我们奇怪地受到所穿衣服的影响。服装创造了一种精神和社会氛围。对于一个坚持雇用伦敦裁缝的人，我们能指望他有什么样的美国精神？一个人的食物会影响他的美国精神。在酸菜和林堡奶酪的氛围中，能培养出什么样的美国意识？或者，对于一个总是呼吸着大蒜味的人，你能指望他有什么样的美国精神？”</p><p class="normal3">If we cannot fully understand the acts of other people, until we know what they think they know, then in order to do justice we have to appraise not only the information which has been at their disposal, but the minds through which they have filtered it. For the accepted types, the current patterns, the standard versions, intercept information on its way to consciousness. Americanization, for example, is superficially at least the substitution of American for European stereotypes. Thus the peasant who might see his landlord as if he were the lord of the manor, his employer as he saw the local magnate, is taught by Americanization to see the landlord and employer according to American standards. This constitutes a change of mind, which is, in effect, when the inoculation succeeds, a change of vision. His eye sees differently. One kindly gentlewoman has confessed that the stereotypes are of such overweening importance, that when hers are not indulged, she at least is unable to accept the brotherhood of man and the fatherhood of God: "we are strangely affected by the clothes we wear. Garments create a mental and social atmosphere. What can be hoped for the Americanism of a man who insists on employing a London tailor? One's very food affects his Americanism. What kind of American consciousness can grow in the atmosphere of sauerkraut and Limburger cheese? Or what can you expect of the Americanism of the man whose breath always reeks of garlic?"</p>
<p class="normal3">这位女士很可能是我朋友曾经参加过的一次庆典的赞助人。那次庆典叫做“熔炉”，是 7 月 4 日在汽车城举行的，那里有许多外国出生的工人。棒球场二垒中央立着一个巨大的木制和帆布熔炉。两边有台阶通往熔炉边缘。观众就座后，乐队演奏完毕，队伍从球场一侧的空地上走来。队伍由工厂里的所有外国国籍的工人组成。他们穿着本国的服装，唱着本国的国歌，跳着本国的民间舞蹈，举着欧洲各地的旗帜。司仪是小学的校长，他打扮成山姆大叔。他领着他们来到熔炉前。他带领他们走上台阶，走到熔炉边缘，然后走进熔炉。他在另一边再次招呼他们出来。我的朋友说，他们来了，毫无疑问，戴着圆顶礼帽，穿着外套、裤子、背心、硬领和圆点领带，每个人的口袋里都装着一支 Eversharp 铅笔，一起唱着星条旗之歌。</p><p class="normal3">This lady might well have been the patron of a pageant which a friend of mine once attended. It was called the Melting Pot, and it was given on the Fourth of July in an automobile town where many foreign-born workers are employed. In the center of the baseball park at second base stood a huge wooden and canvas pot. There were flights of steps up to the rim on two sides. After the audience had settled itself, and the band had played, a procession came through an opening at one side of the field. It was made up of men of all the foreign nationalities employed in the factories. They wore their native costumes, they were singing their national songs; they danced their folk dances, and carried the banners of all Europe. The master of ceremonies was the principal of the grade school dressed as Uncle Sam. He led them to the pot. He directed them up the steps to the rim, and inside. He called them out again on the other side. They came, dressed in derby hats, coats, pants, vest, stiff collar and polka-dot tie, undoubtedly, said my friend, each with an Eversharp pencil in his pocket, and all singing the Star-Spangled Banner.</p>
<p class="normal3">对于这场盛会的发起人，或许也是对于大多数演员来说，他们似乎已经成功地表达了美国老一辈人和新一辈人之间建立友好关系所面临的最深刻的困难。他们刻板印象之间的矛盾妨碍了对他们共同人性的充分认识。改名的人知道这一点。他们想改变自己，改变陌生人对他们的态度。</p><p class="normal3">To the promoters of this pageant, and probably to most of the actors, it seemed as if they had managed to express the most intimate difficulty to friendly association between the older peoples of America and the newer. The contradiction of their stereotypes interfered with the full recognition of their common humanity. The people who change their names know this. They mean to change themselves, and the attitude of strangers toward them.</p>
<p class="normal3">当然，外面的景象和我们观察它的心态之间存在某种联系，就像激进集会上有些长发男子和短发女子一样。但对于匆忙的观察者来说，轻微的联系就足够了。如果观众中有两位剪短发、四位留着胡子的人，那么对于事先知道此类集会由具有这种发型品味的人组成的记者来说，他们就是剪短发、留着胡子的观众。我们的视野和事实之间存在联系，但这种联系往往很奇怪。比如说，一个人很少看风景，除非是为了研究将其划分为建筑用地的可能性，但他看到客厅里挂着许多风景画。从这些风景画中，他学会了将风景想象成玫瑰色的日落，或乡村道路、教堂尖顶和银色的月亮。有一天，他去了乡下，几个小时都没有看到一处风景。然后太阳下山，看起来玫瑰色的。他立刻认出了这处风景，并惊呼它很美。但两天后，当他试图回忆所见所闻时，很可能他主要记得的是客厅里的一些风景。</p><p class="normal3">There is, of course, some connection between the scene outside and the mind through which we watch it, just as there are some long-haired men and short-haired women in radical gatherings. But to the hurried observer a slight connection is enough. If there are two bobbed heads and four beards in the audience, it will be a bobbed and bearded audience to the reporter who knows beforehand that such gatherings are composed of people with these tastes in the management of their hair. There is a connection between our vision and the facts, but it is often a strange connection. A man has rarely looked at a landscape, let us say, except to examine its possibilities for division into building lots, but he has seen a number of landscapes hanging in the parlor. And from them he has learned to think of a landscape as a rosy sunset, or as a country road with a church steeple and a silver moon. One day he goes to the country, and for hours he does not see a single landscape. Then the sun goes down looking rosy. At once he recognizes a landscape and exclaims that it is beautiful. But two days later, when he tries to recall what he saw, the odds are that he will remember chiefly some landscape in a parlor.</p>
<p class="normal3">除非他喝醉了、在做梦或者疯了，否则他确实看到了日落，但他从中看到的，尤其是从中记住的，更多是油画教他观察的东西，而不是印象派画家或有教养的日本人看到并带走的东西。而日本人和画家反过来也会看到并记住更多他们学到的形式，除非他们恰好是为人类发现新视野的极少数人。在未经训练的观察中，我们会从环境中挑选出可识别的迹象。这些迹象代表着想法，我们用我们的图像库存来填充这些想法。我们并不是看到这个人和那个日落；而是我们注意到那个东西是人或日落，然后主要看到我们的头脑对这些主题已经充满了什么。</p><p class="normal3">Unless he has been drunk or dreaming or insane he did see a sunset, but he saw in it, and above all remembers from it, more of what the oil painting taught him to observe, than what an impressionist painter, for example, or a cultivated Japanese would have seen and taken away with him. And the Japanese and the painter in turn will have seen and remembered more of the form they had learned, unless they happen to be the very rare people who find fresh sight for mankind. In untrained observation we pick recognizable signs out of the environment. The signs stand for ideas, and these ideas we fill out with our stock of images. We do not so much see this man and that sunset; rather we notice that the thing is man or sunset, and then see chiefly what our mind is already full of on those subjects.</p>

</p>
<p class="normal3">这样做是经济的。因为试图以全新的、详细的眼光看待所有事物，而不是将其视为类型和概括，是令人精疲力竭的，而在繁忙的事务中几乎是不可能的。在朋友圈中，在与亲密伙伴或竞争对手的关系中，个性化的理解没有捷径，也没有替代品。我们最爱和最钦佩的人是那些意识中充满个人而不是类型的男人和女人，他们了解我们而不是我们可能适合的分类。因为即使没有对自己说出来，我们直觉地感觉到所有的分类都与某种目的有关，而不一定是我们自己的目的；在两个人之间，如果双方不把对方当作自己的目的，那么任何关系都没有最终的尊严。两个人之间的任何接触，如果不将双方的人身不可侵犯作为公理，就会有污点。</p><p class="normal3">There is economy in this. For the attempt to see all things freshly and in detail, rather than as types and generalities, is exhausting, and among busy affairs practically out of the question. In a circle of friends, and in relation to close associates or competitors, there is no shortcut through, and no substitute for, an individualized understanding. Those whom we love and admire most are the men and women whose consciousness is peopled thickly with persons rather than with types, who know us rather than the classification into which we might fit. For even without phrasing it to ourselves, we feel intuitively that all classification is in relation to some purpose not necessarily our own; that between two human beings no association has final dignity in which each does not take the other as an end in himself. There is a taint on any contact between two people which does not affirm as an axiom the personal inviolability of both.</p>
<p class="normal3">但现代生活节奏匆忙，纷繁复杂，最重要的是物理距离将经常保持密切联系的人们分开，例如雇主和雇员、官员和选民。没有时间也没有机会进行亲密的交往。相反，我们注意到一种特征，这种特征标志着一种众所周知的类型，并通过我们头脑中的刻板印象来填补其余的画面。他是一个煽动者。我们注意到或被告知的就这么多。好吧，煽动者就是这样的人，所以<i class="calibre10">他</i>
 就是这样的人。他是一个知识分子。他是一个富豪。他是一个外国人。他是一个“南欧人”。他来自后湾区。他是哈佛人。这与以下说法截然不同：他是耶鲁人。他是一个普通人。他是西点军校毕业生。他是一个老陆军中士。他是格林威治村人：那么我们对他和她有什么不了解的呢？他是一个国际银行家。他来自大街小巷。</p><p class="normal3">But modern life is hurried and multifarious, above all physical distance separates men who are often in vital contact with each other, such as employer and employee, official and voter. There is neither time nor opportunity for intimate acquaintance. Instead we notice a trait which marks a well known type, and fill in the rest of the picture by means of the stereotypes we carry about in our heads. He is an agitator. That much we notice, or are told. Well, an agitator is this sort of person, and so <i class="calibre10">he</i>
 is this sort of person. He is an intellectual. He is a plutocrat. He is a foreigner. He is a "South European." He is from Back Bay. He is a Harvard Man. How different from the statement: he is a Yale Man. He is a regular fellow. He is a West Pointer. He is an old army sergeant. He is a Greenwich Villager: what don't we know about him then, and about her? He is an international banker. He is from Main Street.</p>
<p class="normal3">最微妙、最普遍的影响是那些创造和维持刻板印象的事物。我们在看到世界之前就被告知了它。我们在体验大多数事物之前就想象了它们。除非教育让我们敏锐地意识到，否则这些先入之见会深深地控制着整个感知过程。它们将某些物体标记为熟悉或陌生，强调差异，因此稍微熟悉的物体会被视为非常熟悉，而有些陌生的物体会被视为完全陌生。它们被微小的迹象所激发，这些迹象可能从真实的指标到模糊的类比不等。被激发后，它们会用旧的图像淹没新的视野，并将记忆中复活的东西投射到世界上。如果环境中没有实际的一致性，就不会有节约，而人类习惯于将预见视为视觉，只会犯错误。但是，有足够准确的一致性，并且节约注意力的需要是如此不可避免，以至于放弃所有刻板印象而采用完全无害的方法来体验将使人类生活变得贫乏。</p><p class="normal3">The subtlest and most pervasive of all influences ere those which create and maintain the repertory of stereotypes. We are told about the world before we see it. We imagine most things before we experience them. And those preconceptions, unless education has made us acutely aware, govern deeply the whole process of perception. They mark out certain objects as familiar or strange, emphasizing the difference, so that the slightly familiar is seen as very familiar, and the somewhat strange as sharply alien. They are aroused by small signs, which may vary from a true index to a vague analogy. Aroused, they flood fresh vision with older images, and project into the world what has been resurrected in memory. Were there no practical uniformities in the environment, there would be no economy and only error in the human habit of accepting foresight for sight. But there are uniformities sufficiently accurate, and the need of economizing attention is so inevitable, that the abandonment of all stereotypes for a wholly innocent approach to experience would impoverish human life.</p>
<p class="normal3">重要的是刻板印象的性质，以及我们运用刻板印象时的轻信程度。而这些最终取决于构成我们人生哲学的包容性模式。如果我们在这种哲学中假设世界是根据我们拥有的一套代码编纂而成的，那么我们很可能会让我们对正在发生的事情的报道描述一个由我们的代码运行的世界。但如果我们的哲学告诉我们，每个人只是世界的一小部分，他的智力最多只能捕捉到粗糙思想网络中的阶段和方面，那么，当我们使用刻板印象时，我们倾向于知道它们只是刻板印象，轻拿轻放，乐于修改它们。我们还倾向于越来越清楚地认识到我们的想法何时开始，从哪里开始，它们是如何来到我们身边的，我们为什么接受它们。所有有用的历史都是以这种方式防腐的。它使我们能够知道什么童话、什么教科书、什么传统、什么小说、戏剧、图片、短语在这个头脑中植入了一个先入之见，在另一个头脑中植入了另一个先入之见。</p><p class="normal3">What matters is the character of the stereotypes, and the gullibility with which we employ them. And these in the end depend upon those inclusive patterns which constitute our philosophy of life. If in that philosophy we assume that the world is codified according to a code which we possess, we are likely to make our reports of what is going on describe a world run by our code. But if our philosophy tells us that each man is only a small part of the world, that his intelligence catches at best only phases and aspects in a coarse net of ideas, then, when we use our stereotypes, we tend to know that they are only stereotypes, to hold them lightly, to modify them gladly. We tend, also, to realize more and more clearly when our ideas started, where they started, how they came to us, why we accepted them. All useful history is antiseptic in this fashion. It enables us to know what fairy tale, what school book, what tradition, what novel, play, picture, phrase, planted one preconception in this mind, another in that mind.</p>

<p class="normal3">那些希望审查艺术的人至少没有低估这种影响。他们通常误解了它，而且几乎总是荒谬地一心想阻止其他人发现任何未经他们批准的东西。但无论如何，就像柏拉图在关于诗人的论证中一样，他们隐约感觉到通过虚构获得的类型往往会被强加于现实。因此，毫无疑问，电影正在稳步建立意象，然后人们在报纸上读到的文字会唤起这些意象。在整个人类的经验中，没有任何东西可以像电影一样帮助人们想象。如果一个佛罗伦萨人想想象圣徒，他可以去他教堂的壁画，在那里他可以看到乔托为那个时代标准化的圣徒形象。如果一个雅典人想想象诸神，他会去寺庙。但描绘的物体数量并不多。而在东方，第二条诫命的精神被广泛接受，对具体事物的描绘甚至更加贫乏，也许正是因为这个原因，实际决策的能力才大大减弱。然而，在西方世界，在过去几个世纪里，世俗描述的数量和范围有了巨大的增长，文字图片、叙事、插图叙事，最后是电影，也许还有有声电影。</p><p class="normal3">Those who wish to censor art do not at least underestimate this influence. They generally misunderstand it, and almost always they are absurdly bent on preventing other people from discovering anything not sanctioned by them. But at any rate, like Plato in his argument about the poets, they feel vaguely that the types acquired through fiction tend to be imposed on reality. Thus there can be little doubt that the moving picture is steadily building up imagery which is then evoked by the words people read in their newspapers. In the whole experience of the race there has been no aid to visualization comparable to the cinema. If a Florentine wished to visualize the saints, he could go to the frescoes in his church, where he might see a vision of saints standardized for his time by Giotto. If an Athenian wished to visualize the gods he went to the temples. But the number of objects which were pictured was not great. And in the East, where the spirit of the second commandment was widely accepted, the portraiture of concrete things was even more meager, and for that reason perhaps the faculty of practical decision was by so much reduced. In the western world, however, during the last few centuries there has been an enormous increase in the volume and scope of secular description, the word picture, the narrative, the illustrated narrative, and finally the moving picture and, perhaps, the talking picture.</p>
<p class="normal3">如今，照片对想象力具有某种权威，就像昨天的印刷文字和更早之前的口语一样。它们看起来十分真实。我们想象它们直接呈现在我们面前，无需人为干预，它们是可以想象的最不费力的心灵食粮。任何文字描述，甚至任何静止的图片，都需要努力记忆，然后才能在脑海中形成图像。但在屏幕上，观察、描述、报道和想象的整个过程都为你完成了。你只需要保持清醒，你的想象力所追求的结果就会在屏幕上一一呈现，而不需要更多的努力。模糊的想法变得生动起来；比如说，当你看到《一个国家的诞生》时，你对三K党的模糊印象，多亏了格里菲思先生，就变得生动起来了。从历史上看，它可能是一种错误的形象，从道德上看，它可能是一种有害的形象，但它是一种形象，而且我怀疑，任何一个看过这部电影的人，如果不比格里菲思先生更了解三K党，在没有看到那些白骑士的情况下，是否会再次听到这个名字。</p><p class="normal3">Photographs have the kind of authority over imagination to-day, which the printed word had yesterday, and the spoken word before that. They seem utterly real. They come, we imagine, directly to us without human meddling, and they are the most effortless food for the mind conceivable. Any description in words, or even any inert picture, requires an effort of memory before a picture exists in the mind. But on the screen the whole process of observing, describing, reporting, and then imagining, has been accomplished for you. Without more trouble than is needed to stay awake the result which your imagination is always aiming at is reeled off on the screen. The shadowy idea becomes vivid; your hazy notion, let us say, of the Ku Klux Klan, thanks to Mr. Griffiths, takes vivid shape when you see the Birth of a Nation. Historically it may be the wrong shape, morally it may be a pernicious shape, but it is a shape, and I doubt whether anyone who has seen the film and does not know more about the Ku Klux Klan than Mr. Griffiths, will ever hear the name again without seeing those white horsemen.</p>

<p class="normal3">因此，当我们谈论一群人的思想，法国人的思想，军国主义者的思想，布尔什维克的思想时，我们很容易陷入严重的混乱，除非我们同意将本能的本能与刻板印象、模式和公式区分开来，而这些刻板印象、模式和公式在建立本土性格所适应和响应的精神世界中起着决定性的作用。没有做出这种区分，就会导致大量关于集体思想、民族精神和种族心理的胡言乱语。可以肯定的是，刻板印象可能在每一代中从父母传给孩子，如此一致和权威，以至于它几乎看起来像是一个生物学事实。在某些方面，正如沃拉斯先生所说，我们可能确实在生物学上寄生于我们的社会遗产。但肯定没有任何科学证据能让任何人争辩说，人们生来就具有他们出生的国家的政治习惯。如果一个国家的政治习惯都相同，那么首先要寻找解释的地方就是托儿所、学校和教堂，而不是群体思想和民族灵魂所占据的那个边缘地带。除非你完全看不到父母、教师、牧师和叔叔们传承下来的传统，否则将政治差异归咎于种质是一种最糟糕的错误。</p><p class="normal3">And so when we speak of the mind of a group of people, of the French mind, the militarist mind, the bolshevik mind, we are liable to serious confusion unless we agree to separate the instinctive equipment from the stereotypes, the patterns, and the formulae which play so decisive a part in building up the mental world to which the native character is adapted and responds. Failure to make this distinction accounts for oceans of loose talk about collective minds, national souls, and race psychology. To be sure a stereotype may be so consistently and authoritatively transmitted in each generation from parent to child that it seems almost like a biological fact. In some respects, we may indeed have become, as Mr. Wallas says, biologically parasitic upon our social heritage. But certainly there is not the least scientific evidence which would enable anyone to argue that men are born with the political habits of the country in which they are born. In so far as political habits are alike in a nation, the first places to look for an explanation are the nursery, the school, the church, not in that limbo inhabited by Group Minds and National Souls. Until you have thoroughly failed to see tradition being handed on from parents, teachers, priests, and uncles, it is a solecism of the worst order to ascribe political differences to the germ plasm.</p>
<p class="normal3">可以尝试性地、谦虚地概括出同一教育和经验类别的比较差异。然而，即便如此，这也是一项棘手的任务。因为几乎没有两个经历是完全相同的，即使是同一个家庭的两个孩子也是如此。大儿子永远不会有做小儿子的经历。因此，在我们能够忽略教养差异之前，我们必须保留对自然差异的判断。就像在知道哪块土地在拉布拉多，哪块土地在爱荷华之前，通过比较它们的产量来判断两块土地的生产力，无论是经过耕种和富饶，还是被耗尽，还是任其荒芜。</p><p class="normal3">It is possible to generalize tentatively and with a decent humility about comparative differences within the same category of education and experience. Yet even this is a tricky enterprise. For almost no two experiences are exactly alike, not even of two children in the same household. The older son never does have the experience of being the younger. And therefore, until we are able to discount the difference in nurture, we must withhold judgment about differences of nature. As well judge the productivity of two soils by comparing their yield before you know which is in Labrador and which in Iowa, whether they have been cultivated and enriched, exhausted, or allowed to run wild.</p>

<p class="normal3">除了节省精力之外，还有一个原因导致我们经常固守刻板印象，而我们本可以追求更公正的愿景。刻板印象体系可能是我们个人传统的核心，是我们在社会中地位的捍卫者。</p><p class="normal3">THERE is another reason, besides economy of effort, why we so often hold to our stereotypes when we might pursue a more disinterested vision. The systems of stereotypes may be the core of our personal tradition, the defenses of our position in society.</p>
<p class="normal3">它们是一幅有序的、或多或少一致的世界图景，我们的习惯、品味、能力、舒适和希望都已适应了这个世界。它们可能不是完整的世界图景，但它们是我们适应的一个可能世界的图景。在那个世界里，人和物都有它们熟悉的位置，做着某些预期的事情。我们在那里感到宾至如归。我们融入其中。我们是其中的一员。我们知道周围的路。在那里，我们发现了熟悉的、正常的、可靠的事物的魅力；它的凹槽和形状就是我们习惯的地方。虽然在我们把自己折成那个模子之前，我们已经放弃了许多可能诱惑我们的东西，但一旦我们牢牢地融入其中，它就会像一双旧鞋一样合身。</p><p class="normal3">They are an ordered, more or less consistent picture of the world, to which our habits, our tastes, our capacities, our comforts and our hopes have adjusted themselves. They may not be a complete picture of the world, but they are a picture of a possible world to which we are adapted. In that world people and things have their well-known places, and do certain expected things. We feel at home there. We fit in. We are members. We know the way around. There we find the charm of the familiar, the normal, the dependable; its grooves and shapes are where we are accustomed to find them. And though we have abandoned much that might have tempted us before we creased ourselves into that mould, once we are firmly in, it fits as snugly as an old shoe.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，难怪任何对刻板印象的扰乱都像是对宇宙基础的攻击。这是对<i class="calibre10">我们</i>
 宇宙基础的攻击，当事关重大时，我们不会轻易承认我们的宇宙和宇宙之间存在任何区别。如果一个世界变成我们所尊敬的人不配，而我们所鄙视的人却高贵，这令人心烦意乱。如果我们的优先顺序不是唯一可能的顺序，就会出现无政府状态。因为如果温顺的人真的应该继承地球，如果第一应该是最后，如果只有那些没有罪的人才能扔石头，如果你只把凯撒的东西交给凯撒，那么对于那些把生活安排得好像这些格言不真实的人来说，自尊的基础就会动摇。刻板印象的模式不是中性的。它不仅仅是一种用秩序来取代现实中繁华喧闹的混乱的方式。它不仅仅是一条捷径。它是所有这些，还有更多的东西。它是我们自尊的保证；它是我们对自身价值、自身地位和自身权利的自我认知在世人的投射。因此，刻板印象中充满了与之相关的情感。它们是我们传统的堡垒，在它的防线后面，我们可以继续在我们所处的位置上感到安全。</p><p class="normal3">No wonder, then, that any disturbance of the stereotypes seems like an attack upon the foundations of the universe. It is an attack upon the foundations of <i class="calibre10">our</i>
 universe, and, where big things are at stake, we do not readily admit that there is any distinction between our universe and the universe. A world which turns out to be one in which those we honor are unworthy, and those we despise are noble, is nerve-racking. There is anarchy if our order of precedence is not the only possible one. For if the meek should indeed inherit the earth, if the first should be last, if those who are without sin alone may cast a stone, if to Caesar you render only the things that are Caesar's, then the foundations of self-respect would be shaken for those who have arranged their lives as if these maxims were not true. A pattern of stereotypes is not neutral. It is not merely a way of substituting order for the great blooming, buzzing confusion of reality. It is not merely a short cut. It is all these things and something more. It is the guarantee of our self-respect; it is the projection upon the world of our own sense of our own value, our own position and our own rights. The stereotypes are, therefore, highly charged with the feelings that are attached to them. They are the fortress of our tradition, and behind its defenses we can continue to feel ourselves safe in the position we occupy.</p>

<p class="normal3">例如，公元前四世纪，亚里士多德在面对日益增长的怀疑时，为奴隶制辩护，当时雅典的奴隶与自由公民几乎没有区别。齐默恩先生引用了《老寡头》中一段有趣的文字，解释了对奴隶的优待。“假设公民可以殴打奴隶，那么雅典人经常会被误认为是奴隶或外来人，并遭到殴打；因为雅典人的衣着并不比奴隶或外来人好，在外表上也没有任何优越性。”这种缺乏区别的现象自然会导致奴隶制的瓦解。如果自由人和奴隶长得一样，那么有什么理由对他们区别对待呢？亚里士多德在《政治学》第一卷中着手消除的就是这种混淆。他凭着敏锐的直觉明白，要证明奴隶制的合理性，就必须教会希腊人一种<i class="calibre10">看待</i>
 奴隶的方式，使之与奴隶制的延续相适应。</p><p class="normal3">When, for example, in the fourth century B. C., Aristotle wrote his defense of slavery in the face of increasing skepticism, the Athenian slaves were in great part indistinguishable from free citizens Mr. Zimmern quotes an amusing passage from the Old Oligarch explaining the good treatment of the slaves. "Suppose it were legal for a slave to be beaten by a citizen, it would frequently happen that an Athenian might be mistaken for a slave or an alien and receive a beating;—since the Athenian people is not better clothed than the slave or alien, nor in personal appearance is there any superiority." This absence of distinction would naturally tend to dissolve the institution. If free men and slaves looked alike, what basis was there for treating them so differently? It was this confusion which Aristotle set himself to clear away in the first book of his Politics. With unerring instinct he understood that to justify slavery he must teach the Greeks a way of <i class="calibre10">seeing</i>
 their slaves that comported with the continuance of slavery.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，亚里士多德说，有些人天生就是奴隶。“那么，他天生就是奴隶，适合成为他人的奴隶，<i class="calibre10">因此他就是这样</i>
 。”这句话实际上说的是，任何碰巧是奴隶的人天生就注定要成为奴隶。从逻辑上讲，这种说法毫无价值，但事实上它根本不是一个命题，逻辑与它无关。这是一种刻板印象，或者更确切地说，它是刻板印象的一部分。其余的几乎紧接着就出现了。在断言奴隶感知理性，但没有赋予理性使用能力之后，亚里士多德坚持认为“大自然的意图是让奴隶和自由人的身体彼此不同，一个应该强壮以达到他们必要的目的，而另一个应该直立；对于这种卑微的劳动确实毫无用处，但适合平民生活……很明显，有些人天生自由，而另一些人是奴隶。……”</p><p class="normal3">So, said Aristotle, there are beings who are slaves by nature. "He then is by nature formed a slave, who is fitted to become the chattel of another person, <i class="calibre10">and on that account is so</i>
 ." All this really says is that whoever happens to be a slave is by nature intended to be one. Logically the statement is worthless, but in fact it is not a proposition at all, and logic has nothing to do with it. It is a stereotype, or rather it is part of a stereotype. The rest follows almost immediately. After asserting that slaves perceive reason, but are not endowed with the use of it, Aristotle insists that "it is the intention of nature to make the bodies of slaves and free men different from each other, that the one should be robust for their necessary purposes, but the other erect; useless indeed for such servile labours, but fit for civil life… It is clear then that some men are free by nature, and others are slaves. …"</p>
<p class="normal3">如果我们自问亚里士多德的论证到底出了什么问题，我们会发现他一开始就在自己和事实之间筑起了一道巨大的屏障。当他说那些奴隶天生就是奴隶时，他一下子排除了一个致命的问题：那些碰巧是奴隶的人是否天生就是奴隶。因为这个问题会让每一起奴隶制案件都充满疑问。而且，由于身为奴隶这一事实并不能证明一个人注定要成为奴隶，因此就没有确定的检验标准了。因此，亚里士多德完全排除了这种破坏性的怀疑。那些奴隶天生就是奴隶。每个奴隶主都应该把他的动产视为天生的奴隶。当他的眼睛被训练成这样看待他们时，他就会注意到他们从事奴役工作、他们有能力做奴役工作、他们有做奴役工作的肌肉，这些事实证实了他们的奴役性质。</p><p class="normal3">If we ask ourselves what is the matter with Aristotle's argument, we find that he has begun by erecting a great barrier between himself and the facts. When he had said that those who are slaves are by nature intended to be slaves, he at one stroke excluded the fatal question whether those particular men who happened to be slaves were the particular men intended by nature to be slaves. For that question would have tainted each case of slavery with doubt. And since the fact of being a slave was not evidence that a man was destined to be one, no certain test would have remained. Aristotle, therefore, excluded entirely that destructive doubt. Those who are slaves are intended to be slaves. Each slave holder was to look upon his chattels as natural slaves. When his eye had been trained to see them that way, he was to note as confirmation of their servile character the fact that they performed servile work, that they were competent to do servile work, and that they had the muscles to do servile work.</p>
<p class="normal3">这是完美的刻板印象。其特点是先于理性的使用；是一种感知形式，在数据到达智力之前将某种特征强加于我们感官的数据上。刻板印象就像比肯街上的淡紫色窗玻璃，就像化装舞会上判断客人是否穿着合适的化装的门卫。没有什么比刻板印象更难以接受教育或批评了。它在获取证据的过程中就将自己印在证据上。这就是为什么回国旅行者的记述往往是一个有趣的故事，讲述旅行者在旅途中随身携带的东西。如果他主要带着他的胃口，对瓷砖浴室的热爱，对普尔曼车厢是人类舒适度的极致的坚信，以及对给服务员、出租车司机和理发师小费是合理的信念，但绝不给车站工作人员和引座员小费，那么他的奥德赛之旅将充满美食和劣质美食、洗澡冒险、火车车厢冒险和对金钱的贪婪索求。或者如果他是一个更严肃的人，他可能会在旅行中发现自己身处著名景点。到达基地，偷偷瞥了一眼纪念碑，他埋头阅读贝德克尔，从头到尾读完，然后前往下一个著名景点；就这样带着对欧洲紧凑而有序的印象回来了，被评为一星或两星。</p><p class="normal3">This is the perfect stereotype. Its hallmark is that it precedes the use of reason; is a form of perception, imposes a certain character on the data of our senses before the data reach the intelligence. The stereotype is like the lavender window-panes on Beacon Street, like the door-keeper at a costume ball who judges whether the guest has an appropriate masquerade. There is nothing so obdurate to education or to criticism as the stereotype. It stamps itself upon the evidence in the very act of securing the evidence. That is why the accounts of returning travellers are often an interesting tale of what the traveller carried abroad with him on his trip. If he carried chiefly his appetite, a zeal for tiled bathrooms, a conviction that the Pullman car is the acme of human comfort, and a belief that it is proper to tip waiters, taxicab drivers, and barbers, but under no circumstances station agents and ushers, then his Odyssey will be replete with good meals and bad meals, bathing adventures, compartment-train escapades, and voracious demands for money. Or if he is a more serious soul he may while on tour have found himself at celebrated spots. Having touched base, and cast one furtive glance at the monument, he buried his head in Baedeker, read every word through, and moved on to the next celebrated spot; and thus returned with a compact and orderly impression of Europe, rated one star, or two.</p>
<p class="normal3">在某种程度上，来自外界的刺激，尤其是印刷品或口头文字，会唤起刻板印象系统的某些部分，因此实际感觉和先入之见会同时占据意识。两者混合在一起，就像我们透过蓝色眼镜看红色，却看到绿色一样。如果我们看到的东西与我们的预期相符，刻板印象就会在未来得到强化，就像一个人事先知道日本人很狡猾，却不幸遇到了两个不诚实的日本人一样。</p><p class="normal3">In some measure, stimuli from the outside, especially when they are printed or spoken words, evoke some part of a system of stereotypes, so that the actual sensation and the preconception occupy consciousness at the same time. The two are blended, much as if we looked at red through blue glasses and saw green. If what we are looking at corresponds successfully with what we anticipated, the stereotype is reinforced for the future, as it is in a man who knows in advance that the Japanese are cunning and has the bad luck to run across two dishonest Japanese.</p>
<p class="normal3">如果体验与刻板印象相矛盾，就会发生两种情况之一。如果这个人不再具有可塑性，或者某种强大的利益使他很难重新安排他的刻板印象，他就会对矛盾嗤之以鼻，认为这是一个例外，证明了规则，抹黑了证人，发现了某个地方的缺陷，并设法忘记了它。但如果他仍然好奇和开放，新奇的东西就会被纳入画面，并被允许修改它。有时，如果事件足够引人注目，如果他对自己既定的计划感到普遍不舒服，他可能会动摇到不信任所有公认的生活观的程度，并认为事情通常不会像人们通常认为的那样。在极端情况下，尤其是如果他是文学家，他可能会发展出一种颠覆道德经典的激情，把犹大、本尼迪克特·阿诺德或凯撒·博尔吉亚塑造成他故事中的英雄。</p><p class="normal3">If the experience contradicts the stereotype, one of two things happens. If the man is no longer plastic, or if some powerful interest makes it highly inconvenient to rearrange his stereotypes, he pooh- poohs the contradiction as an exception that proves the rule, discredits the witness, finds a flaw somewhere, and manages to forget it. But if he is still curious and open-minded, the novelty is taken into the picture, and allowed to modify it. Sometimes, if the incident is striking enough, and if he has felt a general discomfort with his established scheme, he may be shaken to such an extent as to distrust all accepted ways of looking at life, and to expect that normally a thing will not be what it is generally supposed to be. In the extreme case, especially if he is literary, he may develop a passion for inverting the moral canon by making Judas, Benedict Arnold, or Caesar Borgia the hero of his tale.</p>

<p class="normal3">这种刻板印象所起的作用可以从德国关于比利时狙击手的传说中看出。奇怪的是，这些传说首先被一个被称为 Pax 的德国天主教牧师组织驳斥。暴行故事的存在本身并不奇怪，德国人民也乐于相信它们。但令人惊讶的是，一大批保守的爱国德国人早在 1914 年 8 月 16 日就已经开始反驳一系列针对敌人的诽谤，尽管这些诽谤对于抚慰同胞不安的良心具有极大的价值。为什么耶稣会会特别着手摧毁对德国战斗士气如此重要的虚构故事呢？</p><p class="normal3">The role played by the stereotype can be seen in the German tales about Belgian snipers. Those tales curiously enough were first refuted by an organization of German Catholic priests known as Pax. The existence of atrocity stories is itself not remarkable, nor that the German people gladly believed them. But it is remarkable that a great conservative body of patriotic Germans should have set out as early as August 16, 1914, to contradict a collection of slanders on the enemy, even though such slanders were of the utmost value in soothing the troubled conscience of their fellow countrymen. Why should the Jesuit order in particular have set out to destroy a fiction so important to the fighting morale of Germany?</p>

<p class="normal3">或许有人会进行攻击。如果每个愤怒的比利时人都冲到图书馆，打开国际法手册，了解自己是否有权对在街头游荡的可恶的滋扰者进行射击，那将是不可思议的。如果一支从未遭受过炮火的军队不认为每颗射向它的子弹都是未经授权的，因为这很不方便，而且实际上在某种程度上违反了当时构成其唯一战争经验的战争游戏规则，那也同样不可思议。可以想象，更敏感的人会一心想说服自己，他们所针对的人一定是可怕的人。因此，这个传说可能被编造出来，直到它传到审查者和宣传者手中，无论他们是否相信，他们都看到了它的价值，并把它传给了德国平民。他们也不会完全为发现自己所激怒的人是非人类而感到难过。最重要的是，由于传说源自他们的英雄，他们不仅有权相信它，而且如果他们不相信，他们就是不爱国的。</p><p class="normal3">There may have been some sniping. It would be extraordinary if every angry Belgian had rushed to the library, opened a manual of international law, and had informed himself whether he had a right to take potshot at the infernal nuisance tramping through his streets. It would be no less extraordinary if an army that had never been under fire, did not regard every bullet that came its way as unauthorized, because it was inconvenient, and indeed as somehow a violation of the rules of the Kriegspiel, which then constituted its only experience of war. One can imagine the more sensitive bent on convincing themselves that the people to whom they were doing such terrible things must be terrible people. And so the legend may have been spun until it reached the censors and propagandists, who, whether they believed it or not, saw its value, and let it loose on the German civilians.

For in the minds of most patriotic protestant Germans, especially of the upper classes, the picture of Bismarck's victories included a long quarrel with the Roman Catholics. By a process of association, Belgian priests became priests, and hatred of Belgians a vent for all their hatreds. These German protestants did what some Americans did when under the stress of war they created a compound object of hatred out of the enemy abroad and all their opponents at home. Against this synthetic enemy, the Hun in Germany and the Hun within the Gate, they launched all the animosity that was in them.</p>
<p class="normal3">当然，天主教徒对暴行故事的抵制是出于防御。它针对的是那些引起对所有天主教徒的仇恨的特定虚构故事，而不仅仅是针对比利时天主教徒。M . van Langenhove 说， <i class="calibre10">《和平信息》</i>
 只具有教会意义，“几乎只关注牧师的应受谴责的行为”。然而，人们不禁想知道，德国天主教徒在得知俾斯麦帝国对他们意味着什么后，他们的脑海中会浮现出什么；以及这种了解与愿意在停战协议中签署帝国死刑令的著名德国政治家是天主教中央党领袖埃茨贝格尔这一事实之间是否存在任何模糊的联系。</p><p class="normal3">The Catholic resistance to the atrocity tales was, of course, defensive. It was aimed at those particular fictions which aroused animosity against all Catholics, rather than against Belgian Catholics alone. The <i class="calibre10">Informations Pax</i>
 , says M. van Langenhove, had only an ecclesiastical bearing and "confined their attention almost exclusively to the reprehensible acts attributed to the priests." And yet one cannot help wondering a little about what was set in motion in the minds of German Catholics by this revelation of what Bismarck's empire meant in relation to them; and also whether there was any obscure connection between that knowledge and the fact that the prominent German politician who was willing in the armistice to sign the death warrant of the empire was Erzberger, the leader of the Catholic Centre Party.</p>

<p class="normal3">我一直在谈论刻板印象而不是理想，因为“理想”这个词通常用于指代我们认为的善、真和美。因此，它暗示着这里有一些东西需要复制或实现。但我们固定印象的储备远不止于此。它包含理想的骗子、理想的坦慕尼政客、理想的沙文主义者、理想的煽动者、理想的敌人。我们刻板印象中的世界不一定是我们希望的世界。它只是我们期望的世界。如果事件相符，就会有一种熟悉感，我们会觉得我们正在随着事件的发展而前进。如果我们是希望没有疑虑的雅典人，我们的奴隶必须是天生的奴隶。如果我们告诉朋友我们在 95 年打了 18 洞高尔夫球，我们会在 110 年打完一场比赛后告诉他们，我们今天不是我们自己。也就是说，我们不认识那个打了 15 杆的笨蛋。</p><p class="normal3">I HAVE been speaking of stereotypes rather than ideals, because the word ideal is usually reserved for what we consider the good, the true and the beautiful. Thus it carries the hint that here is something to be copied or attained. But our repertory of fixed impressions is wider than that. It contains ideal swindlers, ideal Tammany politicians, ideal jingoes, ideal agitators, ideal enemies. Our stereotyped world is not necessarily the world we should like it to be. It is simply the kind of world we expect it to be. If events correspond there is a sense of familiarity, and we feel that we are moving with the movement of events. Our slave must be a slave by nature, if we are Athenians who wish to have no qualms. If we have told our friends that we do eighteen holes of golf in 95, we tell them after doing the course in 110, that we are not ourselves to-day. That is to say, we are not acquainted with the duffer who foozled fifteen strokes.</p>
<p class="normal3">如果每一代人中没有相对较少的人不断将事物整理、标准化和改进为逻辑系统（即政治经济学法则、政治学原理等），我们大多数人都会通过相当随意和不断变化的各种刻板印象来处理事务。一般来说，当我们写到文化、传统和群体思维时，我们想到的是这些由天才完善的体系。现在，毫无疑问有必要不断研究和批评这些理想化的版本，但历史学家、政治家和宣传人员不能止步于此。因为在历史中起作用的不是天才所制定的系统思想，而是个人头脑中不断变化的模仿、复制品、伪造品、类比和扭曲。</p><p class="normal3">Most of us would deal with affairs through a rather haphazard and shifting assortment of stereotypes, if a comparatively few men in each generation were not constantly engaged in arranging, standardizing, and improving them into logical systems, known as the Laws of Political Economy, the Principles of Politics, and the like. Generally when we write about culture, tradition, and the group mind, we are thinking of these systems perfected by men of genius. Now there is no disputing the necessity of constant study and criticism of these idealized versions, but the historian of people, the politician, and the publicity man cannot stop there. For what operates in history is not the systematic idea as a genius formulated it, but shifting imitations, replicas, counterfeits, analogies, and distortions in individual minds.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，马克思主义不一定是卡尔·马克思在《资本论》中所写的内容，而是所有自称是信徒的敌对教派所信仰的任何东西。你无法从福音书中推断出基督教的历史，也无法从宪法中推断出美国的政治历史。你必须遵循的是《资本论》的构想、福音书的宣讲和对宣讲的理解、宪法的解释和执行。因为虽然标准版本和当前版本之间存在相互影响，但正是这些在人们中传播的当前版本影响了他们的行为。</p><p class="normal3">Thus Marxism is not necessarily what Karl Marx wrote in Das Kapital, but whatever it is that all the warring sects believe, who claim to be the faithful. From the gospels you cannot deduce the history of Christianity, nor from the Constitution the political history of America. It is Das Kapital as conceived, the gospels as preached and the preachment as understood, the Constitution as interpreted and administered, to which you have to go. For while there is a reciprocating influence between the standard version and the current versions, it is these current versions as distributed among men which affect their behavior.</p>
<p class="normal3">一位眼皮和丽莎夫人一样有些疲惫的评论家说：“相对论有望发展成为一种像进化论一样适用于全世界的理论。进化论从一种技术性的生物学假设，变成了几乎所有知识领域工作者的鼓舞人心的指南：风俗习惯、道德、宗教、哲学、艺术、蒸汽机、电车——一切都在‘进化’。” “进化”成为一个非常笼统的术语；它也变得不精确，直到在许多情况下，这个词最初的明确含义已经消失，它所描述的理论被误解。我们有足够的勇气预言相对论的类似发展和命运。目前尚未完全理解的技术物理理论将变得更加模糊和晦涩。历史会重演，相对论就像进化论一样，在其科学方面得到许多可理解但有些不准确的流行阐述后，将开始征服世界的历程。我们认为，到那时，它可能会被称为<i class="calibre10">相对论</i>
 。这些较大的应用中的许多无疑将得到证实；有些将是荒谬的，我们想象，相当多的应用将沦为真理。而物理理论，这一巨大增长的种子，将再次成为科学家纯粹的技术关注点。”</p><p class="normal3">"The theory of Relativity," says a critic whose eyelids, like the Lady Lisa's, are a little weary, "promises to develop into a principle as adequate to universal application as was the theory of Evolution. This latter theory, from being a technical biological hypothesis, became an inspiring guide to workers in practically every branch of knowledge: manners and customs, morals, religions, philosophies, arts, steam engines, electric tramways—everything had 'evolved.' 'Evolution' became a very general term; it also became imprecise until, in many cases, the original, definite meaning of the word was lost, and the theory it had been evoked to describe was misunderstood. We are hardy enough to prophesy a similar career and fate for the theory of Relativity. The technical physical theory, at present imperfectly understood, will become still more vague and dim. History repeats itself, and Relativity, like Evolution, after receiving a number of intelligible but somewhat inaccurate popular expositions in its scientific aspect, will be launched on a world-conquering career. We suggest that, by that time, it will probably be called <i class="calibre10">Relativismus</i>
 . Many of these larger applications will doubtless be justified; some will be absurd and a considerable number will, we imagine, reduce to truisms. And the physical theory, the mere seed of this mighty growth, will become once more the purely technical concern of scientific men."</p>
<p class="normal3">但是，对于这样一个征服世界的事业，一个想法必须与某种东西相对应，无论这种相对应是多么不精确。伯里教授表明，进步的观念在很长一段时间内仍然是一种推测性的玩物。他写道：“一个新的推测秩序的观念要渗透并影响一个社会的普遍意识，并不容易，除非它已经呈现出一些外在的具体体现，或者得到了一些引人注目的物质证据的推荐。就进步而言，这两个条件在 1820-1850 年期间（在英国）都得到了满足。”最引人注目的证据是由机械革命提供的。“出生于本世纪初的人，在他们三十岁之前，就见证了蒸汽航行的快速发展、城镇和房屋被煤气照亮、第一条铁路的开通。”在普通家庭的意识中，像这样的奇迹形成了他对人类可完善性的信仰的模式。</p><p class="normal3">But for such a world-conquering career an idea must correspond, however imprecisely, to something. Professor Bury shows for how long a time the idea of progress remained a speculative toy. "It is not easy," he writes, "for a new idea of the speculative order to penetrate and inform the general consciousness of a community until it has assumed some external and concrete embodiment, or is recommended by some striking material evidence. In the case of Progress both these conditions were fulfilled (in England) in the period 1820-1850." The most striking evidence was furnished by the mechanical revolution. "Men who were born at the beginning of the century had seen, before they had passed the age of thirty, the rapid development of steam navigation, the illumination of towns and houses by gas, the opening of the first railway." In the consciousness of the average householder miracles like these formed the pattern of his belief in the perfectibility of the human race.</p>
<p class="normal3">丁尼生在哲学上是个相当正常的人，他告诉我们，当他乘坐从利物浦开往曼彻斯特的第一列火车（1830 年）时，他觉得车轮在凹槽里转动。然后他写下了这样一句话：</p><p class="normal3">Tennyson, who was in philosophical matters a fairly normal person, tells us that when he went by the first train from Liverpool to Manchester (1830) he thought that the wheels ran in grooves. Then he wrote this line:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">“让伟大的世界永远在变化的洪流中旋转。”</p>
</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">"Let the great world spin forever down the ringing grooves of change."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="normal3">于是，一个或多或少适用于利物浦和曼彻斯特之间旅程的概念被推广为“永恒”的宇宙模式。这种模式被其他人所接受，并通过令人眼花缭乱的发明得到强化，使进化论变得乐观起来。当然，正如伯里教授所说，进化论在悲观主义和乐观主义之间是中立的。但它承诺不断变化，世界上可见的变化标志着大自然如此非凡的征服，以至于大众的思想将两者融合在一起。进化论首先出现在达尔文本人身上，然后出现在赫伯特·斯宾塞身上，是一种“走向完美的进步”。</p><p class="normal3">And so a notion more or less applicable to a journey between Liverpool and Manchester was generalized into a pattern of the universe "for ever." This pattern, taken up by others, reinforced by dazzling inventions, imposed an optimistic turn upon the theory of evolution. That theory, of course, is, as Professor Bury says, neutral between pessimism and optimism. But it promised continual change, and the changes visible in the world marked such extraordinary conquests of nature, that the popular mind made a blend of the two. Evolution first in Darwin himself, and then more elaborately in Herbert Spencer, was a "progress towards perfection."</p>

</p>
<p class="normal3">“进步”和“完美”等词语所代表的刻板印象从根本上来说就是机械发明。而且，从总体上讲，这种刻板印象至今仍然如此。在美国，机械进步的景象给人留下了比在其他地方更深刻的印象，以至于它渗透到了整个道德准则中。美国人几乎可以忍受任何侮辱，除了指责他不进步。无论是拥有悠久的本土血统，还是新移民，美国文明的巨大物质增长总是让他印象深刻。这构成了他看待世界的基本刻板印象：乡村将成为大都市，朴素的建筑将成为摩天大楼，小的将成为大；慢的将成为快的；贫穷的将成为富裕的；少的将成为多的；任何事物都将更加多。</p><p class="normal3">The stereotype represented by such words as "progress" and "perfection" was composed fundamentally of mechanical inventions. And mechanical it has remained, on the whole, to this day. In America more than anywhere else, the spectacle of mechanical progress has made so deep an impression, that it has suffused the whole moral code. An American will endure almost any insult except the charge that he is not progressive. Be he of long native ancestry, or a recent immigrant, the aspect that has always struck his eye is the immense physical growth of American civilization. That constitutes a fundamental stereotype through which he views the world: the country village will become the great metropolis, the modest building a skyscraper, what is small shall be big; what is slow shall be fast; what is poor shall be rich; what is few shall be many; whatever is shall be more so.</p>
<p class="normal3">当然，并非每个美国人都这样看世界。亨利·亚当斯不是，威廉·艾伦·怀特也不是。但那些在宣扬成功宗教的杂志上被称为美国缔造者的人们却是这样的。他们宣扬进化、进步、繁荣、建设性、美国做事的方式，大概就是这个意思。这很容易让人发笑，但事实上，他们运用了一种非常伟大的人类努力模式。一方面，它采用了一种非个人的标准；另一方面，它采用了一种世俗的标准；第三，它使人们习惯于定量思考。诚然，这种理想混淆了卓越与规模、幸福与速度、人性与机械装置。然而，起作用的动机与任何道德准则都是相同的，而且这些道德准则曾经或将来也会如此。渴望最大、最快、最高，或者如果你是手表或显微镜制造商，渴望最小；简而言之，最高级和“无与伦比的”爱情，本质上可能是一种高尚的激情。</p><p class="normal3">Not every American, of course, sees the world this way. Henry Adams didn't, and William Allen White doesn't. But those men do, who in the magazines devoted to the religion of success appear as Makers of America. They mean just about that when they preach evolution, progress, prosperity, being constructive, the American way of doing things. It is easy to laugh, but, in fact, they are using a very great pattern of human endeavor. For one thing it adopts an impersonal criterion; for another it adopts an earthly criterion; for a third it is habituating men to think quantitatively. To be sure the ideal confuses excellence with size, happiness with speed, and human nature with contraption. Yet the same motives are at work which have ever actuated any moral code, or ever will. The desire for the biggest, the fastest, the highest, or if you are a maker of wristwatches or microscopes the smallest; the love in short of the superlative and the "peerless," is in essence and possibility a noble passion.</p>
<p class="normal3">当然，美国版的进步与经济状况和人性中大量的事实相吻合。它把异常多的好斗、贪婪和权力欲转化为生产性工作。直到最近，它才严重挫败了社区积极成员的积极性。他们创造了一种文明，为创造它的人提供了他们认为在工作、交配和娱乐中充分满足的东西，他们战胜高山、荒野、距离和人类竞争的冲动甚至使宗教情感的一部分成为一种与宇宙目的相通的感觉。这种模式在理想、实践和结果的顺序上取得了近乎完美的成功，以至于任何对它的挑战都被称为非美国式的。</p><p class="normal3">Certainly the American version of progress has fitted an extraordinary range of facts in the economic situation and in human nature. It turned an unusual amount of pugnacity, acquisitiveness, and lust of power into productive work. Nor has it, until more recently perhaps, seriously frustrated the active nature of the active members of the community. They have made a civilization which provides them who made it with what they feel to be ample satisfaction in work, mating and play, and the rush of their victory over mountains, wildernesses, distance, and human competition has even done duty for that part of religious feeling which is a sense of communion with the purpose of the universe. The pattern has been a success so nearly perfect in the sequence of ideals, practice, and results, that any challenge to it is called un-American.</p>
<p class="normal3">然而，这种模式是一种非常片面和不充分的描述世界的方式。习惯于将进步视为“发展”，这意味着环境的许多方面被忽视了。由于“进步”的刻板印象，美国人在大众眼中几乎没有看到与这种进步不符的东西。他们看到城市的扩张，但没有看到贫民窟的增加；他们为人口普查数据欢呼，但拒绝考虑过度拥挤的问题；他们自豪地指出他们的增长，但看不到离开家乡的人口或未被同化的移民。他们疯狂地扩张工业，不计后果地消耗自然资源；他们建立了巨型公司，却没有安排好劳资关系。他们成长为地球上最强大的国家之一，却没有为结束孤立状态做好机构或思想准备。他们在道德和身体上都没有做好准备就跌跌撞撞地卷入了世界大战，他们再次跌跌撞撞地退出，大失所望，但经验却没有增加多少。</p><p class="normal3">And yet, this pattern is a very partial and inadequate way of representing the world. The habit of thinking about progress as "development" has meant that many aspects of the environment were simply neglected. With the stereotype of "progress" before their eyes, Americans have in the mass seen little that did not accord with that progress. They saw the expansion of cities, but not the accretion of slums; they cheered the census statistics, but refused to consider overcrowding; they pointed with pride to their growth, but would not see the drift from the land, or the unassimilated immigration. They expanded industry furiously at reckless cost to their natural resources; they built up gigantic corporations without arranging for industrial relations. They grew to be one of the most powerful nations on earth without preparing their institutions or their minds for the ending of their isolation. They stumbled into the World War morally and physically unready, and they stumbled out again, much disillusioned, but hardly more experienced.</p>
<p class="normal3">在世界大战中，美国刻板印象的正反两方面影响显而易见。认为只要招募无限数量的军队、筹集无限数量的贷款、建造无限数量的舰船、生产无限数量的军火，并无限集中精力于这些就能赢得战争的想法符合传统的刻板印象，并产生了类似物理奇迹的东西。但在那些受刻板印象影响最深的人中，没有空间去考虑胜利的果实是什么，或者如何实现它们。因此，目标被忽视，或被视为自动实现，胜利被认为是战场上的毁灭性胜利，因为刻板印象要求如此。在和平时期，你不会问最快的汽车有什么用，在战争中，你也不会问最彻底的胜利有什么用。然而，在巴黎，这种模式并不符合事实。在和平时期，你可以无休止地用大的东西取代小的东西，用更大的东西取代大的东西；在战争中，当你赢得了绝对的胜利时，你就不可能再取得更绝对的胜利。你必须按照完全不同的模式做事。如果你没有这样的模式，战争的结束对你来说就像对许多好人一样，是一个沉闷而毫无趣味的世界里的败笔。</p><p class="normal3">In the World War the good and the evil influence of the American stereotype was plainly visible. The idea that the war could be won by recruiting unlimited armies, raising unlimited credits, building an unlimited number of ships, producing unlimited munitions, and concentrating without limit on these alone, fitted the traditional stereotype, and resulted in something like a physical miracle. But among those most affected by the stereotype, there was no place for the consideration of what the fruits of victory were, or how they were to be attained. Therefore, aims were ignored, or regarded as automatic, and victory was conceived, because the stereotype demanded it, as nothing but an annihilating victory in the field. In peace time you did not ask what the fastest motor car was for, and in war you did not ask what the completest victory was for. Yet in Paris the pattern did not fit the facts. In peace you can go on endlessly supplanting small things with big ones, and big ones with bigger ones; in war when you have won absolute victory, you cannot go on to a more absolute victory. You have to do something on an entirely different pattern. And if you lack such a pattern, the end of the war is to you what it was to so many good people, an anticlimax in a dreary and savorless world.</p>
<p class="normal3">这标志着刻板印象和不容忽视的事实最终分道扬镳的临界点。总是存在这样的临界点，因为我们对事物行为的想象比事物的涨落更简单、更固定。因此，总有那么一个时刻，盲点会从视野的边缘延伸到中心。那时，除非有敢于发出警报的批评家、能够理解变化的领导人和习惯宽容的人民，否则刻板印象不但不能像 1917 年和 1918 年那样节省精力、集中精力，反而可能会使努力受挫、浪费人们的精力，就像它对那些在 1919 年呼吁迦太基和平、在 1921 年谴责凡尔赛条约的人所做的那样。</p><p class="normal3">This marks the point where the stereotype and the facts, that cannot be ignored, definitely part company. There is always such a point, because our images of how things behave are simpler and more fixed than the ebb and flow of affairs. There comes a time, therefore, when the blind spots come from the edge of vision into the center. Then unless there are critics who have the courage to sound an alarm, and leaders capable of understanding the change, and a people tolerant by habit, the stereotype, instead of economizing effort, and focussing energy as it did in 1917 and 1918, may frustrate effort and waste men's energy by blinding them, as it did for those people who cried for a Carthaginian peace in 1919 and deplored the Treaty of Versailles in 1921.</p>

<p class="normal3">如果不加批判地坚持这种刻板印象，它不仅会屏蔽掉许多需要考虑的因素，而且当清算日到来时，这种刻板印象被打破，它所明智考虑的因素很可能也会随之崩塌。这就是萧伯纳先生对自由贸易、自由契约、自由竞争、自然自由、自由放任和达尔文主义的惩罚。一百年前，当他肯定是这些学说最尖锐的拥护者之一时，他不会像今天，在异教徒半个世纪中那样，认为这些学说是“肆无忌惮地‘打压他人’的借口，指导政府的一切干预，除警察组织之外的所有组织，以保护合法欺诈免受殴打，所有试图将人类的目的、设计和深思熟虑引入工业混乱的行为都是‘违反政治经济规律’”。那么，作为向天堂平原进军的先驱之一，他会看到，在像维多利亚女王叔叔那样的政府中，人类的目的、设计和深思熟虑越少越好。他会看到，不是强者打压弱者，而是愚蠢的人打压强者。他会看到，目的、设计和深思熟虑在起作用，阻碍发明，阻碍企业，阻碍他肯定会认识到的创造进化的下一步。</p><p class="normal3">Uncritically held, the stereotype not only censors out much that needs to be taken into account, but when the day of reckoning comes, and the stereotype is shattered, likely as not that which it did wisely take into account is ship-wrecked with it. That is the punishment assessed by Mr. Bernard Shaw against Free Trade, Free Contract, Free Competition, Natural Liberty, Laissez-faire, and Darwinism. A hundred years ago, when he would surely have been one of the tartest advocates of these doctrines, he would not have seen them as he sees them to-day, in the Infidel Half Century, to be excuses for "'doing the other fellow down' with impunity, all interference by a guiding government, all organization except police organization to protect legalized fraud against fisticuffs, all attempt to introduce human purpose and design and forethought into the industrial welter being 'contrary to the laws of political economy'" He would have seen, then, as one of the pioneers of the march to the plains of heaven that, of the kind of human purpose and design and forethought to be found in a government like that of Queen Victoria's uncles, the less the better. He would have seen, not the strong doing the weak down, but the foolish doing the strong down. He would have seen purposes, designs and forethoughts at work, obstructing invention, obstructing enterprise, obstructing what he would infallibly have recognized as the next move of Creative Evolution.</p>
<p class="normal3">即便现在，萧伯纳也不太热衷于他所知道的任何指导性政府的指导，但在理论上，他完全反对自由放任主义。战前最先进的思想也同样反对既定观念，即如果你放开一切，智慧就会涌现，建立和谐。战后，在审查员、宣传员和间谍的帮助下，罗巴克·拉姆斯登和自然自由主义以其明确的指导性政府表现重新被纳入严肃思想家的行列。</p><p class="normal3">Even now Mr. Shaw is none too eager for the guidance of any guiding government he knows, but in theory he has turned a full loop against laissez-faire. Most advanced thinking before the war had made the same turn against the established notion that if you unloosed everything, wisdom would bubble up, and establish harmony. Since the war, with its definite demonstration of guiding governments, assisted by censors, propagandists, and spies, Roebuck Ramsden and Natural Liberty have been readmitted to the company of serious thinkers.</p>
<p class="normal3">这些周期有一个共同点。在每一套刻板印象中，都有一个点，在这个点上，努力停止，事情自然发生，就像你希望的那样。进步的刻板印象，有力地激励工作，几乎完全抹杀了决定做什么工作和为什么工作的尝试。自由放任主义，一种摆脱愚蠢官僚主义的幸运，认为人们会自发地走向预先确定的和谐。集体主义，一种对抗无情自私的解药，在马克思主义者看来，它似乎假设了一种经济决定论，即社会主义官员的效率和智慧。强大的政府，国内外的帝国主义，在最好的情况下，深刻意识到混乱的代价，最终依赖于这样一种观念，即被统治者所关心的一切都会被统治者知道。在每一种理论中，都有一丝盲目的自动化。</p><p class="normal3">One thing is common to these cycles. There is in each set of stereotypes a point where effort ceases and things happen of their own accord, as you would like them to. The progressive stereotype, powerful to incite work, almost completely obliterates the attempt to decide what work and why that work. Laissez-faire, a blessed release from stupid officialdom, assumes that men will move by spontaneous combustion towards a pre-established harmony. Collectivism, an antidote to ruthless selfishness, seems, in the Marxian mind, to suppose an economic determinism towards efficiency and wisdom on the part of socialist officials. Strong government, imperialism at home and abroad, at its best deeply conscious of the price of disorder, relies at last on the notion that all that matters to the governed will be known by the governors. In each theory there is a spot of blind automatism.</p>
<p class="normal3">那个盲点掩盖了一些事实，如果考虑到这一点，就会抑制刻板印象所激发的重大运动。如果进步人士必须像笑话中的中国人一样扪心自问，他想用打破纪录节省下来的时间做什么，如果自由放任主义的倡导者不仅要考虑人类自由和旺盛的能量，还要考虑一些人所说的人类本性，如果集体主义者将注意力集中在如何保护官员的问题上，如果帝国主义者敢于怀疑自己的灵感，那么你会发现更多的哈姆雷特而不是亨利五世。因为这些盲点可以避免分散注意力的形象，这些形象及其伴随的情绪可能会导致犹豫和目标不明确。因此，刻板印象不仅可以在忙碌的生活中节省时间，捍卫我们在社会中的地位，而且还可以保护我们免受试图稳定地看待世界和看待世界整体所带来的所有令人困惑的影响。</p><p class="normal3">That spot covers up some fact, which if it were taken into account, would check the vital movement that the stereotype provokes. If the progressive had to ask himself, like the Chinaman in the joke, what he wanted to do with the time he saved by breaking the record, if the advocate of laissez-faire had to contemplate not only free and exuberant energies of men, but what some people call their human nature, if the collectivist let the center of his attention be occupied with the problem of how he is to secure his officials, if the imperialist dared to doubt his own inspiration, you would find more Hamlet and less Henry the Fifth. For these blind spots keep away distracting images, which with their attendant emotions, might cause hesitation and infirmity of purpose. Consequently the stereotype not only saves time in a busy life and is a defense of our position in society, but tends to preserve us from all the bewildering effect of trying to see the world steadily and see it whole.</p>

The shape of a hat, a slightly characteristic gait, evoked the vivid picture in his mind's eye. In sleep a tinkle may sound like the pealing of a great bell; the distant stroke of a hammer like a thunderclap. For our constellations of imagery will vibrate to a stimulus that is perhaps but vaguely similar to some aspect of them. They may, in hallucination, flood the whole consciousness. They may enter very little into perception, though I am inclined to think that such an experience is extremely rare and highly sophisticated, as when we gaze blankly at a familiar word or object, and it gradually ceases to be familiar. Certainly for the most part, the way we see things is a combination of what is there and of what we expected to find. The heavens are not the same to an astronomer as to a pair of lovers; a page of Kant will start a different train of thought in a Kantian and in a radical empiricist; the Tahitian belle is a better looking person to her Tahitian suitor than to the readers of the <i class="calibre10">National Geographic Magazine</i>

<p class="normal3">事实上，任何学科的专业知识都是我们准备发现的方面数量的乘积，加上低估我们期望的习惯。对于无知的人来说，所有事物看起来都一样，生活就是一件接一件的事情，而对于专家来说，事物是高度个性化的。对于司机、美食家、鉴赏家、总统内阁成员或教授的妻子来说，存在着明显的差异和品质，而对于讨论汽车、葡萄酒、老大师、共和党人和大学教职员工的普通人来说，这些差异和品质根本不明显。</p><p class="normal3">Expertness in any subject is, in fact, a multiplication of the number of aspects we are prepared to discover, plus the habit of discounting our expectations. Where to the ignoramus all things look alike, and life is just one thing after another, to the specialist things are highly individual. For a chauffeur, an epicure, a connoisseur, a member of the President's cabinet, or a professor's wife, there are evident distinctions and qualities, not at all evident to the casual person who discusses automobiles, wines, old masters, Republicans, and college faculties.</p>
<p class="normal3">但在我们的公众舆论中，很少有人能成为专家，而正如萧伯纳先生所言，生命如此短暂。那些专家只精通少数几个话题。即使在专家士兵中，正如我们在战争期间所了解到的，精通骑兵的人也不一定擅长堑壕战和坦克。事实上，有时对一个小话题的一点点精通可能只是夸大了我们正常的人类习惯，即试图把所有能挤进我们刻板印象的东西塞进去，把不合适的东西抛到外面的黑暗中。</p><p class="normal3">But in our public opinions few can be expert, while life is, as Mr. Bernard Shaw has made plain, so short. Those who are expert are so on only a few topics. Even among the expert soldiers, as we learned during the war, expert cavalrymen were not necessarily brilliant with trench-warfare and tanks. Indeed, sometimes a little expertness on a small topic may simply exaggerate our normal human habit of trying to squeeze into our stereotypes all that can be squeezed, and of casting into outer darkness that which does not fit.</p>
<p class="normal3">如果不仔细观察，我们就会倾向于借助于我们脑海中已有的图像来想象我们所熟悉的一切。因此，美国人对进步和成功的看法中，对人性和社会有着明确的描述。正是这种人性和这种社会逻辑上产生了被认为是理想的进步。然后，当我们试图描述或解释真正成功的人和真正发生的事件时，我们会从他们身上读出刻板印象中预设的品质。</p><p class="normal3">Whatever we recognize as familiar we tend, if we are not very careful, to visualize with the aid of images already in our mind. Thus in the American view of Progress and Success there is a definite picture of human nature and of society. It is the kind of human nature and the kind of society which logically produce the kind of progress that is regarded as ideal. And then, when we seek to describe or explain actually successful men, and events that have really happened, we read back into them the qualities that are presupposed in the stereotypes.</p>
<p class="normal3">老一辈经济学家对这些品质进行了相当天真的标准化。他们开始描述他们所处的社会制度，发现它太复杂了，无法用语言描述。因此，他们构建了一个他们真诚希望简化的图表，在原则和真实性上与儿童画的复杂奶牛的有腿和头的平行四边形没有太大区别。该方案由一位努力从自己的劳动中节省资本的资本家、一位设想社会有用需求并组织工厂的企业家、一群自由签订劳动合同、接受或放弃劳动的工人、一位房东和一群消费者组成，他们在最便宜的市场上购买那些通过现成的快乐-痛苦计算而知道会给他们带来最大快乐的商品。这个模型奏效了。在描述该模型的书中，模型所假设的那种人生活在模型所假设的那种世界中，总是和谐地合作。</p><p class="normal3">These qualities were standardized rather innocently by the older economists. They set out to describe the social system under which they lived, and found it too complicated for words. So they constructed what they sincerely hoped was a simplified diagram, not so different in principle and in veracity from the parallelogram with legs and head in a child's drawing of a complicated cow. The scheme consisted of a capitalist who had diligently saved capital from his labor, an entrepreneur who conceived a socially useful demand and organized a factory, a collection of workmen who freely contracted, take it or leave it, for their labor, a landlord, and a group of consumers who bought in the cheapest market those goods which by the ready use of the pleasure-pain calculus they knew would give them the most pleasure. The model worked. The kind of people, which the model assumed, living in the sort of world the model assumed, invariably cooperated harmoniously in the books where the model was described.</p>
<p class="normal3">经济学家们为了简化思维而对这一纯粹的虚构进行了修改和粉饰，然后将其传播开来，直到它成为当时大部分人的经济神话。它为资本家、推动者、工人和消费者提供了一个标准版本，而这个社会自然更热衷于获得成功，而不是解释成功。不断拔地而起的大楼和不断增加的银行账户证明了人们对成功的看法是正确的。而那些从成功中获益最多的人开始相信他们就是他们应该成为的那种人。难怪成功人士的真诚朋友在阅读官方传记和讣告时，不得不克制自己不去问这是否真的是他们的朋友。</p><p class="normal3">With modification and embroidery, this pure fiction, used by economists to simplify their thinking, was retailed and popularized until for large sections of the population it prevailed as the economic mythology of the day. It supplied a standard version of capitalist, promoter, worker and consumer in a society that was naturally more bent on achieving success than on explaining it. The buildings which rose, and the bank accounts which accumulated, were evidence that the stereotype of how the thing had been done was accurate. And those who benefited most by success came to believe they were the kind of men they were supposed to be. No wonder that the candid friends of successful men, when they read the official biography and the obituary, have to restrain themselves from asking whether this is indeed their friend.</p>

<p class="normal3">对于失败者和受害者来说，官方的描绘当然是无法辨认的。因为那些代表进步的人往往不会停下来思考他们是否按照经济学家或其他同样值得称道的人所制定的路线前进，而那些失败的人却在思考。威廉·詹姆斯说：“没有人能比自己对细节的了解更深入地理解概括。”工业巨头们把大托拉斯看作是他们成功的纪念碑；他们失败的竞争对手则认为是他们失败的纪念碑。因此，大企业主们阐述大企业的节约和美德，要求不受干扰，说他们是繁荣的推动者和贸易的开发者。失败者坚持托拉斯的浪费和残酷，并大声呼吁司法部将企业从阴谋中解放出来。在同样的情形下，一方看到了进步、节约和辉煌的发展；另一方看到了反动、奢侈和贸易的限制。大量的统计数据和有关真实真相和内部真相、更深层和更大的真相的轶事被发表出来以证明双方的论点。</p><p class="normal3">To the vanquished and the victims, the official portraiture was, of course, unrecognizable. For while those who exemplified progress did not often pause to inquire whether they had arrived according to the route laid down by the economists, or by some other just as creditable, the unsuccessful people did inquire. "No one," says William James, "sees further into a generalization than his own knowledge of detail extends." The captains of industry saw in the great trusts monuments of (their) success; their defeated competitors saw the monuments of (their) failure. So the captains expounded the economies and virtues of big business, asked to be let alone, said they were the agents of prosperity, and the developers of trade. The vanquished insisted upon the wastes and brutalities of the trusts, and called loudly upon the Department of Justice to free business from conspiracies. In the same situation one side saw progress, economy, and a splendid development; the other, reaction, extravagance, and a restraint of trade. Volumes of statistics, anecdotes about the real truth and the inside truth, the deeper and the larger truth, were published to prove both sides of the argument.</p>
<p class="normal3">因为当一套刻板印象体系牢固确立时，我们的注意力就会被吸引到那些支持它的事实上，而远离那些与之相反的事实。所以，也许正是因为他们善于发现这一点，善良的人才会发现善良的那么多理由，恶意的人才会发现恶意的那么多理由。我们说得非常准确，就是戴着玫瑰色的眼镜，或者带着偏见看问题。如果像菲利普·利特尔曾经写过一位杰出教授那样，我们透过一个黑暗的阶级来看待生活，我们对最优秀人和下层阶级的刻板印象就不会被理解所污染。陌生的东西会被拒绝，不同的东西会落在无知的眼睛上。我们看不到我们的眼睛不习惯考虑的东西。有时是有意识的，更多的时候是无意识的，我们会对那些符合我们哲学的事实印象深刻。</p><p class="normal3">For when a system of stereotypes is well fixed, our attention is called to those facts which support it, and diverted from those which contradict. So perhaps it is because they are attuned to find it, that kindly people discover so much reason for kindness, malicious people so much malice. We speak quite accurately of seeing through rose-colored spectacles, or with a jaundiced eye. If, as Philip Littell once wrote of a distinguished professor, we see life as through a class darkly, our stereotypes of what the best people and the lower classes are like will not be contaminated by understanding. What is alien will be rejected, what is different will fall upon unseeing eyes. We do not see what our eyes are not accustomed to take into account. Sometimes consciously, more often without knowing it, we are impressed by those facts which fit our philosophy.</p>

<p class="normal3">这种哲学是一系列或多或少有组织的图像，用于描述看不见的世界。但不仅用于描述它。也用于判断它。因此，刻板印象充满了偏爱，充满了爱或厌恶，与恐惧、欲望、强烈的愿望、骄傲、希望联系在一起。任何引起刻板印象的事物都会以适当的情绪来判断。除非我们故意保持偏见，否则我们不会研究一个人并判断他是坏人。我们看到一个坏人。我们看到一个露水的早晨，一个脸红的少女，一个圣洁的牧师，一个没有幽默感的英国人，一个危险的红色人，一个无忧无虑的波西米亚人，一个懒惰的印度人，一个狡猾的东方人，一个做梦的斯拉夫人，一个反复无常的爱尔兰人，一个贪婪的犹太人，一个 100% 的美国人。在日常世界中，这往往是真正的判断，远远领先于证据，它本身就包含了证据肯定会证实的结论。正义、仁慈和真理都不能参与这样的判断，因为判断先于证据。然而，一个没有偏见的民族，一个具有完全中立观点的民族，在任何值得思考的文明中都是不可想象的，以至于任何教育方案都不可能建立在这种理想之上。偏见可以被发现、消除和提炼，但只要有限的人必须将应对广阔文明的准备压缩到短期学校教育中，他们就必须随身携带这种文明的形象，并有偏见。他们思考和行动的质量将取决于这些偏见是否友好，是否对其他人、对其他思想友好，是否唤起对他们认为是积极善的事物的热爱，而不是对他们认为的善中没有的东西的仇恨。</p><p class="normal3">This philosophy is a more or less organized series of images for describing the unseen world. But not only for describing it. For judging it as well. And, therefore, the stereotypes are loaded with preference, suffused with affection or dislike, attached to fears, lusts, strong wishes, pride, hope. Whatever invokes the stereotype is judged with the appropriate sentiment. Except where we deliberately keep prejudice in suspense, we do not study a man and judge him to be bad. We see a bad man. We see a dewy morn, a blushing maiden, a sainted priest, a humorless Englishman, a dangerous Red, a carefree bohemian, a lazy Hindu, a wily Oriental, a dreaming Slav, a volatile Irishman, a greedy Jew, a 100% American. In the workaday world that is often the real judgment, long in advance of the evidence, and it contains within itself the conclusion which the evidence is pretty certain to confirm. Neither justice, nor mercy, nor truth, enter into such a judgment, for the judgment has preceded the evidence. Yet a people without prejudices, a people with altogether neutral vision, is so unthinkable in any civilization of which it is useful to think, that no scheme of education could be based upon that ideal. Prejudice can be detected, discounted, and refined, but so long as finite men must compress into a short schooling preparation for dealing with a vast civilization, they must carry pictures of it around with them, and have prejudices. The quality of their thinking and doing will depend on whether those prejudices are friendly, friendly to other people, to other ideas, whether they evoke love of what is felt to be positively good, rather than hatred of what is not contained in their version of the good.</p>
<p class="normal3">道德、良好品味和良好形式首先规范化，然后强调某些潜在的偏见。当我们调整自己以适应我们的准则时，我们也会调整我们看到的事实以适应该准则。理性地说，事实对于我们对是非的所有看法都是中立的。实际上，我们的准则在很大程度上决定了我们将感知什么以及如何感知。</p><p class="normal3">Morality, good taste and good form first standardize and then emphasize certain of these underlying prejudices. As we adjust ourselves to our code, we adjust the facts we see to that code. Rationally, the facts are neutral to all our views of right and wrong. Actually, our canons determine greatly what we shall perceive and how.</p>
<p class="normal3">因为道德准则是一套适用于许多典型情况的行为体系。按照准则行事就是服务于准则所追求的任何目的。它可能是上帝的旨意，也可能是国王的意志，也可能是个人在一个美好、坚实、立体的天堂中的救赎，也可能是人间的成功，也可能是为人类服务。无论如何，准则的制定者会确定某些典型情况，然后通过某种形式的推理或直觉，推断出会产生他们认可的目标的行为类型。规则适用于适用的地方。</p><p class="normal3">For a moral code is a scheme of conduct applied to a number of typical instances. To behave as the code directs is to serve whatever purpose the code pursues. It may be God's will, or the king's, individual salvation in a good, solid, three dimensional paradise, success on earth, or the service of mankind. In any event the makers of the code fix upon certain typical situations, and then by some form of reasoning or intuition, deduce the kind of behavior which would produce the aim they acknowledge. The rules apply where they apply.</p>
<p class="normal3">但在日常生活中，一个人如何知道他所处的困境是否正是立法者所设想的？他被告知不要杀人。但如果他的孩子受到袭击，他可以杀人来阻止杀戮吗？十诫对这一点只字未提。因此，围绕每一条法典，都有一群解释者推断出更具体的案例。那么，假设法律博士决定他可以出于自卫而杀人。对于下一个人来说，疑问几乎同样巨大；他如何知道他对自卫的定义是正确的，或者他没有误判事实，没有想象出袭击，他真的是侵略者？也许他挑起了袭击。但什么是挑衅？正是这些混乱在 1914 年 8 月感染了大多数德国人的思想。</p><p class="normal3">But in daily living how does a man know whether his predicament is the one the law-giver had in mind? He is told not to kill. But if his children are attacked, may he kill to stop a killing? The Ten Commandments are silent on the point. Therefore, around every code there is a cloud of interpreters who deduce more specific cases. Suppose, then, that the doctors of the law decide that he may kill in self-defense. For the next man the doubt is almost as great; how does he know that he is defining self-defense correctly, or that he has not misjudged the facts, imagined the attack, and is really the aggressor? Perhaps he has provoked the attack. But what is a provocation? Exactly these confusions infected the minds of most Germans in August, 1914.</p>
<p class="normal3">在现代社会，比任何道德准则的差异更为严重的是，对准则所适用的事实的假设存在差异。宗教、道德和政治公式之间的差异，并不比其信奉者所假设的事实大。因此，有益的讨论不是比较理想，而是重新审视事实的观点。因此，己所不欲勿施于人这一规则基于人性是一致的这一信念。萧伯纳先生说，己所不欲勿施于人，因为他们的品味可能不同，这一说法基于人性不是一致的这一信念。竞争是贸易的生命这一格言包含了大量关于经济动机、劳资关系和特定商业体系运作的假设。除非商船是私人所有和管理的，否则美国永远不会拥有商船队，这一说法假设了某种盈利和激励之间存在某种已证实的联系。布尔什维克宣传家为独裁、间谍和恐怖进行辩护，因为“每个国家都是暴力机器”，这是一个历史判断，其真实性对于非共产主义者来说绝非不言而喻。</p><p class="normal3">Far more serious in the modern world than any difference of moral code is the difference in the assumptions about facts to which the code is applied. Religious, moral and political formulae are nothing like so far apart as the facts assumed by their votaries. Useful discussion, then, instead of comparing ideals, reexamines the visions of the facts. Thus the rule that you should do unto others as you would have them do unto you rests on the belief that human nature is uniform. Mr. Bernard Shaw's statement that you should not do unto others what you would have them do unto you, because their tastes may be different, rests on the belief that human nature is not uniform. The maxim that competition is the life of trade consists of a whole tome of assumptions about economic motives, industrial relations, and the working of a particular commercial system. The claim that America will never have a merchant marine, unless it is privately owned and managed, assumes a certain proved connection between a certain kind of profit-making and incentive. The justification by the bolshevik propagandist of the dictatorship, espionage, and the terror, because "every state is an apparatus of violence" is an historical judgment, the truth of which is by no means self-evident to a non-communist.</p>
<p class="normal3">每一条道德准则的核心都是一幅人性的图景、一幅宇宙地图和一段历史。道德准则的规则适用于人性（构想的那种）、宇宙（想象的那种）、历史（如此理解的那种）。只要人格、环境和记忆的事实不同，道德准则的规则就很难成功应用。现在，每一条道德准则都必须以某种方式构想人类心理、物质世界和传统。但在受科学影响的准则中，概念被认为是一种假设，而在未经检验的过去或从思想洞穴中冒出来的准则中，概念并不被视为需要证明或反驳的假设，而是一种毫无疑问接受的虚构。在前一种情况下，人类对自己的信仰很谦虚，因为他知道这些信仰是暂时的和不完整的；在另一种情况下，人类很武断，因为他的信仰是一个完整的神话。服从科学纪律的道德家知道，尽管他并非无所不知，但他正在阻碍了解某些事物；教条主义者利用神话，相信自己分享了部分全知的洞察力，尽管他缺乏区分真相和谬误的标准。因为神话的显著特征是，真理和谬误、事实和寓言、报道和幻想都处于同一可信度水平。</p><p class="normal3">At the core of every moral code there is a picture of human nature, a map of the universe, and a version of history. To human nature (of the sort conceived), in a universe (of the kind imagined), after a history (so understood), the rules of the code apply. So far as the facts of personality, of the environment and of memory are different, by so far the rules of the code are difficult to apply with success. Now every moral code has to conceive human psychology, the material world, and tradition some way or other. But in the codes that are under the influence of science, the conception is known to be an hypothesis, whereas in the codes that come unexamined from the past or bubble up from the caverns of the mind, the conception is not taken as an hypothesis demanding proof or contradiction, but as a fiction accepted without question. In the one case, man is humble about his beliefs, because he knows they are tentative and incomplete; in the other he is dogmatic, because his belief is a completed myth. The moralist who submits to the scientific discipline knows that though he does not know everything, he is in the way of knowing something; the dogmatist, using a myth, believes himself to share part of the insight of omniscience, though he lacks the criteria by which to tell truth from error. For the distinguishing mark of a myth is that truth and error, fact and fable, report and fantasy, are all on the same plane of credibility.</p>
<p class="normal3">那么，神话不一定是假的。它可能完全真实。也可能部分真实。如果它长期影响了人类的行为，那么它几乎肯定会包含许多深刻而重要的真实内容。神话从来不具备区分真相与谬误的批判能力。因为只有认识到没有任何人类观点，无论其假定来源如何，都过于崇高而无法通过证据检验，每种观点都只是某人的观点，才能获得这种能力。如果你问为什么证据检验比其他任何检验都更好，除非你愿意使用检验来检验它，否则没有答案。</p><p class="normal3">The myth is, then, not necessarily false. It might happen to be wholly true. It may happen to be partly true. If it has affected human conduct a long time, it is almost certain to contain much that is profoundly and importantly true. What a myth never contains is the critical power to separate its truths from its errors. For that power comes only by realizing that no human opinion, whatever its supposed origin, is too exalted for the test of evidence, that every opinion is only somebody's opinion. And if you ask why the test of evidence is preferable to any other, there is no answer unless you are willing to use the test in order to test it.</p>

<p class="normal3">我认为，有充分的证据证明，道德准则假定了对事实的特定看法。道德准则包括所有类型的准则：个人、家庭、经济、职业、法律、爱国和国际。每种准则的核心都是关于心理学、社会学和历史的刻板印象。我们所有的准则很少都坚持相同的人性、制度或传统观点。例如，比较一下经济准则和爱国准则。有一场战争应该对所有人产生同样的影响。两个人是生意伙伴。一个参军，另一个签订了战争合同。士兵牺牲了一切，甚至牺牲了自己的生命。他每天只得到一美元，没有人说，也没有人相信，任何形式的经济激励都能让他成为一名更好的士兵。这种动机从他的人性中消失了。承包商牺牲很少，得到的利润远高于成本，几乎没有人说或相信，如果没有经济激励，他会生产军火。这对他来说可能不公平。关键在于，公认的爱国准则假定了一种人性，而商业准则则假定了另一种人性。这些准则可能在某种程度上建立在真实的期望之上，即当一个人采用某种准则时，他往往会表现出准则所要求的那种人性。</p><p class="normal3">The statement is, I think, susceptible of overwhelming proof, that moral codes assume a particular view of the facts. Under the term moral codes I include all kinds: personal, family, economic, professional, legal, patriotic, international. At the center of each there is a pattern of stereotypes about psychology, sociology, and history. The same view of human nature, institutions or tradition rarely persists through all our codes. Compare, for example, the economic and the patriotic codes. There is a war supposed to affect all alike. Two men are partners in business. One enlists, the other takes a war contract. The soldier sacrifices everything, perhaps even his life. He is paid a dollar a day, and no one says, no one believes, that you could make a better soldier out of him by any form of economic incentive. That motive disappears out of his human nature. The contractor sacrifices very little, is paid a handsome profit over costs, and few say or believe that he would produce the munitions if there were no economic incentive. That may be unfair to him. The point is that the accepted patriotic code assumes one kind of human nature, the commercial code another. And the codes are probably founded on true expectations to this extent, that when a man adopts a certain code he tends to exhibit the kind of human nature which the code demands.</p>
<p class="normal3">这就是为什么对人性进行概括是如此危险的原因之一。慈爱的父亲可能是一个脾气暴躁的老板，一个热心的市政改革者，一个贪婪的海外沙文主义者。他的家庭生活、他的商业生涯、他的政治和外交政策都基于对他人的看法和他应该如何行事的完全不同的理解。这些看法在同一个人身上因准则而异，同一社会群体中的人之间准则略有不同，不同社会群体之间准则也大不相同，两个国家或两种肤色之间的差异可能大到没有任何共同的假设。这就是为什么信奉相同宗教信仰的人会开战的原因。他们的信仰中决定行为的因素是他们对事实的看法。</p><p class="normal3">That is one reason why it is so dangerous to generalize about human nature. A loving father can be a sour boss, an earnest municipal reformer, and a rapacious jingo abroad. His family life, his business career, his politics, and his foreign policy rest on totally different versions of what others are like and of how he should act. These versions differ by codes in the same person, the codes differ somewhat among persons in the same social set, differ widely as between social sets, and between two nations, or two colors, may differ to the point where there is no common assumption whatever. That is why people professing the same stock of religious beliefs can go to war. The element of their belief which determines conduct is that view of the facts which they assume.</p>
<p class="normal3">正是在这里，规范如此巧妙而广泛地介入了舆论的形成。正统理论认为，舆论构成了对一组事实的道德判断。我提出的理论是，在目前的教育状态下，舆论主要是事实的道德化和规范化版本。我认为，我们规范核心的刻板印象模式在很大程度上决定了我们将看到哪一组事实，以及我们将以何种眼光看待它们。这就是为什么，尽管怀着世界上最好的意愿，杂志的新闻政策倾向于支持其编辑政策；为什么资本家看到一组事实，而人性的某些方面确实看到了这些事实；他的社会主义对手看到另一组事实和其他方面，为什么每个人都认为对方是不合理或不正当的，而他们之间的真正区别只是感知的不同。这种差异是由资本主义和社会主义刻板印象模式的差异造成的。“美国没有阶级，”一位美国编辑写道。 《共产党宣言》说：“迄今为止现存社会的历史都是阶级斗争的历史。”如果你的头脑中有编辑的模式，你就会清楚地看到证实它的事实，而与之相反的事实则会模糊而无效地看到。如果你有共产主义模式，你不仅会寻找不同的东西，而且你会以完全不同的重点看到你和编辑碰巧看到的共同点。</p><p class="normal3">That is where codes enter so subtly and so pervasively into the making of public opinion. The orthodox theory holds that a public opinion constitutes a moral judgment on a group of facts. The theory I am suggesting is that, in the present state of education, a public opinion is primarily a moralized and codified version of the facts. I am arguing that the pattern of stereotypes at the center of our codes largely determines what group of facts we shall see, and in what light we shall see them. That is why, with the best will in the world, the news policy of a journal tends to support its editorial policy; why a capitalist sees one set of facts, and certain aspects of human nature, literally sees them; his socialist opponent another set and other aspects, and why each regards the other as unreasonable or perverse, when the real difference between them is a difference of perception. That difference is imposed by the difference between the capitalist and socialist pattern of stereotypes. "There are no classes in America," writes an American editor. "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles," says the Communist Manifesto. If you have the editor's pattern in your mind, you will see vividly the facts that confirm it, vaguely and ineffectively those that contradict. If you have the communist pattern, you will not only look for different things, but you will see with a totally different emphasis what you and the editor happen to see in common.</p>

<p class="normal3">而且，由于我的道德体系建立在我接受的事实版本之上，所以，对我而言，否认我的道德判断或事实版本的人是反常的、异类的、危险的。我该如何解释他呢？对手总是需要解释的，而我们寻求的最后一个解释是，他看到了一组不同的事实。我们避免这样的解释，因为它削弱了我们对自己已经稳定地、全面地看待生活的基础的信心。只有当我们习惯于将我们的观点视为通过刻板印象看到的部分经验时，我们才会真正容忍对手。如果没有这种习惯，我们就会相信我们自己观点的绝对主义，从而相信所有反对意见的危险性。因为虽然人们愿意承认“问题”有两面，但他们不相信他们所认为的“事实”有两面。他们从来不相信这一点，直到经过长期的批判性教育，他们才充分意识到自己对社会数据的理解是多么的二手和主观。</p><p class="normal3">And since my moral system rests on my accepted version of the facts, he who denies either my moral judgments or my version of the facts, is to me perverse, alien, dangerous. How shall I account for him? The opponent has always to be explained, and the last explanation that we ever look for is that he sees a different set of facts. Such an explanation we avoid, because it saps the very foundation of our own assurance that we have seen life steadily and seen it whole. It is only when we are in the habit of recognizing our opinions as a partial experience seen through our stereotypes that we become truly tolerant of an opponent. Without that habit, we believe in the absolutism of our own vision, and consequently in the treacherous character of all opposition. For while men are willing to admit that there are two sides to a "question," they do not believe that there are two sides to what they regard as a "fact." And they never do believe it until after long critical education, they are fully conscious of how second-hand and subjective is their apprehension of their social data.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，当两派都清楚地看到各自的方面，并对他们所看到的事物做出自己的解释时，他们几乎不可能诚实地相信对方。如果模式在关键时刻符合他们的经验，他们就不再将其视为一种解释。他们将其视为“现实”。它可能与现实并不相似，除非它最终得出一个符合真实经验的结论。我可以用地图上的一条直线来表示我从纽约到波士顿的旅程，就像一个人可能把他的胜利视为一条笔直狭窄的道路的终点一样。我实际去波士顿的那条路可能绕了很多弯路，拐了很多弯，就像他的道路可能除了纯粹的进取、劳动和节俭之外还涉及很多事情。但只要我到达波士顿，他也能成功，那条航线和那条笔直的道路就可以作为现成的图表。只有当有人试图追随它们，却没有到达时，我们才必须回答反对意见。如果我们坚持我们的图表，而他坚持拒绝，我们很快就会认为他是个危险的傻瓜，而他会认为我们是骗子和伪君子。因此，我们逐渐互相描绘。因为对手将自己表现为说“恶即是善”的人。他是一个不适合事物计划的讨厌鬼。然而他却干扰了。而且由于该计划在我们心中是建立在无可辩驳的事实之上，并以不可抗拒的逻辑为后盾，所以必须在计划中为他找到一些位置。在政治或劳资纠纷中，很少会因为简单承认他看待过同样的现实，但看到了它的另一个方面而为他找到一席之地。那会动摇整个计划。</p><p class="normal3">So where two factions see vividly each its own aspect, and contrive their own explanations of what they see, it is almost impossible for them to credit each other with honesty. If the pattern fits their experience at a crucial point, they no longer look upon it as an interpretation. They look upon it as "reality." It may not resemble the reality, except that it culminates in a conclusion which fits a real experience. I may represent my trip from New York to Boston by a straight line on a map, just as a man may regard his triumph as the end of a straight and narrow path. The road by which I actually went to Boston may have involved many detours, much turning and twisting, just as his road may have involved much besides pure enterprise, labor and thrift. But provided I reach Boston and he succeeds, the airline and the straight path will serve as ready made charts. Only when somebody tries to follow them, and does not arrive, do we have to answer objections. If we insist on our charts, and he insists on rejecting them, we soon tend to regard him as a dangerous fool, and he to regard us as liars and hypocrites. Thus we gradually paint portraits of each other. For the opponent presents himself as the man who says, evil be thou my good. He is an annoyance who does not fit into the scheme of things. Nevertheless he interferes. And since that scheme is based in our minds on incontrovertible fact fortified by irresistible logic, some place has to be found for him in the scheme. Rarely in politics or industrial disputes is a place made for him by the simple admission that he has looked upon the same reality and seen another aspect of it. That would shake the whole scheme.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，对在巴黎的意大利人来说，阜姆是意大利的。它不仅仅是一个值得纳入意大利王国的城市。它本身就是意大利的。他们把全部注意力都集中在城市合法边界内的意大利多数人群身上。美国代表在纽约见到的意大利人比在阜姆见到的还多，但他们并不认为纽约是意大利的，而是把目光投向了阜姆，将其视为欧洲中部的入境口岸。他们清楚地看到了郊区和非意大利腹地的南斯拉夫人。因此，巴黎的一些意大利人需要对美国人的乖僻行为给出令人信服的解释。他们在一个谣言中找到了答案，这个谣言的起源无人知晓，说一位有影响力的美国外交官被一位南斯拉夫情妇所蒙蔽。有人见过她……有人见过他……就在凡尔赛大道旁……那座长满大树的别墅。</p><p class="normal3">Thus to the Italians in Paris Fiume was Italian It was not merely a city that it would be desirable to include within the Italian kingdom. It was Italian. They fixed their whole mind upon the Italian majority within the legal boundaries of the city itself. The American delegates, having seen more Italians in New York than there are in Fiume, without regarding New York as Italian, fixed their eyes on Fiume as a central European port of entry. They saw vividly the Jugoslavs in the suburbs and the non-Italian hinterland. Some of the Italians in Paris were therefore in need of a convincing explanation of the American perversity. They found it in a rumor which started, no one knows where, that an influential American diplomat was in the snares of a Jugoslav mistress. She had been seen…. He had been seen…. At Versailles just off the boulevard. … The villa with the large trees.</p>
<p class="normal3">这是为反对意见辩解的常用方式。这些指控在诽谤性更强的形式下很少出现在报纸上，罗斯福可能要等上几年，哈丁可能要等上几个月，才能迫使政府采取行动，结束已经渗透到各个谈话圈子的流言蜚语。公众人物必须忍受大量恶毒的俱乐部、餐桌和闺房诽谤，这些诽谤被反复提及、详细阐述、引人发笑，并被视为美味佳肴。虽然我认为这种事情在美国不如在欧洲普遍，但很少有美国官员不被人重复丑闻。</p><p class="normal3">This is a rather common way of explaining away opposition. In their more libelous form such charges rarely reach the printed page, and a Roosevelt may have to wait years, or a Harding months, before he can force an issue, and end a whispering campaign that has reached into every circle of talk. Public men have to endure a fearful amount of poisonous clubroom, dinner table, boudoir slander, repeated, elaborated, chuckled over, and regarded as delicious. While this sort of thing is, I believe, less prevalent in America than in Europe, yet rare is the American official about whom somebody is not repeating a scandal.</p>
<p class="normal3">我们把反对派塑造成恶棍和阴谋家。如果物价无情上涨，奸商们就密谋了；如果报纸歪曲新闻，那就有资本主义的阴谋；如果富人太富有，他们就一直在偷窃；如果一场势均力敌的选举失败了，那选民就被腐蚀了；如果一个政客做了你不赞成的事情，那他就是被某个声名狼藉的人收买或影响了。如果工人焦躁不安，那他们就是煽动者的受害者；如果他们在广大地区焦躁不安，那一定有阴谋在酝酿。如果你生产的飞机不够，那是间谍干的；如果爱尔兰出现问题，那是德国或布尔什维克的“黄金”。如果你仔细观察，疯狂地寻找阴谋，你会发现，所有的罢工、普拉姆计划、爱尔兰叛乱、穆罕默德暴动、康斯坦丁国王复辟、国际联盟、墨西哥动乱、裁军运动、周日电影、短裙、逃避酒类管制法、黑人自强不息，都是莫斯科、罗马、共济会、日本人或锡安长老会策划的宏伟阴谋下的子阴谋。</p><p class="normal3">Out of the opposition we make villains and conspiracies. If prices go up unmercifully the profiteers have conspired; if the newspapers misrepresent the news, there is a capitalist plot; if the rich are too rich, they have been stealing; if a closely fought election is lost, the electorate was corrupted; if a statesman does something of which you disapprove, he has been bought or influenced by some discreditable person. If workingmen are restless, they are the victims of agitators; if they are restless over wide areas, there is a conspiracy on foot. If you do not produce enough aeroplanes, it is the work of spies; if there is trouble in Ireland, it is German or Bolshevik "gold." And if you go stark, staring mad looking for plots, you see all strikes, the Plumb plan, Irish rebellion, Mohammedan unrest, the restoration of King Constantine, the League of Nations, Mexican disorder, the movement to reduce armaments, Sunday movies, short skirts, evasion of the liquor laws, Negro self-assertion, as sub-plots under some grandiose plot engineered either by Moscow, Rome, the Free Masons, the Japanese, or the Elders of Zion.</p>

<p class="normal3">经验丰富的外交官被迫大声向交战的人民讲话，学会了如何使用大量的陈词滥调。他们面对的是岌岌可危的强国联盟，每个联盟都只能靠最谨慎的领导来维持其战争团结。普通士兵和他的妻子，英勇无私，超越了英雄史册上的任何记载，但他们仍然没有足够的英雄气概，无法为了外国驻外机构所说的对文明未来至关重要的所有理念而欣然面对死亡。那里有港口、矿山、岩石山口和村庄，很少有士兵愿意穿越无人区为他们的盟友夺取这些地方。</p><p class="normal3">Skilled diplomatists, compelled to talk out loud to the warring peoples, learned how to use a large repertory of stereotypes. They were dealing with a precarious alliance of powers, each of which was maintaining its war unity only by the most careful leadership. The ordinary soldier and his wife, heroic and selfless beyond anything in the chronicles of courage, were still not heroic enough to face death gladly for all the ideas which were said by the foreign offices of foreign powers to be essential to the future of civilization. There were ports, and mines, rocky mountain passes, and villages that few soldiers would willingly have crossed No Man's Land to obtain for their allies.</p>
<p class="normal3">现在，在一个国家，控制着外交部、最高指挥部和大多数媒体的主战派，对几个邻国的领土提出了主权要求。有教养的阶层把这些领土称为大鲁里塔尼亚，他们认为吉卜林、特赖奇克和莫里斯·巴雷斯是百分之百的鲁里塔尼亚人。但这个宏伟的想法并没有在国外引起热情。因此，正如他们的桂冠诗人所说，鲁里塔尼亚的政治家们把鲁里塔尼亚天才的这朵最优秀的花朵放在心上，开始分而治之。他们把领土划分成几个部分。对于每一部分，他们都援引了他们的一个或多个盟友难以抗拒的刻板印象，因为这个盟友有自己的主权要求，希望通过使用同样的刻板印象来获得认可。</p><p class="normal3">Now it happened in one nation that the war party which was in control of the foreign office, the high command, and most of the press, had claims on the territory of several of its neighbors. These claims were called the Greater Ruritania by the cultivated classes who regarded Kipling, Treitschke, and Maurice Barres as one hundred percent Ruritanian. But the grandiose idea aroused no enthusiasm abroad. So holding this finest flower of the Ruritanian genius, as their poet laureate said, to their hearts, Ruritania's statesmen went forth to divide and conquer. They divided the claim into sectors. For each piece they invoked that stereotype which some one or more of their allies found it difficult to resist, because that ally had claims for which it hoped to find approval by the use of this same stereotype.</p>
<p class="normal3">第一部分恰好是一片居住着外来农民的山区。鲁里塔尼亚要求将其作为其自然地理边界的补充。如果你长时间关注自然的不可言喻的价值，那些外来农民就会消失在雾中，只能看到山坡。下一个部分居住着鲁里塔尼亚人，根据任何民族都不应生活在外来统治下的原则，他们被重新吞并。接下来是一个具有相当重要商业意义的城市，鲁里塔尼亚人并没有居住。但直到十八世纪，它一直是鲁里塔尼亚的一部分，根据历史权利的原则，它被吞并。再往前，有一个由外国人拥有和开采的优质矿藏。根据损害赔偿的原则，它被吞并。在此之外，有一块 97% 的领土居住着外国人，构成了另一个国家的自然地理边界，历史上从未成为鲁里塔尼亚的一部分。但鲁里塔尼亚联邦中的一个省份以前曾在这些市场上进行贸易，上层阶级的文化是鲁里塔尼亚文化。基于文化优越性和捍卫文明的必要性，这些土地被占领。最后，有一个港口在地理、种族、经济、历史和传统上与鲁里塔尼亚完全脱节。要求建立这个港口的理由是需要国防。</p><p class="normal3">The first sector happened to be a mountainous region inhabited by alien peasants. Ruritania demanded it to complete her natural geographical frontier. If you fixed your attention long enough on the ineffable value of what is natural, those alien peasants just dissolved into fog, and only the slope of the mountains was visible. The next sector was inhabited by Ruritanians, and on the principle that no people ought to live under alien rule, they were re-annexed. Then came a city of considerable commercial importance, not inhabited by Ruritanians. But until the Eighteenth Century it had been part of Ruritania, and on the principle of Historic Right it was annexed. Farther on there was a splendid mineral deposit owned by aliens and worked by aliens. On the principle of reparation for damage it was annexed. Beyond this there was a territory inhabited 97% by aliens, constituting the natural geographical frontier of another nation, never historically a part of Ruritania. But one of the provinces which had been federated into Ruritania had formerly traded in those markets, and the upper class culture was Ruritanian. On the principle of cultural superiority and the necessity of defending civilization, the lands were claimed. Finally, there was a port wholly disconnected from Ruritania geographically, ethnically, economically, historically, traditionally. It was demanded on the ground that it was needed for national defense.</p>
<p class="normal3">在结束第一次世界大战的条约中，你可以举出很多这样的例子。现在，我并不想暗示我认为可以始终如一地按照这些原则中的任何一个来重新安置欧洲。我确信不可能。这些如此自命不凡和绝对的原则的使用本身就意味着和解的精神没有占上风，因此，和平的实质并不存在。当你开始讨论工厂、矿山、山脉甚至政治权威作为某个永恒原则的完美例子时，你不是在争论，而是在战斗。那个永恒的原则会排除所有的反对意见，将问题与其背景和环境隔离开来，并在你心中激起某种强烈的情感，这种情感与原则相符，与码头、仓库和房地产极不相符。从这种情绪开始，你就无法停止。存在着真正的危险。为了应对它，你必须援引更绝对的原则来捍卫那些可能受到攻击的东西。然后你必须保卫防线，建立缓冲区，并为缓冲区建立缓冲区，直到整个事件变得如此混乱，以至于打架似乎比继续谈话更不危险。</p><p class="normal3">In the treaties that concluded the Great War you can multiply examples of this kind. Now I do not wish to imply that I think it was possible to resettle Europe consistently on any one of these principles. I am certain that it was not. The very use of these principles, so pretentious and so absolute, meant that the spirit of accommodation did not prevail and that, therefore, the substance of peace was not there. For the moment you start to discuss factories, mines, mountains, or even political authority, as perfect examples of some eternal principle or other, you are not arguing, you are fighting. That eternal principle censors out all the objections, isolates the issue from its background and its context, and sets going in you some strong emotion, appropriate enough to the principle, highly inappropriate to the docks, warehouses, and real estate. And having started in that mood you cannot stop. A real danger exists. To meet it you have to invoke more absolute principles in order to defend what is open to attack. Then you have to defend the defenses, erect buffers, and buffers for the buffers, until the whole affair is so scrambled that it seems less dangerous to fight than to keep on talking.</p>
<p class="normal3">某些线索通常有助于发现刻板印象的虚假绝对主义。在鲁里塔尼亚宣传中，各种原则如此迅速地相互覆盖，以至于人们很容易看出论点是如何构建的。一系列矛盾表明，对于每个领域，都采用了刻板印象，这将抹杀所有干扰主张的事实。这种矛盾通常是一个很好的线索。</p><p class="normal3">There are certain clues which often help in detecting the false absolutism of a stereotype. In the case of the Ruritanian propaganda the principles blanketed each other so rapidly that one could readily see how the argument had been constructed. The series of contradictions showed that for each sector that stereotype was employed which would obliterate all the facts that interfered with the claim. Contradiction of this sort is often a good clue.</p>

<p class="normal3">另一个原因是无法考虑空间因素。例如，1918 年春，许多人对俄国撤退感到震惊，要求“重建东线”。他们设想的战争是两条战线，当其中一条战线消失时，立即有人要求重建。失业的日本军队将代替俄国军队驻守前线。但有一个无法克服的障碍。符拉迪沃斯托克和东线战线之间有五千英里的国土，一条铁路断了。然而，这五千英里不会留在狂热分子的脑海中。他们坚信东线战线是必要的，他们对日本军队的英勇无畏充满信心，以至于在心理上，他们把这支军队从符拉迪沃斯托克投射到波兰，就像是乘坐魔毯一样。我们的军事当局徒劳地争辩说，将军队登陆西伯利亚边缘与到达德国人几乎没有关系，就像从地下室爬到伍尔沃斯大楼的屋顶与到达月球几乎没有关系一样。</p><p class="normal3">Inability to take account of space is another. In the spring of 1918, for example, large numbers of people, appalled by the withdrawal of Russia, demanded the "reestablishment of an Eastern Front." The war, as they had conceived it, was on two fronts, and when one of them disappeared there was an instant demand that it be recreated. The unemployed Japanese army was to man the front, substituting for the Russian. But there was one insuperable obstacle. Between Vladivostok and the eastern battleline there were five thousand miles of country, spanned by one broken down railway. Yet those five thousand miles would not stay in the minds of the enthusiasts. So overwhelming was their conviction that an eastern front was needed, and so great their confidence in the valor of the Japanese army, that, mentally, they had projected that army from Vladivostok to Poland on a magic carpet. In vain our military authorities argued that to land troops on the rim of Siberia had as little to do with reaching the Germans, as climbing from the cellar to the roof of the Woolworth building had to do with reaching the moon.</p>
<p class="normal3">这次战争的刻板印象是两线作战。自从人们开始想象第一次世界大战以来，他们就认为德国夹在法国和俄罗斯之间。一代或两代战略家一直以这种视觉形象作为他们所有计算的起点。近四年来，他们看到的每一张作战地图都加深了他们这就是战争的印象。当事态发生新的转变时，很难再像当时那样看待它们。人们是通过刻板印象来看待它们的，与之相矛盾的事实，例如从日本到波兰的距离，无法生动地进入人们的意识。</p><p class="normal3">The stereotype in this instance was the war on two fronts. Ever since men had begun to imagine the Great War they had conceived Germany held between France and Russia. One generation of strategists, and perhaps two, had lived with that visual image as the starting point of all their calculations. For nearly four years every battle-map they saw had deepened the impression that this was the war. When affairs took a new turn, it was not easy to see them as they were then. They were seen through the stereotype, and facts which conflicted with it, such as the distance from Japan to Poland, were incapable of coming vividly into consciousness.</p>
<p class="normal3">值得注意的是，美国当局比法国当局更现实地处理新事实。部分原因是（1914 年之前）他们没有对大陆上发生战争的先入为主的观念；部分原因是美国人全神贯注于动员军队，对西线的看法本身就是刻板印象，使<i class="calibre10">他们</i>
 对其他战场没有任何生动的认识。1918 年春天，这种美国观点无法与传统的法国观点相抗衡，因为虽然美国人对自己的力量深信不疑，但当时的法国人（在康蒂尼和第二次马恩河战役之前）却对此深表怀疑。美国人的自信弥漫在美国刻板印象中，赋予它拥有意识的力量、活力和明智的刺激、对意志的刺激作用、作为欲望对象的情感兴趣、与手头活动的一致性，詹姆斯指出，这些都是我们认为“真实”的特征。法国人绝望地坚持他们所接受的形象。当事实、粗略的地理事实与先入之见不符时，他们要么被排除在外，要么事实本身被扭曲。因此，日本人到达五千英里外的德国人的困难在一定程度上被德国人带往半路以外的地区所克服。1918 年 3 月至 6 月间，据说有一支德国军队在东西伯利亚作战。这支幻影军队由一些实际看到的德国战俘、更多想象中的德国战俘组成，主要是因为人们误以为这五千英里的距离并不存在。</p><p class="normal3">It is interesting to note that the American authorities dealt with the new facts more realistically than the French. In part, this was because (previous to 1914) they had no preconception of a war upon the continent; in part because the Americans, engrossed in the mobilization of their forces, had a vision of the western front which was itself a stereotype that excluded from <i class="calibre10">their</i>
 consciousness any very vivid sense of the other theatres of war. In the spring of 1918 this American view could not compete with the traditional French view, because while the Americans believed enormously in their own powers, the French at that time (before Cantigny and the Second Marne) had the gravest doubts. The American confidence suffused the American stereotype, gave it that power to possess consciousness, that liveliness and sensible pungency, that stimulating effect upon the will, that emotional interest as an object of desire, that congruity with the activity in hand, which James notes as characteristic of what we regard as "real." The French in despair remained fixed on their accepted image. And when facts, gross geographical facts, would not fit with the preconception, they were either censored out of mind, or the facts were themselves stretched out of shape. Thus the difficulty of the Japanese reaching the Germans five thousand miles away was, in measure, overcome by bringing the Germans more than half way to meet them. Between March and June 1918, there was supposed to be a German army operating in Eastern Siberia. This phantom army consisted of some German prisoners actually seen, more German prisoners thought about, and chiefly of the delusion that those five thousand intervening miles did not really exist.</p>

<p class="normal3">真正理解空间并非易事。如果我在地图上从孟买到香港画一条直线并测量距离，我根本无法知道我航行需要经过的距离。即使我测量了必须穿越的实际距离，在知道有哪些船只在运行、它们何时开航、它们行驶的速度有多快、我是否能找到住处并支付得起费用之前，我仍然一无所知。在实际生活中，空间是一个可用的交通工具问题，而不是几何平面问题，就像那位老铁路大亨在威胁要让一个冒犯他的城市的街道上长草时所知道的那样。如果我开车问离目的地有多远，我会骂那个告诉我有三英里却没有提到六英里绕行路线的人是个十足的傻瓜。如果告诉我步行距离是三英里，那对我来说毫无意义。我还不如告诉我直线距离是一英里。我不会像乌鸦一样飞，也不会像步行一样。我必须知道，对于汽车来说，这是九英里，而且，如果是这样的话，其中六英里是车辙和水坑。我会把告诉我是三英里的行人称为讨厌鬼，并认为告诉我是一英里的飞行员是可恶的。他们俩都在谈论他们必须覆盖的空间，而不是我必须覆盖的空间。</p><p class="normal3">A true conception of space is not a simple matter. If I draw a straight line on a map between Bombay and Hong Kong and measure the distance, I have learned nothing whatever about the distance I should have to cover on a voyage. And even if I measure the actual distance that I must traverse, I still know very little until I know what ships are in the service, when they run, how fast they go, whether I can secure accommodation and afford to pay for it. In practical life space is a matter of available transportation, not of geometrical planes, as the old railroad magnate knew when he threatened to make grass grow in the streets of a city that had offended him. If I am motoring and ask how far it is to my destination, I curse as an unmitigated booby the man who tells me it is three miles, and does not mention a six mile detour. It does me no good to be told that it is three miles if you walk. I might as well be told it is one mile as the crow flies. I do not fly like a crow, and I am not walking either. I must know that it is nine miles for a motor car, and also, if that is the case, that six of them are ruts and puddles. I call the pedestrian a nuisance who tells me it is three miles and think evil of the aviator who told me it was one mile. Both of them are talking about the space they have to cover, not the space I must cover.</p>
<p class="normal3">在划定边界线时，由于未能了解一个地区的实际地理情况，出现了荒谬的复杂情况。根据自决等一般公式，政治家们在不同时期在地图上划线，当现场测量时，这些线穿过工厂中间、村庄街道中心、教堂中殿对角线或农民小屋厨房和卧室之间。在放牧国家，有将牧场与水、牧场与市场分开的边界，在工业国家，有将铁路终点站与铁路分开的边界。在彩色民族地图上，这条线在民族上是公正的，也就是说，在那个民族地图的世界中是公正的。</p><p class="normal3">In the drawing of boundary lines absurd complications have arisen through failure to conceive the practical geography of a region. Under some general formula like self-determination statesmen have at various times drawn lines on maps, which, when surveyed on the spot, ran through the middle of a factory, down the center of a village street, diagonally across the nave of a church, or between the kitchen and bedroom of a peasant's cottage. There have been frontiers in a grazing country which separated pasture from water, pasture from market, and in an industrial country, railheads from railroad. On the colored ethnic map the line was ethnically just, that is to say, just in the world of that ethnic map.</p>

<p class="normal3">但是时间，和空间一样，情况很糟糕。一个常见的例子是，一个人试图通过制定一份详尽的遗嘱来控制他死后的钱财。他的曾孙亨利·詹姆斯写道：“威廉·詹姆斯一世的目的是让他的孩子们（他去世时，其中几个还未成年）通过勤奋和经验获得资格，享受他希望留给他们的大笔遗产，为此，他留下了一份遗嘱，里面充满了限制和指示。他由此表明，他对自己判断的信心和对后代道德福祉的关心是多么强烈。”法院推翻了遗嘱。因为法律在反对永久继承时，承认允许任何人将自己的道德模板强加于未知的未来，其用处是有明显的限制的。但强加这种模板的愿望是一种非常人性化的特性，如此人性化以至于法律允许它在死后有限的时间内发挥作用。</p><p class="normal3">But time, no less than space, fares badly. A common example is that of the man who tries by making an elaborate will to control his money long after his death. "It had been the purpose of the first William James," writes his great-grandson Henry James, "to provide that his children (several of whom were under age when he died) should qualify themselves by industry and experience to enjoy the large patrimony which he expected to bequeath to them, and with that in view he left a will which was a voluminous compound of restraints and instructions. He showed thereby how great were both his confidence in his own judgment and his solicitude for the moral welfare of his descendants." The courts upset the will. For the law in its objection to perpetuities recognizes that there are distinct limits to the usefulness of allowing anyone to impose his moral stencil upon an unknown future. But the desire to impose it is a very human trait, so human that the law permits it to operate for a limited time after death.</p>
<p class="normal3">任何宪法的修正条款都是作者对其观点在后代影响范围的信心的一个很好的指标。我相信，美国有些州的宪法几乎无法修正。制定这些宪法的人可能对时间的变迁知之甚少：对他们来说，此时此刻是如此确定，而来世是如此模糊或可怕，以至于他们有勇气说出他们死后的生活应该如何过。而且由于宪法难以修正，热心于永生的人喜欢在这块不朽的铜板上写下各种规则和限制，只要对未来保持一点谦逊的态度，这些规则和限制就不应该比普通的法令更永久。</p><p class="normal3">The amending clause of any constitution is a good index of the confidence the authors entertained about the reach of their opinions in the succeeding generations. There are, I believe, American state constitutions which are almost incapable of amendment. The men who made them could have had but little sense of the flux of time: to them the Here and Now was so brilliantly certain, the Hereafter so vague or so terrifying, that they had the courage to say how life should run after they were gone. And then because constitutions are difficult to amend, zealous people with a taste for mortmain have loved to write on this imperishable brass all kinds of rules and restrictions that, given any decent humility about the future, ought to be no more permanent than an ordinary statute.</p>
<p class="normal3">我们普遍持有一种关于时间的假设。对一个人来说，一个在他的整个有意识的生活中一直存在的制度是宇宙中永恒不变的家具的一部分；对另一个人来说，它却是短暂的。地质时间与生物时间截然不同。社会时间是最复杂的。政治家必须决定是为紧急情况计算还是为长远考虑。有些决定必须根据接下来两个小时会发生什么来做出；其他决定则要根据一周、一个月、一个季节、十年后会发生什么，当孩子长大成人或他们的孩子的孩子长大成人时。智慧的一个重要部分是能够区分真正属于手头事物的时间概念。使用错误时间概念的人从忽视现在的梦想家到什么都看不见的庸人。真正的价值尺度对相对时间有着非常敏锐的感觉。</p><p class="normal3">A presumption about time enters widely into our opinions. To one person an institution which has existed for the whole of his conscious life is part of the permanent furniture of the universe: to another it is ephemeral. Geological time is very different from biological time. Social time is most complex. The statesman has to decide whether to calculate for the emergency or for the long run. Some decisions have to be made on the basis of what will happen in the next two hours; others on what will happen in a week, a month, a season, a decade, when the children have grown up, or their children's children. An important part of wisdom is the ability to distinguish the time-conception that properly belongs to the thing in hand. The person who uses the wrong time-conception ranges from the dreamer who ignores the present to the philistine who can see nothing else. A true scale of values has a very acute sense of relative time.</p>
<p class="normal3">遥远的时间，过去和未来，必须以某种方式来构想。但正如詹姆斯所说，“对于较长的时间，我们没有直接的‘实现’感。”我们立即感受到的最长的时间是所谓的“似是而非的现在”。根据铁钦纳的说法，它持续了大约六秒钟。“这段时间内的所有印象都<i class="calibre10">同时</i>呈现在我们
 面前。这使我们能够感知变化和事件以及静止的物体。感知的现在由概念的现在补充。通过将感知与记忆图像相结合，过去的整天、整月甚至整年都被带入现在。”</p><p class="normal3">Distant time, past and future, has somehow to be conceived. But as James says, "of the longer duration we have no direct 'realizing' sense." The longest duration which we immediately feel is what is called the "specious present." It endures, according to Titchener, for about six seconds. "All impressions within this period of time are present to us <i class="calibre10">at once</i>
 . This makes it possible for us to perceive changes and events as well as stationary objects. The perceptual present is supplemented by the ideational present. Through the combination of perceptions with memory images, entire days, months, and even years of the past are brought together into the present."</p>
<p class="normal3">在这种观念上的现在，正如詹姆斯所说，生动性与我们在其中感知到的辨别数量成正比。因此，一个我们无聊无所事事的假期在我们度过时过得很慢，但在记忆中却似乎很短暂。大活动会迅速消磨时间，但在记忆中它持续的时间很长。关于我们辨别的数量和我们的时间观之间的关系，詹姆斯有一段有趣的文字：</p><p class="normal3">In this ideational present, vividness, as James said, is proportionate to the number of discriminations we perceive within it. Thus a vacation in which we were bored with nothing to do passes slowly while we are in it, but seems very short in memory. Great activity kills time rapidly, but in memory its duration is long. On the relation between the amount we discriminate and our time perspective James has an interesting passage:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">“我们有充分的理由认为，生物在直觉上感觉到的持续时间长度和可能填充的事件的精细程度上可能存在巨大差异。冯·贝尔对这种差异对自然面貌的影响进行了一些有趣的计算。假设我们能够在一秒钟的时间内清楚地注意到 10,000 个事件，而不是像现在这样仅仅 10 个；如果我们的生命注定要容纳相同数量的印象，那么它可能会短 1000 倍。我们的寿命应该不到一个月，而且个人对季节的变化一无所知。如果出生在冬天，我们应该相信夏天，就像我们现在相信石炭纪的炎热一样。有机生物的运动对于我们的感觉来说是如此缓慢，以至于只能推断，而不能看到。太阳会在天空中静止不动，月亮几乎没有变化，等等。但现在反过来假设，假设一个生物只得到我们感觉的千分之一在他看来，冬天和夏天就像一刻钟那么短。蘑菇和生长更快的植物会迅速生长，看起来像是瞬间的产物；一年生灌木会像不停沸腾的泉水一样从地上升起和落下；动物的运动就像我们看不见子弹和炮弹的运动一样；太阳会像流星一样划过天空，身后留下一条火红的轨迹，等等。”</p>
</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">"We have every reason to think that creatures may possibly differ enormously in the amounts of duration which they intuitively feel, and in the fineness of the events that may fill it. Von Baer has indulged in some interesting computations of the effect of such differences in changing the aspect of Nature. Suppose we were able, within the length of a second, to note 10,000 events distinctly, instead of barely 10 as now; if our life were then destined to hold the same number of impressions, it might be 1000 times as short. We should live less than a month, and personally know nothing of the change of seasons. If born in winter, we should believe in summer as we now believe in the heats of the carboniferous era. The motions of organic beings would be so slow to our senses as to be inferred, not seen. The sun would stand still in the sky, the moon be almost free from change, and so on. But now reverse the hypothesis and suppose a being to get only one 1000th part of the sensations we get in a given time, and consequently to live 1000 times as long. Winters and summers will be to him like quarters of an hour. Mushrooms and the swifter growing plants will shoot into being so rapidly as to appear instantaneous creations; annual shrubs will rise and fall from the earth like restless boiling water springs; the motions of animals will be as invisible as are to us the movements of bullets and cannon-balls; the sun will scour through the sky like a meteor, leaving a fiery trail behind him, etc."</p>

<p class="normal3">在他的《历史大纲》中，韦尔斯先生做出了巨大的努力，试图形象化“历史时间与地质时间的真实比例”。如果用三英寸的空间来表示从哥伦布到我们今天的时间，读者必须走 55 英尺才能看到阿尔塔马拉洞穴画家的年代，走 550 英尺才能看到更早的尼安德特人，走一英里左右才能看到最后的恐龙。或多或少精确的年代学直到公元前 1000 年之后才开始，而那时“阿卡德-苏美尔帝国的萨尔贡一世是一个遥远的记忆，……比君士坦丁大帝离当今世界还要遥远……汉谟拉比已经死了一千年……英格兰的巨石阵已经有一千年的历史了。”</p><p class="normal3">In his Outline of History Mr. Wells has made a gallant effort to visualize "the true proportions of historical to geological time" On a scale which represents the time from Columbus to ourselves by three inches of space, the reader would have to walk 55 feet to see the date of the painters of the Altamara caves, 550 feet to see the earlier Neanderthalers, a mile or so to the last of the dinosaurs. More or less precise chronology does not begin until after 1000 B.C., and at that time "Sargon I of the Akkadian-Sumerian Empire was a remote memory,… more remote than is Constantine the Great from the world of the present day…. Hammurabi had been dead a thousand years… Stonehedge in England was already a thousand years old."</p>
<p class="normal3">威尔斯先生的写作是有目的的。“在短短的一万年中，这些单位（人类结合而成的单位）从早期新石器文化的小家族部落发展成为当今庞大的联合王国——虽然庞大，但仍然太小，太片面。”威尔斯先生希望通过改变我们当前问题的时间观来改变道德观。然而，天文时间测量、地质时间、生物时间，任何将现在最小化的望远镜测量并不比微观时间“更真实”。西米恩·斯特伦斯基先生坚持认为“如果威尔斯先生正在考虑他的副标题《人类可能的未来》，他有权要求用多少个世纪来解决问题。如果他正在考虑挽救这个在第一次世界大战的影响下摇摇欲坠的西方文明，他必须考虑几十年和几十年。”这完全取决于你采用这种测量的实际目的。有些情况下需要延长时间视角，而其他情况下则需要缩短时间视角。</p><p class="normal3">Mr. Wells was writing with a purpose. "In the brief period of ten thousand years these units (into which men have combined) have grown from the small family tribe of the early neolithic culture to the vast united realms—vast yet still too small and partial—of the present time." Mr. Wells hoped by changing the time perspective on our present problems to change the moral perspective. Yet the astronomical measure of time, the geological, the biological, any telescopic measure which minimizes the present is not "more true" than a microscopic. Mr. Simeon Strunsky is right when he insists that "if Mr. Wells is thinking of his subtitle, The Probable Future of Mankind, he is entitled to ask for any number of centuries to work out his solution. If he is thinking of the salvaging of this western civilization, reeling under the effects of the Great War, he must think in decades and scores of years." It all depends upon the practical purpose for which you adopt the measure. There are situations when the time perspective needs to be lengthened, and others when it needs to be shortened.</p>
<p class="normal3">有人说，即使有 1500 万中国人死​​于饥荒，也无所谓，因为两代人之后，出生率就会弥补这一损失。这个人用时间观念来为自己的惰性辩解。一个人因为眼前的困难而让一个健康的年轻人陷入贫困，他忘记了这个乞丐的生命有多长。那些为了眼前的和平，愿意放纵侵略性帝国的胃口来收买它的人们，让一个华而不实的现实干扰了他们孩子的和平。那些对麻烦的邻居没有耐心，想把一切都“摊牌”的人，同样也是华而不实的现实的受害者。</p><p class="normal3">The man who says that it does not matter if 15,000,000 Chinese die of famine, because in two generations the birthrate will make up the loss, has used a time perspective to excuse his inertia. A person who pauperizes a healthy young man because he is sentimentally overimpressed with an immediate difficulty has lost sight of the duration of the beggar's life. The people who for the sake of an immediate peace are willing to buy off an aggressive empire by indulging its appetite have allowed a specious present to interfere with the peace of their children. The people who will not be patient with a troublesome neighbor, who want to bring everything to a "showdown" are no less the victims of a specious present.</p>

<p class="normal3">几乎每一个社会问题都涉及到时间的正确计算。假设，例如，这是一个木材问题。有些树长得比其他树快。那么，一个合理的森林政策就是，每个季节砍伐的每种树种和每种树龄的树木数量，都通过重新种植来弥补。只要这个计算正确，就达到了最真实的节约。砍伐少是浪费，砍伐多是剥削。但可能会出现紧急情况，比如战争中需要飞机云杉，这时必须超过一年的限额。一个警觉的政府会认识到这一点，并把恢复平衡视为对未来的负担。</p><p class="normal3">Into almost every social problem the proper calculation of time enters. Suppose, for example, it is a question of timber. Some trees grow faster than others. Then a sound forest policy is one in which the amount of each species and of each age cut in each season is made good by replanting. In so far as that calculation is correct the truest economy has been reached. To cut less is waste, and to cut more is exploitation. But there may come an emergency, say the need for aeroplane spruce in a war, when the year's allowance must be exceeded. An alert government will recognize that and regard the restoration of the balance as a charge upon the future.</p>
<p class="normal3">煤炭涉及不同的时间理论，因为煤炭与树木不同，是按照地质时间尺度生产的。煤炭的供应是有限的。因此，正确的社会政策需要对世界可用储量、预计的可能性、目前的使用率、目前的使用经济性和替代燃料进行复杂的计算。但是，当计算结果出来后，它必须最终与涉及时间的理想标准相一致。例如，假设工程师得出结论，目前的燃料正在以一定的速度耗尽；除非有新的发现，否则工业将不得不在未来某个确定的时间进入收缩阶段。那么，我们必须确定，在采取了所有可行的经济措施之后，我们将使用多少节俭和自我克制，以免掠夺后代。但是，我们应该把后代看作什么呢？我们的孙子？我们的曾孙？也许我们会决定以一百年为单位来计算，相信如果立即明确了必要性，那么这足以发现替代燃料。当然，这些数字是假设的。但是，在这样计算时，我们将运用我们拥有的理由。我们将在公众舆论中赋予社会时间一席之地。现在让我们想象一个略有不同的情况：一个城市与一家有轨电车公司之间的合同。该公司表示，除非获得主干道九十九年的垄断权，否则它不会投资。在提出这一要求的人看来，九十九年的时间太长，意味着“永远”。但是，假设有理由认为，由轨道上的中央发电厂运行的地面车将在二十年后过时。那么，这是一份最不明智的合同，因为你实际上是在让后代不得不使用劣质的交通工具。在签订这样的合同时，城市官员缺乏对九十九年的现实意识。现在给公司补贴以吸引资本远比通过放纵虚假的永恒感来刺激投资要好得多。没有哪个城市官员和公司官员在谈论九十九年时有真正的时间感。</p><p class="normal3">Coal involves a different theory of time, because coal, unlike a tree, is produced on the scale of geological time. The supply is limited. Therefore a correct social policy involves intricate computation of the available reserves of the world, the indicated possibilities, the present rate of use, the present economy of use, and the alternative fuels. But when that computation has been reached it must finally be squared with an ideal standard involving time. Suppose, for example, that engineers conclude that the present fuels are being exhausted at a certain rate; that barring new discoveries industry will have to enter a phase of contraction at some definite time in the future. We have then to determine how much thrift and self-denial we will use, after all feasible economies have been exercised, in order not to rob posterity. But what shall we consider posterity? Our grandchildren? Our great grandchildren? Perhaps we shall decide to calculate on a hundred years, believing that to be ample time for the discovery of alternative fuels if the necessity is made clear at once. The figures are, of course, hypothetical. But in calculating that way we shall be employing what reason we have. We shall be giving social time its place in public opinion. Let us now imagine a somewhat different case: a contract between a city and a trolley-car company. The company says that it will not invest its capital unless it is granted a monopoly of the main highway for ninety-nine years. In the minds of the men who make that demand ninety-nine years is so long as to mean "forever." But suppose there is reason to think that surface cars, run from a central power plant on tracks, are going out of fashion in twenty years. Then it is a most unwise contract to make, for you are virtually condemning a future generation to inferior transportation. In making such a contract the city officials lack a realizing sense of ninety-nine years. Far better to give the company a subsidy now in order to attract capital than to stimulate investment by indulging a fallacious sense of eternity. No city official and no company official has a sense of real time when he talks about ninety-nine years.</p>
<p class="normal3">通俗历史是时间混淆的快乐猎场。例如，对于普通英国人来说，克伦威尔的行为、《联合法案》的腐败、1847 年的大饥荒都是早已去世的人所遭受的苦难，而这些苦难是由早已去世的行动者所为，与这些在世的人（无论是爱尔兰人还是英国人）没有任何真正的联系。但在一位爱国的爱尔兰人的心目中，这些相同的事件几乎是同时发生的。他的记忆就像一幅历史画，维吉尔和但丁并肩坐在一起交谈。这些远景和缩短是民族之间的巨大障碍。对于一个传统的人来说，记住另一个传统中同时发生的事情是非常困难的。</p><p class="normal3">Popular history is a happy hunting ground of time confusions. To the average Englishman, for example, the behavior of Cromwell, the corruption of the Act of Union, the Famine of 1847 are wrongs suffered by people long dead and done by actors long dead with whom no living person, Irish or English, has any real connection. But in the mind of a patriotic Irishman these same events are almost contemporary. His memory is like one of those historical paintings, where Virgil and Dante sit side by side conversing. These perspectives and foreshortenings are a great barrier between peoples. It is ever so difficult for a person of one tradition to remember what is contemporary in the tradition of another.</p>
<p class="normal3">几乎没有任何所谓的历史权利或历史错误可以称为对过去的真正客观的看法。以法德关于阿尔萨斯-洛林的辩论为例。这完全取决于您选择的原始日期。如果您从 Rauraci 和 Sequani 开始，这些土地在历史上是古高卢的一部分。如果您更喜欢亨利一世，它们在历史上是德国领土；如果您选择 1273 年，它们属于奥地利王朝；如果您选择 1648 年和威斯特伐利亚和约，它们大部分是法国的；如果您选择路易十四和 1688 年，它们几乎都是法国的。如果您使用历史论据，您相当肯定地会选择过去的那些日期来支持您对现在应该做什么的看法。</p><p class="normal3">Almost nothing that goes by the name of Historic Rights or Historic Wrongs can be called a truly objective view of the past. Take, for example, the Franco-German debate about Alsace-Lorraine. It all depends on the original date you select. If you start with the Rauraci and Sequani, the lands are historically part of Ancient Gaul. If you prefer Henry I, they are historically a German territory; if you take 1273 they belong to the House of Austria; if you take 1648 and the Peace of Westphalia, most of them are French; if you take Louis XIV and the year 1688 they are almost all French. If you are using the argument from history you are fairly certain to select those dates in the past which support your view of what should be done now.</p>
<p class="normal3">关于“种族”和民族的争论常常暴露出同样武断的时间观。在战争期间，在强烈情感的影响下，人们普遍认为“日耳曼人”与“盎格鲁-撒克逊人”和法国人之间的差异是永恒的。他们一直是对立的种族。然而，一代人之前，像弗里曼这样的历史学家强调西欧各民族的共同日耳曼血统，民族学家肯定会坚持认为德国人、英国人和大部分法国人都是曾经共同血统的分支。一般规则是：如果你喜欢今天的某个民族，你会顺着枝条追溯到主干；如果你不喜欢他们，你会坚持认为不同的枝条是不同的主干。在一种情况下，你会把注意力集中在他们变得可区分之前的时期；在另一种情况下，你会把注意力集中在他们变得不同的时期之后。符合这种情绪的观点被认为是“真理”。</p><p class="normal3">Arguments about "races" and nationalities often betray the same arbitrary view of time. During the war, under the influence of powerful feeling, the difference between "Teutons" on the one hand, and "Anglo-Saxons" and French on the other, was popularly believed to be an eternal difference. They had always been opposing races. Yet a generation ago, historians, like Freeman, were emphasizing the common Teutonic origin of the West European peoples, and ethnologists would certainly insist that the Germans, English, and the greater part of the French are branches of what was once a common stock. The general rule is: if you like a people to-day you come down the branches to the trunk; if you dislike them you insist that the separate branches are separate trunks. In one case you fix your attention on the period before they were distinguishable; in the other on the period after which they became distinct. And the view which fits the mood is taken as the "truth."</p>
<p class="normal3">一个可爱的变体是家谱。通常有一对夫妇被指定为原始祖先，如果可能的话，这对夫妇与诺曼征服等光荣事件有关。这对夫妇没有祖先。他们不是后代。然而他们是祖先的后代，而某某是他家的创始人这一表述并不意味着他是他家的亚当，而是他是理想的特定祖先，或者可能是有记录的最早祖先。但家谱表表现出更深的偏见。除非女性血统恰好是特别显着的，否则血统是通过男性追溯的。这棵树是雄性的。在不同的时刻，雌性会加入其中，就像流动的蜜蜂落在一棵古老的苹果树上一样。</p><p class="normal3">An amiable variation is the family tree. Usually one couple are appointed the original ancestors, if possible, a couple associated with an honorific event like the Norman Conquest. That couple have no ancestors. They are not descendants. Yet they were the descendants of ancestors, and the expression that So-and-So was the founder of his house means not that he is the Adam of his family, but that he is the particular ancestor from whom it is desirable to start, or perhaps the earliest ancestor of which there is a record. But genealogical tables exhibit a deeper prejudice. Unless the female line happens to be especially remarkable descent is traced down through the males. The tree is male. At various moments females accrue to it as itinerant bees light upon an ancient apple tree.</p>

<p class="normal3">但未来是最虚幻的时期。我们在这里很容易跳过必要的步骤，而且由于我们受希望或怀疑的支配，我们很容易夸大或最小化完成过程各个部分所需的时间。关于工薪阶层在工业管理中应发挥的作用的讨论充满了这种困难。因为管理这个词涵盖了许多功能。其中一些不需要培训；一些需要一点培训；其他一些只能在一生中学会。而真正有辨别力的工业民主化计划将基于适当的时间顺序，这样承担责任将与补充的工业培训计划并行。无产阶级突然专政的提议是试图取消中间的准备时间；抵制所有责任分担是试图否认人类能力随着时间的推移而改变。民主的原始观念，例如轮换任职、蔑视专家，其实不过是古老神话中的一个说法，即智慧女神从朱庇特的额头上诞生，成熟且全副武装。他们认为，需要多年学习的东西根本不需要学习。</p><p class="normal3">But the future is the most illusive time of all. Our temptation here is to jump over necessary steps in the sequence; and as we are governed by hope or doubt, to exaggerate or to minimize the time required to complete various parts of a process. The discussion of the role to be exercised by wage-earners in the management of industry is riddled with this difficulty. For management is a word that covers many functions. Some of these require no training; some require a little training; others can be learned only in a lifetime. And the truly discriminating program of industrial democratization would be one based on the proper time sequence, so that the assumption of responsibility would run parallel to a complementary program of industrial training. The proposal for a sudden dictatorship of the proletariat is an attempt to do away with the intervening time of preparation; the resistance to all sharing of responsibility an attempt to deny the alteration of human capacity in the course of time. Primitive notions of democracy, such as rotation in office, and contempt for the expert, are really nothing but the old myth that the Goddess of Wisdom sprang mature and fully armed from the brow of Jove. They assume that what it takes years to learn need not be learned at all.</p>
<p class="normal3">每当“落后民族”一词被用作政策依据时，时间观念就是决定性因素。例如，《国际联盟盟约》规定，“托管性质必须根据民族发展阶段的不同而不同”，以及其他理由。它断言，某些社区“已经达到了发展阶段”，可以暂时承认其独立，并接受建议和援助，“直到他们能够独立”。托管国和受托管国对时间观念的方式将深刻影响他们的关系。因此，在古巴问题上，美国政府的判断实际上与古巴爱国者的判断一致，尽管存在麻烦，但在强国如何对待弱国的历史上，没有比这更好的一页了。在那段历史中，估计往往不一致。无论帝国人民如何公开表达自己的观点，他们深信落后的落后是如此无望，不值得补救，或者如此有利可图，以至于补救它是不值得的，这种束缚已经恶化并毒害了世界和平。在少数情况下，落后意味着统治者需要一个前进的计划，一个具有明确标准和明确时间估计的计划。更常见的情况是，事实上，这种情况如此频繁，以至于似乎已经成为常态，落后被认为是自卑的内在和永恒标志。然后，任何减少落后的尝试都被看作是煽动，在这种情况下，它无疑是煽动。在我们自己的种族战争中，我们可以看到未能意识到时间会逐渐抹去黑人的奴隶道德，而基于这种道德的社会调节将开始崩溃的一些后果。</p><p class="normal3">Whenever the phrase "backward people" is used as the basis of a policy, the conception of time is a decisive element. The Covenant of the League of Nations says, for example, that "the character of the mandate must differ according to the stage of the development of the people," as well as on other grounds. Certain communities, it asserts, "have reached a stage of development" where their independence can be provisionally recognized, subject to advice and assistance "until such time as they are able to stand alone." The way in which the mandatories and the mandated conceive that time will influence deeply their relations. Thus in the case of Cuba the judgment of the American government virtually coincided with that of the Cuban patriots, and though there has been trouble, there is no finer page in the history of how strong powers have dealt with the weak. Oftener in that history the estimates have not coincided. Where the imperial people, whatever its public expressions, has been deeply convinced that the backwardness of the backward was so hopeless as not to be worth remedying, or so profitable that it was not desirable to remedy it, the tie has festered and poisoned the peace of the world. There have been a few cases, very few, where backwardness has meant to the ruling power the need for a program of forwardness, a program with definite standards and definite estimates of time. Far more frequently, so frequently in fact as to seem the rule, backwardness has been conceived as an intrinsic and eternal mark of inferiority. And then every attempt to be less backward has been frowned upon as the sedition, which, under these conditions, it undoubtedly is. In our own race wars we can see some of the results of the failure to realize that time would gradually obliterate the slave morality of the Negro, and that social adjustment based on this morality would begin to break down.</p>

They wished to say, with some decent grounds for saying it, how the workers of Sheffield were equipped. They found, as we all find the moment we refuse to let our first notion prevail, that they were beset with complications. Of the test they employed nothing need be said here except that it was a large questionnaire. For the sake of the illustration, assume that the questions were a fair test of mental equipment for English city life. Theoretically, then, those questions should have been put to every member of the working class. But it is not so easy to know who are the working class. However, assume again that the census knows how to classify them. Then there were roughly 104,000 men and 107,000 women who ought to have been questioned. They possessed the answers which would justify or refute the casual phrase about the "ignorant workers" or the "intelligent workers." But nobody could think of questioning the whole two hundred thousand.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，社会工作者咨询了一位著名的统计学家鲍利教授。他建议他们，至少 408 名男性和 408 名女性将是一个公平的样本。根据数学计算，这个数字与平均水平的偏差不会超过 1/22。因此，他们必须询问至少 816 人，才能假装谈论普通工人。但他们应该联系哪 816 人呢？“我们可能已经收集了有关我们其中一人事先调查过的工人的详细信息；我们可能通过与俱乐部、传教所、医务室、礼拜场所、定居点的某些工人有联系的慈善绅士和女士来开展工作。但这种选择方法会产生完全没有价值的成果。这样挑选出来的工人根本不代表人们通常所说的‘普通工人’；他们只代表他们所属的小圈子。</p><p class="normal3">So the social workers consulted an eminent statistician, Professor Bowley. He advised them that not less than 408 men and 408 women would prove to be a fair sample. According to mathematical calculation this number would not show a greater deviation from the average than 1 in 22. They had, therefore, to question at least 816 people before they could pretend to talk about the average workingman. But which 816 people should they approach? "We might have gathered particulars concerning workers to whom one or another of us had a pre-inquiry access; we might have worked through philanthropic gentlemen and ladies who were in contact with certain sections of workers at a club, a mission, an infirmary, a place of worship, a settlement. But such a method of selection would produce entirely worthless results. The workers thus selected would not be in any sense representative of what is popularly called 'the average run of workers;' they would represent nothing but the little coteries to which they belonged.</p>
<p class="normal3">“我们花费了大量的时间和精力，严格遵守确保‘受害者’的正确方法，即通过某种‘中立’、‘偶然’或‘随机’的方法抓住工人。”他们这样做了。在采取了所有这些预防措施之后，他们得出的结论并不明确，只是根据他们的分类和调查问卷，在谢菲尔德 20 万名工人中，“约四分之一”的人“装备精良”，“接近四分之三”的人“装备不足”，“约十五分之一”的人“装备不良”。</p><p class="normal3">"The right way of securing 'victims,' to which at immense cost of time and labour we rigidly adhered, is to get hold of your workers by some 'neutral' or 'accidental' or 'random' method of approach." This they did. And after all these precautions they came to no more definite conclusion than that on their classification and according to their questionnaire, among 200,000 Sheffield workers "about one quarter" were "well equipped," "approaching three-quarters" were "inadequately equipped" and that "about one-fifteenth" were "mal-equipped."</p>
<p class="normal3">将这种认真、近乎迂腐的得出意见的方法与我们通常对大众的判断进行比较，对反复无常的爱尔兰人、逻辑严密的法国人、纪律严明的德国人、无知的斯拉夫人、诚实的中国人、不值得信任的日本人等等。所有这些都是从样本中得出的概括，但样本的选择方法在统计上完全不合理。因此，雇主将根据他所认识的最麻烦的雇员或最温顺的雇员来判断劳动力，许多激进团体都认为这是工人阶级的公平样本。有多少女性对“仆人问题”的看法只不过是她们自己对待仆人的方式的反映？随意的思维倾向于挑选或偶然发现一个支持或违背其偏见的样本，然后使其成为整个阶级的代表。</p><p class="normal3">Compare this conscientious and almost pedantic method of arriving at an opinion, with our usual judgments about masses of people, about the volatile Irish, and the logical French, and the disciplined Germans, and the ignorant Slavs, and the honest Chinese, and the untrustworthy Japanese, and so on and so on. All these are generalizations drawn from samples, but the samples are selected by a method that statistically is wholly unsound. Thus the employer will judge labor by the most troublesome employee or the most docile that he knows, and many a radical group has imagined that it was a fair sample of the working class. How many women's views on the "servant question" are little more than the reflection of their own treatment of their servants? The tendency of the casual mind is to pick out or stumble upon a sample which supports or defies its prejudices, and then to make it the representative of a whole class.</p>
<p class="normal3">当人们拒绝按照我们给他们的分类进行自我分类时，就会产生很多混乱。如果他们能保持我们给他们的分类，那么预言就会容易得多。但事实上，像工人阶级这样的短语只能在部分时间内涵盖部分事实。当你把所有收入低于一定水平的人都称为工人阶级时，你不得不假设，这样分类的人会按照你的刻板印象行事。至于这些人到底是谁，你不太清楚。工厂工人和矿工或多或少都符合，但农场工人、小农、小贩、小店主、办事员、仆人、士兵、警察、消防员则不在名单之列。当你呼吁“工人阶级”时，往往会将注意力集中在或多或少坚定的工会主义者身上，并将他们视为劳工；另外一千七百或一千八百万可能符合统计要求的人，则被默认为具有组织核心的观点。把工会代表大会的决议或知识分子撰写的小册子中表达的观点归咎于1918年至1921年的英国工人阶级是多么具有误导性。</p><p class="normal3">A great deal of confusion arises when people decline to classify themselves as we have classified them. Prophecy would be so much easier if only they would stay where we put them. But, as a matter of fact, a phrase like the working class will cover only some of the truth for a part of the time. When you take all the people, below a certain level of income, and call them the working class, you cannot help assuming that the people so classified will behave in accordance with your stereotype. Just who those people are you are not quite certain. Factory hands and mine workers fit in more or less, but farm hands, small farmers, peddlers, little shop keepers, clerks, servants, soldiers, policemen, firemen slip out of the net. The tendency, when you are appealing to the "working class," is to fix your attention on two or three million more or less confirmed trade unionists, and treat them as Labor; the other seventeen or eighteen million, who might qualify statistically, are tacitly endowed with the point of view ascribed to the organized nucleus. How very misleading it was to impute to the British working class in 1918-1921 the point of view expressed in the resolutions of the Trades Union Congress or in the pamphlets written by intellectuals.</p>
<p class="normal3">劳动者作为解放者的刻板印象选择了支持自己的证据，而拒绝了其他证据。因此，与工人的真实运动并行的，还有一种劳工运动的虚构，其中理想化的群众朝着理想的目标前进。这种虚构与未来有关。在未来，可能性几乎与概率、概率与确定性难以区分。如果未来足够长，人类的意志可能会把可以想象的事情变成非常可能的事情，把可能的事情变成肯定会发生的事情。詹姆斯称之为信仰阶梯，并说“它是善意的斜坡，人们习惯于在更大的人生问题上生活于此。”</p><p class="normal3">The stereotype of Labor as Emancipator selects the evidence which supports itself and rejects the other. And so parallel with the real movements of working men there exists a fiction of the Labor Movement, in which an idealized mass moves towards an ideal goal. The fiction deals with the future. In the future possibilities are almost indistinguishable from probabilities and probabilities from certainties. If the future is long enough, the human will might turn what is just conceivable into what is very likely, and what is likely into what is sure to happen. James called this the faith ladder, and said that "it is a slope of goodwill on which in the larger questions of life men habitually live."</p>

<p class="normal3">而且，正如他在另一处所补充说的，“在某些特殊情况下，你的行动可能是一种确保最终实现目标的手段。”然而，没有人比他更坚持，就我们所知，我们必须避免用目标代替起点，必须避免将勇气、努力和技能在未来可能创造的东西重新解读到现在。然而，这个真理很难实现，因为我们每个人都没有受过太多关于样本选择的训练。</p><p class="normal3">And, as he added in another place, "your acting thus may in certain special cases be a means of making it securely true in the end." Yet no one would have insisted more than he, that, so far as we know how, we must avoid substituting the goal for the starting point, must avoid reading back into the present what courage, effort and skill might create in the future. Yet this truism is inordinately difficult to live by, because every one of us is so little trained in the selection of our samples.</p>
<p class="normal3">如果我们相信某件事应该是真的，我们几乎总能找到一个事实，或者找到一个相信它应该是真的人。当一个具体的事实表明希望正确地衡量这一事实时，就很难做到这一点。当我们遇到的前六个人同意我们的观点时，很难记住他们可能都在早餐时读了同一份报纸。然而，我们不可能每次想估计一个概率时都向 816 个随机样本发送问卷。在处理任何大量事实时，如果我们是根据偶然的印象行事，那么就假设我们挑选了真实的样本。</p><p class="normal3">If we believe that a certain thing ought to be true, we can almost always find either an instance where it is true, or someone who believes it ought to be true. It is ever so hard when a concrete fact illustrates a hope to weigh that fact properly. When the first six people we meet agree with us, it is not easy to remember that they may all have read the same newspaper at breakfast. And yet we cannot send out a questionnaire to 816 random samples every time we wish to estimate a probability. In dealing with any large mass of facts, the presumption is against our having picked true samples, if we are acting on a casual impression.</p>

<p class="normal3">当我们试图更进一步寻找看不见的复杂事件的因果时，随意的意见是非常棘手的。公共生活中很少有大问题的因果关系一目了然。对于那些花了数年时间研究商业周期、价格和工资变动、人民的移民和同化或外国外交目的的学者来说，它们并不明显。然而，不知何故，我们都应该对这些问题有自己的看法，最常见的推理形式是直觉的，事后诸葛亮，这并不奇怪。</p><p class="normal3">And when we try to go one step further in order to seek the causes and effects of unseen and complicated affairs, haphazard opinion is very tricky. There are few big issues in public life where cause and effect are obvious at once. They are not obvious to scholars who have devoted years, let us say, to studying business cycles, or price and wage movements, or the migration and the assimilation of peoples, or the diplomatic purposes of foreign powers. Yet somehow we are all supposed to have opinions on these matters, and it is not surprising that the commonest form of reasoning is the intuitive, post hoc ergo propter hoc.</p>
<p class="normal3">一个人的头脑越是缺乏训练，就越容易得出这样的理论：两件同时引起他注意的事情之间是有因果关系的。我们已经详细讨论了事物引起我们注意的方式。我们已经看到，我们获取信息的渠道是受阻和不确定的，我们的理解力深受刻板印象的控制；我们理性所能获得的证据受到防御、威望、道德、空间、时间和取样的幻觉的影响。我们现在必须注意到，随着这一最初的污染，公众舆论进一步受到困扰，因为在一系列主要通过刻板印象看到的事件中，我们很容易接受顺序或平行性等同于因果关系。</p><p class="normal3">The more untrained a mind, the more readily it works out a theory that two things which catch its attention at the same time are causally connected. We have already dwelt at some length on the way things reach our attention. We have seen that our access to information is obstructed and uncertain, and that our apprehension is deeply controlled by our stereotypes; that the evidence available to our reason is subject to illusions of defense, prestige, morality, space, time, and sampling. We must note now that with this initial taint, public opinions are still further beset, because in a series of events seen mostly through stereotypes, we readily accept sequence or parallelism as equivalent to cause and effect.</p>
<p class="normal3">当两个想法结合在一起引起相同的感觉时，这种情况最有可能发生。如果它们结合在一起，它们很可能会引起相同的感觉；即使它们没有结合在一起，附着在其中一个想法上的强烈感觉也可能从记忆的所有角落吸走任何感觉大致相同的想法。因此，一切痛苦的事情都倾向于聚集到一个因果系统中，一切愉快的事情也是如此。</p><p class="normal3">This is most likely to happen when two ideas that come together arouse the same feeling. If they come together they are likely to arouse the same feeling; and even when they do not arrive together a powerful feeling attached to one is likely to suck out of all the corners of memory any idea that feels about the same. Thus everything painful tends to collect into one system of cause and effect, and likewise everything pleasant.</p>

<p class="normal3">当我们极度憎恨某件事时，我们很容易将我们极度憎恨或恐惧的其他大多数事情与它联系起来，认为它们是原因或结果。它们之间的联系可能并不比天花和酒馆、相对论和布尔什维克主义之间的联系更紧密，但它们却因同一种情感而紧密相连。在像天体力学教授那样的迷信思想中，情感是一股熔岩流，它捕捉并嵌入它所接触的一切。当你在其中挖掘时，你会发现，就像在一座被埋葬的城市中一样，各种各样的物体荒谬地纠缠在一起。任何事物都可以与其他事物相关联，只要它有这种感觉。处于这种状态的思想也无法知道它有多么荒谬。古老的恐惧，加上最近的恐惧，凝结成一连串的恐惧，任何令人恐惧的事物都是其他令人恐惧的事物的原因。</p><p class="normal3">In hating one thing violently, we readily associate with it as cause or effect most of the other things we hate or fear violently. They may have no more connection than smallpox and alehouses, or Relativity and Bolshevism, but they are bound together in the same emotion. In a superstitious mind, like that of the Professor of Celestial Mechanics, emotion is a stream of molten lava which catches and imbeds whatever it touches. When you excavate in it you find, as in a buried city, all sorts of objects ludicrously entangled in each other. Anything can be related to anything else, provided it feels like it. Nor has a mind in such a state any way of knowing how preposterous it is. Ancient fears, reinforced by more recent fears, coagulate into a snarl of fears where anything that is dreaded is the cause of anything else that is dreaded.</p>

<p class="normal3">一般而言，这一切最终都会形成一个万恶体系，以及另一个万善体系。然后，我们对绝对的热爱就显露出来了。因为我们不喜欢限定副词。它们使句子变得杂乱，干扰了不可抗拒的感觉。我们喜欢“最多”胜过“更多”，喜欢“最少”胜过“更少”，我们不喜欢“宁愿”、“也许”、“如果”、“或者”、“但是”、“向着”、“不完全”、“几乎”、“暂时”、“部分”等词。然而，几乎每一种关于公共事务的观点都需要用这种词来打消。但在我们自由的时刻，一切都倾向于绝对地表现——百分之百，无处不在，永远如此。</p><p class="normal3">Generally it all culminates in the fabrication of a system of all evil, and of another which is the system of all good. Then our love of the absolute shows itself. For we do not like qualifying adverbs. They clutter up sentences, and interfere with irresistible feeling. We prefer most to more, least to less, we dislike the words rather, perhaps, if, or, but, toward, not quite, almost, temporarily, partly. Yet nearly every opinion about public affairs needs to be deflated by some word of this sort. But in our free moments everything tends to behave absolutely,—one hundred percent, everywhere, forever.</p>
<p class="normal3">仅仅说我们比敌人更正确，我们的胜利比敌人更有利于民主是不够的。我们必须坚持我们的胜利将永远结束战争，让世界安全，实现民主。战争结束后，虽然我们挫败了比现在困扰我们的邪恶更大的邪恶，但结果的相对性会逐渐消失，当前邪恶的绝对性会战胜我们的精神，我们会感到无助，因为我们并非不可抗拒。钟摆在无所不能和无能之间摇摆。</p><p class="normal3">It is not enough to say that our side is more right than the enemy's, that our victory will help democracy more than his. One must insist that our victory will end war forever, and make the world safe for democracy. And when the war is over, though we have thwarted a greater evil than those which still afflict us, the relativity of the result fades out, the absoluteness of the present evil overcomes our spirit, and we feel that we are helpless because we have not been irresistible. Between omnipotence and impotence the pendulum swings.</p>

<p class="normal3">但人类的心灵并不是一部电影，它不会一劳永逸地记录下通过快门和镜头所呈现的每一个印象。人类的心灵具有无休止的、持续的创造力。随着我们使这些画面更加完整地融入我们自己，这些画面会淡化或融合，在这里变得清晰，在那里变得浓缩。它们不会静止地停留在心灵的表面，而是被诗意的能力重新加工成我们自己的个人表达。我们分配重点并参与行动。</p><p class="normal3">BUT the human mind is not a film which registers once and for all each impression that comes through its shutters and lenses. The human mind is endlessly and persistently creative. The pictures fade or combine, are sharpened here, condensed there, as we make them more completely our own. They do not lie inert upon the surface of the mind, but are reworked by the poetic faculty into a personal expression of ourselves. We distribute the emphasis and participate in the action.</p>
<p class="normal3">为了做到这一点，我们倾向于将数量人格化，将关系戏剧化。除了极其复杂的头脑之外，世界事务被表现为某种寓言。社会运动、经济力量、国家利益、公众舆论被视为人，或者像教皇、总统、列宁、摩根或国王这样的人被视为思想和制度。所有刻板印象中最深刻的是人类刻板印象，它将人性归因于无生命或集体的事物。</p><p class="normal3">In order to do this we tend to personalize quantities, and to dramatize relations. As some sort of allegory, except in acutely sophisticated minds, the affairs of the world are represented. Social Movements, Economic Forces, National Interests, Public Opinion are treated as persons, or persons like the Pope, the President, Lenin, Morgan or the King become ideas and institutions. The deepest of all the stereotypes is the human stereotype which imputes human nature to inanimate or collective things.</p>
<p class="normal3">即使经过各种方式的审查，我们的印象仍然千差万别，令人眼花缭乱，这迫使我们采用更经济的寓言。事物如此之多，我们无法清楚地记住它们。通常，我们给它们命名，让名字代表整个印象。但名字是多孔的。旧的含义会溜走，新的含义会溜进来，试图保留名字的完整含义几乎和试图回忆原始印象一样令人疲惫。然而，名字并不是思想的廉价货币。它们太空洞、太抽象、太不人性化。因此，我们开始通过一些个人刻板印象来看待名字，对其进行解读，最终在名字中看到某种人类品质的化身。</p><p class="normal3">The bewildering variety of our impressions, even after they have been censored in all kinds of ways, tends to force us to adopt the greater economy of the allegory. So great is the multitude of things that we cannot keep them vividly in mind. Usually, then, we name them, and let the name stand for the whole impression. But a name is porous. Old meanings slip out and new ones slip in, and the attempt to retain the full meaning of the name is almost as fatiguing as trying to recall the original impressions. Yet names are a poor currency for thought. They are too empty, too abstract, too inhuman. And so we begin to see the name through some personal stereotype, to read into it, finally to see in it the incarnation of some human quality.</p>
<p class="normal3">然而，人类的品质本身是模糊和波动的。它们最好通过物理符号来记住。因此，我们倾向于将人类的品质归因于我们印象的名称，而这些品质本身往往以物理隐喻的形式来形象化。英国人民、英国历史都浓缩在英格兰，英格兰变成了约翰牛，他快活而肥胖，不太聪明，但能很好地照顾自己。人民的迁徙对某些人来说可能像河流的蜿蜒曲折，对另一些人来说则像毁灭性的洪水。人们表现出的勇气可以具体化为一块岩石；他们的目标可以具体化为一条道路，他们的疑虑可以具体化为道路的分叉，他们的困难可以具体化为车辙和岩石，他们的进步可以具体化为一片肥沃的山谷。如果他们动员他们的无畏之心，他们就会拔出宝剑。如果他们的军队投降，他们就会被打倒在地。如果他们受到压迫，他们就会被折磨或被折磨。</p><p class="normal3">Yet human qualities are themselves vague and fluctuating. They are best remembered by a physical sign. And therefore, the human qualities we tend to ascribe to the names of our impressions, themselves tend to be visualized in physical metaphors. The people of England, the history of England, condense into England, and England becomes John Bull, who is jovial and fat, not too clever, but well able to take care of himself. The migration of a people may appear to some as the meandering of a river, and to others like a devastating flood. The courage people display may be objectified as a rock; their purpose as a road, their doubts as forks of the road, their difficulties as ruts and rocks, their progress as a fertile valley. If they mobilize their dread-naughts they unsheath a sword. If their army surrenders they are thrown to earth. If they are oppressed they are on the rack or under the harrow.</p>
<p class="normal3">当公共事务通过演讲、标题、戏剧、电影、漫画、小说、雕像或绘画等形式普及时，要将其转化为人类的兴趣，首先需要从原作中抽象出来，然后使抽象的内容生动起来。我们不会对我们看不到的东西产生太大的兴趣，也不会被它打动。我们每个人对公共事务了解甚少，因此，它们仍然枯燥乏味，直到某个具有艺术家气质的人将它们转化为生动的画面。因此，由于我们接触的渠道和偏见的限制，我们对现实的认识被强加了抽象，这种抽象得到了补偿。由于我们不是无所不在、无所不知的，我们看不到很多我们要思考和谈论的东西。作为有血有肉的人，我们不会靠文字、名字和灰色理论来维持生活。作为某种艺术家，我们用抽象来绘画、上演戏剧和画漫画。</p><p class="normal3">When public affairs are popularized in speeches, headlines, plays, moving pictures, cartoons, novels, statues or paintings, their transformation into a human interest requires first abstraction from the original, and then animation of what has been abstracted. We cannot be much interested in, or much moved by, the things we do not see. Of public affairs each of us sees very little, and therefore, they remain dull and unappetizing, until somebody, with the makings of an artist, has translated them into a moving picture. Thus the abstraction, imposed upon our knowledge of reality by all the limitations of our access and of our prejudices, is compensated. Not being omnipresent and omniscient we cannot see much of what we have to think and talk about. Being flesh and blood we will not feed on words and names and gray theory. Being artists of a sort we paint pictures, stage dramas and draw cartoons out of the abstractions.</p>
<p class="normal3">或者，如果可能的话，我们会找到有天赋的人，他们可以为我们进行想象。因为每个人的绘画能力并不相同。但我想，人们可以像柏格森一样断言，实践智力与空间品质最为密切相关。一个“清晰”的思想者几乎总是一个优秀的视觉家。但出于同样的原因，因为他是“电影摄影师”，所以他往往过于外在和不敏感。因为有直觉的人，这可能是音乐或肌肉感知的另一个名称，他们往往比视觉家更能欣赏事件的质量和行为的内在性。当关键因素是一种从不粗暴公开的欲望时，他们有更多理解，这种欲望只出现在表面上，以一种隐晦的手势或一种语言节奏。视觉化可以捕捉刺激和结果。但中间和内部往往被视觉化者严重地讽刺，就像作曲家的意图被一个伟大的女高音在甜美少女的角色中讽刺一样。</p><p class="normal3">Or, if possible, we find gifted men who can visualize for us. For people are not all endowed to the same degree with the pictorial faculty. Yet one may, I imagine, assert with Bergson that the practical intelligence is most closely adapted to spatial qualities. A "clear" thinker is almost always a good visualizer. But for that same reason, because he is "cinematographic," he is often by that much external and insensitive. For the people who have intuition, which is probably another name for musical or muscular perception, often appreciate the quality of an event and the inwardness of an act far better than the visualizer. They have more understanding when the crucial element is a desire that is never crudely overt, and appears on the surface only in a veiled gesture, or in a rhythm of speech. Visualization may catch the stimulus and the result. But the intermediate and internal is often as badly caricatured by a visualizer, as is the intention of the composer by an enormous soprano in the sweet maiden's part.</p>
<p class="normal3">然而，尽管直觉往往具有一种特殊的正义性，但它仍然是高度私密的，而且在很大程度上是不可交流的。但社会交往依赖于交流，虽然一个人常常可以凭借直觉以最大的优雅掌控自己的生活，但他通常很难让别人相信直觉。当他谈论直觉时，直觉听起来就像一团雾。因为虽然直觉确实能更公正地感知人类的感觉，但理性的空间和触觉偏见却对这种感知无能为力。因此，当行动取决于许多人是否意见一致时，可能首先没有一个想法在具有视觉或触觉价值之前是无法清晰地做出实际决定的。但同样真实的是，没有一个视觉想法对我们来说是重要的，除非它包裹了我们自己个性的一些压力。在它释放或抵抗、抑制或增强我们自己的一些渴望之前，它仍然是无关紧要的对象之一。</p><p class="normal3">Nevertheless, though they have often a peculiar justice, intuitions remain highly private and largely incommunicable. But social intercourse depends on communication, and while a person can often steer his own life with the utmost grace by virtue of his intuitions, he usually has great difficulty in making them real to others. When he talks about them they sound like a sheaf of mist. For while intuition does give a fairer perception of human feeling, the reason with its spatial and tactile prejudice can do little with that perception. Therefore, where action depends on whether a number of people are of one mind, it is probably true that in the first instance no idea is lucid for practical decision until it has visual or tactile value. But it is also true, that no visual idea is significant to us until it has enveloped some stress of our own personality. Until it releases or resists, depresses or enhances, some craving of our own, it remains one of the objects which do not matter.</p>

<p class="normal3">图像一直是传达思想的最可靠方式，其次是唤起记忆中图像的文字。但是，除非我们将自己与图像的某个方面联系起来，否则所传达的思想并不完全属于我们自己。这种认同，或者弗农·李所说的移情，可能几乎是无限微妙和象征性的。模仿可能在我们不知情的情况下进行，有时甚至会以一种让我们的个性中支持自尊的部分感到恐惧的方式进行。对于成熟的人而言，他们参与的可能不是英雄的命运，而是整个思想的命运，而英雄和恶棍都是必不可少的。但这些都是精妙之处。</p><p class="normal3">Pictures have always been the surest way of conveying an idea, and next in order, words that call up pictures in memory. But the idea conveyed is not fully our own until we have identified ourselves with some aspect of the picture. The identification, or what Vernon Lee has called empathy, may be almost infinitely subtle and symbolic. The mimicry may be performed without our being aware of it, and sometimes in a way that would horrify those sections of our personality which support our self-respect. In sophisticated people the participation may not be in the fate of the hero, but in the fate of the whole idea to which both hero and villain are essential. But these are refinements.</p>
<p class="normal3">在通俗作品中，识别的把柄几乎总是被标记出来。你立刻就知道谁是英雄。如果标记不明确，选择不明确，那么任何作品都不可能轻易流行。但这还不够。观众必须有事可做，而对真善美的沉思不是一件可以做的事情。为了不呆呆地坐在画面前，这既适用于报纸故事，也适用于小说和电影，观众必须通过画面来锻炼。现在有两种锻炼形式远远超越其他所有形式，既容易被唤起，又渴望寻求刺激。它们是性激情和打斗，两者之间有着如此多的联系，如此紧密地融合在一起，以至于关于性的打斗在吸引力方面胜过其他任何主题。没有哪一种如此引人入胜，也没有哪一种如此不顾文化和边界的所有区别。</p><p class="normal3">In popular representation the handles for identification are almost always marked. You know who the hero is at once. And no work promises to be easily popular where the marking is not definite and the choice clear. But that is not enough. The audience must have something to do, and the contemplation of the true, the good and the beautiful is not something to do. In order not to sit inertly in the presence of the picture, and this applies as much to newspaper stories as to fiction and the cinema, the audience must be exercised by the image. Now there are two forms of exercise which far transcend all others, both as to ease with which they are aroused, and eagerness with which stimuli for them are sought. They are sexual passion and fighting, and the two have so many associations with each other, blend into each other so intimately, that a fight about sex outranks every other theme in the breadth of its appeal. There is none so engrossing or so careless of all distinctions of culture and frontiers.</p>
<p class="normal3">性主题几乎不出现在美国政治形象中。除了战争的某些小高潮、偶尔的丑闻或与黑人或亚洲人的种族冲突阶段外，谈论它似乎有些牵强。只有在电影、小说和一些杂志小说中，劳资关系、商业竞争、政治和外交才会与女孩和另一个女人纠缠在一起。但战斗主题随处可见。当有战斗，或者我们所说的有争议时，政治才有趣。为了让政治流行，必须找到争议，即使在真理和正义中没有争议——没有争议，因为判断、原则或事实的差异不需要征召好斗。</p><p class="normal3">The sexual motif figures hardly at all in American political imagery. Except in certain minor ecstasies of war, in an occasional scandal, or in phases of the racial conflict with Negroes or Asiatics, to speak of it at all would seem far-fetched. Only in moving pictures, novels, and some magazine fiction are industrial relations, business competition, politics, and diplomacy tangled up with the girl and the other woman. But the fighting motif appears at every turn. Politics is interesting when there is a fight, or as we say, an issue. And in order to make politics popular, issues have to be found, even when in truth and justice, there are none,—none, in the sense that the differences of judgment, or principle, or fact, do not call for the enlistment of pugnacity.</p>
<p class="normal3">但是，如果没有好斗精神，我们这些没有直接参与的人很难保持兴趣。对于那些参与其中的人来说，即使没有问题，这种专注也可能足以让他们保持兴趣。他们可能因为活动中的纯粹乐趣，或者因为微妙的竞争或发明而锻炼了这种专注。但对于那些整个问题都是外部和遥远的人来说，这些其他能力不容易发挥作用。为了让事情的模糊形象对他们有意义，必须允许他们锻炼对斗争、悬念和胜利的热爱。</p><p class="normal3">But where pugnacity is not enlisted, those of us who are not directly involved find it hard to keep up our interest. For those who are involved the absorption may be real enough to hold them even when no issue is involved. They may be exercised by sheer joy in activity, or by subtle rivalry or invention. But for those to whom the whole problem is external and distant, these other faculties do not easily come into play. In order that the faint image of the affair shall mean something to them, they must be allowed to exercise the love of struggle, suspense, and victory.</p>
<p class="normal3">帕特森小姐坚持认为“悬念……是大都会艺术博物馆的杰作与里沃利或里亚托剧院的影片之间的区别。”如果她明确表示这些杰作既缺乏简单的识别方式，又缺乏对这一代人受欢迎的主题，那么她完全可以正确地说，这“解释了为什么人们三三两两地涌入大都会，数百人挤进里亚托和里沃利。三三两两的人在艺术博物馆看一幅画的时间不到十分钟——除非他们是艺术学生、评论家或鉴赏家。里沃利或里亚托的数百人看画的时间超过一个小时。就美感而言，这两幅画的优点是无法比较的。然而，这部电影比杰作吸引了更多的人，并让他们的注意力停留更长时间，这并不是因为它本身有什么内在的优点，而是因为它描绘了正在展开的事件，观众正屏息等待着结果。它具有斗争的元素，这总能引起悬念。”</p><p class="normal3">Miss Patterson insists that "suspense… constitutes the difference between the masterpieces in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the pictures at the Rivoli or the Rialto Theatres." Had she made it clear that the masterpieces lack either an easy mode of identification or a theme popular for this generation, she would be wholly right in saying that this "explains why the people straggle into the Metropolitan by twos and threes and struggle into the Rialto and Rivoli by hundreds. The twos and threes look at a picture in the Art Museum for less than ten minutes—unless they chance to be art students, critics, or connoisseurs. The hundreds in the Rivoli or the Rialto look at the picture for more than an hour. As far as beauty is concerned there can be no comparison of the merits of the two pictures. Yet the motion picture draws more people and holds them at attention longer than do the masterpieces, not through any intrinsic merit of its own, but because it depicts unfolding events, the outcome of which the audience is breathlessly waiting. It possesses the element of struggle, which never fails to arouse suspense."</p>
<p class="normal3">为了使遥远的情景不成为注意力边缘的灰色闪烁，它应该能够转化为可以识别的画面。除非发生这种情况，否则它只会在短时间内引起少数人的兴趣。它将属于看到但感觉不到的景象，属于敲击我们感官却不被承认的感觉。我们必须站队。我们必须能够站队。在我们内心深处，我们必须走出观众席，走上舞台，像英雄一样为正义战胜邪恶而奋斗。我们必须将我们生命的气息注入寓言中。</p><p class="normal3">In order then that the distant situation shall not be a gray flicker on the edge of attention, it should be capable of translation into pictures in which the opportunity for identification is recognizable. Unless that happens it will interest only a few for a little while. It will belong to the sights seen but not felt, to the sensations that beat on our sense organs, and are not acknowledged. We have to take sides. We have to be able to take sides. In the recesses of our being we must step out of the audience on to the stage, and wrestle as the hero for the victory of good over evil. We must breathe into the allegory the breath of our life.</p>

<p class="normal3">因此，尽管有批评者，但关于现实主义和浪漫主义的古老争论还是得出了结论。我们的大众品味是让戏剧以足够现实的场景开始，使认同变得可信，并让戏剧以足够浪漫的场景结束，使其令人向往，但又不至于浪漫到不可想象。在开始和结束之间，经典是自由的，但真正的开始和幸福的结局是里程碑。电影观众拒绝逻辑上发展的幻想，因为在纯粹的幻想中，在机器时代没有熟悉的立足点。它拒绝不懈追求的现实主义，因为它不喜欢在已经成为自己的斗争中失败。</p><p class="normal3">And so, in spite of the critics, a verdict is rendered in the old controversy about realism and romanticism. Our popular taste is to have the drama originate in a setting realistic enough to make identification plausible and to have it terminate in a setting romantic enough to be desirable, but not so romantic as to be inconceivable. In between the beginning and the end the canons are liberal, but the true beginning and the happy ending are landmarks. The moving picture audience rejects fantasy logically developed, because in pure fantasy there is no familiar foothold in the age of machines. It rejects realism relentlessly pursued because it does not enjoy defeat in a struggle that has become its own.</p>
<p class="normal3">什么才是真实的、现实的、善的、恶的、令人向往的，并不是永恒不变的。这些是由刻板印象决定的，这些刻板印象是从早期经验中获得的，并延续到后来的判断中。因此，如果对每部电影和流行杂志的财务投资不是那么高昂，以至于需要立即获得广泛的欢迎，那么有精神和想象力的人就可以像人们梦想的那样，利用银幕和期刊来扩大和完善、验证和批评我们想象力所运用的图像库。但是，考虑到目前的成本，制作电影的人，就像其他时代的教堂和宫廷画家一样，必须坚持他们发现的刻板印象，否则就会付出令人失望的代价。刻板印象可以改变，但不能及时保证六个月后电影上映时的成功。</p><p class="normal3">What will be accepted as true, as realistic, as good, as evil, as desirable, is not eternally fixed. These are fixed by stereotypes, acquired from earlier experiences and carried over into judgment of later ones. And, therefore, if the financial investment in each film and in popular magazines were not so exorbitant as to require instant and widespread popularity, men of spirit and imagination would be able to use the screen and the periodical, as one might dream of their being used, to enlarge and to refine, to verify and criticize the repertory of images with which our imaginations work. But, given the present costs, the men who make moving pictures, like the church and the court painters of other ages, must adhere to the stereotypes that they find, or pay the price of frustrating expectation. The stereotypes can be altered, but not in time to guarantee success when the film is released six months from now.</p>
<p class="normal3">那些真正改变刻板印象的人，那些先锋艺术家和评论家，自然会对保护他们投资的经理和编辑感到沮丧和愤怒。他们冒着一切风险，那么其他人为什么不呢？这不太公平，因为他们在义愤填膺中忘记了自己的回报，而这些回报是他们的雇主无法想象的。他们不能，即使可以也不会换位置。在与非利士人的无休止的战争中，他们还忘记了另一件事。他们忘记了他们衡量自己成功的标准是过去的艺术家和智者做梦也想不到的。他们要求的是直到最近几代艺术家才考虑过的发行量和观众。当他们得不到这些时，他们就会失望。</p><p class="normal3">The men who do alter the stereotypes, the pioneering artists and critics, are naturally depressed and angered at managers and editors who protect their investments. They are risking everything, then why not the others? That is not quite fair, for in their righteous fury they have forgotten their own rewards, which are beyond any that their employers can hope to feel. They could not, and would not if they could, change places. And they have forgotten another thing in the unceasing war with Philistia. They have forgotten that they are measuring their own success by standards that artists and wise men of the past would never have dreamed of invoking. They are asking for circulations and audiences that were never considered by any artist until the last few generations. And when they do not get them, they are disappointed.</p>
<p class="normal3">那些像《大街》中的辛克莱·刘易斯一样的人，成功地将大量其他人在脑海中试图表达的东西明确地投射出来。“你已经为我说出来了。”他们建立了一种新的形式，然后被无休止地复制，直到它也成为一种刻板印象。下一位先驱者很难让公众以其他方式看待大街。他和辛克莱·刘易斯的先驱们一样，与公众发生了争执。</p><p class="normal3">Those who catch on, like Sinclair Lewis in "Main Street," are men who have succeeded in projecting definitely what great numbers of other people were obscurely trying to say inside their heads. "You have said it for me." They establish a new form which is then endlessly copied until it, too, becomes a stereotype of perception. The next pioneer finds it difficult to make the public see Main Street any other way. And he, like the forerunners of Sinclair Lewis, has a quarrel with the public.</p>
<p class="normal3">这场争论不仅源于刻板印象的冲突，还源于先锋艺术家对其素材的崇敬。无论他选择哪个层面，他都会坚持那个层面。如果他处理的是事件的内在性，他会不顾它造成的痛苦，将其一直延续到最后。他不会用幻想来帮助任何人，也不会在没有和平的地方高呼和平。这就是他的美国。但广大观众无法忍受这种严肃。他们对自己比对世界上任何其他事物都更感兴趣。他们感兴趣的自我是学校和传统所揭示的自我。他们坚持认为，艺术作品应该是一辆有踏板的车辆，他们可以爬上去，他们应该乘坐的不是国家的轮廓，而是一片土地，在那里一个小时内没有钟表要打卡，也没有盘子要洗。为了满足这些要求，存在着一个中间阶层的艺术家，他们能够并且愿意混淆各个层面，将更伟大的人物的发明拼凑成一个现实主义-浪漫主义的混合体，并且正如帕特森小姐所建议的那样，给出“现实生活中很少能做到的事情——一系列困难的胜利解决；美德的痛苦和罪恶的胜利……转变为对美德的颂扬和对其敌人的永恒惩罚。”</p><p class="normal3">This quarrel is due not only to the conflict of stereotypes, but to the pioneering artist's reverence for his material. Whatever the plane he chooses, on that plane he remains. If he is dealing with the inwardness of an event he follows it to its conclusion regardless of the pain it causes. He will not tag his fantasy to help anyone, or cry peace where there is no peace. There is his America. But big audiences have no stomach for such severity. They are more interested in themselves than in anything else in the world. The selves in which they are interested are the selves that have been revealed by schools and by tradition. They insist that a work of art shall be a vehicle with a step where they can climb aboard, and that they shall ride, not according to the contours of the country, but to a land where for an hour there are no clocks to punch and no dishes to wash. To satisfy these demands there exists an intermediate class of artists who are able and willing to confuse the planes, to piece together a realistic-romantic compound out of the inventions of greater men, and, as Miss Patterson advises, give "what real life so rarely does-the triumphant resolution of a set of difficulties; the anguish of virtue and the triumph of sin… changed to the glorifications of virtue and the eternal punishment of its enemy."</p>

<p class="normal3">政治意识形态遵循这些规则。现实主义的立足点始终存在。在论证中，可以辨认出一些真实的邪恶，如德国威胁或阶级冲突。对世界某些方面的描述令人信服，因为它与熟悉的想法一致。但是，由于意识形态既涉及看不见的未来，也涉及有形的现在，它很快就会不知不觉地跨越验证的边界。在描述现在时，你或多或少地被束缚在共同的经验中。在描述没有人经历过的事情时，你注定要放手。你或多或少站在世界末日，但你也许在为上帝而战……一个真正的开始，按照现行的标准来看是真实的，还有一个幸福的结局。每一个马克思主义者都对当前的残酷无情非常坚定，而对独裁统治后的一天则大多持乐观态度。战争宣传家也是如此：在莱茵河以东的任何地方，或者如果他们是德国人，在莱茵河以西的任何地方，他们都发现了人性中没有一种兽性。确实，兽性确实存在。但胜利之后，就是永恒的和平。很多这样的事情都是经过深思熟虑的。因为熟练的宣传家知道，虽然你必须从合理的分析开始，但你不能一直分析下去，因为真正的政治成就的乏味很快就会摧毁人们的兴趣。因此，宣传家用一个相当合理的开头来耗尽人们对现实的兴趣，然后挥舞着通往天堂的护照，为长途旅行积蓄能量。</p><p class="normal3">The ideologies of politics obey these rules. The foothold of realism is always there. The picture of some real evil, such as the German threat or class conflict, is recognizable in the argument. There is a description of some aspect of the world which is convincing because it agrees with familiar ideas. But as the ideology deals with an unseen future, as well as with a tangible present, it soon crosses imperceptibly the frontier of verification. In describing the present you are more or less tied down to common experience. In describing what nobody has experienced you are bound to let go. You stand at Armageddon, more or less, but you battle for the Lord, perhaps…. A true beginning, true according to the standards prevailing, and a happy ending. Every Marxist is hard as nails about the brutalities of the present, and mostly sunshine about the day after the dictatorship. So were the war propagandists: there was not a bestial quality in human nature they did not find everywhere east of the Rhine, or west of it if they were Germans. The bestiality was there all right. But after the victory, eternal peace. Plenty of this is quite cynically deliberate. For the skilful propagandist knows that while you must start with a plausible analysis, you must not keep on analyzing, because the tedium of real political accomplishment will soon destroy interest. So the propagandist exhausts the interest in reality by a tolerably plausible beginning, and then stokes up energy for a long voyage by brandishing a passport to heaven.</p>
<p class="normal3">当公众虚构与私人紧迫感交织在一起时，这一公式便会奏效。但一旦交织在一起，在激烈的斗争中，最初的自我和最初的刻板印象可能会完全消失。</p><p class="normal3">The formula works when the public fiction enmeshes itself with a private urgency. But once enmeshed, in the heat of battle, the original self and the original stereotype which effected the junction may be wholly lost to sight.</p>

<p class="normal3">因此，对于所有听到同一个故事的人来说，故事并不是同一个。每个人进入故事的起点都会略有不同，因为没有两个经历是完全相同的；他会以自己的方式重演这个故事，并注入自己的感情。有时，一位技艺高超的艺术家会迫使我们进入与我们完全不同的生活，这些生活乍一看似乎枯燥、令人厌恶或古怪。但这种情况很少见。在几乎每一个引起我们注意的故事中，我们都变成了一个角色，用我们自己的哑剧表演这个角色。哑剧可能是微妙的或粗俗的，可能是对故事的共鸣，也可能只是粗略地类似；但它将包含我们对角色的构想所引起的那些感情。因此，原始主题在流传过程中，被所有经历它的人的思想所强调、扭曲和修饰。就好像莎士比亚的戏剧每次演出时都会被重写，演员和观众激发的重点和意义都会发生变化。</p><p class="normal3">THEREFORE, the identical story is not the same story to all who hear it. Each will enter it at a slightly different point, since no two experiences are exactly alike; he will reenact it in his own way, and transfuse it with his own feelings. Sometimes an artist of compelling skill will force us to enter into lives altogether unlike our own, lives that seem at first glance dull, repulsive, or eccentric. But that is rare. In almost every story that catches our attention we become a character and act out the role with a pantomime of our own. The pantomime may be subtle or gross, may be sympathetic to the story, or only crudely analogous; but it will consist of those feelings which are aroused by our conception of the role. And so, the original theme as it circulates, is stressed, twisted, and embroidered by all the minds through which it goes. It is as if a play of Shakespeare's were rewritten each time it is performed with all the changes of emphasis and meaning that the actors and audience inspired.</p>
<p class="normal3">在传奇故事被最终记录下来之前，似乎也发生了类似的事情。在我们这个时代，印刷记录会抑制每个人的想象力。但对于谣言，几乎没有或根本没有抑制，原始故事，无论是真实的还是虚构的，都会随着每个流言的艺术家对其进行创作而长出翅膀和角、蹄子和喙。第一个叙述者的叙述不会保持其形状和比例。所有听到它的人都会对其进行编辑和修改，将其用于白日梦并流传下去。</p><p class="normal3">Something very like that seems to have happened to the stories in the sagas before they were definitively written down. In our time the printed record, such as it is, checks the exuberance of each individual's fancy. But against rumor there is little or no checks and the original story, true or invented, grows wings and horns, hoofs and beaks, as the artist in each gossip works upon it. The first narrator's account does not keep its shape and proportions. It is edited and revised by all who played with it as they heard it, used it for day dreams, and passed it on.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，听众越复杂，反应的变化就越大。因为随着听众的增多，常用词的数量就会减少。因此，故事中的共同因素变得更加抽象。这个故事缺乏自己的明确特征，但听故事的人却各不相同。他们赋予它自己的特征。</p><p class="normal3">Consequently the more mixed the audience, the greater will be the variation in the response. For as the audience grows larger, the number of common words diminishes. Thus the common factors in the story become more abstract. This story, lacking precise character of its own, is heard by people of highly varied character. They give it their own character.</p>

<p class="normal3">他们赋予它的特征不仅因性别、年龄、种族、宗教和社会地位而异，而且在这些较粗略的分类中，根据个人的遗传和后天体质、能力、职业、职业发展、职业的突出方面、情绪和紧张程度，或他在所玩的任何人生游戏中的棋盘位置而有所不同。他从公共事务、几行印刷品、一些照片、轶事和他自己的一些偶然经历中了解到的东西，他通过既定的模式进行构思，并用自己的情感进行再现。他不会将个人问题作为更大环境的部分样本。他将自己对更大环境的故事视为私人生活的模仿放大。</p><p class="normal3">The character they give it varies not only with sex and age, race and religion and social position, but within these cruder classifications, according to the inherited and acquired constitution of the individual, his faculties, his career, the progress of his career, an emphasized aspect of his career, his moods and tenses, or his place on the board in any of the games of life that he is playing. What reaches him of public affairs, a few lines of print, some photographs, anecdotes, and some casual experience of his own, he conceives through his set patterns and recreates with his own emotions. He does not take his personal problems as partial samples of the greater environment. He takes his stories of the greater environment as a mimic enlargement of his private life.</p>
<p class="normal3">但不一定像他自己描述的那种私人生活。因为在他的私人生活中，选择范围很窄，他的大部分自我被压抑在视线之外，无法直接控制他的外在行为。因此，除了那些将自己生活的幸福投射到普遍的善意中，或将自己的不幸投射到怀疑和仇恨中的普通人之外，还有一些表面上快乐但在自己圈子之外的任何地方都很残忍的人，以及那些越憎恨家人、朋友和工作，就越对人类充满爱的人。</p><p class="normal3">But not necessarily of that private life as he would describe it to himself. For in his private life the choices are narrow, and much of himself is squeezed down and out of sight where it cannot directly govern his outward behavior. And thus, beside the more average people who project the happiness of their own lives into a general good will, or their unhappiness into suspicion and hate, there are the outwardly happy people who are brutal everywhere but in their own circle, as well as the people who, the more they detest their families, their friends, their jobs, the more they overflow with love for mankind.</p>
<p class="normal3">当你从一般性转向细节时，就会越来越明显地看到，人们处理事务的性格并不是固定不变的。也许他们不同的自我有共同的主干和共同的品质，但树枝和细枝却有多种形式。没有人会以相同的性格面对每一种情况。他的性格会因时间和记忆的积累而在某种程度上发生变化，因为他不是机器人。他的性格不仅会随着时间而变化，而且会随着环境而变化。传说南洋的一位孤独的英国人，他总是刮胡子，打着黑色领带去吃晚饭，这证明了他自己直觉的、文明的恐惧，害怕失去他已经获得的性格。日记、相册、纪念品、旧信件、旧衣服和对一成不变的例行公事的热爱也证明了我们意识到在赫拉克利特河中再踏两步是多么困难。</p><p class="normal3">As you descend from generalities to detail, it becomes more apparent that the character in which men deal with their affairs is not fixed. Possibly their different selves have a common stem and common qualities, but the branches and the twigs have many forms. Nobody confronts every situation with the same character. His character varies in some degree through the sheer influence of time and accumulating memory, since he is not an automaton. His character varies, not only in time, but according to circumstance. The legend of the solitary Englishman in the South Seas, who invariably shaves and puts on a black tie for dinner, bears witness to his own intuitive and civilized fear of losing the character which he has acquired. So do diaries, and albums, and souvenirs, old letters, and old clothes, and the love of unchanging routine testify to our sense of how hard it is to step twice in the Heraclitan river.</p>
<p class="normal3">没有任何一个自我总是在发挥作用。因此，在形成任何公众舆论时，自我所参与的程度非常重要。日本人要求获得在加利福尼亚定居的权利。显然，无论你认为这一要求是想种植水果还是想娶白人的女儿，都会有很大的不同。如果两个国家在争夺一块领土，那么人们是把谈判看作房地产交易、羞辱他们的企图，还是像通常笼罩这些争论的激动和挑衅的语言那样，认为是强奸，这非常重要。因为当我们想到柠檬或遥远的土地时，掌控本能的自我与我们在思考甚至可能作为愤怒的一家之主时出现的自我非常不同。在一种情况下，进入意见的私人情感是温和的，在另一种情况下，则是炽热的。因此，尽管“自身利益”决定观点这一说法真实可信，但这种说法并没有多大启发意义，除非我们知道众多自我中的哪一个自我选择并引导了如此构想的利益。</p><p class="normal3">There is no one self always at work. And therefore it is of great importance in the formation of any public opinion, what self is engaged. The Japanese ask the right to settle in California. Clearly it makes a whole lot of difference whether you conceive the demand as a desire to grow fruit or to marry the white man's daughter. If two nations are disputing a piece of territory, it matters greatly whether the people regard the negotiations as a real estate deal, an attempt to humiliate them, or, in the excited and provocative language which usually enclouds these arguments, as a rape. For the self which takes charge of the instincts when we are thinking about lemons or distant acres is very different from the self which appears when we are thinking even potentially as the outraged head of a family. In one case the private feeling which enters into the opinion is tepid, in the other, red hot. And so while it is so true as to be mere tautology that "self-interest" determines opinion, the statement is not illuminating, until we know which self out of many selects and directs the interest so conceived.</p>
<p class="normal3">宗教教义和民间智慧总是将每个人的个性区分开来。他们被称为高级和低级、精神和物质、神圣和肉体；尽管我们可能不完全接受这种分类，但我们不能不注意到存在区别。现代人可能会注意到，除了两个对立的自我之外，还有很多没有那么明显区别的自我。他会说神学家们的区分是武断的和外在的，因为许多不同的自我只要符合神学家的分类，就会被归为高级自我，但他仍然会认识到，这是人类本性多样性的真实线索。</p><p class="normal3">Religious teaching and popular wisdom have always distinguished several personalities in each human being. They have been called the Higher and Lower, the Spiritual and the Material, the Divine and the Carnal; and although we may not wholly accept this classification, we cannot fail to observe that distinctions exist. Instead of two antithetic selves, a modern man would probably note a good many not so sharply separated. He would say that the distinction drawn by theologians was arbitrary and external, because many different selves were grouped together as higher provided they fitted into the theologian's categories, but he would recognize nevertheless that here was an authentic clue to the variety of human nature.</p>
<p class="normal3">我们学会了注意多个自我，但不要急于对它们做出评判。我们明白，我们看到的是同一个身体，但往往是一个不同的人，这取决于他是在与社会地位平等的人、社会地位低下的人还是社会地位高的人打交道；取决于他是在与一个有资格结婚的女人做爱，还是与一个没有资格结婚的女人做爱；取决于他是在追求一个女人，还是认为自己是她的主人；取决于他是在和他的孩子、他的伙伴、他最信任的下属、能成就他或毁掉他的老板打交道；取决于他是在为生活必需品而奋斗，还是在取得成功；取决于他是在与一个友好的外国人打交道，还是在与一个被鄙视的人打交道；取决于他是处在极大的危险之中，还是处于绝对的安全之中；取决于他是独自一人在巴黎，还是在皮奥里亚与家人在一起。</p><p class="normal3">We have learned to note many selves, and to be a little less ready to issue judgment upon them. We understand that we see the same body, but often a different man, depending on whether he is dealing with a social equal, a social inferior, or a social superior; on whether he is making love to a woman he is eligible to marry, or to one whom he is not; on whether he is courting a woman, or whether he considers himself her proprietor; on whether he is dealing with his children, his partners, his most trusted subordinates, the boss who can make him or break him; on whether he is struggling for the necessities of life, or successful; on whether he is dealing with a friendly alien, or a despised one; on whether he is in great danger, or in perfect security; on whether he is alone in Paris or among his family in Peoria.</p>
<p class="normal3">当然，人们在性格的一致性方面差异很大，差异如此之大，以至于他们可能涵盖了像杰基尔博士那样的分裂灵魂与完全专一的布兰德、帕西法尔或堂吉诃德之间的所有差异。如果自我之间太不相关，我们就会不信任这个人；如果他们过于固执地坚持一条轨道，我们会觉得他枯燥、固执或古怪。在人物的储备中，孤立和自给自足的人的储备很贫乏，适应性强的人的储备则高度多样化，有各种各样的自我，从我们希望上帝看到的顶部自我，到我们自己不敢看到的底部自我。可能有八度代表家庭——父亲、耶和华、暴君——丈夫、东道主、男性——情人、好色之徒——代表职业——雇主、主人、剥削者——竞争对手、阴谋家、敌人——下属、朝臣、势利小人。有些角色从未出现在公众视野中。其他人只有在特殊情况下才会被召唤出来。但这些角色的形成取决于一个人对自己所处境况的想象。如果他敏感的环境恰好是上流社会，他就会模仿他认为合适的角色。那个角色往往会调节他的举止、讲话、话题选择和喜好。生活的喜剧大部分就在于此，在于人们如何想象他们的角色适合他们不熟悉的境况：发起人中的教授、扑克游戏中的执事、乡下的伦敦佬、真钻石中的人造钻石。</p><p class="normal3">People differ widely, of course, in the consistency of their characters, so widely that they may cover the whole gamut of differences between a split soul like Dr. Jekyll's and an utterly singleminded Brand, Parsifal, or Don Quixote. If the selves are too unrelated, we distrust the man; if they are too inflexibly on one track we find him arid, stubborn, or eccentric. In the repertory of characters, meager for the isolated and the self-sufficient, highly varied for the adaptable, there is a whole range of selves, from that one at the top which we should wish God to see, to those at the bottom that we ourselves do not dare to see. There may be octaves for the family,—father, Jehovah, tyrant,—husband, proprietor, male,—lover, lecher,—for the occupation,—employer, master, exploiter,—competitor, intriguer, enemy,—subordinate, courtier, snob. Some never come out into public view. Others are called out only by exceptional circumstances. But the characters take their form from a man's conception of the situation in which he finds himself. If the environment to which he is sensitive happens to be the smart set, he will imitate the character he conceives to be appropriate. That character will tend to act as modulator of his bearing, his speech, his choice of subjects, his preferences. Much of the comedy of life lies here, in the way people imagine their characters for situations that are strange to them: the professor among promoters, the deacon at a poker game, the cockney in the country, the paste diamond among real diamonds.</p>

<p class="normal3">在形成一个人的性格时，会受到各种难以区分的影响。其基本分析可能仍像公元前五世纪一样令人怀疑，当时希波克拉底提出了体液学说，区分了多血质、忧郁质、胆汁质和粘液质的性格，并将它们归因于血液、黑胆汁、黄胆汁和粘液。最新的理论，如坎农、阿德勒、肯普夫的理论，似乎遵循着同样的思路，从外在行为和内在意识到身体的生理学。但是，尽管技术有了很大的改进，但没有人会声称有确定的结论使我们能够将先天与后天分开，并将天生的性格与后天的性格区分开来。只有在约瑟夫·贾斯特罗所说的心理学贫民窟中，性格的解释才被视为一套固定的系统，供颅相学家、手相学家、算命师、读心师和一些政治教授使用。在那里你仍然会发现有人断言“中国人喜欢颜色，眉毛很高”，而“卡尔梅克人的头从上面凹陷，但侧面很大，在器官周围，有获取的倾向；这个民族的偷窃倾向等是被承认的。”</p><p class="normal3">Into the making of a man's characters there enters a variety of influences not easily separated. The analysis in its fundamentals is perhaps still as doubtful as it was in the fifth century B. C. when Hippocrates formulated the doctrine of the humors, distinguished the sanguine, the melancholic, the choleric, and the phlegmatic dispositions, and ascribed them to the blood, the black bile, the yellow bile, and the phlegm. The latest theories, such as one finds them in Cannon, Adler, Kempf, appear to follow much the same scent, from the outward behavior and the inner consciousness to the physiology of the body. But in spite of an immensely improved technique, no one would be likely to claim that there are settled conclusions which enable us to set apart nature from nurture, and abstract the native character from the acquired. It is only in what Joseph Jastrow has called the slums of psychology that the explanation of character is regarded as a fixed system to be applied by phrenologists, palmists, fortune-tellers, mind-readers, and a few political professors. There you will still find it asserted that "the Chinese are fond of colors, and have their eyebrows much vaulted" while "the heads of the Calmucks are depressed from above, but very large laterally, about the organ which gives the inclination to acquire; and this nation's propensity to steal, etc., is admitted."</p>
<p class="normal3">现代心理学家倾向于将成年人的外在行为视为一系列变量之间的等式，例如环境的抵抗力、几个成熟期被压抑的渴望以及明显的个性。只有当我们周围的环境保持正常和平静，当我们遇到的人对我们的期望一致时，我们才会不了解自己的许多性格。当意外发生时，我们会对自己了解很多我们不知道的事情。</p><p class="normal3">The modern psychologists are disposed to regard the outward behavior of an adult as an equation between a number of variables, such as the resistance of the environment, repressed cravings of several maturities, and the manifest personality. It is only when our surroundings remain normal and placid, when what is expected of us by those we meet is consistent, that we live without knowledge of many of our dispositions. When the unexpected occurs, we learn much about ourselves that we did not know.</p>
<p class="normal3">自我是我们在影响我们的所有人的帮助下构建起来的，它规定了哪些冲动、如何强调、如何引导，适合于我们已经学会了准备态度的某些典型情况。对于一种可识别的体验类型，有一种特性控制着我们整个存在的外在表现。例如，在日常生活中，杀人的仇恨是受到控制的。尽管你怒不可遏，但作为父母、孩子、雇主、政客，你一定不能表现出来。你不会希望表现出一种散发着杀人仇恨的个性。你对此不以为然，你周围的人也会不以为然。但如果爆发战争，很有可能你钦佩的每个人都会开始觉得杀戮和仇恨是正当的。起初，这些感情的发泄口非常狭窄。那些真正热爱祖国的自我出现在人们面前，这种感觉可以在鲁伯特·布鲁克、爱德华·格雷爵士 1914 年 8 月 3 日的演讲以及威尔逊总统 1917 年 4 月 2 日对国会的演讲中找到。人们仍然厌恶战争的现实，人们逐渐了解战争的真正意义。因为以前的战争只是变形的回忆。在那个蜜月期，战争现实主义者正确地坚持认为国家尚未觉醒，并互相安慰说：“等待伤亡名单。”杀戮的冲动逐渐成为主要的事情，所有可能改变它的特征都瓦解了。这种冲动变得中心化，被神圣化，并逐渐变得无法控制。它寻求的发泄对象不仅仅是敌人的观念，这是大多数人在战争期间实际看到的所有敌人，而且是所有一直令人憎恶的人、物和观念。对敌人的仇恨是合法的。这些仇恨本身已经通过最粗暴的类比而合法化，而一旦冷却下来，我们就会认识到这是最牵强的类比。一旦冲动爆发，需要很长时间才能抑制它。因此，当战争结束时，需要时间和努力才能恢复自我控制，并以平民身份处理和平问题。</p><p class="normal3">The selves, which we construct with the help of all who influence us, prescribe which impulses, how emphasized, how directed, are appropriate to certain typical situations for which we have learned prepared attitudes. For a recognizable type of experience, there is a character which controls the outward manifestations of our whole being. Murderous hate is, for example, controlled in civil life. Though you choke with rage, you must not display it as a parent, child, employer, politician. You would not wish to display a personality that exudes murderous hate. You frown upon it, and the people around you also frown. But if a war breaks out, the chances are that everybody you admire will begin to feel the justification of killing and hating. At first the vent for these feelings is very narrow. The selves which come to the front are those which are attuned to a real love of country, the kind of feeling that you find in Rupert Brooke, and in Sir Edward Grey's speech on August 3,1914, and in President Wilson's address to Congress on April 2, 1917. The reality of war is still abhorred, and what war actually means is learned but gradually. For previous wars are only transfigured memories. In that honeymoon phase, the realists of war rightly insist that the nation is not yet awake, and reassure each other by saying: "Wait for the casualty lists." Gradually the impulse to kill becomes the main business, and all those characters which might modify it, disintegrate. The impulse becomes central, is sanctified, and gradually turns unmanageable. It seeks a vent not alone on the idea of the enemy, which is all the enemy most people actually see during the war, but upon all the persons and objects and ideas that have always been hateful. Hatred of the enemy is legitimate. These other hatreds have themselves legitimized by the crudest analogy, and by what, once having cooled off, we recognize as the most far-fetched analogy. It takes a long time to subdue so powerful an impulse once it goes loose. And therefore, when the war is over in fact, it takes time and struggle to regain self-control, and to deal with the problems of peace in civilian character.</p>
<p class="normal3">正如赫伯特·克罗利先生所说，现代战争是现代社会政治结构所固有的，但其理想却将其视为非法。对于平民来说，战争中不存在理想的行为准则，比如士兵仍然拥有的和曾经规定的骑士精神。平民没有标准，除非他们中最优秀的人设法即兴制定标准。他们拥有的唯一标准使战争成为一件可恶的事情。然而，尽管战争可能是必要的，但没有道德训练让他们做好了准备。只有他们的高级自我才有一套准则和模式，当他们不得不按照高级自我认为的低级品格行事时，就会产生深刻的混乱。</p><p class="normal3">Modern war, as Mr. Herbert Croly has said, is inherent in the political structure of modern society, but outlawed by its ideals. For the civilian population there exists no ideal code of conduct in war, such as the soldier still possesses and chivalry once prescribed. The civilians are without standards, except those that the best of them manage to improvise. The only standards they possess make war an accursed thing. Yet though the war may be a necessary one, no moral training has prepared them for it. Only their higher selves have a code and patterns, and when they have to act in what the higher regards as a lower character profound disturbance results.</p>
<p class="normal3">道德教育的功能之一是培养人们适应各种情况的性格。显然，道德教育的成功取决于人们探索环境的诚意和知识。因为在一个被错误构想的世界里，我们自己的性格也是被错误构想的，我们行为不当。因此，道德家必须做出选择：要么他必须为生活的每一个阶段提供行为模式，无论其中某些阶段有多么令人厌恶，要么他必须保证他的学生永远不会遇到他不赞成的情况。要么他必须废除战争，或者教人们如何以最精明的心理经济来打仗；要么他必须废除人类的经济生活，用星尘和露水喂养人类，要么他必须研究经济生活的所有困惑，并提供适用于没有人能自给自足的世界的行为模式。但这正是主流道德文化通常拒绝做的事情。在其最好的方面，它对现代世界的可怕复杂性感到羞怯。在最糟糕的情况下，这只是懦弱的表现。现在，道德家们是否学习经济学、政治学和心理学，或者社会科学家是否教育道德家，都无关紧要。每一代人都将毫无准备地进入现代世界，除非他们被教导去设想他们最有可能遇到的问题之一——他们必须具备什么样的个性。</p><p class="normal3">The preparation of characters for all the situations in which men may find themselves is one function of a moral education. Clearly then, it depends for its success upon the sincerity and knowledge with which the environment has been explored. For in a world falsely conceived, our own characters are falsely conceived, and we misbehave. So the moralist must choose: either he must offer a pattern of conduct for every phase of life, however distasteful some of its phases may be, or he must guarantee that his pupils will never be confronted by the situations he disapproves. Either he must abolish war, or teach people how to wage it with the greatest psychic economy; either he must abolish the economic life of man and feed him with stardust and dew, or he must investigate all the perplexities of economic life and offer patterns of conduct which are applicable in a world where no man is self-supporting. But that is just what the prevailing moral culture so generally refuses to do. In its best aspects it is diffident at the awful complication of the modern world. In its worst, it is just cowardly. Now whether the moralists study economics and politics and psychology, or whether the social scientists educate the moralists is no great matter. Each generation will go unprepared into the modern world, unless it has been taught to conceive the kind of personality it will have to be among the issues it will most likely meet.</p>

<p class="normal3">幼稚的自利观忽略了其中的大部分。它忘记了自我和利益都是以某种方式构想出来的，而且大多数情况下都是传统构想出来的。普通的自利学说通常完全忽略了认知功能。它如此坚持人类最终将所有事物归结于自己，以至于它没有注意到人类对万物和自身的观念不是本能的。它们是后天习得的。</p><p class="normal3">Most of this the naive view of self-interest leaves out of account. It forgets that self and interest are both conceived somehow, and that for the most part they are conventionally conceived. The ordinary doctrine of self-interest usually omits altogether the cognitive function. So insistent is it on the fact that human beings finally refer all things to themselves, that it does not stop to notice that men's ideas of all things and of themselves are not instinctive. They are acquired.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，正如詹姆斯·麦迪逊在《联邦党人文集》第十篇中所写的那样，也许确实如此，“土地利益、制造业利益、商业利益、货币利益以及许多较小的利益，在文明国家中必然会发展起来，并将它们划分为不同的阶级，受到不同情绪和观点的驱使。”但如果你研究麦迪逊论文的背景，你会发现一些东西，我认为这些东西可以阐明本能宿命论的观点，有时被称为历史的经济解释。麦迪逊主张联邦宪法，并且“在联盟的众多优势中”，他阐述了“联盟倾向于打破和控制派系暴力”。派系正是麦迪逊担心的。他认为，派系斗争的起因在于“人的天性”，即潜在的倾向“根据公民社会的不同情况而发挥出不同的作用”。对宗教、政府和许多其他问题的不同观点，以及对思辨和实践的不同观点的狂热；对雄心勃勃地争夺卓越地位和权力的不同领袖的依恋，或对命运与人类激情相关的其他类型的人的依恋，反过来又把人类分成了不同的派系，激起了他们之间的相互仇恨，使他们更倾向于互相激怒和压迫，而不是为了共同的利益而合作。人类这种相互仇恨的倾向是如此强烈，以至于在没有实质性机会出现的情况下，最无聊和最虚幻的区别就足以点燃他们不友好的激情并激起他们最激烈的冲突。但派系斗争<i class="calibre10">最常见</i>
 和<i class="calibre10">最持久的</i>
 根源是财产的分配方式多样和不公平。”</p><p class="normal3">Thus it may be true enough, as James Madison wrote in the tenth paper of the Federalist, that "a landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a mercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with many lesser interests, grow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into different classes, actuated by different sentiments and views." But if you examine the context of Madison's paper, you discover something which I think throws light upon that view of instinctive fatalism, called sometimes the economic interpretation of history. Madison was arguing for the federal constitution, and "among the numerous advantages of the union" he set forth "its tendency to break and control the violence of faction." Faction was what worried Madison. And the causes of faction he traced to "the nature of man," where latent dispositions are "brought into different degrees of activity, according to the different circumstances of civil society. A zeal for different opinions concerning religion, concerning government and many other points, as well of speculation as of practice; an attachment to different leaders ambitiously contending for preeminence and power, or to persons of other descriptions whose fortunes have been interesting to the human passions, have, in turn, divided mankind into parties, inflamed them with mutual animosity, and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress each other, than to cooperate for their common good. So strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual animosities, that where no substantial occasion presents itself, the most frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle their unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts. But the <i class="calibre10">most common</i>
 and <i class="calibre10">durable</i>
 source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property."</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，麦迪逊的理论是，派系倾向可能是由宗教或政治观点、领导人引发的，但最常见的是财产分配。但请注意，麦迪逊只是声称人们因与财产的关系而分裂。他并没有说他们的财产和观点是因果关系，而是说财产的差异是观点差异的原因。麦迪逊论点中的关键词是“不同”。从不同的经济状况的存在，你可以暂时推断出可能存在意见分歧，但你无法推断这些意见必然是什么。</p><p class="normal3">Madison's theory, therefore, is that the propensity to faction may be kindled by religious or political opinions, by leaders, but most commonly by the distribution of property. Yet note that Madison claims only that men are divided by their relation to property. He does not say that their property and their opinions are cause and effect, but that differences of property are the causes of differences of opinion. The pivotal word in Madison's argument is "different." From the existence of differing economic situations you can tentatively infer a probable difference of opinions, but you cannot infer what those opinions will necessarily be.</p>
<p class="normal3">这一保留意见与通常认为的理论主张完全相反。正统社会主义者在教条和实践之间所存在的巨大矛盾证明了这一保留意见的必要性。他们认为，社会进化的下一阶段是现阶段的必然结果。但为了产生这一必然的下一阶段，他们组织起来，鼓动起来，以产生“阶级意识”。有人会问，为什么经济形势没有让每个人产生阶级意识？事实并非如此。因此，社会主义哲学建立在对命运的预言性洞察之上的傲慢主张是站不住脚的。它建立在对人性的假设之上。</p><p class="normal3">This reservation cuts radically into the claims of the theory as that theory is usually held. That the reservation is necessary, the enormous contradiction between dogma and practice among orthodox socialists bears witness. They argue that the next stage in social evolution is the inevitable result of the present stage. But in order to produce that inevitable next stage they organize and agitate to produce "class consciousness." Why, one asks, does not the economic situation produce consciousness of class in everybody? It just doesn't, that is all. And therefore the proud claim will not stand that the socialist philosophy rests on prophetic insight into destiny. It rests on an hypothesis about human nature.</p>
<p class="normal3">社会主义实践基于这样一种信念：如果人们的经济状况不同，他们就会被诱导持有某些观点。毫无疑问，他们经常会相信或被诱导相信不同的东西，例如，他们是地主或租户、雇员或雇主、熟练或非熟练劳动者、工薪阶层或工薪阶层、买家或卖家、农民或中间人、出口商或进口商、债权人或债务人。收入差异在接触和机会方面造成巨大差异。正如托斯丹·凡勃伦先生所精辟地指出的那样，操作机器的人对经验的解释往往与手工艺人或商人不同。如果这就是唯物主义政治观所断言的全部，那么这一理论将是一个极其有价值的假设，每个舆论解释者都必须使用它。但他往往不得不放弃这一理论，而且他必须时刻保持警惕。因为在试图解释某种公众舆论时，很难看出一个人的众多社会关系中哪一个影响了特定的观点。史密斯的观点是源自他作为房东、进口商、铁路股份所有者或雇主所面临的问题吗？琼斯是纺织厂的织布工，他的观点是源自老板的态度、新移民的竞争、妻子的食品杂货账单，还是源自与以分期付款方式向他出售福特汽车、房屋和土地的公司签订的无时无刻的合同？如果不进行特别调查，你就无法知道。经济决定论者也无法知道。</p><p class="normal3">The socialist practice is based on a belief that if men are economically situated in different ways, they can then be induced to hold certain views. Undoubtedly they often come to believe, or can be induced to believe different things, as they are, for example, landlords or tenants, employees or employers, skilled or unskilled laborers, wageworkers or salaried men, buyers or sellers, farmers or middle-men, exporters or importers, creditors or debtors. Differences of income make a profound difference in contact and opportunity. Men who work at machines will tend, as Mr. Thorstein Veblen has so brilliantly demonstrated, to interpret experience differently from handicraftsmen or traders. If this were all that the materialistic conception of politics asserted, the theory would be an immensely valuable hypothesis that every interpreter of opinion would have to use. But he would often have to abandon the theory, and he would always have to be on guard. For in trying to explain a certain public opinion, it is rarely obvious which of a man's many social relations is effecting a particular opinion. Does Smith's opinion arise from his problems as a landlord, an importer, an owner of railway shares, or an employer? Does Jones's opinion, Jones being a weaver in a textile mill, come from the attitude of his boss, the competition of new immigrants, his wife's grocery bills, or the ever present contract with the firm which is selling him a Ford car and a house and lot on the instalment plan? Without special inquiry you cannot tell. The economic determinist cannot tell.</p>
<p class="normal3">一个人的各种经济接触会限制或扩大他的观点范围。但是，唯物主义的政治观念无法预测哪些接触、以何种形式、基于何种理论。它可以高度准确地预测，如果一个人拥有一家工厂，他的所有权将出现在那些似乎与该工厂有关的观点中。但是，没有一个经济决定论者能够告诉你，作为工厂所有者的职能将如何发挥作用。对于与成为工厂所有者有关的任何问题，没有固定的观点，没有关于劳动、财产、管理的观点，更不用说关于不那么直接的问题的观点了。决定论者可以预测，在百分之九十九的情况下，工厂所有者会抵制剥夺他所有权的企图，或者他会支持他认为会增加利润的立法。但是，由于所有权并没有什么魔力能够让商人知道哪些规律会使他繁荣，因此经济唯物主义中也没有任何因果关系能够让任何人预言所有者是着眼长远还是短视，是竞争还是合作。</p><p class="normal3">A man's various economic contacts limit or enlarge the range of his opinions. But which of the contacts, in what guise, on what theory, the materialistic conception of politics cannot predict. It can predict, with a high degree of probability, that if a man owns a factory, his ownership will figure in those opinions which seem to have some bearing on that factory. But how the function of being an owner will figure, no economic determinist as such, can tell you. There is no fixed set of opinions on any question that go with being the owner of a factory, no views on labor, on property, on management, let alone views on less immediate matters. The determinist can predict that in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the owner will resist attempts to deprive him of ownership, or that he will favor legislation which he thinks will increase his profits. But since there is no magic in ownership which enables a business man to know what laws will make him prosper, there is no chain of cause and effect described in economic materialism which enables anyone to prophesy whether the owner will take a long view or a short one, a competitive or a cooperative.</p>
<p class="normal3">如果这一理论具有人们经常宣称的有效性，它将使我们能够预言。我们可以分析一个民族的经济利益，并推断出人们必须做什么。马克思尝试过这一点，在对托拉斯进行了很好的猜测之后，却完全错了。第一次社会主义实验并非如他所预言的那样，来自西方资本主义发展的顶峰，而是来自东方前资本主义制度的崩溃。为什么他错了？为什么他最伟大的弟子列宁错了？因为马克思主义者认为，人们的经济地位将不可抗​​拒地产生对其经济利益的清晰概念。他们认为自己拥有这种清晰的概念，他们所知道的东西，其他人类也会学到。事实证明，不仅不是每个人都会自动产生清晰的利益概念，甚至马克思和列宁自己也没有产生这种概念。在马克思和列宁写出这么多东西之后，人类的社会行为仍然模糊不清。如果仅由经济地位决定公众舆论，情况就不应该如此。如果他们的理论是正确的，那么立场不仅应该把人类划分为阶级，还应该为每个阶级提供其利益的观点和实现利益的连贯政策。然而，没有什么比所有阶级的人都对自己的利益感到困惑更确定的了。事实上，当面临考验时，列宁完全放弃了对政治的唯物主义解释。如果他在 1917 年夺取政权时真诚地坚持马克思主义的公式，他会对自己说：根据马克思的教义，社会主义将从成熟的资本主义中发展出来……我在这里，控制着一个刚刚开始资本主义发展的国家……我确实是一个社会主义者，但我是一个科学社会主义者……因此，目前，社会主义共和国的所有想法都是不可能的……我们必须推进资本主义，以便马克思所预言的演变能够发生。但列宁没有做任何这样的事情。他没有等待进化，而是试图通过意志、力量和教育来挑战他的哲学所假设的历史进程。</p><p class="normal3">Did the theory have the validity which is so often claimed for it, it would enable us to prophesy. We could analyze the economic interests of a people, and deduce what the people was bound to do. Marx tried that, and after a good guess about the trusts, went wholly wrong. The first socialist experiment came, not as he predicted, out of the culmination of capitalist development in the West, but out of the collapse of a pre-capitalist system in the East. Why did he go wrong? Why did his greatest disciple, Lenin, go wrong? Because the Marxians thought that men's economic position would irresistibly produce a clear conception of their economic interests. They thought they themselves possessed that clear conception, and that what they knew the rest of mankind would learn. The event has shown, not only that a clear conception of interest does not arise automatically in everyone, but that it did not arise even in Marx and Lenin themselves. After all that Marx and Lenin have written, the social behavior of mankind is still obscure. It ought not to be, if economic position alone determined public opinion. Position ought, if their theory were correct, not only to divide mankind into classes, but to supply each class with a view of its interest and a coherent policy for obtaining it. Yet nothing is more certain than that all classes of men are in constant perplexity as to what their interests are. As a matter of fact, when it came to the test, Lenin completely abandoned the materialistic interpretation of politics. Had he held sincerely to the Marxian formula when he seized power in 1917, he would have said to himself: according to the teachings of Marx, socialism will develop out of a mature capitalism… here am I, in control of a nation that is only entering upon a capitalist development… it is true that I am a socialist, but I am a scientific socialist… it follows that for the present all idea of a socialist republic is out of the question… we must advance capitalism in order that the evolution which Marx predicted may take place. But Lenin did nothing of the sort. Instead of waiting for evolution to evolve, he tried by will, force, and education, to defy the historical process which his philosophy assumed.</p>
<p class="normal3">自从写下这篇文章以来，列宁就放弃了共产主义，理由是俄罗斯不具备成熟的资本主义的必要基础。他现在说，俄罗斯必须建立资本主义，这将创造无产阶级，无产阶级终有一天会创造共产主义。这至少符合马克思主义的教条。但它表明，决定论者的观点中几乎没有决定论。</p><p class="normal3">Since this was written Lenin has abandoned communism on the ground that Russia does not possess the necessary basis in a mature capitalism. He now says that Russia must create capitalism, which will create a proletariat, which will some day create communism. This is at least consistent with Marxist dogma. But it shows how little determinism there is in the opinions of a determinist.</p>
<p class="normal3">这消除了经济决定论的影响。因为如果我们的经济利益是由我们对这些利益的不同概念构成的，那么作为社会进程的万能钥匙，该理论就失败了。该理论假设人们只能采纳一种版本的利益，而且一旦采纳，他们就会不惜一切代价去实现它。它假设存在一个特定的阶级利益。这个假设是错误的。阶级利益可以在很大程度上或狭隘地、自私地或无私地被构想出来，可以基于没有事实、一些事实、许多事实、真理和错误。这样，马克思主义解决阶级冲突的办法就崩溃了。这个办法假设，如果所有财产都可以共同拥有，阶级差异就会消失。这个假设是错误的。财产很可能是共同拥有的，但不能作为一个整体来构想。任何一群人一旦不能以共产主义的方式看待共产主义，他们就会根据他们所看到的东西分成不同的阶级。</p><p class="normal3">This dissolves the impact of economic determinism. For if our economic interests are made up of our variable concepts of those interests, then as the master key to social processes the theory fails. That theory assumes that men are capable of adopting only one version of their interest, and that having adopted it, they move fatally to realize it. It assumes the existence of a specific class interest. That assumption is false. A class interest can be conceived largely or narrowly, selfishly or unselfishly, in the light of no facts, some facts, many facts, truth and error. And so collapses the Marxian remedy for class conflicts. That remedy assumes that if all property could be held in common, class differences would disappear. The assumption is false. Property might well be held in common, and yet not be conceived as a whole. The moment any group of people failed to see communism in a communist manner, they would divide into classes on the basis of what they saw.</p>
<p class="normal3">对于现有的社会秩序，马克思主义社会主义强调财产冲突是舆论的制造者；对于定义模糊的工人阶级，马克思主义社会主义忽视了财产冲突是动乱的基础；对于未来，马克思主义社会主义设想了一个没有财产冲突，因而没有舆论冲突的社会。在现有的社会秩序中，一个人必须失去才能让另一个人获得利益的情况可能比在社会主义制度下更多，但对于每一个一个人必须失去才能让另一个人获得利益的情况，都有无数的人仅仅因为没有受过教育而想象冲突的情况。而在社会主义制度下，尽管你消除了绝对冲突的所有例子，但每个人对整个事实的部分了解仍然会造成冲突。社会主义国家将无法放弃教育、道德或自由科学，尽管从严格的唯物主义角度来看，财产的公共所有权应该使它们变得多余。如果经济决定论是唯一决定俄罗斯人民舆论的因素，那么俄罗斯的共产党人就不会如此热情地传播他们的信仰。</p><p class="normal3">In respect to the existing social order Marxian socialism emphasizes property conflict as the maker of opinion, in respect to the loosely defined working class it ignores property conflict as the basis of agitation, in respect to the future it imagines a society without property conflict, and, therefore, without conflict of opinion. Now in the existing social order there may be more instances where one man must lose if another is to gain, than there would be under socialism, but for every case where one must lose for another to gain, there are endless cases where men simply imagine the conflict because they are uneducated. And under socialism, though you removed every instance of absolute conflict, the partial access of each man to the whole range of facts would nevertheless create conflict. A socialist state will not be able to dispense with education, morality, or liberal science, though on strict materialistic grounds the communal ownership of properties ought to make them superfluous. The communists in Russia would not propagate their faith with such unflagging zeal if economic determinism were alone determining the opinion of the Russian people.</p>

<p class="normal3">社会主义的人性理论与享乐主义的演算一样，是错误决定论的一个例子。两者都认为未经学习的倾向会致命地但明智地产生某种行为。社会主义者认为这些倾向追求的是阶级的经济利益；享乐主义者则认为它们追求快乐，避免痛苦。这两种理论都基于对本能的幼稚看法，詹姆斯对这种看法进行了定义，尽管他对此进行了彻底的限定，但认为它是一种“以某种方式采取行动以产生某些目的的能力，无需预见目的，也无需事先接受教育即可实现目的。”</p><p class="normal3">The socialist theory of human nature is, like the hedonistic calculus, an example of false determinism. Both assume that the unlearned dispositions fatally but intelligently produce a certain type of behavior. The socialist believes that the dispositions pursue the economic interest of a class; the hedonist believes that they pursue pleasure and avoid pain. Both theories rest on a naive view of instinct, a view, defined by James, though radically qualified by him, as "the faculty of acting in such a way as to produce certain ends, without foresight of the ends and without previous education in the performance."</p>
<p class="normal3">这种本能行为是否在人类社会生活中有所体现，这一点值得怀疑。正如詹姆斯指出的那样：“有记忆力的动物的每一个本能行为在重复一次后就不再是‘盲目的’。”无论出生时的装备如何，先天性倾向从婴儿时期就沉浸在经验中，经验决定了什么可以激发它们。正如麦克杜格尔先生所说，“它们变得能够被激发，不仅是通过感知直接激发先天性倾向的物体，即本能的自然或本土刺激物，而且是通过对此类物体的观念，以及对其他类型物体的感知和观念。”</p><p class="normal3">It is doubtful whether instinctive action of this sort figures at all in the social life of mankind. For as James pointed out: "every instinctive act in an animal with memory must cease to be 'blind' after being once repeated." Whatever the equipment at birth, the innate dispositions are from earliest infancy immersed in experience which determines what shall excite them as stimulus. "They become capable," as Mr. McDougall says, "of being initiated, not only by the perception of objects of the kind which directly excite the innate disposition, the natural or native excitants of the instinct, but also by ideas of such objects, and by perceptions and by ideas of objects of other kinds."</p>
<p class="normal3">麦克杜格尔先生进一步指出，只有“性格的核心部分”才保留了其特定特征，并且对于激发本能的所有个人和所有情况而言都是共同的。认知过程以及本能实现其目的的实际身体动作可能无限复杂。换句话说，人类有恐惧的本能，但他会害怕什么以及他会如何试图逃脱，这不是从出生开始就决定的，而是由经验决定的。</p><p class="normal3">It is only the "central part of the disposition" says Mr. McDougall further, "that retains its specific character and remains common to all individuals and all situations in which the instinct is excited." The cognitive processes, and the actual bodily movements by which the instinct achieves its end may be indefinitely complicated. In other words, man has an instinct of fear, but what he will fear and how he will try to escape, is determined not from birth, but by experience.</p>
<p class="normal3">如果没有这种多变性，就很难想象人性会有如此的多样性。但是，当你考虑到生物的所有重要倾向，他的欲望、他的爱、他的恨、他的好奇心、他的性欲、他的恐惧和好斗，都可以自由地附着于各种物体作为刺激，附着于各种物体作为满足时，人性的复杂性就不那么难以想象了。当你认为每一代新生代都是上一代人所受制约方式的偶然受害者，同时也是由此产生的环境的继承者时，可能的组合和排列将是巨大的。</p><p class="normal3">If it were not for this variability, it would be difficult to conceive the inordinate variety of human nature. But when you consider that all the important tendencies of the creature, his appetites, his loves, his hates, his curiosity, his sexual cravings, his fears, and pugnacity, are freely attachable to all sorts of objects as stimulus, and to all kinds of objects as gratification, the complexity of human nature is not so inconceivable. And when you think that each new generation is the casual victim of the way a previous generation was conditioned, as well as the inheritor of the environment that resulted, the possible combinations and permutations are enormous.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，没有表面上的证据可以假设，因为人们渴望某种特定的东西，或以某种特定的方式行事，人类的天性就注定会渴望并如此行事。渴望和行动都是后天习得的，而另一代人可能会以不同的方式习得。分析心理学和社会历史共同支持这一结论。心理学表明，特定刺激和特定反应之间的联系本质上是多么的偶然。人类学在最广泛的意义上支持了这一观点，它表明，激发人们激情的事物以及他们实现激情的手段，在不同时代和不同地方有着无穷的差异。</p><p class="normal3">There is no prima facie case then for supposing that because persons crave some particular thing, or behave in some particular way, human nature is fatally constituted to crave that and act thus. The craving and the action are both learned, and in another generation might be learned differently. Analytic psychology and social history unite in supporting this conclusion. Psychology indicates how essentially casual is the nexus between the particular stimulus and the particular response. Anthropology in the widest sense reinforces the view by demonstrating that the things which have excited men's passions, and the means which they have used to realize them, differ endlessly from age to age and from place to place.</p>
<p class="normal3">人们追求自己的兴趣。但他们追求的方式却没有被注定，因此，无论这个星球继续支持人类生命的时间有多长，人类都无法限制人类的创造力。他不能发布自动化的厄运。如果必须，他可以说，在他的一生中不会发生他认为是好的变化。但是，在说这句话时，他将把自己的生活限制在他用眼睛可以看到的东西上，拒绝了他可以用头脑看到的东西；他将以他碰巧拥有的尺度作为衡量好坏的标准。除非他选择将未知视为不可知，除非他选择相信没有人知道的东西没有人会知道，并且没有人能够教一个人尚未学会的东西，否则他就没有理由放弃他最大的希望并放松他的有意识的努力。</p><p class="normal3">Men pursue their interest. But how they shall pursue it is not fatally determined, and, therefore, within whatever limits of time this planet will continue to support human life, man can set no term upon the creative energies of men. He can issue no doom of automatism. He can say, if he must, that for his life there will be no changes which he can recognize as good. But in saying that he will be confining his life to what he can see with his eye, rejecting what he might see with his mind; he will be taking as the measure of good a measure which is only the one he happens to possess. He can find no ground for abandoning his highest hopes and relaxing his conscious effort unless he chooses to regard the unknown as the unknowable, unless he elects to believe that what no one knows no one will know, and that what someone has not yet learned no one will ever be able to teach.</p>

<p class="normal3">这表明每个人对无形世界的印象都有很多变数。接触点各不相同，刻板的期望各不相同，最微妙的是所征求的兴趣也各不相同。许多人的活生生的印象在每个人身上都是不可估量的个人化，而在大众身上则是难以驾驭的复杂。那么，人们头脑中的东西和他们无法理解的外部环境之间是如何建立实际关系的呢？用民主理论的语言来说，如此多的人如此私密地感受如此抽象的画面，如何形成共同的意志？一个简单而恒定的思想是如何从这些复杂的变量中产生的？那些被称为人民意志、国家目标或公众舆论的东西是如何从如此短暂而随意的形象中结晶出来的？</p><p class="normal3">This goes to show that there are many variables in each man's impressions of the invisible world. The points of contact vary, the stereotyped expectations vary, the interest enlisted varies most subtly of all. The living impressions of a large number of people are to an immeasurable degree personal in each of them, and unmanageably complex in the mass. How, then, is any practical relationship established between what is in people's heads and what is out there beyond their ken in the environment? How in the language of democratic theory, do great numbers of people feeling each so privately about so abstract a picture, develop any common will? How does a simple and constant idea emerge from this complex of variables? How are those things known as the Will of the People, or the National Purpose, or Public Opinion crystallized out of such fleeting and casual imagery?</p>
<p class="normal3">1921 年春，美国驻英国大使与大量其他美国人之间爆发了激烈冲突，这表明这里确实存在困难。哈维先生在英国餐桌上发表讲话，毫不犹豫地向世界保证了 1917 年美国人的动机是什么。正如他所描述的那样，这些动机并不是威尔逊总统在阐述美国人的思想时所坚持的动机<i class="calibre10">。</i>
 当然，现在哈维先生和威尔逊先生，以及他们的批评者和朋友，或者任何其他人，都无法定量和定性地了解三千万或四千万成年人的思想。但每个人都知道，这场战争是在众多努力的推动下打响并取得胜利的，没有人知道，这些努力在多大程度上受到了威尔逊的动机、哈维的动机以及两者的各种混合的刺激。人们参军、战斗、工作、纳税、为共同的目标牺牲，但没有人能够确切地说出是什么促使每个人去做他所做的每一件事。因此，哈维先生告诉一个认为这是一场结束战争的战争的士兵，他并不这么认为，这是毫无意义的。认为这是一场结束战争的战争的士兵就是这么认为<i class="calibre10">的</i>
 。而哈维先生，他的想法是<i class="calibre10">其他的</i>
 ……</p><p class="normal3">That there is a real difficulty here was shown by an angry tilt in the spring of 1921 between the American Ambassador to England and a very large number of other Americans. Mr. Harvey, speaking at a British dinner table, had assured the world without the least sign of hesitancy what were the motives of Americans in 1917. As he described them, they were not the motives which President Wilson had insisted upon when <i class="calibre10">he</i>
 enunciated the American mind. Now, of course, neither Mr. Harvey nor Mr. Wilson, nor the critics and friends of either, nor any one else, can know quantitatively and qualitatively what went on in thirty or forty million adult minds. But what everybody knows is that a war was fought and won by a multitude of efforts, stimulated, no one knows in what proportion, by the motives of Wilson and the motives of Harvey and all kinds of hybrids of the two. People enlisted and fought, worked, paid taxes, sacrificed to a common end, and yet no one can begin to say exactly what moved each person to do each thing that he did. It is no use, then, Mr. Harvey telling a soldier who thought this was a war to end war that the soldier did not think any such thing. The soldier who thought that <i class="calibre10">thought that</i>
 . And Mr. Harvey, who thought something else, thought <i class="calibre10">something else</i>
 .</p>
<p class="normal3">在同一篇演讲中，哈维先生同样清楚地阐述了 1920 年选民心中的想法。这样做是轻率的，如果你简单地假设所有投票给你的人都和你一样投票，那么这样做就是不诚实的。统计显示，有 1600 万人投票给共和党，900 万人投票给民主党。哈维先生说，他们投票支持和反对国际联盟，为了支持这一说法，他可以指出威尔逊先生要求举行全民公决，以及民主党和考克斯先生坚持国际联盟是问题这一不可否认的事实。但是，说国际联盟是问题并不意味着国际联盟就是问题，通过在选举日统计选票，你无法了解国际联盟的真正意见分歧。例如，有 900 万民主党人。你有权相信他们都是国际联盟的坚定支持者吗？当然没有。您对美国政治的了解告诉您，数百万人中的许多人一如既往地投票支持维持南方现有的社会制度，而且无论他们对联盟的看法如何，他们投票并不是为了表达自己的观点。那些希望联盟的人无疑很高兴民主党也希望联盟。那些不喜欢联盟的人可能会在投票时捏着鼻子。但两组南方人都投了同样的票。</p><p class="normal3">In the same speech Mr. Harvey formulated with equal clarity what the voters of 1920 had in their minds. That is a rash thing to do, and, if you simply assume that all who voted your ticket voted as you did, then it is a disingenuous thing to do. The count shows that sixteen millions voted Republican, and nine millions Democratic. They voted, says Mr. Harvey, for and against the League of Nations, and in support of this claim, he can point to Mr. Wilson's request for a referendum, and to the undeniable fact that the Democratic party and Mr. Cox insisted that the League was the issue. But then, saying that the League was the issue did not make the League the issue, and by counting the votes on election day you do not know the real division of opinion about the League. There were, for example, nine million Democrats. Are you entitled to believe that all of them are staunch supporters of the League? Certainly you are not. For your knowledge of American politics tells you that many of the millions voted, as they always do, to maintain the existing social system in the South, and that whatever their views on the League, they did not vote to express their views. Those who wanted the League were no doubt pleased that the Democratic party wanted it too. Those who disliked the League may have held their noses as they voted. But both groups of Southerners voted the same ticket.</p>
<p class="normal3">共和党人的意见是否更加一致？任何人都可以从他的朋友圈中挑选出足够多的共和党选民，涵盖从参议员约翰逊和诺克斯的不可调和到国务卿胡佛和首席大法官塔夫脱的拥护的各种意见。没有人能确切地说出有多少人对联盟有某种特定的看法，也没有人能确切地说出有多少人让他们对这个问题的看法决定了他们的投票。当只有两种方式来表达一百种不同的感受时，就没有确定的方法知道决定性的组合是什么。参议员博拉在共和党的候选人名单中找到了投票给共和党的理由，但洛厄尔总统也是如此。共和党多数派由那些认为共和党胜利会毁掉联盟的男男女女、那些认为这是确保联盟最实际的方法的人以及那些认为这是获得修正联盟最可靠的方法的人组成。所有这些选民都不可避免地被自己的愿望或其他选民的愿望所纠缠，他们想改善商业，或让劳动力回到原来的位置，或惩罚民主党发动战争，或惩罚他们没有早点发动战争，或摆脱伯利森先生，或提高小麦价格，或降低税收，或阻止丹尼尔斯先生超越世界，或帮助哈丁先生做同样的事情。</p><p class="normal3">Were the Republicans more unanimous? Anybody can pick Republican voters enough out of his circle of friends to cover the whole gamut of opinion from the irreconcilability of Senators Johnson and Knox to the advocacy of Secretary Hoover and Chief Justice Taft. No one can say definitely how many people felt in any particular way about the League, nor how many people let their feelings on that subject determine their vote. When there are only two ways of expressing a hundred varieties of feeling, there is no certain way of knowing what the decisive combination was. Senator Borah found in the Republican ticket a reason for voting Republican, but so did President Lowell. The Republican majority was composed of men and women who thought a Republican victory would kill the League, plus those who thought it the most practical way to secure the League, plus those who thought it the surest way offered to obtain an amended League. All these voters were inextricably entangled with their own desire, or the desire of other voters to improve business, or put labor in its place, or to punish the Democrats for going to war, or to punish them for not having gone sooner, or to get rid of Mr. Burleson, or to improve the price of wheat, or to lower taxes, or to stop Mr. Daniels from outbuilding the world, or to help Mr. Harding do the same thing.</p>
<p class="normal3">然而，某种决定还是出现了；哈丁先生入主白宫。因为所有选票中最小的共同点就是民主党应该下台，共和党应该上台。在所有矛盾相互抵消之后，这是唯一剩下的因素。但这个因素足以改变政策四年。1920 年 11 月那个日子希望改变的具体原因没有记录，甚至在个别选民的记忆中也没有。原因不是固定的。它们会不断发展、变化，并融入其他原因，因此哈丁先生必须处理的公众舆论不是选举他时产生的那些舆论。各种各样的意见和 1916 年每个人都看到的特定行动方针之间并没有必然的联系。威尔逊先生似乎是因为呼吁让我们远离战争而当选的，但在五个月内他就把国家带入了战争。</p><p class="normal3">And yet a sort of decision emerged; Mr. Harding moved into the White House. For the least common denominator of all the votes was that the Democrats should go and the Republicans come in. That was the only factor remaining after all the contradictions had cancelled each other out. But that factor was enough to alter policy for four years. The precise reasons why change was desired on that November day in 1920 are not recorded, not even in the memories of the individual voters. The reasons are not fixed. They grow and change and melt into other reasons, so that the public opinions Mr. Harding has to deal with are not the opinions that elected him. That there is no inevitable connection between an assortment of opinions and a particular line of action everyone saw in 1916. Elected apparently on the cry that he kept us out of war, Mr. Wilson within five months led the country into war.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，民意的运作方式总是需要解释。那些对民意的反复无常的运作方式印象最深刻的人在勒邦先生身上找到了先知的影子，并欢迎对罗伯特·皮尔爵士所说的“愚蠢、软弱、偏见、错误感觉、正确感觉、固执和报纸段落的综合体，即所谓的公众舆论”进行概括。其他人则得出结论，既然在漂泊和不连贯中确实出现了既定的目标，那么一定有一个神秘的诡计在某个国家居民之上发挥作用。他们唤起了一种集体灵魂、一种民族精神、一种时代精神，将秩序强加于随机的意见之上。似乎需要一个超灵，因为一个群体成员的情感和思想并没有揭示任何如此简单和清晰的东西，就像那些同样的人会接受的作为他们公众舆论的真实陈述的公式一样。</p><p class="normal3">The working of the popular will, therefore, has always called for explanation. Those who have been most impressed by its erratic working have found a prophet in M. LeBon, and have welcomed generalizations about what Sir Robert Peel called "that great compound of folly, weakness, prejudice, wrong feeling, right feeling, obstinacy and newspaper paragraphs which is called public opinion." Others have concluded that since out of drift and incoherence, settled aims do appear, there must be a mysterious contrivance at work somewhere over and above the inhabitants of a nation. They invoke a collective soul, a national mind, a spirit of the age which imposes order upon random opinion. An oversoul seems to be needed, for the emotions and ideas in the members of a group do not disclose anything so simple and so crystalline as the formula which those same individuals will accept as a true statement of their Public Opinion.</p>

<p class="normal3">但我认为，即使没有超灵的伪装，事实也能得到更令人信服的解释。毕竟，诱导各种不同想法的人投相同票的艺术在每一次政治竞选中都有所体现。例如，1916 年，共和党候选人必须从许多不同类型的共和党人中争取到共和党人的选票。让我们看看休斯先生接受提名后的第一次演讲。背景在我们脑海中仍然足够清晰，无需过多解释；但问题已不再有争议。这位候选人说话异常直白，已经退出政坛好几年了，个人对近期的问题没有投入。此外，他没有罗斯福、威尔逊或劳合乔治等受欢迎的领导人所拥有的魔法，也没有这些人模仿追随者感情的戏剧天赋。从性情和训练来看，他与政治方面相距甚远。但他通过计算知道政治家的技巧是什么。他是那种只知道如何做事，但自己做不到的人。他们往往比那些艺术大师更能当老师，因为艺术大师是他们的第二天性，他们自己都不知道怎么做的。“能做的人做，不能做的人教”这句话，其实并没有听起来那么严重地反映了老师的水平。</p><p class="normal3">But the facts can, I think, be explained more convincingly without the help of the oversoul in any of its disguises. After all, the art of inducing all sorts of people who think differently to vote alike is practiced in every political campaign. In 1916, for example, the Republican candidate had to produce Republican votes out of many different kinds of Republicans. Let us look at Mr. Hughes' first speech after accepting the nomination. The context is still clear enough in our minds to obviate much explanation; yet the issues are no longer contentious. The candidate was a man of unusually plain speech, who had been out of politics for several years and was not personally committed on the issues of the recent past. He had, moreover, none of that wizardry which popular leaders like Roosevelt, Wilson, or Lloyd George possess, none of that histrionic gift by which such men impersonate the feelings of their followers. From that aspect of politics he was by temperament and by training remote. But yet he knew by calculation what the politician's technic is. He was one of those people who know just how to do a thing, but who can not quite do it themselves. They are often better teachers than the virtuoso to whom the art is so much second nature that he himself does not know how he does it. The statement that those who can, do; those who cannot, teach, is not nearly so much of a reflection on the teacher as it sounds.</p>
<p class="normal3">休斯先生知道这是个重大时刻，他精心准备了手稿。一个包厢里坐着刚从密苏里回来的西奥多·罗斯福。整个大厅里都坐着参加过世界末日战争的老兵，他们表现出不同程度的怀疑和沮丧。在讲台上和其他包厢里，可以看到 1912 年的旧墓葬和旧二楼的士兵，显然身体状况很好，心情也有些激动。大厅外面有强大的亲德派和强大的亲盟派；东部和大城市里有主战派；中部和远西部有和平派。人们对墨西哥的感情很强烈。休斯先生必须从各种各样反对民主党的人中形成多数派，这些人分为塔夫脱和罗斯福、亲德派和亲盟派、战争派和中立派、墨西哥干预派和不干预派。</p><p class="normal3">Mr. Hughes knew the occasion was momentous, and he had prepared his manuscript carefully. In a box sat Theodore Roosevelt just back from Missouri. All over the house sat the veterans of Armageddon in various stages of doubt and dismay. On the platform and in the other boxes the ex-whited sepulchres and ex-second-story men of 1912 were to be seen, obviously in the best of health and in a melting mood. Out beyond the hall there were powerful pro-Germans and powerful pro-Allies; a war party in the East and in the big cities; a peace party in the middle and far West. There was strong feeling about Mexico. Mr. Hughes had to form a majority against the Democrats out of people divided into all sorts of combinations on Taft vs. Roosevelt, pro-Germans vs. pro-Allies, war vs. neutrality, Mexican intervention vs. non-intervention.</p>
<p class="normal3">当然，我们并不关心这件事的道德性或智慧性。我们唯一感兴趣的是持不同观点的领导人如何确保获得一致选票。</p><p class="normal3">About the morality or the wisdom of the affair we are, of course, not concerned here. Our only interest is in the method by which a leader of heterogeneous opinion goes about the business of securing a homogeneous vote.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="normal3">斜体字是固定词：在这样的演讲中，林肯当然与亚伯拉罕·林肯没有任何关系。这只是一种刻板印象，通过这种刻板印象，围绕着这个名字的虔诚可以转移到现在站在他位置上的共和党候选人身上。林肯提醒共和党人，无论是公牛麋党还是老卫队，在分裂之前，他们有着共同的历史。没有人敢谈论分裂。但它就在那里，至今尚未愈合。</p><p class="normal3">The italicized words are binders: Lincoln in such a speech has of course, no relation to Abraham Lincoln. It is merely a stereotype by which the piety which surrounds that name can be transferred to the Republican candidate who now stands in his shoes. Lincoln reminds the Republicans, Bull Moose and Old Guard, that before the schism they had a common history. About the schism no one can afford to speak. But it is there, as yet unhealed.</p>
<p class="normal3">演讲者必须修复它。现在，1912 年的分裂已经因国内问题而产生；正如罗斯福先生所宣称的那样，1916 年的重聚是基于对威尔逊先生处理国际事务的共同愤慨。但国际事务也是冲突的危险根源。有必要找到一个开放的话题，不仅可以忽略 1912 年，还可以避免 1916 年的爆炸性冲突。演讲者巧妙地选择了外交任命中的分赃制。“值得尊敬的民主党人”是一个贬低的短语，休斯先生立刻提到了它。记录是站不住脚的，攻击的力度毫不犹豫。从逻辑上讲，这是对共同情绪的理想介绍。</p><p class="normal3">The speaker must heal it. Now the schism of 1912 had arisen over domestic questions; the reunion of 1916 was, as Mr. Roosevelt had declared, to be based on a common indignation against Mr. Wilson's conduct of international affairs. But international affairs were also a dangerous source of conflict. It was necessary to find an opening subject which would not only ignore 1912 but would avoid also the explosive conflicts of 1916. The speaker skilfully selected the spoils system in diplomatic appointments. "Deserving Democrats" was a discrediting phrase, and Mr. Hughes at once evokes it. The record being indefensible, there is no hesitation in the vigor of the attack. Logically it was an ideal introduction to a common mood.</p>
<p class="normal3">休斯先生随后转向墨西哥，首先回顾了历史。他必须考虑到墨西哥局势不妙的普遍看法；同样普遍的看法是应该避免战争；还有两股强大的舆论潮流，其中一股认为威尔逊总统不承认韦尔塔是正确的，另一股则认为威尔塔比卡兰萨更受欢迎，更愿意干预。韦尔塔是记录中的第一个痛处……</p><p class="normal3">Mr. Hughes then turns to Mexico, beginning with an historical review. He had to consider the general sentiment that affairs were going badly in Mexico; also, a no less general sentiment that war should be avoided; and two powerful currents of opinion, one of which said President Wilson was right in not recognizing Huerta, the other which preferred Huerta to Carranza, and intervention to both. Huerta was the first sore spot in the record…</p>
<blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">“事实上他确实是墨西哥政府首脑。”</p>
</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">"He was certainly in fact the head of the Government in Mexico."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="normal3">但那些将韦尔塔视为醉酒杀人犯的道德家们必须得到安抚。</p><p class="normal3">But the moralists who regarded Huerta as a drunken murderer had to be placated.</p>
<blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">“是否应该承认他是一个需要通过合理的判断但依据正确的原则来决定的问题。”</p>
</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">"Whether or not he should be recognized was a question to be determined in the exercise of a sound discretion, but according to correct principles."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="normal3">因此，候选人没有说应该承认韦尔塔，而是说应该应用正确的原则。每个人都相信正确的原则，当然，每个人都相信他拥有这些原则。为了进一步模糊这个问题，威尔逊总统的政策被描述为“干预”。也许在法律上是这样的，但不是当时这个词的意思。通过扩大这个词的范围来涵盖威尔逊先生所做的以及真正的干预主义者想要的东西，两派之间的问题将被压制。</p><p class="normal3">So instead of saying that Huerta should have been recognized, the candidate says that correct principles ought to be applied. Everybody believes in correct principles, and everybody, of course, believes he possesses them. To blur the issue still further President Wilson's policy is described as "intervention." It was that in law, perhaps, but not in the sense then currently meant by the word. By stretching the word to cover what Mr. Wilson had done, as well as what the real interventionists wanted, the issue between the two factions was to be repressed.</p>
<p class="normal3"><i class="calibre10">通过让“韦尔塔</i>
 ”和“<i class="calibre10">干预</i>”这两个爆炸性论点
 对所有人来说都具有意义，演讲暂时转向了更安全的领域。候选人讲述了坦皮科、维拉克鲁斯、维拉、圣伊莎贝尔、哥伦布和卡里萨尔的故事。休斯先生之所以讲得具体，要么是因为报纸上的事实令人恼火，要么是因为真正的解释（例如关于坦皮科的解释）太复杂了。这样的记录不可能激起任何相反的情绪。但最后候选人必须表明立场。他的听众期待着这一点。起诉书是罗斯福先生的。休斯先生会采取他的补救措施，即干预吗？</p><p class="normal3">Having got by the two explosive points "<i class="calibre10">Huerta</i>
 " and "<i class="calibre10">intervention</i>
 " by letting the words mean all things to all men, the speech passes for a while to safer ground. The candidate tells the story of Tampico, Vera Cruz, Villa, Santa Ysabel, Columbus and Carrizal. Mr. Hughes is specific, either because the facts as known from the newspapers are irritating, or because the true explanation is, as for example in regard to Tampico, too complicated. No contrary passions could be aroused by such a record. But at the end the candidate had to take a position. His audience expected it. The indictment was Mr. Roosevelt's. Would Mr. Hughes adopt his remedy, intervention?</p>
<blockquote class="calibre9">

</blockquote>
<p class="normal3">友谊这个主题属于不干涉主义者，而“新政策”和“坚定”这个主题属于干涉主义者。在非争议性记录中，细节令人应接不暇；而在问题上，一切都模糊不清。</p><p class="normal3">The theme friendship is for the non-interventionists, the theme "new policy" and "firmness" is for the interventionists. On the non-contentious record, the detail is overwhelming; on the issue everything is cloudy.</p>
<p class="normal3">关于欧洲战争，休斯先生采用了一个巧妙的公式：</p><p class="normal3">Concerning the European war Mr. Hughes employed an ingenious formula:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">“我主张坚定不移地维护
 美国在陆地和海洋上的<i class="calibre10">所有权利。”</i></p>
</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">"I stand for the unflinching maintenance of <i class="calibre10">all</i>
 American rights on land and sea."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="normal3">为了理解当时发表的这一声明的力度，我们必须记住，在中立时期，每个派别都认为他们在欧洲反对的国家是唯一侵犯美国权利的国家。休斯先生似乎在对亲盟国说：我会胁迫德国。但亲德派一直坚持认为英国的海上力量侵犯了我们的大部分权利。这一公式用象征性的短语“美国权利”涵盖了两个截然相反的目的。</p><p class="normal3">In order to understand the force of that statement at the time it was spoken, we must remember how each faction during the period of neutrality believed that the nations it opposed in Europe were alone violating American rights. Mr. Hughes seemed to say to the pro-Allies: I would have coerced Germany. But the pro-Germans had been insisting that British sea power was violating most of our rights. The formula covers two diametrically opposed purposes by the symbolic phrase "American rights."</p>
<p class="normal3">但卢西塔尼亚号事件却存在。就像 1912 年的分裂一样，它也是实现和谐的不可逾越的障碍。</p><p class="normal3">But there was the Lusitania. Like the 1912 schism, it was an invincible obstacle to harmony.</p>
<blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">“……我相信卢西塔尼亚号的沉没不会造成美国人的生命损失。”</p>
</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">"… I am confident that there would have been no destruction of American lives by the sinking of the Lusitania."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="normal3">因此，不能妥协的东西必须被消灭，当有一个问题我们无法达成一致时，让我们假装它不存在。关于美国与欧洲关系的未来，休斯先生保持沉默。他所说的任何话都不可能取悦他所争取的两个不可调和的派系。</p><p class="normal3">Thus, what cannot be compromised must be obliterated, when there is a question on which we cannot all hope to get together, let us pretend that it does not exist. About the future of American relations with Europe Mr. Hughes was silent. Nothing he could say would possibly please the two irreconcilable factions for whose support he was bidding.</p>
<p class="normal3">几乎无需多言，休斯先生并不是这项技术的发明者，也没有将其运用得非常成功。但他说明了由不同意见组成的公众舆论是如何变得模糊的；其含义是如何接近由多种颜色混合而成的中性色调的。当表面上的和谐是目标而冲突是事实时，公众呼吁中的蒙昧主义通常是结果。在公开辩论的关键时刻，模糊性几乎总是相互矛盾的表现。</p><p class="normal3">It is hardly necessary to say that Mr. Hughes did not invent this technic and did not employ it with the utmost success. But he illustrated how a public opinion constituted out of divergent opinions is clouded; how its meaning approaches the neutral tint formed out of the blending of many colors. Where superficial harmony is the aim and conflict the fact, obscurantism in a public appeal is the usual result. Almost always vagueness at a crucial point in public debate is a symptom of cross-purposes.</p>

<p class="normal3">但是，为什么一个模糊的想法往往具有将人们深切感受的意见统一起来的力量呢？我们记得，这些意见，无论它们被感受得多么深刻，都不会与它们声称要处理的事实保持持续而强烈的联系。对于看不见的环境，墨西哥，欧洲战争，我们的了解很有限，尽管我们的感受可能很强烈。引起这种感觉的原始图片和文字并不像这种感觉本身那样有力量。在我们从未去过的地方，看不见也听不到发生的事情的描述，除了在梦境或幻想中短暂地发生外，从未有过也永远不可能拥有现实的所有维度。但它可以唤起所有的情感，有时甚至比现实还要多。因为触发因素可以由不止一个刺激物触发。</p><p class="normal3">But how is it that a vague idea so often has the power to unite deeply felt opinions? These opinions, we recall, however deeply they may be felt, are not in continual and pungent contact with the facts they profess to treat. On the unseen environment, Mexico, the European war, our grip is slight though our feeling may be intense. The original pictures and words which aroused it have not anything like the force of the feeling itself. The account of what has happened out of sight and hearing in a place where we have never been, has not and never can have, except briefly as in a dream or fantasy, all the dimensions of reality. But it can arouse all, and sometimes even more emotion than the reality. For the trigger can be pulled by more than one stimulus.</p>
<p class="normal3">最初触发触发的刺激可能是一系列由印刷文字或口头文字引起的脑海中的画面。这些画面逐渐消退，难以保持稳定；它们的轮廓和脉动会波动。逐渐地，你会开始知道自己的感受，但并不完全确定自己为什么会有这种感受。消退的画面被其他画面取代，然后是名称或符号。但情绪仍在继续，现在可以被替代的图像和名称所唤起。即使在严肃的思考中，这些替代也会发生，因为如果一个人试图比较两种复杂的情况，他很快就会发现，试图将两者的所有细节都牢记在心是令人筋疲力尽的。他使用名称、符号和样本的简写。如果他想取得进展，他就必须这样做，因为他不可能在每一步中都带着整个包袱。但如果他忘记了自己已经进行了替换和简化，他很快就会陷入言语主义，开始谈论名称而不考虑对象。然后，他无法知道脱离了最初事物的名称是否与其他事物发生了错误结合。在非正式政治中，防范变种人更加困难。</p><p class="normal3">The stimulus which originally pulled the trigger may have been a series of pictures in the mind aroused by printed or spoken words. These pictures fade and are hard to keep steady; their contours and their pulse fluctuate. Gradually the process sets in of knowing what you feel without being entirely certain why you feel it. The fading pictures are displaced by other pictures, and then by names or symbols. But the emotion goes on, capable now of being aroused by the substituted images and names. Even in severe thinking these substitutions take place, for if a man is trying to compare two complicated situations, he soon finds exhausting the attempt to hold both fully in mind in all their detail. He employs a shorthand of names and signs and samples. He has to do this if he is to advance at all, because he cannot carry the whole baggage in every phrase through every step he takes. But if he forgets that he has substituted and simplified, he soon lapses into verbalism, and begins to talk about names regardless of objects. And then he has no way of knowing when the name divorced from its first thing is carrying on a misalliance with some other thing. It is more difficult still to guard against changelings in casual politics.</p>
<p class="normal3">因为根据心理学家所称的条件反应，一种情绪并不只依附于一种想法。有无数的东西可以激起这种情绪，也有无数的东西可以满足这种情绪。当刺激只是模糊和间接地被感知到，而目标同样是间接的时候，情况尤其如此。因为你可以将一种情绪，比如恐惧，首先与某种直接危险的东西联系起来，然后与这种危险的想法联系起来，然后与类似于这种想法的东西联系起来，等等。人类文化的整个结构在某种程度上是对刺激和反应的精心设计，而原始的情绪能力仍然是相当固定的中心。毫无疑问，情绪的性质在历史进程中发生了变化，但速度或精心设计却与它的条件化特征不同。</p><p class="normal3">For by what is known to psychologists as conditioned response, an emotion is not attached merely to one idea. There are no end of things which can arouse the emotion, and no end of things which can satisfy it. This is particularly true where the stimulus is only dimly and indirectly perceived, and where the objective is likewise indirect. For you can associate an emotion, say fear, first with something immediately dangerous, then with the idea of that thing, then with something similar to that idea, and so on and on. The whole structure of human culture is in one respect an elaboration of the stimuli and responses of which the original emotional capacities remain a fairly fixed center. No doubt the quality of emotion has changed in the course of history, but with nothing like the speed, or elaboration, that has characterized the conditioning of it.</p>
<p class="normal3">人们对观念的敏感度差异很大。有些人对俄罗斯挨饿儿童的印象几乎和眼前挨饿儿童的印象一样深刻。有些人几乎无法被遥远的观念所激起。两者之间存在许多层次。有些人对事实不敏感，只被观念所激起。但是，尽管这种情感是由观念引起的，但我们无法通过亲自参与场景来满足这种情感。俄罗斯挨饿儿童的观念唤起了人们想要喂饱孩子的愿望。但被激起这种情感的人无法喂饱孩子。他只能把钱捐给一个非个人的组织，或者捐给一个他称之为胡佛先生的化身。他的钱没有到达那个孩子手中。它流向了一个用来喂养大量儿童的公共资金池。因此，正如观念是间接的一样，行动的影响也是间接的。认知是间接的，意志是间接的，只有影响是直接的。在这三个过程部分中，刺激来自看不见的地方，反应到达看不见的地方，只有情感完全存在于人内心。对于孩子的饥饿，他只有一个想法，对于孩子的宽慰，他只有一个想法，但对于他自己想要帮助的愿望，他有真实的体验。这是事情的核心事实，他内心的情感，这是第一手的。</p><p class="normal3">People differ widely in their susceptibility to ideas. There are some in whom the idea of a starving child in Russia is practically as vivid as a starving child within sight. There are others who are almost incapable of being excited by a distant idea. There are many gradations between. And there are people who are insensitive to facts, and aroused only by ideas. But though the emotion is aroused by the idea, we are unable to satisfy the emotion by acting ourselves upon the scene itself. The idea of the starving Russian child evokes a desire to feed the child. But the person so aroused cannot feed it. He can only give money to an impersonal organization, or to a personification which he calls Mr. Hoover. His money does not reach that child. It goes to a general pool from which a mass of children are fed. And so just as the idea is second hand, so are the effects of the action second hand. The cognition is indirect, the conation is indirect, only the effect is immediate. Of the three parts of the process, the stimulus comes from somewhere out of sight, the response reaches somewhere out of sight, only the emotion exists entirely within the person. Of the child's hunger he has only an idea, of the child's relief he has only an idea, but of his own desire to help he has a real experience. It is the central fact of the business, the emotion within himself, which is first hand.</p>
<p class="normal3">在不同的限度内，情感在刺激和反应方面都是可以转移的。因此，如果你在一群反应倾向各异的人中，找到了一种能激起他们中许多人相同情感的刺激，你就可以用它来代替原来的刺激。例如，如果一个人不喜欢联盟，另一个人讨厌威尔逊先生，第三个人害怕劳工，如果你能找到一个与他们所憎恨的东西截然相反的象征，你也许能够把他们团结起来。假设这个象征是美国主义。第一个人可能把它理解为维护美国的孤立，或者他可能称之为独立；第二个人把它理解为拒绝与他对美国总统的想法相冲突的政治家；第三个人把它理解为抵制革命的号召。这个象征本身实际上并不代表任何特定的东西，但它几乎可以与任何东西联系起来。正因为如此，它可以成为共同情感的共同纽带，即使这些情感最初与不同的想法联系在一起。</p><p class="normal3">Within limits that vary, the emotion is transferable both as regards stimulus and response. Therefore, if among a number of people, possessing various tendencies to respond, you can find a stimulus which will arouse the same emotion in many of them, you can substitute it for the original stimuli. If, for example, one man dislikes the League, another hates Mr. Wilson, and a third fears labor, you may be able to unite them if you can find some symbol which is the antithesis of what they all hate. Suppose that symbol is Americanism. The first man may read it as meaning the preservation of American isolation, or as he may call it, independence; the second as the rejection of a politician who clashes with his idea of what an American president should be, the third as a call to resist revolution. The symbol in itself signifies literally no one thing in particular, but it can be associated with almost anything. And because of that it can become the common bond of common feelings, even though those feelings were originally attached to disparate ideas.</p>
<p class="normal3">当政党或报纸宣称拥护美国主义、进步主义、法律与秩序、正义和人性时，他们希望融合冲突派系的情感，如果邀请他们讨论一项具体计划而不是这些象征，冲突派系肯定会分裂。因为当围绕象征达成联盟时，情感会趋向于在象征下保持一致，而不是批判性地审查措施。我认为，将多个这样的短语称为象征性的，既方便又技术上正确。它们并不代表具体的想法，而是一种休战或思想之间的交汇。它们就像一个战略铁路中心，许多道路汇聚于此，无论其最终起源或最终目的地如何。但谁能抓住暂时包含公众情感的象征，谁就能控制公共政策的方法。只要一个特定的象征具有联盟的力量，野心勃勃的派系就会争夺所有权。例如，想想林肯的名字或罗斯福的名字。能够驾驭当前象征的领导者或利益集团，就是当前局势的主人。当然，这也有限度。过于猛烈地滥用人们认为象征所代表的现实，或者过于强烈地以象征的名义抵制新用途，可以说，都会使象征遭到破坏。1917 年，神圣俄罗斯和小圣父的宏伟象征就这样在苦难和失败的冲击下遭到破坏。</p><p class="normal3">When political parties or newspapers declare for Americanism, Progressivism, Law and Order, Justice, Humanity, they hope to amalgamate the emotion of conflicting factions which would surely divide, if, instead of these symbols, they were invited to discuss a specific program. For when a coalition around the symbol has been effected, feeling flows toward conformity under the symbol rather than toward critical scrutiny of the measures. It is, I think, convenient and technically correct to call multiple phrases like these symbolic. They do not stand for specific ideas, but for a sort of truce or junction between ideas. They are like a strategic railroad center where many roads converge regardless of their ultimate origin or their ultimate destination. But he who captures the symbols by which public feeling is for the moment contained, controls by that much the approaches of public policy. And as long as a particular symbol has the power of coalition, ambitious factions will fight for possession. Think, for example, of Lincoln's name or of Roosevelt's. A leader or an interest that can make itself master of current symbols is master of the current situation. There are limits, of course. Too violent abuse of the actualities which groups of people think the symbol represents, or too great resistance in the name of that symbol to new purposes, will, so to speak, burst the symbol. In this manner, during the year 1917, the imposing symbol of Holy Russia and the Little Father burst under the impact of suffering and defeat.</p>

<p class="normal3">俄国崩溃的巨大后果影响到了所有战线和所有人民。它们直接导致了一场引人注目的实验，即从战争所激起的各种意见中提炼出一种共同意见。十四点原则是针对所有政府，包括盟国、敌国、中立国和所有人民的。它们试图将世界大战中的主要不可估量因素联系在一起。这必然是一个新的出发点，因为这是第一次伟大的战争，在这场战争中，人类的所有决定性因素都可以同时思考相同的思想，或者至少是相同的思想名称。如果没有电缆、无线电、电报和日报，十四点原则的实验就不可能实现。它试图利用现代通讯手段，在全世界范围内恢复“共同意识”。</p><p class="normal3">The tremendous consequences of Russia's collapse were felt on all the fronts and among all the peoples. They led directly to a striking experiment in the crystallization of a common opinion out of the varieties of opinion churned up by the war. The Fourteen Points were addressed to all the governments, allied, enemy, neutral, and to all the peoples. They were an attempt to knit together the chief imponderables of a world war. Necessarily this was a new departure, because this was the first great war in which all the deciding elements of mankind could be brought to think about the same ideas, or at least about the same names for ideas, simultaneously. Without cable, radio, telegraph, and daily press, the experiment of the Fourteen Points would have been impossible. It was an attempt to exploit the modern machinery of communication to start the return to a "common consciousness" throughout the world.</p>
<p class="normal3">但首先我们必须研究一下 1917 年底出现的一些情况。因为在这份文件最终呈现的形式中，所有这些考虑都以某种方式体现出来了。在夏季和秋季，发生了一系列事件，这些事件深刻影响了人民的情绪和战争的进程。7 月，俄国人发动了最后一次进攻，遭到惨败，士气低落，导致了十一月的布尔什维克革命。稍早之前，法国人在香槟遭受了一场严重且几乎是灾难性的失败，导致军队叛乱，平民中出现了失败主义的骚动。英国正遭受潜艇袭击的影响，佛兰德斯战役的惨重损失，11 月，英国军队在康布雷遭遇了惨败，这让前线的士兵和国内的领导人感到震惊。极度厌战情绪弥漫整个西欧。</p><p class="normal3">But first we must examine some of the circumstances as they presented themselves at the end of 1917. For in the form which the document finally assumed, all these considerations are somehow represented. During the summer and autumn a series of events had occurred which profoundly affected the temper of the people and the course of the war. In July the Russians had made a last offensive, had been disastrously beaten, and the process of demoralization which led to the Bolshevik revolution of November had begun. Somewhat earlier the French had suffered a severe and almost disastrous defeat in Champagne which produced mutinies in the army and a defeatist agitation among the civilians. England was suffering from the effects of the submarine raids, from the terrible losses of the Flanders battles, and in November at Cambrai the British armies met a reverse that appalled the troops at the front and the leaders at home. Extreme war weariness pervaded the whole of western Europe.</p>
<p class="normal3">实际上，痛苦和失望已经动摇了散漫者对战争公认版本的关注。他们不再关注普通的官方声明，他们的注意力开始飘忽不定，一会儿关注他们自己的痛苦，一会儿关注他们党派和阶级的目的，一会儿关注对政府的普遍不满。官方宣传对感知、希望、恐惧和仇恨的刺激对兴趣和注意力的或多或少完美的组织，即所谓的士气，正在逐渐瓦解。各地人们的思想开始寻找新的可以带来解脱的依恋。</p><p class="normal3">In effect, the agony and disappointment had jarred loose men's concentration on the accepted version of the war. Their interests were no longer held by the ordinary official pronouncements, and their attention began to wander, fixing now upon their own suffering, now upon their party and class purposes, now upon general resentments against the governments. That more or less perfect organization of perception by official propaganda, of interest and attention by the stimuli of hope, fear, and hatred, which is called morale, was by way of breaking down. The minds of men everywhere began to search for new attachments that promised relief.</p>
<p class="normal3">突然间，他们目睹了一场惊心动魄的戏剧。东线战场上，圣诞节停战，杀戮结束，喧嚣结束，和平许诺。在布列斯特-立托夫斯克，所有普通人的梦想都变成了现实：谈判是可能的，除了与敌人拼死一搏，还有其他方式可以结束这场磨难。人们开始胆怯地但全神贯注地转向东方。他们问，为什么不呢？这一切都是为了什么？政客们知道自己在做什么吗？我们真的在为他们所说的而战吗？也许，不打仗就能实现这一目标？在审查制度的禁令下，这些内容很少被允许在印刷品中展示，但当兰斯多恩勋爵讲话时，人们发自内心地做出了回应。早期的战争象征已经变得陈腐，失去了团结的力量。在表面之下，每个同盟国都出现了巨大的分裂。</p><p class="normal3">Suddenly they beheld a tremendous drama. On the Eastern front there was a Christmas truce, an end of slaughter, an end of noise, a promise of peace. At Brest-Litovsk the dream of all simple people had come to life: it was possible to negotiate, there was some other way to end the ordeal than by matching lives with the enemy. Timidly, but with rapt attention, people began to turn to the East. Why not, they asked? What is it all for? Do the politicians know what they are doing? Are we really fighting for what they say? Is it possible, perhaps, to secure it without fighting? Under the ban of the censorship, little of this was allowed to show itself in print, but, when Lord Lansdowne spoke, there was a response from the heart. The earlier symbols of the war had become hackneyed, and had lost their power to unify. Beneath the surface a wide schism was opening up in each Allied country.</p>
<p class="normal3">中欧也发生了类似的事情。在那里，战争的原始冲动也被削弱了；神圣的联盟被打破了。战线上的垂直分裂被各种不可预见的水平分裂所切断。战争的道德危机在军事决定尚未出现之前就已经到来。威尔逊总统和他的顾问们意识到了这一切。当然，他们对形势并不完全了解，但他们知道我所概述的情况。</p><p class="normal3">Something similar was happening in Central Europe. There too the original impulse of the war was weakened; the union sacrée was broken. The vertical cleavages along the battle front were cut across by horizontal divisions running in all kinds of unforeseeable ways. The moral crisis of the war had arrived before the military decision was in sight. All this President Wilson and his advisers realized. They had not, of course, a perfect knowledge of the situation, but what I have sketched they knew.</p>
<p class="normal3">他们还知道，盟国政府受一系列条约的约束，而这些条约在文字和精神上都与民众对战争的理解背道而驰。巴黎经济会议的决议当然是公共财产，而布尔什维克在 1917 年 11 月公布了一系列秘密条约。这些条约的条款只为人民所模糊知晓，但人们确信这些条款与自决、不兼并、不赔款的理想口号不符。民众的疑问是，阿尔萨斯-洛林或达尔马提亚的生命值多少千英国人的生命，波兰或美索不达米亚的生命值多少法国人的生命。在美国，这种疑问也并非完全不为人所知。由于拒绝参加布列斯特-立陶夫斯克战役，整个盟国的事业都处于守势。</p><p class="normal3">They knew also that the Allied Governments were bound by a series of engagements that in letter and in spirit ran counter to the popular conception of what the war was about. The resolutions of the Paris Economic Conference were, of course, public property, and the network of secret treaties had been published by the Bolsheviks in November of 1917. Their terms were only vaguely known to the peoples, but it was definitely believed that they did not comport with the idealistic slogan of self-determination, no annexations and no indemnities. Popular questioning took the form of asking how many thousand English lives Alsace-Lorraine or Dalmatia were worth, how many French lives Poland or Mesopotamia were worth. Nor was such questioning entirely unknown in America. The whole Allied cause had been put on the defensive by the refusal to participate at Brest-Litovsk.</p>
<p class="normal3">这是一种高度敏感的心态，任何一位有能力的领导人都不会忽视。理想的回应应该是盟军采取联合行动。但在 10 月的盟军会议上，人们发现这是不可能的。但到了 12 月，压力变得如此之大，以至于乔治先生和威尔逊先生被迫各自做出回应。总统选择的形式是一份分为 14 个标题的和平条款声明。对条款进行编号是一种手段，以确保准确性，并立即给人留下这是一份公事公办的文件的印象。提出“和平条款”而不是“战争目标”的想法源于建立布列斯特-立陶夫斯克谈判的真正替代方案的必要性。他们的目的是通过用更宏大的全球公开辩论来取代俄德谈判的场面，以争夺注意力。</p><p class="normal3">Here was a highly sensitive state of mind which no competent leader could fail to consider. The ideal response would have been joint action by the Allies. That was found to be impossible when it was considered at the Interallied Conference of October. But by December the pressure had become so great that Mr. George and Mr. Wilson were moved independently to make some response. The form selected by the President was a statement of peace terms under fourteen heads. The numbering of them was an artifice to secure precision, and to create at once the impression that here was a business-like document. The idea of stating "peace terms" instead of "war aims" arose from the necessity of establishing a genuine alternative to the Brest-Litovsk negotiations. They were intended to compete for attention by substituting for the spectacle of Russo-German parleys the much grander spectacle of a public world-wide debate.</p>
<p class="normal3">在争取到全世界的利益之后，就必须使这种利益统一起来，并灵活应对各种不同情况。这些条款必须让盟国中的大多数人认为它们有价值。它们必须满足每个民族的民族愿望，但又要限制这些愿望，这样就不会有一个国家把自己看作另一个国家的爪牙。这些条款必须满足官方利益，以免引起官方分裂，但它们必须符合民众的观念，以防止士气低落的蔓延。简而言之，它们必须在战争继续进行的情况下维护和巩固盟国的团结。</p><p class="normal3">Having enlisted the interest of the world, it was necessary to hold that interest unified and flexible for all the different possibilities which the situation contained. The terms had to be such that the majority among the Allies would regard them as worth while. They had to meet the national aspirations of each people, and yet to limit those aspirations so that no one nation would regard itself as a catspaw for another. The terms had to satisfy official interests so as not to provoke official disunion, and yet they had to meet popular conceptions so as to prevent the spread of demoralization. They had, in short, to preserve and confirm Allied unity in case the war was to go on.</p>
<p class="normal3">但它们也必须是可能的和平条件，这样，如果德国中左翼准备好进行煽动，他们就有了打击统治阶级的文本。因此，这些条件必须促使盟国总督更接近他们的人民，将德国总督赶出他们的人民，并在盟国、非官方德国人和奥匈帝国的臣民之间建立一条共同理解的路线。十四点计划是一个大胆的尝试，旨在提高几乎每个人都可以遵守的标准。如果有足够多的敌方人民做好准备，那么和平就会实现；如果没有，那么盟国将更好地准备承受战争的冲击。</p><p class="normal3">But they had also to be the terms of a possible peace, so that in case the German center and left were ripe for agitation, they would have a text with which to smite the governing class. The terms had, therefore, to push the Allied governors nearer to their people, drive the German governors away from their people, and establish a line of common understanding between the Allies, the non-official Germans, and the subject peoples of Austria-Hungary. The Fourteen Points were a daring attempt to raise a standard to which almost everyone might repair. If a sufficient number of the enemy people were ready there would be peace; if not, then the Allies would be better prepared to sustain the shock of war.</p>
<p class="normal3">所有这些考虑都体现在十四点原则的制定中。也许没有一个人能把所有原则都考虑在内，但所有相关人员都考虑到了其中的一些原则。在此背景下，让我们来研究一下这份文件的某些方面。前五点和第十四点涉及“开放外交”、“海洋自由”、“平等贸易机会”、“裁减军备”、不进行帝国主义吞并殖民地以及国际联盟。它们可能被描述为当时每个人都声称相信的流行概括的陈述。但第三点更具体。它是有意识地直接针对巴黎经济会议的决议，旨在减轻德国人民对窒息的恐惧。</p><p class="normal3">All these considerations entered into the making of the Fourteen Points. No one man may have had them all in mind, but all the men concerned had some of them in mind. Against this background let us examine certain aspects of the document. The first five points and the fourteenth deal with "open diplomacy," "freedom of the seas," "equal trade opportunities," "reduction of armaments," no imperialist annexation of colonies, and the League of Nations. They might be described as a statement of the popular generalizations in which everyone at that time professed to believe. But number three is more specific. It was aimed consciously and directly at the resolutions of the Paris Economic Conference, and was meant to relieve the German people of their fear of suffocation.</p>
<p class="normal3">第六条是第一项涉及特定国家的条款。它旨在回应俄罗斯对盟国的怀疑，其承诺的雄辩与布列斯特-立陶夫斯克的戏剧性事件相呼应。第七条涉及比利时，其形式和目的与几乎整个世界（包括中欧大部分地区）的信念一样不加修饰。第八条我们必须停下来思考。它首先是绝对要求撤离和恢复法国领土，然后转向阿尔萨斯-洛林问题。这一条款的措辞最完美地说明了公开声明的特点，它必须用几句话来概括大量的利益。“1871 年普鲁士在阿尔萨斯-洛林问题上对法国犯下的错误，已经扰乱了近五十年的世界和平，应该得到纠正。……”这里的每一个词都经过了精心挑选。犯下的错误应该得到纠正；为什么不说应该恢复阿尔萨斯-洛林？之所以没有这么说，是因为<i class="calibre10">当时</i>还不确定
 如果举行全民公决，所有法国人是否会无限期地为重新吞并而战；而且英国人和意大利人是否会继续战斗更是不确定。因此，这个公式必须涵盖这两种情况。“纠正”一词保证法国满意，但并不意味着承诺简单吞并。但为什么要谈论<i class="calibre10">普鲁士</i>
 在<i class="calibre10">1871 年</i>犯下的错误
 ？当然，普鲁士这个词是为了提醒南德人，阿尔萨斯-洛林不属于他们，而是属于普鲁士。为什么要说“五十年”以来的和平，为什么要用“1871”这个词？首先，法国人和世界其他国家记住的是 1871 年。那是他们不满的节点。但十四点计划的制定者知道，法国官方计划的不仅仅是 1871 年的阿尔萨斯-洛林。1916 年沙皇部长与法国官员之间传递的秘密备忘录涵盖了吞并萨尔河谷和某种程度上肢解莱茵兰。计划将萨尔河谷纳入“阿尔萨斯-洛林”一词，因为它在 1814 年曾是阿尔萨斯-洛林的一部分，尽管它在 1815 年被分离出来，并且在普法战争结束时不属于该领土。法国吞并萨尔的官方方案是将其纳入“阿尔萨斯-洛林”，即 1814-1815 年的阿尔萨斯-洛林。总统坚持“1871年”实际上是在划定德国和法国之间的最终边界，是在提及秘密条约，并将其抛在一边。</p><p class="normal3">Number six is the first point dealing with a particular nation. It was intended as a reply to Russian suspicion of the Allies, and the eloquence of its promises was attuned to the drama of Brest-Litovsk. Number seven deals with Belgium, and is as unqualified in form and purpose as was the conviction of practically the whole world, including very large sections of Central Europe. Over number eight we must pause. It begins with an absolute demand for evacuation and restoration of French territory, and then passes on to the question of Alsace-Lorraine. The phrasing of this clause most perfectly illustrates the character of a public statement which must condense a vast complex of interests in a few words. "And the wrong done to France by Prussia in 1871 in the matter of Alsace-Lorraine, which has unsettled the peace of the world for nearly fifty years, should be righted. …" Every word here was chosen with meticulous care. The wrong done should be righted; why not say that Alsace-Lorraine should be restored? It was not said, because it was not certain that all of the French <i class="calibre10">at that time</i>
 would fight on indefinitely for reannexation if they were offered a plebiscite; and because it was even less certain whether the English and Italians would fight on. The formula had, therefore, to cover both contingencies. The word "righted" guaranteed satisfaction to France, but did not read as a commitment to simple annexation. But why speak of the wrong done by <i class="calibre10">Prussia</i>
 in <i class="calibre10">1871</i>
 ? The word Prussia was, of course, intended to remind the South Germans that Alsace-Lorraine belonged not to them but to Prussia. Why speak of peace unsettled for "fifty years," and why the use of "1871"? In the first place, what the French and the rest of the world remembered was 1871. That was the nodal point of their grievance. But the formulators of the Fourteen Points knew that French officialdom planned for more than the Alsace-Lorraine of 1871. The secret memoranda that had passed between the Czar's ministers and French officials in 1916 covered the annexation of the Saar Valley and some sort of dismemberment of the Rhineland. It was planned to include the Saar Valley under the term "Alsace-Lorraine" because it had been part of Alsace-Lorraine in 1814, though it had been detached in 1815, and was no part of the territory at the close of the Franco-Prussian war. The official French formula for annexing the Saar was to subsume it under "Alsace-Lorraine" meaning the Alsace-Lorraine of 1814-1815. By insistence on "1871" the President was really defining the ultimate boundary between Germany and France, was adverting to the secret treaty, and was casting it aside.</p>
<p class="normal3">第九条对意大利采取了同样的做法，但不那么微妙。“清晰可辨的民族界限”恰恰是《伦敦条约》所没有的界限。这些界限部分是战略性的，部分是经济性的，部分是帝国主义性的，部分是民族性的。其中唯一可能获得盟国同情的部分是恢复真正的“意大利独立”。其余部分，正如所有知情人士所知，只是延缓了即将发生的南斯拉夫起义。</p><p class="normal3">Number nine, a little less subtly, does the same thing in respect to Italy. "Clearly recognizable lines of nationality" are exactly what the lines of the Treaty of London were not. Those lines were partly strategic, partly economic, partly imperialistic, partly ethnic. The only part of them that could possibly procure allied sympathy was that which would recover the genuine Italia Irredenta. All the rest, as everyone who was informed knew, merely delayed the impending Jugoslav revolt.</p>

<p class="normal3">认为对十四点计划的一致欢迎代表了对计划的一致同意是错误的。每个人似乎都找到了自己喜欢的东西，并强调了这一点和那一点。但没有人敢进行讨论。这些充满文明世界潜在冲突的措辞被接受了。它们代表着对立的思想，但却唤起了共同的情感。从这个意义上说，它们在团结西方人民应对他们仍需忍受的十个月的绝望战争方面发挥了作用。</p><p class="normal3">It would be a mistake to suppose that the apparently unanimous enthusiasm which greeted the Fourteen Points represented agreement on a program. Everyone seemed to find something that he liked and stressed this aspect and that detail. But no one risked a discussion. The phrases, so pregnant with the underlying conflicts of the civilized world, were accepted. They stood for opposing ideas, but they evoked a common emotion. And to that extent they played a part in rallying the western peoples for the desperate ten months of war which they had still to endure.</p>
<p class="normal3">只要十四点计划处理的是痛苦即将结束的朦胧而幸福的未来，真正的解释冲突就不会显现出来。它们是解决完全看不见的环境问题的计划，由于这些计划激发了所有团体各自怀有的私人希望，所以所有的希望都汇聚在一起，成为一种公共希望。正如我们在休斯先生的演讲中看到的那样，和谐是一个符号的等级制度。随着你为了包括越来越多的派别而上升到这个等级制度，你可能会暂时保持情感联系，尽管你失去了理智。但即使是情感也会变得淡薄。随着你离经验越来越远，你会越来越深入地概括或微妙。随着你乘坐气球上升，你会把越来越多的具体物体扔到船外，当你带着一些像人权或为民主而安全的世界这样的短语到达顶端时，你看得很远，但你看到的却很少。然而，被情绪所感染的人并不会保持被动。随着公众诉求越来越成为所有人的普遍诉求，随着情感被激起而意义被分散，其私人意义被赋予了普遍应用。你迫切想要的就是人权。因为这个越来越空洞、几乎可以指任何意思的短语，很快就变得几乎指一切。威尔逊先生的措辞在世界的每个角落都有着无穷无尽的不同理解。没有任何经过谈判并公开记录的文件可以纠正这种混乱。因此，当解决之日到来时，每个人都期待着一切。条约的欧洲作者有很大的选择，他们选择实现那些在国内拥有最大权力的同胞所抱有的期望。</p><p class="normal3">As long as the Fourteen Points dealt with that hazy and happy future when the agony was to be over, the real conflicts of interpretation were not made manifest. They were plans for the settlement of a wholly invisible environment, and because these plans inspired all groups each with its own private hope, all hopes ran together as a public hope. For harmonization, as we saw in Mr. Hughes's speech, is a hierarchy of symbols. As you ascend the hierarchy in order to include more and more factions you may for a time preserve the emotional connection though you lose the intellectual. But even the emotion becomes thinner. As you go further away from experience, you go higher into generalization or subtlety. As you go up in the balloon you throw more and more concrete objects overboard, and when you have reached the top with some phrase like the Rights of Humanity or the World Made Safe for Democracy, you see far and wide, but you see very little. Yet the people whose emotions are entrained do not remain passive. As the public appeal becomes more and more all things to all men, as the emotion is stirred while the meaning is dispersed, their very private meanings are given a universal application. Whatever you want badly is the Rights of Humanity. For the phrase, ever more vacant, capable of meaning almost anything, soon comes to mean pretty nearly everything. Mr. Wilson's phrases were understood in endlessly different ways in every corner of the earth. No document negotiated and made of public record existed to correct the confusion. And so, when the day of settlement came, everybody expected everything. The European authors of the treaty had a large choice, and they chose to realize those expectations which were held by those of their countrymen who wielded the most power at home.</p>
<p class="normal3">他们从人权到法国、英国和意大利的权利，一路走来。他们没有放弃使用象征。他们放弃的只是那些在战后在其选民的想象中没有永久根基的象征。他们通过使用象征来维护法国的统一，但他们不会为欧洲的统一而冒任何风险。法国深深地依附于象征，而欧洲的象征则只是近期才出现的。然而，像欧洲这样的综合体和像法国这样的象征之间的区别并不明显。国家和帝国的历史揭示了统一思想的范围有时扩大，有时缩小。人们不能说人们一直在从较小的忠诚转向更大的忠诚，因为事实不会证实这一说法。罗马帝国和神圣罗马帝国比 19 世纪那些世界国家信徒通过类比论证的国家统一更加膨胀。然而，无论帝国的暂时通货膨胀和通货紧缩如何，真正的一体化可能确实有所增加。</p><p class="normal3">They came down the hierarchy from the Rights of Humanity to the Rights of France, Britain and Italy. They did not abandon the use of symbols. They abandoned only those which after the war had no permanent roots in the imagination of their constituents. They preserved the unity of France by the use of symbolism, but they would not risk anything for the unity of Europe. The symbol France was deeply attached, the symbol Europe had only a recent history. Nevertheless the distinction between an omnibus like Europe and a symbol like France is not sharp. The history of states and empires reveals times when the scope of the unifying idea increases and also times when it shrinks. One cannot say that men have moved consistently from smaller loyalties to larger ones, because the facts will not bear out the claim. The Roman Empire and the Holy Roman Empire bellied out further than those national unifications in the Nineteenth Century from which believers in a World State argue by analogy. Nevertheless, it is probably true that the real integration has increased regardless of the temporary inflation and deflation of empires.</p>

<p class="normal3">这种真正的融合无疑在美国历史上发生过。在 1789 年之前的十年里，大多数人似乎都觉得他们的州和他们的社区是真实的，但州联盟是不真实的。他们的州、州旗、州最杰出的领导人或任何代表马萨诸塞州或弗吉尼亚州的东西都是真正的象征。也就是说，他们从童年、职业、居住等实际经历中汲取了营养。人们的经历范围很少跨越他们州的想象边界。弗吉尼亚人这个词几乎与大多数弗吉尼亚人所知道或感受到的一切有关。这是与他们的经历真正联系的最广泛的政治观念。</p><p class="normal3">Such a real integration has undoubtedly occurred in American history. In the decade before 1789 most men, it seems, felt that their state and their community were real, but that the confederation of states was unreal. The idea of their state, its flag, its most conspicuous leaders, or whatever it was that represented Massachusetts, or Virginia, were genuine symbols. That is to say, they were fed by actual experiences from childhood, occupation, residence, and the like. The span of men's experience had rarely traversed the imaginary boundaries of their states. The word Virginian was related to pretty nearly everything that most Virginians had ever known or felt. It was the most extensive political idea which had genuine contact with their experience.</p>
<p class="normal3">他们的经历，而不是他们的需求。因为他们的需求源自他们真实的环境，当时的环境至少与十三个殖民地一样大。他们需要共同的防御。他们需要一个像邦联一样广泛的金融和经济体制。但只要州的伪环境包围着他们，州的象征就会耗尽他们的政治兴趣。像邦联这样的州际理念代表着一种无能为力的抽象。它是一个综合体，而不是一个象征，而综合体创造的不同群体之间的和谐是短暂的。</p><p class="normal3">Their experience, not their needs. For their needs arose out of their real environment, which in those days was at least as large as the thirteen colonies. They needed a common defense. They needed a financial and economic regime as extensive as the Confederation. But as long as the pseudo-environment of the state encompassed them, the state symbols exhausted their political interest. An interstate idea, like the Confederation, represented a powerless abstraction. It was an omnibus, rather than a symbol, and the harmony among divergent groups, which the omnibus creates, is transient.</p>
<p class="normal3">我说过，联邦的概念是无力的抽象。然而，在宪法通过之前的十年里，统一的需要是存在的。这种需要是存在的，因为如果不考虑统一的需要，事情就会变得不正常。每个殖民地的某些阶级逐渐开始突破州的经验。他们的个人利益跨越了州界，走向了州际经验，逐渐在他们的脑海中构建了一幅真正具有全国范围的美国环境图景。对他们来说，联邦的概念成为一个真正的象征，而不再是一个综合的概念。这些人中最有想象力的是亚历山大·汉密尔顿。他并不对任何一个州有原始的依恋，因为他出生在西印度群岛，从他活跃生活的一开始，他就与所有州的共同利益联系在一起。因此，对当时的大多数人来说，首都应该在弗吉尼亚还是费城的问题非常重要，因为他们有地方意识。对汉密尔顿来说，这个问题没有感情上的影响；他想要的是承担州债务，因为这将进一步将拟议中的联盟国有化。因此，他很乐意用州议会所在地换取波托马克区代表的两张必要的选票。对汉密尔顿来说，联盟是代表他所有利益和整个经历的象征；对来自波托马克的怀特和李来说，他们所在省份的象征是他们所服务的最高政治实体，他们为之服务，尽管他们不愿意付出代价。杰斐逊说，他们同意改变投票，“怀特感到胃部几乎痉挛。”</p><p class="normal3">I have said that the idea of confederation was a powerless abstraction. Yet the need of unity existed in the decade before the Constitution was adopted. The need existed, in the sense that affairs were askew unless the need of unity was taken into account. Gradually certain classes in each colony began to break through the state experience. Their personal interests led across the state lines to interstate experiences, and gradually there was constructed in their minds a picture of the American environment which was truly national in scope. For them the idea of federation became a true symbol, and ceased to be an omnibus. The most imaginative of these men was Alexander Hamilton. It happened that he had no primitive attachment to any one state, for he was born in the West Indies, and had, from the very beginning of his active life, been associated with the common interests of all the states. Thus to most men of the time the question of whether the capital should be in Virginia or in Philadelphia was of enormous importance, because they were locally minded. To Hamilton this question was of no emotional consequence; what he wanted was the assumption of the state debts because they would further nationalize the proposed union. So he gladly traded the site of the capitol for two necessary votes from men who represented the Potomac district. To Hamilton the Union was a symbol that represented all his interests and his whole experience; to White and Lee from the Potomac, the symbol of their province was the highest political entity they served, and they served it though they hated to pay the price. They agreed, says Jefferson, to change their votes, "White with a revulsion of stomach almost convulsive."</p>
<p class="normal3">在共同意志的结晶中，总有一位亚历山大·汉密尔顿在努力工作。</p><p class="normal3">In the crystallizing of a common will, there is always an Alexander Hamilton at work.</p>

<p class="normal3">符号通常非常有用，而且具有神秘的力量，以至于这个词本身就散发着一种神奇的魅力。在思考符号时，人们很容易把它们当作拥有独立能量的东西。然而，无数曾经引起狂喜的符号已经完全不再影响任何人了。博物馆和民间传说书籍中充满了死气沉沉的象征和咒语，因为符号除了通过与人类思想的联想而获得的力量外，没有任何力量。那些失去了力量的符号，以及那些不断被暗示却未能扎根的符号，提醒我们，如果我们有足够的耐心去详细研究一个符号的流通，我们就会看到一段完全世俗的历史。</p><p class="normal3">Symbols are often so useful and so mysteriously powerful that the word itself exhales a magical glamor. In thinking about symbols it is tempting to treat them as if they possessed independent energy. Yet no end of symbols which once provoked ecstasy have quite ceased to affect anybody. The museums and the books of folklore are full of dead emblems and incantations, since there is no power in the symbol, except that which it acquires by association in the human mind. The symbols that have lost their power, and the symbols incessantly suggested which fail to take root, remind us that if we were patient enough to study in detail the circulation of a symbol, we should behold an entirely secular history.</p>
<p class="normal3">在休斯的竞选演讲、十四点计划和汉密尔顿的计划中，都运用了象征。但它们是由某个人在特定时刻使用的。这些词语本身并不是随意情感的具体体现。这些词语必须由处于战略位置的人说出，而且必须在适当的时机说出。否则它们就只是一阵风。这些象征必须有所标记。因为它们本身毫无意义，而可供选择的象征总是如此之多，以至于我们就像站在两捆干草中间等距离的驴子一样，在争夺我们注意力的象征中犹豫不决，最终会死去。</p><p class="normal3">In the Hughes campaign speech, in the Fourteen Points, in Hamilton's project, symbols are employed. But they are employed by somebody at a particular moment. The words themselves do not crystallize random feeling. The words must be spoken by people who are strategically placed, and they must be spoken at the opportune moment. Otherwise they are mere wind. The symbols must be earmarked. For in themselves they mean nothing, and the choice of possible symbols is always so great that we should, like the donkey who stood equidistant between two bales of hay, perish from sheer indecision among the symbols that compete for our attention.</p>
<p class="normal3">例如，以下是 1920 年选举前夕某些公民向报纸陈述的投票理由。</p><p class="normal3">Here, for example, are the reasons for their vote as stated by certain private citizens to a newspaper just before the election of 1920.</p>

<p class="normal3">“今天，那些为哈定和柯立芝投票的爱国男女，后人将认为他们签署了我们的《第二独立宣言》。</p>

<p class="normal3">“他将确保美国不会加入‘纠缠联盟’，而将政府控制权从民主党转移到共和党，华盛顿这座城市将受益匪浅。”</p>
</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">"He will see to it that the United States does not enter into 'entangling alliances,' Washington as a city will benefit by changing the control of the government from the Democrats to the Republicans."</p>

<p class="normal3">克拉伦斯先生——推销员。</p><p class="normal3">Mr. Clarence—, salesman.</p>
<p class="normal3">对于考克斯来说：</p><p class="normal3">For Cox:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">“美国人民认识到，加入国际联盟是我们在法国战场上宣誓的责任。我们必须承担维护世界和平的责任。”</p>
</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">"The people of the United States realize that it is our duty pledged on the fields of France, to join the League of Nations. We must shoulder our share of the burden of enforcing peace throughout the world."</p>

<p class="normal3">玛丽小姐——，速记员。</p><p class="normal3">Miss Marie—, stenographer.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="normal3">斯宾塞先生——统计学家。</p><p class="normal3">Mr. Spencer—, statistician.</p>
<p class="normal3">这两组说法同样高尚，同样真实，而且几乎可以颠倒过来。克拉伦斯和威尔莫特会不会承认他们有意不履行我们在法国战场上宣誓的义务；或者他们不希望国际和平？当然不会。玛丽和斯宾塞会不会承认他们赞成纠缠不清的联盟或放弃美国独立？他们会和你争论说，正如威尔逊总统所说，国际联盟是一个解开纠缠的联盟，也是一份面向全世界的《独立宣言》，以及一份面向地球的《门罗主义》。</p><p class="normal3">The two sets of phrases are equally noble, equally true, and almost reversible. Would Clarence and Wilmot have admitted for an instant that they intended to default in our duty pledged on the fields of France; or that they did not desire international peace? Certainly not. Would Marie and Spencer have admitted that they were in favor of entangling alliances or the surrender of American independence? They would have argued with you that the League was, as President Wilson called it, a disentangling alliance, as well as a Declaration of Independence for all the world, plus a Monroe Doctrine for the planet.</p>

<p class="normal3">既然符号的提供如此慷慨，而可以赋予的意义又如此灵活，那么任何特定的符号是如何在任何特定的人的心中扎根的呢？它是由另一个我们认为具有权威的人植入的。如果它植入得足够深，那么我们以后可能会称向我们挥舞那个符号的人为权威。但首先，符号之所以具有亲和力和重要性，是因为它们是由亲和力和重要的人介绍给我们的。</p><p class="normal3">Since the offering of symbols is so generous, and the meaning that can be imputed is so elastic, how does any particular symbol take root in any particular person's mind? It is planted there by another human being whom we recognize as authoritative. If it is planted deeply enough, it may be that later we shall call the person authoritative who waves that symbol at us. But in the first instance symbols are made congenial and important because they are introduced to us by congenial and important people.</p>
<p class="normal3">因为我们并非十八岁就从蛋里出生，拥有现实的想象力；正如萧伯纳先生所回忆的，我们仍然处于伯格和鲁宾的时代，婴儿时期我们依赖年长的人来与人接触。因此，我们通过某些受人爱戴和权威的人与外界建立联系。他们是通往无形世界的第一座桥梁。尽管我们可以逐渐掌握更大环境的许多方面，但总有一个更大的未知领域。我们仍然通过权威来与它联系。在所有事实都看不见的地方，真实的报道和似是而非的错误读起来、听起来、感觉都一样。</p><p class="normal3">For we are not born out of an egg at the age of eighteen with a realistic imagination; we are still, as Mr. Shaw recalls, in the era of Burge and Lubin, where in infancy we are dependent upon older beings for our contacts. And so we make our connections with the outer world through certain beloved and authoritative persons. They are the first bridge to the invisible world. And though we may gradually master for ourselves many phases of that larger environment, there always remains a vaster one that is unknown. To that we still relate ourselves through authorities. Where all the facts are out of sight a true report and a plausible error read alike, sound alike, feel alike.</p>
<p class="normal3">除了少数我们自己非常了解的话题外，我们无法在真实与虚假的报道之间做出选择。因此，我们只能在值得信赖的记者与不值得信赖的记者之间做出选择。</p><p class="normal3">Except on a few subjects where our own knowledge is great, we cannot choose between true and false accounts. So we choose between trustworthy and untrustworthy reporters.</p>
<p class="normal3">从理论上讲，我们应该选择每个主题上最专业的专家。但是，选择专家虽然比选择真理容易得多，但仍然太难，而且往往不切实际。专家们自己也不确定他们当中谁是最专业的。而且，即使我们可以识别出专家，也可能太忙而无法咨询，或者无法联系到他。但是，有些人我们可以很容易地识别出来，因为他们是事务的负责人。父母、老师和有专长的朋友是我们遇到的第一批这样的人。我们不需要试图深入探讨为什么孩子信任一个父母而不是另一个父母、信任历史老师而不是主日学校老师这个难题。我们也不需要试图深入探讨信任是如何通过报纸或对公共事务感兴趣的熟人逐渐传播到公众人物的。精神分析文献中充满了富有启发性的假设。</p><p class="normal3">Theoretically we ought to choose the most expert on each subject. But the choice of the expert, though a good deal easier than the choice of truth, is still too difficult and often impracticable. The experts themselves are not in the least certain who among them is the most expert. And at that, the expert, even when we can identify him, is, likely as not, too busy to be consulted, or impossible to get at. But there are people whom we can identify easily enough because they are the people who are at the head of affairs. Parents, teachers, and masterful friends are the first people of this sort we encounter. Into the difficult question of why children trust one parent rather than another, the history teacher rather than the Sunday school teacher, we need not try to enter. Nor how trust gradually spreads through a newspaper or an acquaintance who is interested in public affairs to public personages. The literature of psychoanalysis is rich in suggestive hypothesis.</p>
<p class="normal3">无论如何，我们确实会信任某些人，他们是我们与几乎整个未知世界联系的途径。奇怪的是，这一事实有时被认为天生就不体面，是人类像绵羊、像猿猴的天性的证据。但在宇宙中完全独立是不可想象的。如果我们不能把几乎所有事情都视为理所当然，那么我们就会过着极其琐碎的生活。最接近完全独立的成年人是隐士，隐士的活动范围非常短。他完全为自己而行动，只能在很小的范围内行动，并且只为简单目的而行动。如果他有时间去思考伟大的思想，我们可以肯定，在他成为隐士之前，他毫无疑问地接受了一整套痛苦获得的信息，包括如何保暖、如何不挨饿，以及什么是重大问题。</p><p class="normal3">At any rate we do find ourselves trusting certain people, who constitute our means of junction with pretty nearly the whole realm of unknown things. Strangely enough, this fact is sometimes regarded as inherently undignified, as evidence of our sheep-like, ape-like nature. But complete independence in the universe is simply unthinkable. If we could not take practically everything for granted, we should spend our lives in utter triviality. The nearest thing to a wholly independent adult is a hermit, and the range of a hermit's action is very short. Acting entirely for himself, he can act only within a tiny radius and for simple ends. If he has time to think great thoughts we can be certain that he has accepted without question, before he went in for being a hermit, a whole repertory of painfully acquired information about how to keep warm and how to keep from being hungry, and also about what the great questions are.</p>
<p class="normal3">在我们一生中除了极少数短暂的事情之外，我们所能行使的最大独立性就是增加我们友好倾听的权威。作为天生的业余爱好者，我们对真理的追求在于激励专家，迫使他们回答任何带有说服力的异端。在这样的辩论中，我们常常可以判断谁赢得了辩证的胜利，但我们几乎无法抵御任何辩论者都没有挑战的错误前提，或者他们都没有在辩论中提出的被忽视的方面。我们稍后将看到民主理论是如何在相反的假设下进行的，并假设政府有无限的自给自足的个人供应。</p><p class="normal3">On all but a very few matters for short stretches in our lives, the utmost independence that we can exercise is to multiply the authorities to whom we give a friendly hearing. As congenital amateurs our quest for truth consists in stirring up the experts, and forcing them to answer any heresy that has the accent of conviction. In such a debate we can often judge who has won the dialectical victory, but we are virtually defenseless against a false premise that none of the debaters has challenged, or a neglected aspect that none of them has brought into the argument. We shall see later how the democratic theory proceeds on the opposite assumption and assumes for the purposes of government an unlimited supply of self-sufficient individuals.</p>
<p class="normal3">我们依赖那些与外界接触的人，似乎是在管理这个世界。他们可能只管理着世界的一小部分。保姆喂孩子、给孩子洗澡、哄孩子睡觉。但这并不意味着保姆是物理学、动物学和高等批判方面的权威。史密斯先生管理或至少雇佣了工厂经理。但这并不意味着他是美国宪法方面的权威，也不意味着他是美国福特尼关税影响方面的权威。斯穆特先生管理犹他州的共和党。这本身并不能证明他是税收方面的最佳顾问。但保姆可能暂时决定孩子应该学习什么动物学，史密斯先生将对宪法对他的妻子、秘书甚至牧师的意义发表很多意见，谁来定义斯穆特参议员的权力范围？</p><p class="normal3">The people on whom we depend for contact with the outer world are those who seem to be running it. They may be running only a very small part of the world. The nurse feeds the child, bathes it, and puts it to bed. That does not constitute the nurse an authority on physics, zoology, and the Higher Criticism. Mr. Smith runs, or at least hires, the man who runs the factory. That does not make him an authority on the Constitution of the United States, nor on the effects \of the Fordney tariff. Mr. Smoot runs the Republican party in the State of Utah. That in itself does not prove he is the best man to consult about taxation. But the nurse may nevertheless determine for a while what zoology the child shall learn, Mr. Smith will have much to say on what the Constitution shall mean to his wife, his secretary, and perhaps even to his parson, and who shall define the limits of Senator Smoot's authority?</p>
<p class="normal3">牧师、庄园主、船长和国王、政党领袖、商人、老板，不管这些人是通过出身、继承、征服还是选举产生的，他们和他们有组织的追随者管理着人类事务。他们是官员，虽然同一个人在家里可能是陆军元帅，在办公室可能是少尉，在政治上可能是普通士兵，虽然在许多机构中，等级制度是模糊或隐蔽的，但在每一个需要许多人合作的机构中，都存在着这样的等级制度。在美国政治中，我们称之为机器或“组织”。</p><p class="normal3">The priest, the lord of the manor, the captains and the kings, the party leaders, the merchant, the boss, however these men are chosen, whether by birth, inheritance, conquest or election, they and their organized following administer human affairs. They are the officers, and although the same man may be field marshal at home, second lieutenant at the office, and scrub private in politics, although in many institutions the hierarchy of rank is vague or concealed, yet in every institution that requires the cooperation of many persons, some such hierarchy exists. In American politics we call it a machine, or "the organization."</p>

<p class="normal3">机构成员与普通成员之间存在一些重要区别。领导者、指导委员会和核心圈子直接接触环境。当然，他们对于应该定义环境的概念可能非常有限，但他们处理的几乎不完全是抽象概念。他们希望看到特定的人当选，希望看到特定的资产负债表得到改善，必须实现具体的目标。我并不是说他们摆脱了人类刻板印象的倾向。他们的刻板印象常常使他们成为荒谬的例行公事者。但无论他们有何局限性，首领们实际上与更大环境的一些关键部分保持着联系。他们做出决定。他们下达命令。他们讨价还价。然后，一些明确的事情，也许根本不是他们想象的那样，真的发生了。</p><p class="normal3">There are a number of important distinctions between the members of the machine and the rank and file. The leaders, the steering committee and the inner circle, are in direct contact with their environment. They may, to be sure, have a very limited notion of what they ought to define as the environment, but they are not dealing almost wholly with abstractions. There are particular men they hope to see elected, particular balance sheets they wish to see improved, concrete objectives that must be attained. I do not mean that they escape the human propensity to stereotyped vision. Their stereotypes often make them absurd routineers. But whatever their limitations, the chiefs are in actual contact with some crucial part of that larger environment. They decide. They give orders. They bargain. And something definite, perhaps not at all what they imagined, actually happens.</p>
<p class="normal3">他们的下属并没有共同的信念束缚着他们。也就是说，机器中地位较低的成员不会根据对领导者智慧的独立判断来决定他们的忠诚度。在等级制度中，每个人都依赖于上级，而上级又优于他的某个下属阶层。将机器凝聚在一起的是特权制度。这些特权可能因寻求它们的人的机会和品味而异，从各方面的裙带关系和恩惠到宗族主义、英雄崇拜或固定观念。从军队中的军衔，到封建制度中的土地和服务，再到现代民主国家中的工作和声望，它们各不相同。这就是为什么你可以通过废除特权来解散某个特定的机器。但我相信，在每一个有凝聚力的群体中，机器肯定会重新出现。因为特权完全是相对的，而统一是不可能的。想象一下你头脑中所能想象到的最绝对的共产主义，在那里没有人拥有其他人所没有的任何东西，而且，如果共产主义团体必须采取任何行动，我相信，仅仅是成为即将发表获得最多选票的演讲的人的朋友就足以在他周围形成一个内部组织。</p><p class="normal3">Their subordinates are not tied to them by a common conviction. That is to say the lesser members of a machine do not dispose their loyalty according to independent judgment about the wisdom of the leaders. In the hierarchy each is dependent upon a superior and is in turn superior to some class of his dependents. What holds the machine together is a system of privileges. These may vary according to the opportunities and the tastes of those who seek them, from nepotism and patronage in all their aspects to clannishness, hero-worship or a fixed idea. They vary from military rank in armies, through land and services in a feudal system, to jobs and publicity in a modern democracy. That is why you can breakup a particular machine by abolishing its privileges. But the machine in every coherent group is, I believe, certain to reappear. For privilege is entirely relative, and uniformity is impossible. Imagine the most absolute communism of which your mind is capable, where no one possessed any object that everyone else did not possess, and still, if the communist group had to take any action whatever, the mere pleasure of being the friend of the man who was going to make the speech that secured the most votes, would, I am convinced, be enough to crystallize an organization of insiders around him.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，我们没有必要发明一种集体智慧来解释为什么一个群体的判断通常比普通人的言论更连贯、更真实。一个人或几个人可以遵循一种思路，但一个试图一致思考的群体作为一个群体所能做的只不过是同意或反对。等级制度的成员可以有企业传统。作为学徒，他们从师傅那里学习手艺，而师傅又是在他们还是学徒时学到的，在任何持久的社会中，统治等级制度中的人员变动都很慢，足以让某些伟大的刻板印象和行为模式得以传承。从父亲到儿子，从主教到新手，从老手到学员，某些观察和做事的方式被传授。这些方式变得熟悉，并被广大局外人认可。</p><p class="normal3">It is not necessary, then, to invent a collective intelligence in order to explain why the judgments of a group are usually more coherent, and often more true to form than the remarks of the man in the street. One mind, or a few can pursue a train of thought, but a group trying to think in concert can as a group do little more than assent or dissent. The members of a hierarchy can have a corporate tradition. As apprentices they learn the trade from the masters, who in turn learned it when they were apprentices, and in any enduring society, the change of personnel within the governing hierarchies is slow enough to permit the transmission of certain great stereotypes and patterns of behavior. From father to son, from prelate to novice, from veteran to cadet, certain ways of seeing and doing are taught. These ways become familiar, and are recognized as such by the mass of outsiders.</p>

<p class="normal3">距离本身就使人们相信，在任何复杂事务中，大量人类都会合作，而无需由极少数人管理的中央机器。布莱斯说：“没有人会在立法机构或行政机构中拥有数年处理事务的经验，却不注意到管理世界的人是多么的少。”当然，他指的是国家事务。当然，如果你考虑人类的所有事务，那么执政的人的数量是相当可观的，但如果你考虑任何特定的机构，无论是立法机构、政党、工会、民族主义运动、工厂还是俱乐部，执政者的数量只占理论上应该执政的人的很小一部分。</p><p class="normal3">Distance alone lends enchantment to the view that masses of human beings ever cooperate in any complex affair without a central machine managed by a very few people. "No one," says Bryce, "can have had some years' experience of the conduct of affairs in a legislature or an administration without observing how extremely small is the number of persons by whom the world is governed." He is referring, of course, to affairs of state. To be sure if you consider all the affairs of mankind the number of people who govern is considerable, but if you take any particular institution, be it a legislature, a party, a trade union, a nationalist movement, a factory, or a club, the number of those who govern is a very small percentage of those who are theoretically supposed to govern.</p>
<p class="normal3">大选可以关闭一台机器，换上另一台机器；革命有时会彻底废除某台机器。民主革命建立了两台交替运转的机器，每台机器在几年内都会从另一台机器的错误中获益。但机器并没有消失。田园诗般的民主理论并没有在任何地方实现。工会、社会主义政党和共产主义政府肯定没有。有一个核心圈子，周围是同心圆，逐渐消失在无私或不感兴趣的普通民众中。</p><p class="normal3">Landslides can turn one machine out and put another in; revolutions sometimes abolish a particular machine altogether. The democratic revolution set up two alternating machines, each of which in the course of a few years reaps the advantage from the mistakes of the other. But nowhere does the machine disappear. Nowhere is the idyllic theory of democracy realized. Certainly not in trades unions, nor in socialist parties, nor in communist governments. There is an inner circle, surrounded by concentric circles which fade out gradually into the disinterested or uninterested rank and file.</p>
<p class="normal3">民主党人从未接受过这种普遍的集体生活。他们总是认为这是不合理的。因为民主有两种观点：一种假设个人自给自足；另一种假设超灵控制一切。</p><p class="normal3">Democrats have never come to terms with this commonplace of group life. They have invariably regarded it as perverse. For there are two visions of democracy: one presupposes the self-sufficient individual; the other an Oversoul regulating everything.</p>
<p class="normal3">在这两者中，超灵具有一些优势，因为它至少认识到，大众做出的决定并非自发地产生于每个成员的心中。但是，如果我们把注意力集中在机器上，超灵作为企业行为的主宰天才就成了一个多余的谜。机器是一个相当平凡的现实。它由穿衣服、住在房子里的人类组成，可以命名和描述。他们履行通常分配给超灵的所有职责。</p><p class="normal3">Of the two the Oversoul has some advantage because it does at least recognize that the mass makes decisions that are not spontaneously born in the breast of every member. But the Oversoul as presiding genius in corporate behavior is a superfluous mystery if we fix our attention upon the machine. The machine is a quite prosaic reality. It consists of human beings who wear clothes and live in houses, who can be named and described. They perform all the duties usually assigned to the Oversoul.</p>

<p class="normal3">机器存在的原因不是人性的反常。而是任何群体的私人观念都不会自然而然地产生共同的想法。因为，一群人直接对超出他们能力范围的情况采取行动的方式是有限的。他们中的一些人可以以这种或那种形式迁移，他们可以罢工或抵制，他们可以鼓掌或嘘声。他们偶尔可以通过这些方式抵制他们不喜欢的东西，或者强迫那些阻碍他们想要的东西的人。但是，通过群众行动，什么都不能建设、设计、谈判或管理。公众如果没有一个有组织的等级制度来聚集，可能会因为价格太高而拒绝购买，或者因为工资太低而拒绝工作。工会可以通过罢工的群众行动打破反对派，以便工会官员可以谈判达成协议。例如，它可以赢得联合控制<i class="calibre10">权</i>
 。但它只能通过组织来行使这项权利。一个国家可以要求战争，但当它参战时，它必须服从总参谋部的命令。</p><p class="normal3">The reason for the machine is not the perversity of human nature. It is that out of the private notions of any group no common idea emerges by itself. For the number of ways is limited in which a multitude of people can act directly upon a situation beyond their reach. Some of them can migrate, in one form or another, they can strike or boycott, they can applaud or hiss. They can by these means occasionally resist what they do not like, or coerce those who obstruct what they desire. But by mass action nothing can be constructed, devised, negotiated, or administered. A public as such, without an organized hierarchy around which it can gather, may refuse to buy if the prices are too high, or refuse to work if wages are too low. A trade union can by mass action in a strike break an opposition so that the union officials can negotiate an agreement. It may win, for example, <i class="calibre10">the right</i>
 to joint control. But it cannot exercise the right except through an organization. A nation can clamor for war, but when it goes to war it must put itself under orders from a general staff.</p>
<p class="normal3">在所有实际目的中，直接行动的极限就是有权对向大众提出的问题说“是”或“否”。因为只有在最简单的情况下，问题才会以相同的形式自发地、几乎同时地呈现给公众的所有成员。有无组织的罢工和抵制，不仅仅是工业罢工和抵制，其中的不满是如此明显，以至于几乎没有领导，许多人也会做出同样的反应。但即使在这些基本情况下，也有人比其他人更快地知道自己想做什么，并成为即兴的头目。如果没有他们出现，人群就会漫无目的地四处游荡，被所有私人目标所困扰，或者像前几天 50 人那样，站在一旁，看着一个人自杀。</p><p class="normal3">The limit of direct action is for all practical purposes the power to say Yes or No on an issue presented to the mass. For only in the very simplest cases does an issue present itself in the same form spontaneously and approximately at the same time to all the members of a public. There are unorganized strikes and boycotts, not merely industrial ones, where the grievance is so plain that virtually without leadership the same reaction takes place in many people. But even in these rudimentary cases there are persons who know what they want to do more quickly than the rest, and who become impromptu ringleaders. Where they do not appear a crowd will mill about aimlessly beset by all its private aims, or stand by fatalistically, as did a crowd of fifty persons the other day, and watch a man commit suicide.</p>
<p class="normal3">因为我们从看不见的世界所得到的大多数印象中得出的结论，都是一种在幻想中上演的哑剧。我们很少会自觉地对视线之外的事件做出任何决定，每个人对自己如果努力可以取得什么成就的看法也很少。这很少会成为实际问题，因此也没有很好的决策习惯。如果不是大多数信息在传到我们手中时都带有一种暗示，让我们知道应该如何看待新闻，这一点会更加明显。我们需要这种暗示，如果我们在新闻中找不到，我们就会转向社论或值得信赖的顾问。如果我们觉得自己受到牵连，这种幻想会让我们感到不舒服，直到我们知道自己的立场，也就是说，直到事实已经形成，我们可以对它们感到是或否。</p><p class="normal3">For what we make out of most of the impressions that come to us from the invisible world is a kind of pantomime played out in revery. The number of times is small that we consciously decide anything about events beyond our sight, and each man's opinion of what he could accomplish if he tried, is slight. There is rarely a practical issue, and therefore no great habit of decision. This would be more evident were it not that most information when it reaches us carries with it an aura of suggestion as to how we ought to feel about the news. That suggestion we need, and if we do not find it in the news we turn to the editorials or to a trusted adviser. The revery, if we feel ourselves implicated, is uncomfortable until we know where we stand, that is, until the facts have been formulated so that we can feel Yes or No in regard to them.</p>
<p class="normal3">当许多人都说“是”时，他们可能有各种各样的理由说“是”。他们通常都是这样的。因为正如我们已经注意到的，他们脑海中的画面以微妙而亲密的方式有所不同。但这种微妙性仍然留在他们的脑海中；它通过一些象征性短语公开地表现出来，这些短语在消除了大部分意图之后，承载着个人的情感。等级制度，或者，如果这是一场竞赛，那么两个等级制度，将符号与一个明确的行动、赞成或反对的投票、赞成或反对的态度联系起来。然后，反对联盟的史密斯、反对第十条的琼斯和反对威尔逊先生及其所有作品的布朗，每个人都出于自己的理由，都以或多或少相同的象征性短语的名义，通过投票给共和党来投票反对<i class="calibre10">民主党</i>
 。共同的意愿已经表达出来了。</p><p class="normal3">When a number of people all say Yes they may have all kinds of reasons for saying it. They generally do. For the pictures in their minds are, as we have already noted, varied in subtle and intimate ways. But this subtlety remains within their minds; it becomes represented publicly by a number of symbolic phrases which carry the individual emotion after evacuating most of the intention. The hierarchy, or, if it is a contest, then the two hierarchies, associate the symbols with a definite action, a vote of Yes or No, an attitude pro or con. Then Smith who was against the League and Jones who was against Article X, and Brown who was against Mr. Wilson and all his works, each for his own reason, all in the name of more or less the same symbolic phrase, register a vote <i class="calibre10">against</i>
 the Democrats by voting for the Republicans. A common will has been expressed.</p>
<p class="normal3">必须提出一个具体的选择，必须通过符号转移利益，将选择与个人意见联系起来。职业政客早在民主哲学家之前就学会了这一点。因此，他们组织了党团会议、提名大会和指导委员会，作为制定明确选择的手段。任何希望完成需要大量人合作的事情的人都会效仿他们。有时他们做得相当残酷，比如和会缩减为十人委员会，十人委员会缩减为三巨头或四巨头；并起草一项条约，允许小盟友、他们自己的选民和敌人接受或拒绝。通常，更多的协商是可能的，也是可取的。但基本事实仍然是，少数人向一大群人提出选择。</p><p class="normal3">A concrete choice had to be presented, the choice had to be connected, by the transfer of interest through the symbols, with individual opinion. The professional politicians learned this long before the democratic philosophers. And so they organized the caucus, the nominating convention, and the steering committee, as the means of formulating a definite choice. Everyone who wishes to accomplish anything that requires the cooperation of a large number of people follows their example. Sometimes it is done rather brutally as when the Peace Conference reduced itself to the Council of Ten, and the Council of Ten to the Big Three or Four; and wrote a treaty which the minor allies, their own constituents, and the enemy were permitted to take or leave. More consultation than that is generally possible and desirable. But the essential fact remains that a small number of heads present a choice to a large group.</p>

<p class="normal3">指导委员会的滥用导致了各种提案，如倡议、全民公决和直接初选。但这些提案只是通过使选举（或者如赫伯特·乔治·威尔斯曾经一丝不苟地说过的，使选择变得复杂）而推迟或掩盖了机器的必要性。因为无论多少次投票都无法避免产生一个问题的需要，无论是一项措施还是一个候选人，选民都可以对此表示赞成或反对。事实上，没有“直接立法”这样的东西。因为在应该存在它的地方会发生什么？公民去投票站，收到一张印有多项措施的选票，几乎总是以缩写形式，如果他要说的话，他会说赞成或反对。他可能会想到世界上最精彩的修正案。他对该法案投了赞成或反对票，而不会对其他法案投赞成或反对票。你必须对英语施暴才能称之为立法。当然，我并不是说它没有好处，不管你怎么称呼这个过程。我认为，对于某些类型的问题，这样做有明显的好处。但是，鉴于决策所处的世界必然复杂，任何群众决策都必须具有必要的简单性，这是非常重要的事实。我认为，人们提出的最复杂的投票形式是优先投票制。在众多候选人中，根据该制度，选民不是对一位候选人说“是”，而对所有其他候选人说“否”，而是陈述其选择的顺序。但即使在这里，尽管它非常灵活，群众的行动也取决于所提供选择的质量。而这些选择是由精力充沛的团体提出的，他们忙着请愿并召集代表。多数人可以在少数人提名后选举。</p><p class="normal3">The abuses of the steering committee have led to various proposals such as the initiative, referendum and direct primary. But these merely postponed or obscured the need for a machine by complicating the elections, or as H. G. Wells once said with scrupulous accuracy, the selections. For no amount of balloting can obviate the need of creating an issue, be it a measure or a candidate, on which the voters can say Yes, or No. There is, in fact, no such thing as "direct legislation." For what happens where it is supposed to exist? The citizen goes to the polls, receives a ballot on which a number of measures are printed, almost always in abbreviated form, and, if he says anything at all, he says Yes or No. The most brilliant amendment in the world may occur to him. He votes Yes or No on that bill and no other. You have to commit violence against the English language to call that legislation. I do not argue, of course, that there are no benefits, whatever you call the process. I think that for certain kinds of issues there are distinct benefits. But the necessary simplicity of any mass decision is a very important fact in view of the inevitable complexity of the world in which those decisions operate. The most complicated form of voting that anyone proposes is, I suppose, the preferential ballot. Among a number of candidates presented the voter under that system, instead of saying yes to one candidate and no to all the others, states the order of his choice. But even here, immensely more flexible though it is, the action of the mass depends upon the quality of the choices presented. And those choices are presented by the energetic coteries who hustle about with petitions and round up the delegates. The Many can elect after the Few have nominated.</p>

<p class="normal3">由于象征具有超越现实的重要性，成功的领导者从来不会因为太忙而忽视培养那些用来组织其追随者的象征。象征对普通民众的作用，就如同特权在等级制度中的作用一样。它们维护了团结。从图腾柱到国旗，从木偶到看不见的上帝，从咒语到亚当·斯密或边沁的某种稀释版，象征一直受到领导者的珍视，他们中的许多人本身就是无神论者，因为它们是分歧融合的焦点。超然的观察者可能会鄙视那些限制象征的“星条旗”仪式，也许就像那位告诉自己巴黎胜过几个群众的国王一样。但领导者从经验中知道，只有当象征发挥了作用时，他才有一个可以用来调动人群的把柄。在象征中，情感被发泄在一个共同的目标上，而真正思想的特质被抹去。难怪他讨厌他所谓的破坏性批评，自由精神有时称之为消除废话。 “最重要的是，”白芝浩说，“我们的王权应该受到尊敬，如果你开始质疑它，你就无法尊敬它。”因为用明确的定义和坦率的陈述来质疑可以实现人类已知的所有崇高目的，除了容易维护共同意志。正如每一位负责任的领导人所怀疑的那样，质疑往往会破坏情感从个人思想到制度象征的转移。正如他正确地指出的那样，这样做的第一个结果就是个人主义和派别斗争的混乱。神圣俄罗斯或铁血迪亚兹等象征的瓦解总是长期动乱的开始。</p><p class="normal3">BECAUSE of their transcendent practical importance, no successful leader has ever been too busy to cultivate the symbols which organize his following. What privileges do within the hierarchy, symbols do for the rank and file. They conserve unity. From the totem pole to the national flag, from the wooden idol to God the Invisible King, from the magic word to some diluted version of Adam Smith or Bentham, symbols have been cherished by leaders, many of whom were themselves unbelievers, because they were focal points where differences merged. The detached observer may scorn the "star-spangled" ritual which hedges the symbol, perhaps as much as the king who told himself that Paris was worth a few masses. But the leader knows by experience that only when symbols have done their work is there a handle he can use to move a crowd. In the symbol emotion is discharged at a common target, and the idiosyncrasy of real ideas blotted out. No wonder he hates what he calls destructive criticism, sometimes called by free spirits the elimination of buncombe. "Above all things," says Bagehot, "our royalty is to be reverenced, and if you begin to poke about it you cannot reverence it." For poking about with clear definitions and candid statements serves all high purposes known to man, except the easy conservation of a common will. Poking about, as every responsible leader suspects, tends to break the transference of emotion from the individual mind to the institutional symbol. And the first result of that is, as he rightly says, a chaos of individualism and warring sects. The disintegration of a symbol, like Holy Russia, or the Iron Diaz, is always the beginning of a long upheaval.</p>
<p class="normal3">这些伟大的象征通过转移而拥有了一个古老而刻板的社会的所有细微而详细的忠诚。它们唤起了每个人对风景、家具、面孔、记忆的感受，这些是他最初的记忆，在一个静态的社会中，这些是他唯一的现实。民族性是形象和信仰的核心，没有它，他自己是无法想象的。伟大的象征吸收了这些信仰，并可以在不唤起原始形象的情况下唤起它们。公众辩论的次要象征，更随意的政治闲聊，总是被追溯到这些原始象征，如果可能的话，与它们联系起来。市政地铁上适当票价的问题被象征为人民和利益之间的问题，然后人民被插入到美国的象征中，因此，最终在竞选的激烈气氛中，八美分的票价变成了非美国的。革命先驱们为阻止它而牺牲了生命。林肯为了不让它发生而受苦，对它的抵抗体现在那些长眠在法国的人的死亡中。</p><p class="normal3">These great symbols possess by transference all the minute and detailed loyalties of an ancient and stereotyped society. They evoke the feeling that each individual has for the landscape, the furniture, the faces, the memories that are his first, and in a static society, his only reality. That core of images and devotions without which he is unthinkable to himself, is nationality. The great symbols take up these devotions, and can arouse them without calling forth the primitive images. The lesser symbols of public debate, the more casual chatter of politics, are always referred back to these proto-symbols, and if possible associated with them. The question of a proper fare on a municipal subway is symbolized as an issue between the People and the Interests, and then the People is inserted in the symbol American, so that finally in the heat of a campaign, an eight cent fare becomes unAmerican. The Revolutionary fathers died to prevent it. Lincoln suffered that it might not come to pass, resistance to it was implied in the death of those who sleep in France.</p>
<p class="normal3">由于符号具有将情感从不同思想中抽离出来的能力，它既是一种团结机制，也是一种剥削机制。它使人们能够为共同的目标而努力，但正因为少数处于战略地位的人必须选择具体目标，符号也是少数人用来养活多数人、转移批评和诱使人们为他们不理解的东西承受痛苦的工具。</p><p class="normal3">Because of its power to siphon emotion out of distinct ideas, the symbol is both a mechanism of solidarity, and a mechanism of exploitation. It enables people to work for a common end, but just because the few who are strategically placed must choose the concrete objectives, the symbol is also an instrument by which a few can fatten on many, deflect criticism, and seduce men into facing agony for objects they do not understand.</p>
<p class="normal3">如果我们选择把自己看作是现实的、自给自足的、自治的个体，那么我们对符号的服从的许多方面都不是令人高兴的。然而，不可能断定符号完全是魔鬼的工具。在科学和沉思的领域，它们无疑是诱惑者本身。但在行动的世界里，它们可能是有益的，有时是必需的。这种必要性往往是想象出来的，危险是人为制造出来的。但当必须迅速取得成果时，通过符号操纵群众可能是完成一件重要事情的唯一快速方法。行动往往比理解更重要。有时，如果每个人都理解了，行动就会失败，这是真的。有许多事情不能等到全民公决或经受宣传，有时，例如在战争期间，一个国家、一支军队，甚至它的指挥官都必须把战略托付给极少数人；当两种相互冲突的意见，尽管其中一种恰好是正确的，也比一种错误的意见更危险时。错误的意见可能会带来不好的后果，但两种意见混合在一起，可能会破坏团结，从而带来灾难。</p><p class="normal3">Many aspects of our subjection to symbols are not flattering if we choose to think of ourselves as realistic, self-sufficient, and self-governing personalities. Yet it is impossible to conclude that symbols are altogether instruments of the devil. In the realm of science and contemplation they are undoubtedly the tempter himself. But in the world of action they may be beneficent, and are sometimes a necessity. The necessity is often imagined, the peril manufactured. But when quick results are imperative, the manipulation of masses through symbols may be the only quick way of having a critical thing done. It is often more important to act than to understand. It is sometimes true that the action would fail if everyone understood it. There are many affairs which cannot wait for a referendum or endure publicity, and there are times, during war for example, when a nation, an army, and even its commanders must trust strategy to a very few minds; when two conflicting opinions, though one happens to be right, are more perilous than one opinion which is wrong. The wrong opinion may have bad results, but the two opinions may entail disaster by dissolving unity.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，福煦和亨利·威尔逊爵士预见到，由于后备力量分散，考夫的军队将面临灾难，但他们还是将自己的观点限制在小圈子内，因为他们知道，即使是遭遇惨败的风险，也肯定比报纸上激烈的辩论破坏性小。因为在 1918 年 3 月的紧张局势下，最重要的不是某个行动是否正确，而是对指挥权来源的持续期待。如果福煦“去人民那里”，他可能会赢得辩论，但早在他赢得辩论之前，他所指挥的军队就会解散。因为奥林匹斯山上的争吵场面既有趣又具有破坏性。</p><p class="normal3">Thus Foch and Sir Henry Wilson, who foresaw the impending disaster to Cough's army, as a consequence of the divided and scattered reserves, nevertheless kept their opinions well within a small circle, knowing that even the risk of a smashing defeat was less certainly destructive, than would have been an excited debate in the newspapers. For what matters most under the kind of tension which prevailed in March, 1918, is less the rightness of a particular move than the unbroken expectation as to the source of command. Had Foch "gone to the people" he might have won the debate, but long before he could have won it, the armies which he was to command would have dissolved. For the spectacle of a row on Olympus is diverting and destructive.</p>
<p class="normal3">但这同样也是一种沉默的阴谋。赖特上尉说：“伪装术在最高指挥部而非战线上最为盛行，而且影响最为深远。如今，无数的宣传人员忙于宣传，把各地的首领都粉饰成拿破仑，让他们远远地被误认为是拿破仑……这些拿破仑，无论他们多么无能，都几乎不可能被取代，因为他们通过隐瞒或粉饰失败，夸大或捏造成功，获得了巨大的公众支持……但这种高度组织化的虚假行为最阴险、最恶劣的影响还是在将军身上：尽管他们大多谦虚爱国，大多数人必须如此才能从事和追随崇高的军人职业，但他们自己最终还是受到了这些普遍幻想的影响，每天早上在报纸上读到这些幻想，他们也越来越相信，无论他们失败多少次，他们都是战争中的雷霆，是绝对可靠的，他们保持指挥权是一个神圣的目标，不惜一切代价……这些条件，其中最大的一个就是这个大骗局，最终使所有总参谋部摆脱了一切控制。他们不再为国家而生：国家为他们而生，或者更确切地说，为他们而死。胜利或失败不再是首要利益。对于这些半主权公司来说，重要的是亲爱的老威利或可怜的老哈里是否会成为他们的领导，或者尚蒂伊党是否会战胜荣军院大道党。”</p><p class="normal3">But so also is a conspiracy of silence. Says Captain Wright: "It is in the High Command and not in the line, that the art of camouflage is most practiced, and reaches to highest flights. All chiefs everywhere are now kept painted, by the busy work of numberless publicists, so as to be mistaken for Napoleons—at a distance….It becomes almost impossible to displace these Napoleons, whatever their incompetence, because of the enormous public support created by hiding or glossing failure, and exaggerating or inventing success…. But the most insidious and worst effect of this so highly organized falsity is on the generals themselves: modest and patriotic as they mostly are, and as most men must be to take up and follow the noble profession of arms, they themselves are ultimately affected by these universal illusions, and reading it every morning in the paper, they also grow persuaded they are thunderbolts of war and infallible, however much they fail, and that their maintenance in command is an end so sacred that it justifies the use of any means…. These various conditions, of which this great deceit is the greatest, at last emancipate all General Staffs from all control. They no longer live for the nation: the nation lives, or rather dies, for them. Victory or defeat ceases to be the prime interest. What matters to these semi-sovereign corporations is whether dear old Willie or poor old Harry is going to be at their head, or the Chantilly party prevail over the Boulevard des Invalides party."</p>
<p class="normal3">然而，赖特上尉虽然能如此雄辩和敏锐地认识到沉默的危险，却不得不同意福煦的沉默，因为他没有公开摧毁幻想。这里出现了一个复杂的悖论，我们稍后会更充分地看到，因为传统的民主生活观不是为紧急情况和危险而构想的，而是为了安宁和和谐。因此，当群众必须在不确定和爆发的环境中合作时，通常需要在没有真正同意的情况下确保团结和灵活性。符号就是这样。它掩盖了个人意图，消除了歧视，模糊了个人目的。它使个性僵化，但同时又极大地增强了群体的意图，并将该群体团结起来，这是危机中没有其他东西可以做到的，使其采取有目的的行动。它使群众变得灵活，尽管它使个性僵化。符号是一种工具，借助它，群众在短期内可以摆脱自身的惰性、犹豫不决的惰性或盲目运动的惰性，并能够在复杂局势的曲折中前行。</p><p class="normal3">Yet Captain Wright who can be so eloquent and so discerning about the dangers of silence is forced nevertheless to approve the silence of Foch in not publicly destroying the illusions. There is here a complicated paradox, arising as we shall see more fully later on, because the traditional democratic view of life is conceived, not for emergencies and dangers, but for tranquillity and harmony. And so where masses of people must cooperate in an uncertain and eruptive environment, it is usually necessary to secure unity and flexibility without real consent. The symbol does that. It obscures personal intention, neutralizes discrimination, and obfuscates individual purpose. It immobilizes personality, yet at the same time it enormously sharpens the intention of the group and welds that group, as nothing else in a crisis can weld it, to purposeful action. It renders the mass mobile though it immobilizes personality. The symbol is the instrument by which in the short run the mass escapes from its own inertia, the inertia of indecision, or the inertia of headlong movement, and is rendered capable of being led along the zigzag of a complex situation.</p>

<p class="normal3">但从长远来看，领导者和被领导者之间的相互妥协会逐渐增加。最常用来描述普通士兵对其领导者的心态的词是士气。当个人全力以赴地完成分配给他们的任务时，当每个人的全部力量都受到上级命令的鼓舞时，士气就会很好。因此，每个领导者都必须考虑到这一点来制定政策。他必须不仅根据“优点”来考虑他的决定，而且还要考虑它对他需要持续支持的追随者的影响。如果他是一位计划进攻的将军，他知道，如果伤亡率上升得太高，他组织的军事单位就会四散而逃。</p><p class="normal3">But in the longer run, the give and take increases between the leaders and the led. The word most often used to describe the state of mind in the rank and file about its leaders is morale. That is said to be good when the individuals do the part allotted to them with all their energy; when each man's whole strength is evoked by the command from above. It follows that every leader must plan his policy with this in mind. He must consider his decision not only on "the merits," but also in its effect on any part of his following whose continued support he requires. If he is a general planning an attack, he knows that his organized military units will scatter into mobs if the percentage of casualties rises too high.</p>
<p class="normal3">在第一次世界大战中，先前的计算被推翻得非常严重，因为“每九名前往法国的士兵中，就有五人伤亡”。忍耐的极限比任何人想象的都要大。但总有极限。因此，部分是因为战争对敌人的影响，但很大程度上也是因为战争对士兵及其家属的影响，这场战争中没有一个指挥部敢于公布损失的坦率声明。在法国，伤亡名单从未公布过。在英国、美国和德国，一场大战的损失公布时间要长得多，以破坏对总数的统一印象。只有内部人士直到很久以后才知道索姆河战役或佛兰德斯战役的损失；毫无疑问，鲁登道夫对这些伤亡的了解比伦敦、巴黎或芝加哥的任何私人都要准确得多。每个营地的所有领导人都尽最大努力限制任何一名士兵或平民能够生动想象的实际战争规模。但是，当然，在像 1917 年的法国军队这样的老兵中，他们对战争的了解要比公众了解的多得多。这样的军队开始根据自己的苦难来评判它的指挥官。然后，当另一个夸张的胜利承诺变成了惯常的血腥失败时，你可能会发现，一场叛乱会因为一些相对较小的失误而爆发，比如尼维尔 1917 年的进攻，因为这是一个累积的错误。革命和叛乱通常发生在一系列大罪恶中的一小部分之后。</p><p class="normal3">In the Great War previous calculations were upset to an extraordinary degree, for "out of every nine men who went to France five became casualties." The limit of endurance was far greater than anyone had supposed. But there was a limit somewhere. And so, partly because of its effect on the enemy, but also in great measure because of its effect on the troops and their families, no command in this war dared to publish a candid statement of its losses. In France the casualty lists were never published. In England, America, and Germany publication of the losses of a big battle were spread out over long periods so as to destroy a unified impression of the total. Only the insiders knew until long afterwards what the Somme had cost, or the Flanders battles; and Ludendorff undoubtedly had a very much more accurate idea of these casualties than any private person in London, Paris or Chicago. All the leaders in every camp did their best to limit the amount of actual war which any one soldier or civilian could vividly conceive. But, of course, among old veterans like the French troops of 1917, a great deal more is known about war than ever reaches the public. Such an army begins to judge its commanders in terms of its own suffering. And then, when another extravagant promise of victory turns out to be the customary bloody defeat, you may find that a mutiny breaks out over some comparatively minor blunder, like Nivelle's offensive of 1917, because it is a cumulative blunder. Revolutions and mutinies generally follow a small sample of a big series of evils.</p>
<p class="normal3">政策的实施程度决定了领导者与追随者之间的关系。如果他计划中需要的人远离行动发生地，如果结果被隐藏或推迟，如果个人义务是间接的或尚未到期，尤其是如果同意是一种令人愉快的情感表达，领导者可能会放手一搏。这些计划立即受到最广泛的欢迎，就像禁酒主义者的禁酒令一样，不会立即影响追随者的私人习惯。这就是政府在外交事务上如此放手的一个重要原因。两个国家之间的大多数摩擦都涉及一系列模糊而冗长的争论，有时发生在边境，但更常见的是发生在学校地理课程没有提供精确概念的地区。在捷克斯洛伐克，美国被视为解放者；在美国报纸的段落和音乐喜剧中，在美国人的谈话中，我们解放的国家是捷克斯拉夫还是南斯拉夫，这个问题从来没有最终确定过。</p><p class="normal3">The incidence of policy determines the relation between leader and following. If those whom he needs in his plan are remote from the place where the action takes place, if the results are hidden or postponed, if the individual obligations are indirect or not yet due, above all if assent is an exercise of some pleasurable emotion, the leader is likely to have a free hand. Those programs are immediately most popular, like prohibition among teetotalers, which do not at once impinge upon the private habits of the followers. That is one great reason why governments have such a free hand in foreign affairs. Most of the frictions between two states involve a series of obscure and long-winded contentions, occasionally on the frontier, but far more often in regions about which school geographies have supplied no precise ideas. In Czechoslovakia America is regarded as the Liberator; in American newspaper paragraphs and musical comedy, in American conversation by and large, it has never been finally settled whether the country we liberated is Czechoslavia or Jugoslovakia.</p>
<p class="normal3">在外交事务中，政策的影响范围长期局限于看不见的环境中。外界发生的一切事情都不是完全真实的。因此，由于在战前时期，没有人需要打仗，也没有人需要付出代价，政府按照自己的意愿行事，很少考虑人民。在地方事务中，政策的成本更容易看到。因此，除了最杰出的领导人外，所有领导人都倾向于尽可能间接地降低成本的政策。</p><p class="normal3">In foreign affairs the incidence of policy is for a very long time confined to an unseen environment. Nothing that happens out there is felt to be wholly real. And so, because in the ante-bellum period, nobody has to fight and nobody has to pay, governments go along according to their lights without much reference to their people. In local affairs the cost of a policy is more easily visible. And therefore, all but the most exceptional leaders prefer policies in which the costs are as far as possible indirect.</p>
<p class="normal3">他们不喜欢直接征税。他们不喜欢即付即付。他们喜欢长期债务。他们喜欢让选民相信外国人会付钱。他们总是被迫以生产者而不是消费者的角度来计算繁荣，因为消费者的负担分布在许多琐碎的物品上。工党领袖总是喜欢提高货币工资而不是降低价格。人们对百万富翁的利润的兴趣总是比对工业体系的浪费的兴趣更大，因为百万富翁的利润是可见的，但相对而言并不重要，而工业体系的浪费是巨大的，但难以捉摸。处理住房短缺问题的立法机构（如本文撰写时的情况）说明了这一规则，首先，它没有采取任何措施来增加房屋数量，其次，它严厉打击了贪婪的房东，第三，它调查了牟取暴利的建筑商和工人。因为建设性的政策处理的是遥远而无趣的因素，而贪婪的房东或牟取暴利的水管工则是可见的和直接的。</p><p class="normal3">They do not like direct taxation. They do not like to pay as they go. They like long term debts. They like to have the voters believe that the foreigner will pay. They have always been compelled to calculate prosperity in terms of the producer rather than in terms of the consumer, because the incidence on the consumer is distributed over so many trivial items. Labor leaders have always preferred an increase of money wages to a decrease in prices. There has always been more popular interest in the profits of millionaires, which are visible but comparatively unimportant, than in the wastes of the industrial system, which are huge but elusive. A legislature dealing with a shortage of houses, such as exists when this is written, illustrates this rule, first by doing nothing to increase the number of houses, second by smiting the greedy landlord on the hip, third by investigating the profiteering builders and working men. For a constructive policy deals with remote and uninteresting factors, while a greedy landlord, or a profiteering plumber is visible and immediate.</p>
<p class="normal3">但是，尽管人们很容易相信，在无法想象的未来和看不见的地方，某项政策将使他们受益，但政策的实际执行却与他们的观点不同。一个国家可能会被诱导相信提高货运费率将使铁路繁荣。但如果这些费率对农民和托运人的影响足以产生超出消费者支付能力的商品价格，那么这种信念不会使公路繁荣。消费者是否会付出代价，并不取决于他九个月前是否同意提高费率以挽救企业的提议，而是取决于他现在是否想要一顶新帽子或一辆新汽车，足以支付这些费用。</p><p class="normal3">But while people will readily believe that in an unimagined future and in unseen places a certain policy will benefit them, the actual working out of policy follows a different logic from their opinions. A nation may be induced to believe that jacking up the freight rates will make the railroads prosperous. But that belief will not make the roads prosperous, if the impact of those rates on farmers and shippers is such as to produce a commodity price beyond what the consumer can pay. Whether the consumer will pay the price depends not upon whether he nodded his head nine months previously at the proposal to raise rates and save business, but on whether he now wants a new hat or a new automobile enough to pay for them.</p>

<p class="normal3">领导者常常假装他们只是发现了公众心中存在的一个计划。当他们相信这一点时，他们通常是在自欺欺人。计划不会在众多人的头脑中同步发明出来。这并不是因为众多人的头脑必然比领导者的头脑差，而是因为思想是有机体的功能，而群众不是有机体。</p><p class="normal3">Leaders often pretend that they have merely uncovered a program which existed in the minds of their public. When they believe it, they are usually deceiving themselves. Programs do not invent themselves synchronously in a multitude of minds. That is not because a multitude of minds is necessarily inferior to that of the leaders, but because thought is the function of an organism, and a mass is not an organism.</p>
<p class="normal3">这一事实之所以被掩盖，是因为大众不断受到暗示。大众阅读的不是新闻，而是带有暗示色彩的新闻，暗示着大众要采取的行动路线。大众听到的报道并不客观，但已经定型为某种行为模式。因此，表面上的领导者经常发现，真正的领导者是一位有权有势的报纸老板。但如果像在实验室里一样，人们可以从大众的经验中去除所有的暗示和领导，我想就会发现这样的情况：受到相同刺激的大众会产生理论上可以绘制成错误多边形的反应。会有一群感觉足够相似的人被归为一类。两端都有不同的感觉。随着每个类别中的个人表达出他们的反应，这些分类往往会变得更加严格。也就是说，当那些感觉模糊的人的模糊感受被表达出来时，他们会更明确地知道自己的感受，然后会更明确地感受到它。</p><p class="normal3">This fact is obscured because the mass is constantly exposed to suggestion. It reads not the news, but the news with an aura of suggestion about it, indicating the line of action to be taken. It hears reports, not objective as the facts are, but already stereotyped to a certain pattern of behavior. Thus the ostensible leader often finds that the real leader is a powerful newspaper proprietor. But if, as in a laboratory, one could remove all suggestion and leading from the experience of a multitude, one would, I think, find something like this: A mass exposed to the same stimuli would develop responses that could theoretically be charted in a polygon of error. There would be a certain group that felt sufficiently alike to be classified together. There would be variants of feeling at both ends. These classifications would tend to harden as individuals in each of the classifications made their reactions vocal. That is to say, when the vague feelings of those who felt vaguely had been put into words, they would know more definitely what they felt, and would then feel it more definitely.</p>
<p class="normal3">了解民情的领导人很快就能意识到这些反应。他们知道高昂的价格正在压垮大众，某些阶层的人变得不受欢迎，或者对另一个国家的感情是友好还是敌视。但是，除非有暗示的影响（即记者的领导假设），否则大众的感情不会对任何特定政策的选择产生决定性的影响。大众的感情所要求的只是，制定和揭露的政策应与最初的感情联系起来，即使不是合乎逻辑的，也要通过类比和联想。</p><p class="normal3">Leaders in touch with popular feeling are quickly conscious of these reactions. They know that high prices are pressing upon the mass, or that certain classes of individuals are becoming unpopular, or that feeling towards another nation is friendly or hostile. But, always barring the effect of suggestion which is merely the assumption of leadership by the reporter, there would be nothing in the feeling of the mass that fatally determined the choice of any particular policy. All that the feeling of the mass demands is that policy as it is developed and exposed shall be, if not logically, then by analogy and association, connected with the original feeling.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，当一项新政策即将出台时，人们会先寻求一种情感上的共同体，就像马克·安东尼对布鲁图斯追随者的演讲一样。在第一阶段，领导者会表达群众的普遍意见。他有时会通过讲述一个好故事，有时会通过炫耀他的爱国主义，通常会通过发泄不满来使自己与听众熟悉的态度保持一致。发现他是值得信赖的，四处走动的群众可能会转向他。然后，人们会期望他提出一项竞选计划。但他不会在传达群众感情的口号中找到该计划。他们甚至不会总是表明这一点。在政策影响不大的地方，最重要的是，该计划一开始就应在口头和情感上与群众的声音相联系。受信任的人在熟悉的角色中认同公认的象征，他们无需解释其计划的实质，就能主动走很长一段路。</p><p class="normal3">So when a new policy is to be launched, there is a preliminary bid for community of feeling, as in Mark Antony's speech to the followers of Brutus. In the first phase, the leader vocalizes the prevalent opinion of the mass. He identifies himself with the familiar attitudes of his audience, sometimes by telling a good story, sometimes by brandishing his patriotism, often by pinching a grievance. Finding that he is trustworthy, the multitude milling hither and thither may turn in towards him. He will then be expected to set forth a plan of campaign. But he will not find that plan in the slogans which convey the feelings of the mass. It will not even always be indicated by them. Where the incidence of policy is remote, all that is essential is that the program shall be verbally and emotionally connected at the start with what has become vocal in the multitude. Trusted men in a familiar role subscribing to the accepted symbols can go a very long way on their own initiative without explaining the substance of their programs.</p>
<p class="normal3">但明智的领导者并不满足于此。只要他们认为公开不会过分加强反对派，辩论不会拖延行动太久，他们就会寻求一定程度的同意。他们充分信任下属，即使不是全体，也能让他们做好应对可能发生的事情的准备，让他们觉得他们自由地决定了结果。但无论领导者多么真诚，当事实非常复杂时，这些协商中总会存在一定程度的幻想。因为不可能所有意外事件对全体公众都像对更有经验和想象力的人一样生动。相当大比例的人必然会同意，而没有花时间或没有背景知识来理解领导者向他们提出的选择。然而，没有人可以要求更多。只有理论家可以。如果我们在法庭上得到了公正的审判，如果我们的诉求得到了重视，并且判决结果令人满意，那么我们中的大多数人都不会停下来思考我们的意见对于手头的事情有多大影响。</p><p class="normal3">But wise leaders are not content to do that. Provided they think publicity will not strengthen opposition too much, and that debate will not delay action too long, they seek a certain measure of consent. They take, if not the whole mass, then the subordinates of the hierarchy sufficiently into their confidence to prepare them for what might happen, and to make them feel that they have freely willed the result. But however sincere the leader may be, there is always, when the facts are very complicated, a certain amount of illusion in these consultations. For it is impossible that all the contingencies shall be as vivid to the whole public as they are to the more experienced and the more imaginative. A fairly large percentage are bound to agree without having taken the time, or without possessing the background, for appreciating the choices which the leader presents to them. No one, however, can ask for more. And only theorists do. If we have had our day in court, if what we had to say was heard, and then if what is done comes out well, most of us do not stop to consider how much our opinion affected the business in hand.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，如果既有权力敏感且消息灵通，如果他们明显地试图满足民意，并真正消除一些不满的原因，无论他们进展多么缓慢，只要他们被看到在进展，他们就没什么可担心的。要从下层发起一场革命，需要惊人而持续的失误，加上几乎无限的不机智。宫廷革命、部门间革命是另一回事。煽动也是如此。这只能通过表达情感来缓解紧张局势。但政治家知道，这种缓解是暂时的，如果过于频繁地放纵，是不卫生的。因此，他要确保自己不会激起任何不能融入处理情感所指事实的计划中的情感。</p><p class="normal3">And therefore, if the established powers are sensitive and well-informed, if they are visibly trying to meet popular feeling, and actually removing some of the causes of dissatisfaction, no matter how slowly they proceed, provided they are seen to be proceeding, they have little to fear. It takes stupendous and persistent blundering, plus almost infinite tactlessness, to start a revolution from below. Palace revolutions, interdepartmental revolutions, are a different matter. So, too, is demagogy. That stops at relieving the tension by expressing the feeling. But the statesman knows that such relief is temporary, and if indulged too often, unsanitary. He, therefore, sees to it that he arouses no feeling which he cannot sluice into a program that deals with the facts to which the feelings refer.</p>
<p class="normal3">但并非所有领导人都是政治家，所有领导人都讨厌辞职，而且大多数领导人都很难相信，尽管情况很糟糕，但其他人不会让情况变得更糟。他们不会被动地等待公众感受到政策的影响，因为这种发现的影响通常落在他们自己头上。因此，他们会断断续续地忙于修补关系并巩固自己的地位。</p><p class="normal3">But all leaders are not statesmen, all leaders hate to resign, and most leaders find it hard to believe that bad as things are, the other fellow would not make them worse. They do not passively wait for the public to feel the incidence of policy, because the incidence of that discovery is generally upon their own heads. They are, therefore, intermittently engaged in mending their fences and consolidating their position.</p>
<p class="normal3">修复关系包括偶尔找个替罪羊，解决影响某个有权势的个人或派别的小小不满，重新安排某些工作，安抚一群想要在家乡建立军火库或通过法律制止某人恶行的人。研究任何依赖选举的公职人员的日常活动，你就可以扩大这个名单。有些国会议员年复一年当选，他们从不考虑在公共事务上浪费精力。他们宁愿在许多小问题上为许多人做一点小贡献，也不愿在虚无缥缈中做大贡献。但是，任何组织能够成功效劳的人都是有限的，精明的政治家会小心地照顾那些有影响力的人，或者那些明显没有影响力的人，以至于关注他们是一种耸人听闻的宽宏大量的标志。而那些无法被恩惠所吸引的绝大多数人，也就是匿名的群众，则接受了宣传。</p><p class="normal3">The mending of fences consists in offering an occasional scapegoat, in redressing a minor grievance affecting a powerful individual or faction, rearranging certain jobs, placating a group of people who want an arsenal in their home town, or a law to stop somebody's vices. Study the daily activity of any public official who depends on election and you can enlarge this list. There are Congressmen elected year after year who never think of dissipating their energy on public affairs. They prefer to do a little service for a lot of people on a lot of little subjects, rather than to engage in trying to do a big service out there in the void. But the number of people to whom any organization can be a successful valet is limited, and shrewd politicians take care to attend either the influential, or somebody so blatantly uninfluential that to pay any attention to him is a mark of sensational magnanimity. The far greater number who cannot be held by favors, the anonymous multitude, receive propaganda.</p>
<p class="normal3">任何组织的既定领导者都具有巨大的天然优势。人们认为他们有更好的信息来源。书籍和文件在他们的办公室里。他们参加了重要的会议。他们会见了重要人物。他们肩负重任。因此，他们更容易引起注意，并以令人信服的语气讲话。但他们也对事实的获取有很大的控制权。每位官员在某种程度上都是审查员。由于没有人可以通过隐瞒或忘记提及来压制信息，而不知道他希望公众知道什么，所以每位领导者在某种程度上都是宣传者。官员处于战略位置，经常被迫在同样有说服力但相互冲突的理想之间做出选择，即机构的安全与对公众的坦诚，官员发现自己越来越有意识地决定他应该在什么情况下、以什么形式让公众知道哪些事实。</p><p class="normal3">The established leaders of any organization have great natural advantages. They are believed to have better sources of information. The books and papers are in their offices. They took part in the important conferences. They met the important people. They have responsibility. It is, therefore, easier for them to secure attention and to speak in a convincing tone. But also they have a very great deal of control over the access to the facts. Every official is in some degree a censor. And since no one can suppress information, either by concealing it or forgetting to mention it, without some notion of what he wishes the public to know, every leader is in some degree a propagandist. Strategically placed, and compelled often to choose even at the best between the equally cogent though conflicting ideals of safety for the institution, and candor to his public, the official finds himself deciding more and more consciously what facts, in what setting, in what guise he shall permit the public to know.</p>

<p class="normal3">我认为，没有人否认，制造同意的过程可以非常精细。公众舆论的产生过程当然并不比本文所展示的要简单，任何了解这一过程的人都可以利用这一机会进行操纵。</p><p class="normal3">That the manufacture of consent is capable of great refinements no one, I think, denies. The process by which public opinions arise is certainly no less intricate than it has appeared in these pages, and the opportunities for manipulation open to anyone who understands the process are plain enough.</p>
<p class="normal3">创造同意并不是一门新艺术。它是一门非常古老的艺术，人们认为它应该随着民主的出现而消亡。但它并没有消亡。事实上，它在技术上已经得到了极大的改进，因为它现在是基于分析而不是经验法则。因此，由于心理学研究的结果，再加上现代通讯手段，民主的实践已经发生了转折。一场革命正在发生，其意义远比任何经济权力的转移都重大得多。</p><p class="normal3">The creation of consent is not a new art. It is a very old one which was supposed to have died out with the appearance of democracy. But it has not died out. It has, in fact, improved enormously in technic, because it is now based on analysis rather than on rule of thumb. And so, as a result of psychological research, coupled with the modern means of communication, the practice of democracy has turned a corner. A revolution is taking place, infinitely more significant than any shifting of economic power.</p>
<p class="normal3">在如今掌控事务的这一代人的生活里，说服已经成为一种自觉的艺术和民众政府的常规手段。我们中没有人开始理解其后果，但说如何获得认同的知识将改变每一项政治算计并修改每一项政治前提，这并不是大胆的预言。在宣传的影响下，不一定只是这个词的险恶含义，我们思维中的旧常数已成为变量。例如，我们不再可能相信民主的原始教条；管理人类事务所需的知识自发地来自人类的内心。如果我们按照这一理论行事，我们就会暴露于自欺欺人，以及我们无法证实的说服形式。事实证明，如果我们要处理超出我们能力范围的世界，我们就不能依靠直觉、良心或偶然的意见。</p><p class="normal3">Within the life of the generation now in control of affairs, persuasion has become a self-conscious art and a regular organ of popular government. None of us begins to understand the consequences, but it is no daring prophecy to say that the knowledge of how to create consent will alter every political calculation and modify every political premise. Under the impact of propaganda, not necessarily in the sinister meaning of the word alone, the old constants of our thinking have become variables. It is no longer possible, for example, to believe in the original dogma of democracy; that the knowledge needed for the management of human affairs comes up spontaneously from the human heart. Where we act on that theory we expose ourselves to self-deception, and to forms of persuasion that we cannot verify. It has been demonstrated that we cannot rely upon intuition, conscience, or the accidents of casual opinion if we are to deal with the world beyond our reach.</p>

<p class="normal3">既然舆论被认为是民主国家的原动力，人们可以合理地期望找到大量的文献。但事实并非如此。关于政府和政党的优秀书籍有很多，也就是说，关于在公众舆论形成后，理论上记录公众舆论的机制。但关于这些舆论产生的来源，以及它们产生的过程，则相对较少。舆论这一力量的存在主要是理所当然的，美国政治作家最感兴趣的要么是如何让政府表达共同意志，要么是如何防止共同意志破坏他们认为政府存在的目的。根据他们的传统，他们希望要么驯服舆论，要么服从舆论。因此，一系列著名教科书的编辑写道：“政府最困难和最重要的问题是如何将个人意见的力量转化为公共行动。”</p><p class="normal3">SINCE Public Opinion is supposed to be the prime mover in democracies, one might reasonably expect to find a vast literature. One does not find it. There are excellent books on government and parties, that is, on the machinery which in theory registers public opinions after they are formed. But on the sources from which these public opinions arise, on the processes by which they are derived, there is relatively little. The existence of a force called Public Opinion is in the main taken for granted, and American political writers have been most interested either in finding out how to make government express the common will, or in how to prevent the common will from subverting the purposes for which they believe the government exists. According to their traditions they have wished either to tame opinion or to obey it. Thus the editor of a notable series of text-books writes that "the most difficult and the most momentous question of government (is) how to transmit the force of individual opinion into public action."</p>
<p class="normal3">但肯定还有一个更重要的问题，即如何验证我们对政治场景的私人看法。正如我将在下文中试图指出的那样，通过发展已经实施的原则，我们有望实现根本性的改善。但这种发展将取决于我们如何学会利用意见形成方式的知识来监督我们自己正在形成的意见。因为随意的意见是部分接触、传统和个人利益的产物，本质上不可能接受基于精确记录、测量、分析和比较的政治思想方法。正是那些决定什么看起来有趣、重要、熟悉、个人和戏剧性的思想品质，正是现实主义意见首先会挫败的品质。因此，除非整个社会越来越相信偏见和直觉是不够的，否则，形成现实主义意见将得不到足够的支持，因为这需要时间、金钱、劳动、有意识的努力、耐心和平静。这种信念随着自我批评的增加而增长，使我们意识到自己的胡言乱语，在使用它时鄙视自己，并警惕地发现它。如果我们在阅读、交谈和做决定时没有养成分析意见的根深蒂固的习惯，我们大多数人几乎不会怀疑需要更好的想法，也不会在它们出现时对它们感兴趣，也无法阻止政治情报的新技术被操纵。</p><p class="normal3">But surely there is a still more momentous question, the question of how to validate our private versions of the political scene. There is, as I shall try to indicate further on, the prospect of radical improvement by the development of principles already in operation. But this development will depend on how well we learn to use knowledge of the way opinions are put together to watch over our own opinions when they are being put together. For casual opinion, being the product of partial contact, of tradition, and personal interests, cannot in the nature of things take kindly to a method of political thought which is based on exact record, measurement, analysis and comparison. Just those qualities of the mind which determine what shall seem interesting, important, familiar, personal, and dramatic, are the qualities which in the first instance realistic opinion frustrates. Therefore, unless there is in the community at large a growing conviction that prejudice and intuition are not enough, the working out of realistic opinion, which takes time, money, labor, conscious effort, patience, and equanimity, will not find enough support. That conviction grows as self-criticism increases, and makes us conscious of buncombe, contemptuous of ourselves when we employ it, and on guard to detect it. Without an ingrained habit of analyzing opinion when we read, talk, and decide, most of us would hardly suspect the need of better ideas, nor be interested in them when they appear, nor be able to prevent the new technic of political intelligence from being manipulated.</p>
<p class="normal3">然而，如果我们以最古老和最强大的民主国家来判断，民主国家已经把舆论变成了一个谜。有一些熟练的舆论组织者，他们非常了解这个谜，能够在选举日赢得多数票。但政治学界认为这些组织者是下等人或“麻烦”，而不是最有效的如何创造和操纵舆论的知识的拥有者。那些表达民主思想的人，即使他们没有管理民主的行动，也倾向于将舆论视为其他社会中的人看待神秘力量的方式，他们认为这些力量决定着事件的方向。</p><p class="normal3">Yet democracies, if we are to judge by the oldest and most powerful of them, have made a mystery out of public opinion. There have been skilled organizers of opinion who understood the mystery well enough to create majorities on election day. But these organizers have been regarded by political science as low fellows or as "problems," not as possessors of the most effective knowledge there was on how to create and operate public opinion. The tendency of the people who have voiced the ideas of democracy, even when they have not managed its action, the tendency of students, orators, editors, has been to look upon Public Opinion as men in other societies looked upon the uncanny forces to which they ascribed the last word in the direction of events.</p>
<p class="normal3">因为几乎每一种政治理论中都存在着一种难以捉摸的因素，而在这种理论的鼎盛时期，这种因素是未经检验的。在表象的背后，存在着命运、守护神、天选之人的天命、神圣的君主制、天国的代理摄政王或出身优越的阶级。民主思想中不再有明显的天使、魔鬼和国王，但人们仍然需要相信存在着后备的指导力量。对于设计民主母体的十八世纪思想家来说，这种信念依然存在。他们有一个苍白的神，但却有一颗温暖的心，他们在人民主权的学说中找到了对新社会秩序的绝对起源的需要的答案。这是一个秘密，只有人民的敌人才会用亵渎和好奇的手去触碰它。</p><p class="normal3">For in almost every political theory there is an inscrutable element which in the heyday of that theory goes unexamined. Behind the appearances there is a Fate, there are Guardian Spirits, or Mandates to a Chosen People, a Divine Monarchy, a Vice-Regent of Heaven, or a Class of the Better Born. The more obvious angels, demons, and kings are gone out of democratic thinking, but the need for believing that there are reserve powers of guidance persists. It persisted for those thinkers of the Eighteenth Century who designed the matrix of democracy. They had a pale god, but warm hearts, and in the doctrine of popular sovereignty they found the answer to their need of an infallible origin for the new social order. There was the mystery, and only enemies of the people touched it with profane and curious hands.</p>

<p class="normal3">他们没有揭开面纱，因为他们是身处一场激烈而不确定的斗争中的务实政治家。他们自己感受到了民主的渴望，这种渴望比任何政府理论都更加深刻、更加亲密、更加重要。他们打破了时代的偏见，致力于维护人类尊严。他们所关注的不是约翰·史密斯是否对任何公共问题都有正确的看法，而是约翰·史密斯，一个一直被认为低人一等的家族的后代，现在不会向任何人屈膝。正是这种景象让“在那个黎明活着”成为一种幸福。但每一位分析家似乎都在贬低这种尊严，否认所有人在任何时候都是理性的、受过教育的或见多识广的，指出人们被愚弄了，他们并不总是知道自己的利益，并不是所有人都适合治理国家。</p><p class="normal3">They did not remove the veil because they were practical politicians in a bitter and uncertain struggle. They had themselves felt the aspiration of democracy, which is ever so much deeper, more intimate and more important than any theory of government. They were engaged, as against the prejudice of ages, in the assertion of human dignity. What possessed them was not whether John Smith had sound views on any public question, but that John Smith, scion of a stock that had always been considered inferior, would now bend his knee to no other man. It was this spectacle that made it bliss "in that dawn to be alive." But every analyst seems to degrade that dignity, to deny that all men are reasonable all the time, or educated, or informed, to note that people are fooled, that they do not always know their own interests, and that all men are not equally fitted to govern.</p>
<p class="normal3">批评家们就像一个拿着鼓的小男孩一样不受欢迎。这些关于人性易犯错误的观察都被反复利用。如果民主派承认贵族的任何论点都是正确的，他们就会打开防御的缺口。因此，正如亚里士多德必须坚持奴隶天生就是奴隶一样，民主派必须坚持自由人天生就是立法者和管理者。他们无法停下来解释，人类灵魂可能还没有，甚至可能永远不会有这种技术装备，但它有不可剥夺的权利，不被别人当作不情愿的工具。上等人仍然太强大、太无耻，无法克制自己不利用如此坦率的言论。</p><p class="normal3">The critics were about as welcome as a small boy with a drum. Every one of these observations on the fallibility of man was being exploited ad nauseam. Had democrats admitted there was truth in any of the aristocratic arguments they would have opened a breach in the defenses. And so just as Aristotle had to insist that the slave was a slave by nature, the democrats had to insist that the free man was a legislator and administrator by nature. They could not stop to explain that a human soul might not yet have, or indeed might never have, this technical equipment, and that nevertheless it had an inalienable right not to be used as the unwilling instrument of other men. The superior people were still too strong and too unscrupulous to have refrained from capitalizing so candid a statement.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，早期的民主主义者坚持认为，理性的正义会自发地从人群中涌现出来。所有人都希望如此，许多人也相信确实如此，尽管最聪明的人，如托马斯·杰斐逊，私下里对此持各种保留态度。但有一件事是肯定的：如果公众舆论不是自发产生的，那么那个时代没有人相信它会产生。因为从根本上讲，民主所基于的政治科学与亚里士多德所创立的政治科学是同一门科学。对于民主党人和贵族、保皇党人和共和党人来说，这门科学是同一门科学，因为它的主要前提是认为治理艺术是一种天赋。当人们试图说出具有这种天赋的人时，他们的观点截然不同；但他们一致认为，最大的问题是找到那些天生具有政治智慧的人。保皇党人确信国王天生就是统治者。亚历山大·汉密尔顿认为，虽然“各行各业都有坚强的思想……但代表机构将由土地所有者、商人和博学专业人士组成，除了极少数例外，他们对政府的精神没有任何影响。”杰斐逊认为，政治才能是上帝赋予农民和种植园主的，有时甚至说所有人都有这种才能。主要前提是一样的：统治是一种本能，根据你的社会偏好，它出现在一个人或少数几个人身上，出现在所有男性身上，或者只出现在白人和 21 岁的男性身上，甚至可能出现在所有男人和所有女人身上。</p><p class="normal3">So the early democrats insisted that a reasoned righteousness welled up spontaneously out of the mass of men. All of them hoped that it would, many of them believed that it did, although the cleverest, like Thomas Jefferson, had all sorts of private reservations. But one thing was certain: if public opinion did not come forth spontaneously, nobody in that age believed it would come forth at all. For in one fundamental respect the political science on which democracy was based was the same science that Aristotle formulated. It was the same science for democrat and aristocrat, royalist and republican, in that its major premise assumed the art of government to be a natural endowment. Men differed radically when they tried to name the men so endowed; but they agreed in thinking that the greatest question of all was to find those in whom political wisdom was innate. Royalists were sure that kings were born to govern. Alexander Hamilton thought that while "there are strong minds in every walk of life… the representative body, with too few exceptions to have any influence on the spirit of the government, will be composed of landholders, merchants, and men of the learned professions." Jefferson thought the political faculties were deposited by God in farmers and planters, and sometimes spoke as if they were found in all the people. The main premise was the same: to govern was an instinct that appeared, according to your social preferences, in one man or a chosen few, in all males, or only in males who were white and twenty-one, perhaps even in all men and all women.</p>
<p class="normal3">在决定谁最适合执政时，对世界的了解被视为理所当然。贵族认为那些处理大事的人拥有这种本能，而民主人士则认为所有人都拥有这种本能，因此可以处理大事。无论哪种情况，政治学都不需要思考如何将世界知识带给统治者。如果你支持人民，你就不会试图解决如何让选民了解情况的问题。到 21 岁时，他就具备了政治才能。重要的是一颗善良的心、一个理性的头脑和一个平衡的判断力。这些会随着年龄的增长而成熟，但没有必要考虑如何充实心灵和养成理性。人们吸收事实就像他们呼吸一样。</p><p class="normal3">In deciding who was most fit to govern, knowledge of the world was taken for granted. The aristocrat believed that those who dealt with large affairs possessed the instinct, the democrats asserted that all men possessed the instinct and could therefore deal with large affairs. It was no part of political science in either case to think out how knowledge of the world could be brought to the ruler. If you were for the people you did not try to work out the question of how to keep the voter informed. By the age of twenty-one he had his political faculties. What counted was a good heart, a reasoning mind, a balanced judgment. These would ripen with age, but it was not necessary to consider how to inform the heart and feed the reason. Men took in their facts as they took in their breath.</p>

</p>
<p class="normal3">但是，人们通过这种毫不费力的方式所能掌握的事实是有限的。他们可以了解他们生活和工作的地方的风俗习惯和更明显的性格。但他们必须设想外部世界，而他们不是本能地设想它，也不是通过生活就吸​​收可靠的知识。因此，唯一可能自发政治的环境是统治者直接和确定的知识范围内的环境。无论你在哪里发现政府是建立在人们自然能力范围内的，都无法逃避这一结论。亚里士多德说：“如果一个国家的公民要根据功绩来判断和分配职位，那么他们必须了解彼此的性格；如果他们不具备这种知识，那么无论是选举职位还是诉讼判决都会出错。”</p><p class="normal3">But the facts men could come to possess in this effortless way were limited. They could know the customs and more obvious character of the place where they lived and worked. But the outer world they had to conceive, and they did not conceive it instinctively, nor absorb trustworthy knowledge of it just by living. Therefore, the only environment in which spontaneous politics were possible was one confined within the range of the ruler's direct and certain knowledge. There is no escaping this conclusion, wherever you found government on the natural range of men's faculties. "If," as Aristotle said, "the citizens of a state are to judge and distribute offices according to merit, then they must know each other's characters; where they do not possess this knowledge, both the election to offices and the decision of law suits will go wrong."</p>
<p class="normal3">显然，这一准则对每个政治思想流派都具有约束力。但它给民主派带来了特殊的困难。那些相信阶级政府的人可以公平地声称，在国王的宫廷里，或在绅士的乡间别墅里，人们确实了解彼此的性格，只要其他人处于被动地位，人们唯一需要了解的就是统治阶级的性格。但民主派想要提高所有人的尊严，他们立即被统治阶级——男性选民——的庞大规模和混乱所困扰。他们的科学告诉他们，政治是一种本能，这种本能在一个有限的环境中发挥作用。他们的希望让他们坚持认为，在一个非常大的环境中，所有人都可以执政。在他们的理想和科学之间的这种致命冲突中，唯一的出路就是不加多言地假设人民的声音就是上帝的声音。</p><p class="normal3">Obviously this maxim was binding upon every school of political thought. But it presented peculiar difficulties to the democrats. Those who believed in class government could fairly claim that in the court of the king, or in the country houses of the gentry, men did know each other's characters, and as long as the rest of mankind was passive, the only characters one needed to know were the characters of men in the ruling class. But the democrats, who wanted to raise the dignity of all men, were immediately involved by the immense size and confusion of their ruling class—the male electorate. Their science told them that politics was an instinct, and that the instinct worked in a limited environment. Their hopes bade them insist that all men in a very large environment could govern. In this deadly conflict between their ideals and their science, the only way out was to assume without much discussion that the voice of the people was the voice of God.</p>
<p class="normal3">悖论太大，赌注太大，他们的理想太珍贵，无法进行批判性研究。他们无法说明波士顿市民如何留在波士顿并理解弗吉尼亚人的观点，弗吉尼亚人在弗吉尼亚如何对华盛顿政府有真正的看法，华盛顿的国会议员如何对中国或墨西哥有看法。因为在那个时代，许多人不可能将看不见的环境纳入他们的判断范围。自亚里士多德以来，确实有一些进步。有几份报纸，有书籍，也许有更好的道路和更好的船只。但没有取得重大进展，十八世纪的政治假设基本上是两千年来在政治学中盛行的假设。先驱民主主义者没有解决人类已知注意力范围与他们对人类尊严的无限信念之间冲突的材料。</p><p class="normal3">The paradox was too great, the stakes too big, their ideal too precious for critical examination. They could not show how a citizen of Boston was to stay in Boston and conceive the views of a Virginian, how a Virginian in Virginia could have real opinions about the government at Washington, how Congressmen in Washington could have opinions about China or Mexico. For in that day it was not possible for many men to have an unseen environment brought into the field of their judgment. There had been some advances, to be sure, since Aristotle. There were a few newspapers, and there were books, better roads perhaps, and better ships. But there was no great advance, and the political assumptions of the Eighteenth Century had essentially to be those that had prevailed in political science for two thousand years. The pioneer democrats did not possess the material for resolving the conflict between the known range of man's attention and their illimitable faith in his dignity.</p>
<p class="normal3">他们的假设不仅早于现代报纸、全球新闻服务、摄影和电影，而且，更重要的是，它们早于测量和记录、定量和比较分析、证据准则以及心理分析纠正和消除证人偏见的能力。我并不是说我们的记录令人满意，我们的分析没有偏见，我们的测量合理。我的意思是说，我们已经做出了关键的发明，将看不见的世界带入了判断领域。这些发明在亚里士多德时代还没有被发明，在卢梭、孟德斯鸠或托马斯·杰斐逊时代，它们还不够重要，不足以被政治理论所看到。在后面的章节中，我想我们会看到，即使在最新的人类重建理论中，即英国行会社会主义者的理论中，所有更深层次的前提都是从这个较旧的政治思想体系中吸收的。</p><p class="normal3">Their assumptions antedated not only the modern newspaper, the world-wide press services, photography and moving pictures, but, what is really more significant, they antedated measurement and record, quantitative and comparative analysis, the canons of evidence, and the ability of psychological analysis to correct and discount the prejudices of the witness. I do not mean to say that our records are satisfactory, our analysis unbiased, our measurements sound. I do mean to say that the key inventions have been made for bringing the unseen world into the field of judgment. They had not been made in the time of Aristotle, and they were not yet important enough to be visible for political theory in the age of Rousseau, Montesquieu, or Thomas Jefferson. In a later chapter I think we shall see that even in the latest theory of human reconstruction, that of the English Guild Socialists, all the deeper premises have been taken over from this older system of political thought.</p>
<p class="normal3">该系统在有能力和诚实的时候，必须假设没有人能够对公共事务有超过非常部分的经验。从他只能花很少的时间在公共事务上这一点来说，这个假设仍然是正确的，而且具有最重要的意义。但是，古代理论被迫假设，人们不仅很少关注公共问题，而且可用的注意力必须局限于眼前的事情。如果认为将来有一天遥远而复杂的事件可以以这样一种形式被报道、分析和呈现，以至于一个业余爱好者可以做出真正有价值的选择，那将是一种幻想。现在，这个时刻已经近在眼前。毫无疑问，对看不见的环境进行持续报道是可行的。它经常做得不好，但事实上它确实做到了，而我们开始知道它经常做得有多差，这一事实表明它可以做得更好。工程师和会计师每天都以不同程度的技巧和诚实向商人、秘书和公务员向官员、情报人员向总参谋部、一些记者向一些读者报道遥远的复杂情况。这些都是粗略的开端，但却是激进的，从字面意义上讲，比战争、革命、退位和复辟的重复更为激进；就像人类生活规模的变化一样激进，这使得劳合·乔治先生可以在伦敦吃完早餐后讨论威尔士的煤矿开采，在巴黎吃完晚餐前讨论阿拉伯人的命运。</p><p class="normal3">That system, whenever it was competent and honest, had to assume that no man could have more than a very partial experience of public affairs. In the sense that he can give only a little time to them, that assumption is still true, and of the utmost consequence. But ancient theory was compelled to assume, not only that men could give little attention to public questions, but that the attention available would have to be confined to matters close at hand. It would have been visionary to suppose that a time would come when distant and complicated events could conceivably be reported, analyzed, and presented in such a form that a really valuable choice could be made by an amateur. That time is now in sight. There is no longer any doubt that the continuous reporting of an unseen environment is feasible. It is often done badly, but the fact that it is done at all shows that it can be done, and the fact that we begin to know how badly it is often done, shows that it can be done better. With varying degrees of skill and honesty distant complexities are reported every day by engineers and accountants for business men, by secretaries and civil servants for officials, by intelligence officers for the General Staff, by some journalists for some readers. These are crude beginnings but radical, far more radical in the literal meaning of that word than the repetition of wars, revolutions, abdications and restorations; as radical as the change in the scale of human life which has made it possible for Mr. Lloyd George to discuss Welsh coal mining after breakfast in London, and the fate of the Arabs before dinner in Paris.</p>
<p class="normal3">因为将人类事务的任何方面纳入判断范围的可能性打破了政治思想的魔咒。当然，有许多人没有意识到关注范围是政治科学的主要前提。他们在沙地上建造。他们亲身展示了对世界非常有限和以自我为中心的知识的影响。但对于从柏拉图和亚里士多德到马基雅维利和霍布斯再到民主理论家的政治思想家来说，推测都是围绕着以自我为中心的人展开的，他们必须通过头脑中的几幅图画来看待整个世界。</p><p class="normal3">For the possibility of bringing any aspect of human affairs within the range of judgment breaks the spell which has lain upon political ideas. There have, of course, been plenty of men who did not realize that the range of attention was the main premise of political science. They have built on sand. They have demonstrated in their own persons the effects of a very limited and self-centered knowledge of the world. But for the political thinkers who have counted, from Plato and Aristotle through Machiavelli and Hobbes to the democratic theorists, speculation has revolved around the self-centered man who had to see the whole world by means of a few pictures in his head.</p>

<p class="normal3">以自我为中心的群体如果相互冲突，就会陷入生存斗争，这一点一直都是显而易见的。无论如何，霍布斯在《利维坦》中那段著名文字中都说得非常正确：“虽然从来没有哪个时代，某些人会处于相互交战的状态，但国王和<i class="calibre10">主权者由于独立自主</i>
 ，总是处于不断的嫉妒之中，处于角斗士的状态和姿态，武器指向对方，目光相互注视……”</p><p class="normal3">THAT groups of self-centered people would engage in a struggle for existence if they rubbed against each other has always been evident.

 , are in continual jealousies and in the state and posture of gladiators, having their weapons pointing, and their eyes fixed on one another…"</p>

</p>
<p class="normal3">为了避免这一结论，人类思想的一个主要分支（过去和现在都有许多学派）是这样进行的：它构想了一种理想的公正的人类关系模式，在这种模式中，每个人都有明确界定的职能和权利。如果他认真履行分配给他的角色，他的意见是对是错都无关紧要。他尽职尽责，其他人也尽职尽责，所有尽职尽责的人共同创造了一个和谐的世界。每一个种姓制度都体现了这一原则；你可以在柏拉图的《理想国》和亚里士多德的《理想国》中、在封建理想中、在但丁的《天堂》的圈子中、在官僚社会主义类型中、在自由放任主义中，在工团主义、行会社会主义、无政府主义和罗伯特·兰辛先生理想化的国际法体系中发现它。所有这些都假设一种预先建立的和谐，无论是受启发的、强加的还是天生的，通过这种和谐，有主见的人、阶级或社区与人类其他人协调一致。更权威的人会想象交响乐中会有一位指挥，负责确保每个人都扮演好自己的角色；而无政府主义者则倾向于认为，如果每个演奏者在演奏过程中进行即兴发挥，就会听到更神圣的和声。</p><p class="normal3">To circumvent this conclusion one great branch of human thought, which had and has many schools, proceeded in this fashion: it conceived an ideally just pattern of human relations in which each person had well defined functions and rights. If he conscientiously filled the role allotted to him, it did not matter whether his opinions were right or wrong. He did his duty, the next man did his, and all the dutiful people together made a harmonious world. Every caste system illustrates this principle; you find it in Plato's Republic and in Aristotle, in the feudal ideal, in the circles of Dante's Paradise, in the bureaucratic type of socialism, and in laissez-faire, to an amazing degree in syndicalism, guild socialism, anarchism, and in the system of international law idealized by Mr. Robert Lansing. All of them assume a pre-established harmony, inspired, imposed, or innate, by which the self-opinionated person, class, or community is orchestrated with the rest of mankind. The more authoritarian imagine a conductor for the symphony who sees to it that each man plays his part; the anarchistic are inclined to think that a more divine concord would be heard if each player improvised as he went along.</p>
<p class="normal3">但是也有一些哲学家对这些权利和义务的体系感到厌倦，认为冲突是理所当然的，并试图看看他们一方如何能取得胜利。他们总是显得更现实，即使他们似乎令人担忧，因为他们所要做的就是概括没有人能够逃脱的经验。马基雅维利是这个学派的经典人物，他被最无情地诽谤，因为他恰好是第一个使用通俗易懂的语言来研究超自然主义者所占据的领域的自然主义者。他比任何政治思想家都更臭名昭著，但追随者却更多。他真实地描述了自给自足国家存在的技术。这就是他拥有追随者的原因。他之所以名声不好，主要是因为他对美第奇家族不屑一顾，晚上在书房里穿着“高贵的宫廷礼服”梦见马基雅维利自己就是王子，并把对做事方式的辛辣描述变成了对做事方式的赞美。</p><p class="normal3">But there have also been philosophers who were bored by these schemes of rights and duties, took conflict for granted, and tried to see how their side might come out on top. They have always seemed more realistic, even when they seemed alarming, because all they had to do was to generalize the experience that nobody could escape. Machiavelli is the classic of this school, a man most mercilessly maligned, because he happened to be the first naturalist who used plain language in a field hitherto preempted by supernaturalists. He has a worse name and more disciples than any political thinker who ever lived. He truly described the technic of existence for the self-contained state. That is why he has the disciples. He has the bad name chiefly because he cocked his eye at the Medici family, dreamed in his study at night where he wore his "noble court dress" that Machiavelli was himself the Prince, and turned a pungent description of the way things are done into an eulogy on that way of doing them.</p>
<p class="normal3">在他最臭名昭著的篇章中，他写道：“君主应该注意，他的言行必须具备上述五种品质，这样，他才能在听到和看到他的人面前表现出仁慈、忠诚、仁慈、正直和虔诚。没有什么比表现出最后一种品质更重要了，因为人们通常用眼睛而不是用手来判断，因为每个人都能看到你，但只有少数人能接触到你。每个人都能看到你外表的样子，很少有人真正了解你，而那些少数人不敢反对大多数人的意见，因为大多数人有国家威严来捍卫他们；在所有人的行为中，尤其是君主的行为，如果挑战是不明智的，人们会根据结果来判断……。现在有一位君主，名字不好，他只宣扬和平与诚信，他对两者都怀有敌意，如果他坚持这一点，就会多次剥夺他的名誉和王国。”</p><p class="normal3">In his most infamous chapter he wrote that "a prince ought to take care that he never lets anything slip from his lips that is not replete with the above-named five qualities, that he may appear to him who hears and sees him altogether merciful, faithful, humane, upright, and religious. There is nothing more necessary to appear to have than this last quality, inasmuch as men judge generally more by the eye than by the hand, because it belongs to everybody to see you, to few to come in touch with you. Everyone sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are, and those few dare not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many, who have the majesty of the state to defend them; and in the actions of all men, and especially of princes, which it is not prudent to challenge, one judges by the result…. One prince of the present time, whom it is not well to name, never preaches anything else but peace and good faith, and to both he is most hostile, and either, if he had kept it, would have deprived him of reputation and kingdom many a time."</p>
<p class="normal3">那是玩世不恭。但那是一个真正看到却不知道为什么看到的人的玩世不恭。马基雅维利想到的是那些“通常用眼睛而不是用手来判断”的人和君王，他用这种方式来表达他们的判断是主观的。他太脚踏实地了，无法假装他那个时代的意大利人能稳定地、全面地看待世界。他不会沉溺于幻想，他也没有材料来想象一个学会如何纠正自己视力的种族。</p><p class="normal3">That is cynical. But it is the cynicism of a man who saw truly without knowing quite why he saw what he saw. Machiavelli is thinking of the run of men and princes "who judge generally more by the eye than by the hand," which is his way of saying that their judgments are subjective. He was too close to earth to pretend that the Italians of his day saw the world steadily and saw it whole. He would not indulge in fantasies, and he had not the materials for imagining a race of men that had learned how to correct their vision.</p>
<p class="normal3">马基雅维利发现，这个世界是由那些几乎无法纠正自己观点的人组成的，而这些人由于以私人的方式看待所有公共关系，因此陷入了永久的纷争。他们看到的是他们自己对事务的个人、阶级、王朝或市政版本的解读，而这些事务实际上远远超出了他们视野的界限。他们看到了自己的一面。他们认为这是正确的。但他们却与同样以自我为中心的其他人发生冲突。这样，他们的生存就受到了威胁，或者至少他们出于意想不到的私人原因，认为他们的生存是一种危险。目的固然建立在真实但私人的经历之上，但却可以证明手段的正当性。他们会牺牲其中任何一个理想来拯救所有理想……“人们以结果来判断……”</p><p class="normal3">The world, as he found it, was composed of people whose vision could rarely be corrected, and Machiavelli knew that such people, since they see all public relations in a private way, are involved in perpetual strife. What they see is their own personal, class, dynastic, or municipal version of affairs that in reality extend far beyond the boundaries of their vision. They see their aspect. They see it as right. But they cross other people who are similarly self-centered. Then their very existence is endangered, or at least what they, for unsuspected private reasons, regard as their existence and take to be a danger. The end, which is impregnably based on a real though private experience justifies the means. They will sacrifice any one of these ideals to save all of them,… "one judges by the result…"</p>

<p class="normal3">这些基本事实摆在民主哲学家面前。他们有意无意地知道，政治知识的范围是有限的，自治的范围也必须是有限的，而自给自足的国家在相互摩擦时就像角斗士一样。但他们同样清楚地知道，人们有意愿决定自己的命运，寻求一种不被武力强加的和平。他们如何才能调和这种愿望和事实呢？</p><p class="normal3">These elemental truths confronted the democratic philosophers. Consciously or otherwise, they knew that the range of political knowledge was limited, that the area of self-government would have to be limited, and that self-contained states when they rubbed against each other were in the posture of gladiators. But they knew just as certainly, that there was in men a will to decide their own fate, and to find a peace that was not imposed by force. How could they reconcile the wish and the fact?</p>
<p class="normal3">他们环顾四周。在希腊和意​​大利的城邦，他们发现了腐败、阴谋和战争的记录。在他们自己的城市，他们看到了派系斗争、虚伪和狂热。这不是民主理想能够繁荣的环境，也不是一群独立且同样有能力的人自发管理自己事务的地方。他们进一步观察，也许是受让·雅克·卢梭的启发，来到遥远而未受破坏的乡村。他们看到的东西足以让他们相信，那里就是理想家园。杰斐逊尤其感受到了这一点，杰斐逊比任何人都更能塑造美国的民主形象。正是从乡镇中产生了推动美国革命取得胜利的力量。正是从乡镇中产生了让杰斐逊的政党获得权力的选票。在马萨诸塞州和弗吉尼亚州的农业社区，如果你戴上可以消除奴隶制的眼镜，你就能用心灵之眼看到民主的形象。</p><p class="normal3">They looked about them. In the city states of Greece and Italy they found a chronicle of corruption, intrigue and war. In their own cities they saw faction, artificiality, fever. This was no environment in which the democratic ideal could prosper, no place where a group of independent and equally competent people managed their own affairs spontaneously. They looked further, guided somewhat perhaps by Jean Jacques Rousseau, to remote, unspoiled country villages. They saw enough to convince themselves that there the ideal was at home. Jefferson in particular felt this, and Jefferson more than any other man formulated the American image of democracy. From the townships had come the power that had carried the American Revolution to victory. From the townships were to come the votes that carried Jefferson's party to power. Out there in the farming communities of Massachusetts and Virginia, if you wore glasses that obliterated the slaves, you could see with your mind's eye the image of what democracy was to be.</p>
<p class="normal3">托克维尔说：“美国革命爆发了，人民主权的理论在乡镇中得到培育，并在整个州内盛行。”它当然占据了那些制定和推广民主刻板观念的人的思想。杰斐逊写道：“珍视人民是我们的原则。”但他所珍视的几乎都是小土地所有者：“那些在土地上劳作的人是上帝的选民，如果他真的有选民的话，上帝在他们心中寄托了实质性和真正的美德。正是在这种焦点上，上帝保持了神圣之火的活力，否则它可能会从地球上消失。广大农民的道德败坏是一种现象，任何时代或国家都没有提供过先例。”</p><p class="normal3">"The American Revolution broke out," says de Tocqueville, "and the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people, which had been nurtured in the townships, took possession of the state." It certainly took possession of the minds of those men who formulated and popularized the stereotypes of democracy. "The cherishment of the people was our principle," wrote Jefferson. But the people he cherished almost exclusively were the small landowning farmers: "Those who labor in the earth are the chosen people of God, if ever He had a chosen people, whose breasts He has made his peculiar deposit for substantial and genuine virtue. It is the focus in which He keeps alive that sacred fire, which otherwise might escape from the face of the earth. Corruption of morals in the mass of cultivators is a phenomenon of which no age nor nation has furnished an example."</p>
<p class="normal3">不管这句感叹词中有多少浪漫的回归自然的成分，其中也包含着实实在在的道理。杰斐逊认为，一群独立的农民比任何其他人类社会都更接近于满足自发民主的要求，他的想法是正确的。但是，如果你想要维护这一理想，你就必须将这些理想的社会与世间的丑恶隔离开来。如果农民要管理自己的事务，他们必须将事务限制在他们习惯管理的范围内。杰斐逊得出了所有这些合乎逻辑的结论。他反对制造业、对外贸易、海军、无形财产形式，在理论上，他反对任何不以小型自治团体为中心的政府形式。他那个时代也曾受到批评，其中一人评论道：“如果我们全身心地投入到自我责任中，并且实际上足够强大，能够抵御一切入侵者，我们可能会享受永恒的质朴，永远在自私、满足的冷漠的庇护下，冷漠而粗俗地生活。”</p><p class="normal3">However much of the romantic return to nature may have entered into this exclamation, there was also an element of solid sense. Jefferson was right in thinking that a group of independent farmers comes nearer to fulfilling the requirements of spontaneous democracy than any other human society. But if you are to preserve the ideal, you must fence off these ideal communities from the abominations of the world. If the farmers are to manage their own affairs, they must confine affairs to those they are accustomed to managing. Jefferson drew all these logical conclusions. He disapproved of manufacture, of foreign commerce, and a navy, of intangible forms of property, and in theory of any form of government that was not centered in the small self-governing group. He had critics in his day: one of them remarked that "wrapt up in the fullness of self-consequence and strong enough, in reality, to defend ourselves against every invader, we might enjoy an eternal rusticity and live, forever, thus apathized and vulgar under the shelter of a selfish, satisfied indifference."</p>

<p class="normal3">杰斐逊所塑造的民主理想包括理想的环境和精英阶层，这与他那个时代的政治科学并不冲突。它确实与现实相冲突。当这一理想被绝对化地表述出来时，部分是出于热情，部分是出于竞选目的，人们很快就忘记了这一理论最初是为非常特殊的条件而设计的。它成为了政治福音，并为各党派的美国人提供了看待政治的刻板印象。</p><p class="normal3">The democratic ideal, as Jefferson moulded it, consisting of an ideal environment and a selected class, did not conflict with the political science of his time. It did conflict with the realities. And when the ideal was stated in absolute terms, partly through exuberance and partly for campaign purposes, it was soon forgotten that the theory was originally devised for very special conditions. It became the political gospel, and supplied the stereotypes through which Americans of all parties have looked at politics.</p>
<p class="normal3">这一信条之所以被确立，是因为在杰斐逊时代，没有人能够设想出非自发和主观的公众舆论。因此，民主传统总是试图看到这样一个世界：人们只关心其原因和结果都在他们所居住的地区内发生的事务。民主理论从来没有能够在广阔而不可预测的环境背景下设想自己。镜子是凹面的。尽管民主人士认识到他们与外部事务有联系，但他们非常肯定地看到，与这个自给自足的群体之外的每一次接触都对最初设想的民主构成了威胁。这是一种明智的担忧。如果民主是自发的，民主的利益就必须保持简单、易懂和易于管理。如果信息的供应要留给偶然的经验，条件必须接近偏远乡村乡镇的条件。环境必须限制在每个人直接和确定的知识范围内。</p><p class="normal3">That gospel was fixed by the necessity that in Jefferson's time no one could have conceived public opinions that were not spontaneous and subjective. The democratic tradition is therefore always trying to see a world where people are exclusively concerned with affairs of which the causes and effects all operate within the region they inhabit. Never has democratic theory been able to conceive itself in the context of a wide and unpredictable environment. The mirror is concave. And although democrats recognize that they are in contact with external affairs, they see quite surely that every contact outside that self-contained group is a threat to democracy as originally conceived. That is a wise fear. If democracy is to be spontaneous, the interests of democracy must remain simple, intelligible, and easily managed. Conditions must approximate those of the isolated rural township if the supply of information is to be left to casual experience. The environment must be confined within the range of every man's direct and certain knowledge.</p>
<p class="normal3">民主主义者已经理解了舆论分析似乎表明的一点：在处理看不见的环境时，决策“显然是随意做出的，显然不应该如此”。因此，他总是试图以这样或那样的方式尽量减少看不见的环境的重要性。他害怕对外贸易，因为贸易涉及外国联系；他不信任制造业，因为它们会产生大城市并聚集人群；如果他仍然需要制造业，他希望得到保护以实现自给自足。当他在现实世界中找不到这些条件时，他热情地走进荒野，建立了远离外国联系的乌托邦社区。他的口号揭示了他的偏见。他主张自治、自决、独立。这些想法中没有一个带有自治团体边界之外的任何同意或社区概念。民主行动领域是一个有限的领域。在受保护的边界内，目标是实现自给自足并避免纠缠。这条规则并不局限于外交政策，但它在那里显而易见，因为国界之外的生活比国界之内的生活更明显地陌生。历史表明，民主国家在外交政策方面通常不得不在光荣孤立和违背其理想的外交之间做出选择。事实上，最成功的民主国家，瑞士、丹麦、澳大利亚、新西兰和美国直到最近，都没有欧洲意义上的外交政策。即使是像门罗主义这样的规则，也是出于希望用足够共和、没有外交政策的国家来补充两大洋的愿望。</p><p class="normal3">The democrat has understood what an analysis of public opinion seems to demonstrate: that in dealing with an unseen environment decisions "are manifestly settled at haphazard, which clearly they ought not to be." So he has always tried in one way or another to minimize the importance of that unseen environment. He feared foreign trade because trade involves foreign connections; he distrusted manufactures because they produced big cities and collected crowds; if he had nevertheless to have manufactures, he wanted protection in the interest of self-sufficiency. When he could not find these conditions in the real world, he went passionately into the wilderness, and founded Utopian communities far from foreign contacts. His slogans reveal his prejudice. He is for Self-Government, Self-Determination, Independence. Not one of these ideas carries with it any notion of consent or community beyond the frontiers of the self-governing groups. The field of democratic action is a circumscribed area. Within protected boundaries the aim has been to achieve self-sufficiency and avoid entanglement. This rule is not confined to foreign policy, but it is plainly evident there, because life outside the national boundaries is more distinctly alien than any life within. And as history shows, democracies in their foreign policy have had generally to choose between splendid isolation and a diplomacy that violated their ideals. The most successful democracies, in fact, Switzerland, Denmark, Australia, New Zealand, and America until recently, have had no foreign policy in the European sense of that phrase. Even a rule like the Monroe Doctrine arose from the desire to supplement the two oceans by a glacis of states that were sufficiently republican to have no foreign policy.</p>
<p class="normal3">尽管危险是专制统治的一个重要条件，甚至可以说是不可或缺的条件，但安全被视为民主制度发挥作用的必要条件。自给自足的社会前提必须尽可能少地受到干扰。不安全感意味着意外。这意味着有人在影响你的生活，而你无法控制他们，也无法与他们商量。这意味着有力量在肆意扰乱熟悉的日常生活，并带来新的问题，需要迅速做出不同寻常的决定。每个民主人士都深知危险的危机与民主是不相容的，因为他知道群众的惰性是如此之大，以至于要迅速采取行动，只有极少数人必须做出决定，其余的人则盲目地跟随。这并没有让民主人士成为不抵抗者，但却导致所有民主战争都是为了和平主义目标而战。即使战争实际上是征服战争，人们也真诚地相信它们是为保卫文明而战。</p><p class="normal3">Whereas danger is a great, perhaps an indispensable condition of autocracy, security was seen to be a necessity if democracy was to work. There must be as little disturbance as possible of the premise of a self-contained community. Insecurity involves surprises. It means that there are people acting upon your life, over whom you have no control, with whom you cannot consult. It means that forces are at large which disturb the familiar routine, and present novel problems about which quick and unusual decisions are required. Every democrat feels in his bones that dangerous crises are incompatible with democracy, because he knows that the inertia of masses is such that to act quickly a very few must decide and the rest follow rather blindly. This has not made non-resistants out of democrats, but it has resulted in all democratic wars being fought for pacifist aims. Even when the wars are in fact wars of conquest, they are sincerely believed to be wars in defense of civilization.</p>
<p class="normal3">这些试图圈占地球表面一部分土地的各种尝试并非出于懦弱、冷漠，或者像杰斐逊的一位批评者所说的，愿意生活在僧侣般的纪律之下。民主党人看到了一个令人眼花缭乱的可能性，即每个人都应该充分发挥自己的能力，摆脱人为的限制。凭借他们对政府艺术的了解，他们无法想象一个由自治个体组成的社会，就像他们之前的亚里士多德一样，只能想象一个封闭而简单的社会。因此，如果他们要得出所有人都能自发管理公共事务的结论，他们就别无选择。</p><p class="normal3">These various attempts to enclose a part of the earth's surface were not inspired by cowardice, apathy, or, what one of Jefferson's critics called a willingness to live under monkish discipline. The democrats had caught sight of a dazzling possibility, that every human being should rise to his full stature, freed from man-made limitations. With what they knew of the art of government, they could, no more than Aristotle before them, conceive a society of autonomous individuals, except an enclosed and simple one. They could, then, select no other premise if they were to reach the conclusion that all the people could spontaneously manage their public affairs.</p>

</p>
<p class="normal3">他们采纳这个前提是因为他们迫切希望这样做，但他们也得出了其他结论。因为要实现自发的自治，就必须有一个简单的自给自足的社区，所以他们理所当然地认为，一个人和另一个人一样有能力管理这些简单而自给自足的事务。当愿望是思想的基础时，这种逻辑是令人信服的。此外，全能公民的原则在乡镇中大多数实际应用中都是正确的。村里的每个人迟早都会尝试村里所做的一切事情。全能公民的职位由各行各业的人轮流担任。在民主刻板印象被普遍应用之前，全能公民的原则并没有出现严重的问题，因此人们将复杂的文明视为一个封闭的村庄。</p><p class="normal3">Having adopted the premise because it was necessary to their keenest hope, they drew other conclusions as well. Since in order to have spontaneous self-government, you had to have a simple self-contained community, they took it for granted that one man was as competent as the next to manage these simple and self-contained affairs. Where the wish is father to the thought such logic is convincing. Moreover, the doctrine of the omnicompetent citizen is for most practical purposes true in the rural township. Everybody in a village sooner or later tries his hand at everything the village does. There is rotation in office by men who are jacks of all trades. There was no serious trouble with the doctrine of the omnicompetent citizen until the democratic stereotype was universally applied, so that men looked at a complicated civilization and saw an enclosed village.</p>
<p class="normal3">个人公民不仅适合处理所有公共事务，而且始终具有公共精神，并具有不懈的兴趣。他在乡镇中具有足够的公共精神，在那里他认识每个人，并对每个人的事情感兴趣。对于乡镇来说足够的概念很容易转变为对于任何目的来说足够的概念，因为正如我们所指出的，定量思维并不符合刻板印象。但还有另一个循环。由于假设每个人都对重要事务有足够的兴趣，因此只有每个人都感兴趣的事务才显得重要。</p><p class="normal3">Not only was the individual citizen fitted to deal with all public affairs, but he was consistently public-spirited and endowed with unflagging interest. He was public-spirited enough in the township, where he knew everybody and was interested in everybody's business. The idea of enough for the township turned easily into the idea of enough for any purpose, for as we have noted, quantitative thinking does not suit a stereotype. But there was another turn to the circle. Since everybody was assumed to be interested enough in important affairs, only those affairs came to seem important in which everybody was interested.</p>
<p class="normal3">这意味着人们从头脑中未受质疑的画面中形成了他们对外部世界的印象。这些画面在他们脑海中被父母和老师刻板地塑造，很少被他们自己的经验所纠正。只有少数人有跨越州界的风流韵事。有理由出国的就更少了。大多数选民一生都生活在一个环境中，除了几份乏味的报纸、一些小册子、政治演讲、他们的宗教训练和谣言外，他们不得不想象更大的商业和金融环境、战争与和平。与基于随意想象的舆论相比，基于任何客观报道的舆论数量非常少。</p><p class="normal3">This meant that men formed their picture of the world outside from the unchallenged pictures in their heads. These pictures came to them well stereotyped by their parents and teachers, and were little corrected by their own experience. Only a few men had affairs that took them across state lines. Even fewer had reason to go abroad. Most voters lived their whole lives in one environment, and with nothing but a few feeble newspapers, some pamphlets, political speeches, their religious training, and rumor to go on, they had to conceive that larger environment of commerce and finance, of war and peace. The number of public opinions based on any objective report was very small in proportion to those based on casual fancy.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，出于许多不同的原因，自给自足在形成时期是一种精神理想。乡镇的物理孤立、拓荒者的孤独、民主理论、新教传统和政治科学的局限性，所有这些都使人们相信，他们必须从自己的良心中提取政治智慧。从绝对原则中推导出法律会夺走他们如此多的自由能量，这并不奇怪。美国政治思想必须依靠其资本生存。在法制主义中，它找到了一套经过检验的规则，从中可以制定新的规则，而不必从经验中获得新的真理。这些公式变得如此神圣，以至于每一位优秀的外国观察家都对美国人民充满活力的实践能量与他们公共生活的静态理论主义之间的对比感到惊讶。对固定原则的坚定热爱正是实现自给自足的唯一已知途径。但这意味着任何一个社区的公众对外部世界的看法主要都是由一些刻板的形象组成的，这些形象按照从其法律和道德准则中推断出的模式排列，并受到当地经验所激发的感觉的激发。</p><p class="normal3">And so for many different reasons, self-sufficiency was a spiritual ideal in the formative period. The physical isolation of the township, the loneliness of the pioneer, the theory of democracy, the Protestant tradition, and the limitations of political science all converged to make men believe that out of their own consciences they must extricate political wisdom. It is not strange that the deduction of laws from absolute principles should have usurped so much of their free energy. The American political mind had to live on its capital. In legalism it found a tested body of rules from which new rules could be spun without the labor of earning new truths from experience. The formulae became so curiously sacred that every good foreign observer has been amazed at the contrast between the dynamic practical energy of the American people and the static theorism of their public life. That steadfast love of fixed principles was simply the only way known of achieving self-sufficiency. But it meant that the public opinions of any one community about the outer world consisted chiefly of a few stereotyped images arranged in a pattern deduced from their legal and their moral codes, and animated by the feeling aroused by local experiences.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，民主理论从其对终极人类尊严的美好愿景出发，由于缺乏报告其环境的知识工具，被迫依靠选民身上积累的智慧和经验。用杰斐逊的话来说，上帝把人的胸膛变成了“他独特的储藏实质性和真正美德的地方”。这些被选中的人在他们自给自足的环境中掌握了所有的事实。环境是如此熟悉，以至于人们可以理所当然地认为人们谈论的是基本相同的事情。因此，唯一真正的分歧将是对相同事实的判断。没有必要保证信息来源。它们是显而易见的，所有人都可以平等地获得。也没有必要为最终的标准而烦恼。在自给自足的社会中，人们可以假设，或至少确实假设了同质的道德准则。因此，唯一存在意见分歧的地方是将公认的标准逻辑地应用于公认的事实。而且由于推理能力也得到了很好的标准化，推理中的错误很快就会在自由讨论中暴露出来。因此，在这些限制内，人们可以自由地获得真理。社会可以将其信息供应视为理所当然；其准则通过学校、教堂和家庭传递，从前提中得出推论的能力，而不是找到前提的能力，被视为智力训练的主要目的。</p><p class="normal3">Thus democratic theory, starting from its fine vision of ultimate human dignity, was forced by lack of the instruments of knowledge for reporting its environment, to fall back upon the wisdom and experience which happened to have accumulated in the voter. God had, in the words of Jefferson, made men's breasts "His peculiar deposit for substantial and genuine virtue." These chosen people in their self-contained environment had all the facts before them. The environment was so familiar that one could take it for granted that men were talking about substantially the same things. The only real disagreements, therefore, would be in judgments about the same facts. There was no need to guarantee the sources of information. They were obvious, and equally accessible to all men. Nor was there need to trouble about the ultimate criteria. In the self-contained community one could assume, or at least did assume, a homogeneous code of morals. The only place, therefore, for differences of opinion was in the logical application of accepted standards to accepted facts. And since the reasoning faculty was also well standardized, an error in reasoning would be quickly exposed in a free discussion. It followed that truth could be obtained by liberty within these limits. The community could take its supply of information for granted; its codes it passed on through school, church, and family, and the power to draw deductions from a premise, rather than the ability to find the premise, was regarded as the chief end of intellectual training.</p>

<p class="normal3">汉密尔顿写道：“正如人们所预见的那样，联邦的措施并未得到执行；各州的失职行为一步步发展到极点，最终导致国家政府的所有运转陷入停滞，并陷入可怕的停顿。”……因为“在我们的情况下，在联邦制下，要完全执行联邦制定的每一项重要措施，就需要十三个不同的主权意志的一致同意。”他问道：“各成员国的统治者……将负责判断措施本身是否适当。他们将考虑所提议或要求的事情是否符合他们的直接利益或目标；是否符合通过该措施带来的暂时便利或不便。所有这些都将以利害攸关和怀疑的态度进行，不了解国家情况和国家理由，而这些对于正确判断至关重要，并且对地方目标的强烈偏爱几乎肯定会误导决策。同样的过程必须在组成该机构的每个成员国重复进行；而由全体议会制定的计划的执行，将始终受到各部分不了解情况和偏见的意见的影响。那些熟悉人民议会程序的人，他们看到，在没有外部环境压力的情况下，让他们就重要问题达成和谐决议往往是多么困难，他们很容易想象，要让许多人民议会成员同意他们做出一致决定是多么不可能。这样的集会，在不同的时间、以不同的印象进行远距离审议，渴望在相同的观点和追求下进行合作。”</p><p class="normal3">"IT has happened as was to have been foreseen," wrote Hamilton, "the measures of the Union have not been executed; the delinquencies of the States have, step by step, matured themselves to an extreme which has at length arrested all the wheels of the national government and brought them to an awful stand."… For "in our case the concurrence of thirteen distinct sovereign wills is requisite, under the confederation, to the complete execution of every important measure that proceeds from the Union." How could it be otherwise, he asked: "The rulers of the respective members… will undertake to judge of the propriety of the measures themselves. They will consider the conformity of the thing proposed or required to their immediate interests or aims; the momentary conveniences or inconveniences that would attend its adoption. All this will be done, and in a spirit of interested and suspicious scrutiny, without that knowledge of national circumstances and reasons of state which is essential to right judgment, and with that strong predilection in favor of local objects which can hardly fail to mislead the decision. The same process must be repeated in every member of which the body is constituted; and the execution of the plans framed by the councils of the whole, will always fluctuate on the discretion of the ill-informed and prejudiced opinion of every part. Those who have been conversant in the proceedings of popular assemblies, who have seen how difficult it often is, when there is no exterior pressure of circumstances, to bring them to harmonious resolutions on important points, will readily conceive how impossible it must be to induce a number of such assemblies, deliberating at a distance from each other, at different times, and under different impressions, long to cooperate in the same views and pursuits."</p>
<p class="normal3">十年的风风雨雨，以及约翰·亚当斯所说的“只是外交集会”的国会，为革命领袖们提供了“具有启发性但又令人痛苦的教训”，让他们明白，当许多以自我为中心的社区陷入同一环境时会发生什么。因此，当他们于 1787 年 5 月前往费城，表面上是为了修改《邦联条例》，实际上是在完全反对 18 世纪民主的基本前提。这些领导人不仅有意识地反对当时的民主精神，正如麦迪逊所说，他们觉得“民主一直都是动荡和争斗的奇观”，而且他们决心在国家边界内尽可能地抵消在自给自足的环境中建立自治社区的理想。凹面民主的冲突和失败摆在他们眼前，在凹面民主中，人们自发地管理自己的所有事务。在他们看来，问题在于恢复政府，而不是民主。他们理解政府是制定国家决策并在全国范围内执行的权力；他们相信民主是地方和阶级根据其直接利益和目标坚持自决。</p><p class="normal3">Over ten years of storm and stress with a congress that was, as John Adams said, "only a diplomatic assembly," had furnished the leaders of the revolution "with an instructive but afflicting lesson" in what happens when a number of self-centered communities are entangled in the same environment. And so, when they went to Philadelphia in May of 1787, ostensibly to revise the Articles of Confederation, they were really in full reaction against the fundamental premise of Eighteenth Century democracy. Not only were the leaders consciously opposed to the democratic spirit of the time, feeling, as Madison said, that "democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention," but within the national frontiers they were determined to offset as far as they could the ideal of self-governing communities in self-contained environments. The collisions and failures of concave democracy, where men spontaneously managed all their own affairs, were before their eyes. The problem as they saw it, was to restore government as against democracy. They understood government to be the power to make national decisions and enforce them throughout the nation; democracy they believed was the insistence of localities and classes upon self-determination in accordance with their immediate interests and aims.</p>
<p class="normal3">他们在计算中没有考虑到这样一种知识组织的可能性，即不同的社区会同时根据同一种事实采取行动。我们刚刚开始设想这种可能性，适用于世界上某些新闻自由流通、语言通用的地区，而且仅限于生活的某些方面。工业和世界政治中自愿联邦制的整个概念仍然很初级，正如我们在自己的经验中所看到的，它只在实际政治中发挥了很小的作用。一个多世纪后，我们只能设想它激励几代人的智力努力，而宪法的作者根本没有理由设想它。为了建立国家政府，汉密尔顿和他的同事们必须制定计划，不是基于人们会因为有共同利益而合作的理论，而是基于如果特殊利益通过权力平衡保持平衡，人们就可以被统治的理论。麦迪逊说：“必须用野心来抵消野心。”</p><p class="normal3">They could not consider in their calculations the possibility of such an organization of knowledge that separate communities would act simultaneously on the same version of the facts. We just begin to conceive this possibility for certain parts of the world where there is free circulation of news and a common language, and then only for certain aspects of life. The whole idea of a voluntary federalism in industry and world politics is still so rudimentary, that, as we see in our own experience, it enters only a little, and only very modestly, into practical politics. What we, more than a century later, can only conceive as an incentive to generations of intellectual effort, the authors of the Constitution had no reason to conceive at all. In order to set up national government, Hamilton and his colleagues had to make plans, not on the theory that men would cooperate because they had a sense of common interest, but on the theory that men could be governed, if special interests were kept in equilibrium by a balance of power. "Ambition," Madison said, "must be made to counteract ambition."</p>
<p class="normal3">他们并不像某些作家所认为的那样，想要平衡各方利益，让政府陷入永久的僵局。他们想要使地方和阶级利益陷入僵局，以防止这些利益妨碍政府。麦迪逊写道：“在组建一个由人统治人的政府时，最大的困难在于：你必须首先让政府控制被统治者，其次，迫使政府控制自己。”因此，在一个非常重要的意义上，制衡原则是联邦主义领导人解决舆论问题的良方。他们认为，除了设计一种巧妙的机器来中和地方舆论之外，没有其他方法可以用“行政长官的温和影响”来取代“剑的血腥力量”。他们不懂得如何操纵大量选民，就像他们看不到在共同信息的基础上达成共同同意的可能性一样。确实，当汉密尔顿在 1800 年借助坦慕尼协会夺取纽约市控制权时，阿伦·伯尔给汉密尔顿上了一课，给他留下了深刻印象。但汉密尔顿在能够考虑到这一新发现之前就被杀了，而且，正如福特先生所说，伯尔的手枪炸毁了联邦党的脑袋。</p><p class="normal3">They did not, as some writers have supposed, intend to balance every interest so that the government would be in a perpetual deadlock. They intended to deadlock local and class interest to prevent these from obstructing government. "In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men," wrote Madison, "the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed, and in the next place, oblige it to control itself." In one very important sense, then, the doctrine of checks and balances was the remedy of the federalist leaders for the problem of public opinion. They saw no other way to substitute "the mild influence of the magistracy" for the "sanguinary agency of the sword" except by devising an ingenious machine to neutralize local opinion. They did not understand how to manipulate a large electorate, any more than they saw the possibility of common consent upon the basis of common information. It is true that Aaron Burr taught Hamilton a lesson which impressed him a good deal when he seized control of New York City in 1800 by the aid of Tammany Hall. But Hamilton was killed before he was able to take account of this new discovery, and, as Mr. Ford says, Burr's pistol blew the brains out of the Federal party.</p>

<p class="normal3">宪法制定时，“政治仍可通过绅士之间的协商和协议来管理”，汉密尔顿向绅士寻求政府支持。当地方偏见通过宪法制衡而达到平衡时，他们应该管理国家事务。毫无疑问，汉密尔顿因收养而属于这个阶级，因此对绅士有偏爱。但这本身不足以解释他的治国之道。当然，他对联盟的强烈热情是毋庸置疑的，我认为，说他建立联盟是为了保护阶级特权，而不是说他利用阶级特权建立了联盟，这是颠倒事实。汉密尔顿说：“我们必须以我们所发现的为人，如果我们希望他为公众服务，就必须激起他的热情。”他需要能够最迅速地将热情与国家利益联系起来的人来治理国家。这些人包括绅士、公共债权人、制造商、船运商和商人，历史上可能没有比汉密尔顿采取的一系列财政措施更好的例子来说明如何采用精明的手段来实现明确的目的，通过这些措施，汉密尔顿把地方知名人士团结在新政府中。</p><p class="normal3">When the constitution was written, "politics could still be managed by conference and agreement among gentlemen" and it was to the gentry that Hamilton turned for a government. It was intended that they should manage national affairs when local prejudice had been brought into equilibrium by the constitutional checks and balances. No doubt Hamilton, who belonged to this class by adoption, had a human prejudice in their favor. But that by itself is a thin explanation of his statecraft. Certainly there can be no question of his consuming passion for union, and it is, I think, an inversion of the truth to argue that he made the Union to protect class privileges, instead of saying that he used class privileges to make the Union. "We must take man as we find him," Hamilton said, "and if we expect him to serve the public we must interest his passions in doing so." He needed men to govern, whose passions could be most quickly attached to a national interest. These were the gentry, the public creditors, manufacturers, shippers, and traders, and there is probably no better instance in history of the adaptation of shrewd means to clear ends, than in the series of fiscal measures, by which Hamilton attached the provincial notables to the new government.</p>
<p class="normal3">尽管制宪会议是闭门进行的，尽管批准是“可能不超过六分之一的成年男性投票的结果”，但几乎没有任何掩饰。联邦党人主张联盟，而不是民主，甚至共和国这个词对乔治·华盛顿来说也是一种不愉快的声音，因为他已经担任了两年多的共和党总统。宪法是限制民众统治范围的一次坦率尝试；政府应该拥有的唯一民主机构是众议院，而众议院的选举权受到财产资格的严格限制。即便如此，人们认为众议院将是政府中如此放荡的一部分，因此它受到参议院、选举团、总统否决权和司法解释的仔细制约和平衡。</p><p class="normal3">Although the constitutional convention worked behind closed doors, and although ratification was engineered by "a vote of probably not more than one-sixth of the adult males," there was little or no pretence. The Federalists argued for union, not for democracy, and even the word republic had an unpleasant sound to George Washington when he had been for more than two years a republican president. The constitution was a candid attempt to limit the sphere of popular rule; the only democratic organ it was intended the government should possess was the House, based on a suffrage highly limited by property qualifications. And even at that, the House, it was believed, would be so licentious a part of the government, that it was carefully checked and balanced by the Senate, the electoral college, the Presidential veto, and by judicial interpretation.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，当法国大革命在全世界激起民心的时候，1776 年的美国革命者们却受到了一部尽可能效仿英国君主制的宪法的约束。这种保守的反动无法持续下去。制定这一政策的人是少数，他们的动机受到怀疑，而当华盛顿退休时，士绅阶层的地位还不足以在不可避免的继承权斗争中生存下来。教父们最初的计划与当时的道德情感之间的差距太大了，一位优秀的政治家不能不利用这一点。</p><p class="normal3">Thus at the moment when the French Revolution was kindling popular feeling the world over, the American revolutionists of 1776 came under a constitution which went back, as far as it was expedient, to the British Monarchy for a model. This conservative reaction could not endure. The men who had made it were a minority, their motives were under suspicion, and when Washington went into retirement, the position of the gentry was not strong enough to survive the inevitable struggle for the succession. The anomaly between the original plan of the Fathers and the moral feeling of the age was too wide not to be capitalized by a good politician.</p>

<p class="normal3">杰斐逊将自己的当选称为“1800 年的伟大革命”，但更重要的是，这是一场思想上的革命。虽然没有改变任何重大政策，但建立了新的传统。因为杰斐逊是第一个教导美国人民将宪法视为民主工具的人，他塑造了美国人自此以后相互描述政治的形象、思想，甚至许多短语。这种思想上的胜利是如此彻底，以至于 25 年后，受到联邦党人家庭接待的托克维尔指出，即使是那些“因持续存在而感到恼火”的人，也常常听到“在公共场合赞美共和政府的魅力和民主制度的优势”。</p><p class="normal3">Jefferson referred to his election as "the great revolution of 1800," but more than anything else it was a revolution in the mind. No great policy was altered, but a new tradition was established. For it was Jefferson who first taught the American people to regard the Constitution as an instrument of democracy, and he stereotyped the images, the ideas, and even many of the phrases, in which Americans ever since have described politics to each other. So complete was the mental victory, that twenty-five years later de Tocqueville, who was received in Federalist homes, noted that even those who were "galled by its continuance"—were not uncommonly heard to "laud the delights of a republican government, and the advantages of democratic institutions when they are in public."</p>
<p class="normal3">制宪之父们尽管十分睿智，却未能看到，一部明显不民主的宪法不会长期被容忍。对民治的大胆否定必然会为像杰斐逊这样的人提供一个攻击的切入点，就其宪法观点而言，杰斐逊并不比汉密尔顿更愿意将政府移交给“未经提炼”的人民意志。联邦党领袖们都是有明确信念的人，他们直言不讳。他们的公开观点和私人观点之间几乎没有真正的差异。但杰斐逊的思想却充满矛盾，这不仅仅是因为其缺陷（汉密尔顿和他的传记作者认为），还因为他相信联盟，也相信自发民主，而他那个时代的政治学没有令人满意的方法来调和这两者。杰斐逊的思想和行动都混乱不堪，因为他有一个新奇而伟大的想法，而没有人全面地考虑过它。但是，尽管没有人清楚地理解人民主权，但它似乎意味着人类生活的巨大改善，以至于任何宪法都不能坦率地否认它。因此，坦率的否认从意识中被抹去，而这份表面上是有限宪政民主的真实例子的文件，却被谈论和认为是直接人民统治的工具。杰斐逊实际上已经到了相信联邦党人已经曲解宪法的地步，在他看来，他们不再是宪法的作者。因此，宪法在精神上被重写。部分是通过实际修订，部分是通过实践，如选举团的情况，但主要是通过另一套刻板印象来看待它，外表不再允许看起来像寡头政治。</p><p class="normal3">The Constitutional Fathers with all their sagacity had failed to see that a frankly undemocratic constitution would not long be tolerated. The bold denial of popular rule was bound to offer an easy point of attack to a man, like Jefferson, who so far as his constitutional opinions ran, was not a bit more ready than Hamilton to turn over government to the "unrefined" will of the people. The Federalist leaders had been men of definite convictions who stated them bluntly. There was little real discrepancy between their public and their private views. But Jefferson's mind was a mass of ambiguities, not solely because of its defects, as Hamilton and his biographers have thought, but because he believed in a union and he believed in spontaneous democracies, and in the political science of his age there was no satisfactory way to reconcile the two. Jefferson was confused in thought and action because he had a vision of a new and tremendous idea that no one had thought out in all its bearings. But though popular sovereignty was not clearly understood by anybody, it seemed to imply so great an enhancement of human life, that no constitution could stand which frankly denied it. The frank denials were therefore expunged from consciousness, and the document, which is on its face an honest example of limited constitutional democracy, was talked and thought about as an instrument for direct popular rule. Jefferson actually reached the point of believing that the Federalists had perverted the Constitution, of which in his fancy they were no longer the authors. And so the Constitution was, in spirit, rewritten. Partly by actual amendment, partly by practice, as in the case of the electoral college, but chiefly by looking at it through another set of stereotypes, the facade was no longer permitted to look oligarchic.</p>
<p class="normal3">美国人民开始相信他们的宪法是民主的工具，并以此对待它。他们将这一虚构归功于托马斯·杰斐逊的胜利，而这已成为一个伟大的保守主义虚构。可以合理地猜测，如果每个人都像宪法的作者那样看待宪法，宪法就会被暴力推翻，因为对宪法的忠诚和对民主的忠诚似乎是不相容的。杰斐逊通过教导美国人民将宪法视为民主的表达来解决这一悖论。他自己就此止步。但在大约二十五年的时间里，社会条件发生了如此巨大的变化，安德鲁·杰克逊进行了杰斐逊为之准备的传统的政治革命。</p><p class="normal3">The American people came to believe that their Constitution was a democratic instrument, and treated it as such. They owe that fiction to the victory of Thomas Jefferson, and a great conservative fiction it has been. It is a fair guess that if everyone had always regarded the Constitution as did the authors of it, the Constitution would have been violently overthrown, because loyalty to the Constitution and loyalty to democracy would have seemed incompatible. Jefferson resolved that paradox by teaching the American people to read the Constitution as an expression of democracy. He himself stopped there. But in the course of twenty-five years or so social conditions had changed so radically, that Andrew Jackson carried out the political revolution for which Jefferson had prepared the tradition.</p>

<p class="normal3">这场革命的政治核心是任人唯亲的问题。政府的创立者认为公职是一种财产，不容轻易侵犯，他们无疑希望公职能留在自己的社会阶层手中。但民主理论的主要原则之一就是全能公民的原则。因此，当人们开始将宪法视为民主工具时，官职常任制无疑会显得不民主。人们的自然野心与他们那个时代伟大的道德冲动不谋而合。杰斐逊推广了这一理念，但并未将其无情地付诸实践，在弗吉尼亚州总统任期内，因党派原因被罢免的情况相对较少。杰克逊开创了将公职转变为任人唯亲的做法。</p><p class="normal3">The political center of that revolution was the question of patronage. By the men who founded the government public office was regarded as a species of property, not lightly to be disturbed, and it was undoubtedly their hope that the offices would remain in the hands of their social class. But the democratic theory had as one of its main principles the doctrine of the omnicompetent citizen. Therefore, when people began to look at the Constitution as a democratic instrument, it was certain that permanence in office would seem undemocratic. The natural ambitions of men coincided here with the great moral impulse of their age. Jefferson had popularized the idea without carrying it ruthlessly into practice, and removals on party grounds were comparatively few under the Virginian Presidents. It was Jackson who founded the practice of turning public office into patronage.</p>
<p class="normal3">在我们看来，这听起来很奇怪，但短期轮换制被认为是一项伟大的改革。它不仅承认普通人的新尊严，将他们视为适合任何职位的人，不仅摧毁了少数社会阶层的垄断，似乎为人才打开了职业大门，而且“几个世纪以来，它一直被推崇为政治腐败的万能药”，是防止官僚主义产生的一种方式。公职人员快速更替的做法是将自给自足的村庄民主形象应用于广大地区。</p><p class="normal3">Curious as it sounds to us, the principle of rotation in office with short terms was regarded as a great reform. Not only did it acknowledge the new dignity of the average man by treating him as fit for any office, not only did it destroy the monopoly of a small social class and appear to open careers to talent, but "it had been advocated for centuries as a sovereign remedy for political corruption," and as the one way to prevent the creation of a bureaucracy. The practice of rapid change in public office was the application to a great territory of the image of democracy derived from the self-contained village.</p>
<p class="normal3">当然，它在国内没有取得与民主理论所基于的理想社会相同的结果。它产生了意想不到的结果，因为它建立了一个新的统治阶级来取代被淹没的联邦主义者。无意中，赞助对大选民的影响就像汉密尔顿的财政措施对上层阶级的影响一样。我们常常没有意识到我们政府的稳定在多大程度上归功于赞助。因为正是赞助使天生的领导者摆脱了对以自我为中心的社会的过度依恋，正是赞助削弱了地方精神，并通过某种和平合作将这些人聚集在一起，而这些人作为地方名人，如果没有共同利益意识，就会把联盟分裂开来。</p><p class="normal3">Naturally it did not have the same results in the nation that it had in the ideal community on which the democratic theory was based. It produced quite unexpected results, for it founded a new governing class to take the place of the submerged federalists. Unintentionally, patronage did for a large electorate what Hamilton's fiscal measures had done for the upper classes. We often fail to realize how much of the stability of our government we owe to patronage. For it was patronage that weaned natural leaders from too much attachment to the self-centered community, it was patronage that weakened the local spirit and brought together in some kind of peaceful cooperation, the very men who, as provincial celebrities, would, in the absence of a sense of common interest, have torn the union apart.</p>
<p class="normal3">但当然，民主理论并不打算产生一个新的统治阶级，它从未适应过这一事实。当民主党人想要废除官职垄断，实行轮换和短期任期时，他想到的是乡镇，在那里任何人都可以做公共服务，然后谦卑地回到自己的农场。一个特殊的政治家阶层的想法正是民主党人不喜欢的。但他无法拥有他喜欢的东西，因为他的理论源于一个理想的环境，而他生活在一个真实的环境中。他越深刻地感受到民主的道德冲动，就越不愿意看到汉密尔顿所说的深刻真理，即在远处和不同印象下进行审议的社区无法长期合作，共同追求相同的观点和追求。因为这个真理推迟了任何类似于在公共事务中充分实现民主的事情，直到获得共同同意的艺术得到根本性的改进。因此，虽然杰斐逊和杰克逊领导的革命产生了赞助，从而形成了两党制，创造了绅士统治的替代品，并建立了管理三权分立僵局的纪律，但所有这一切都是在无形中发生的。</p><p class="normal3">But of course, the democratic theory was not supposed to produce a new governing class, and it has never accommodated itself to the fact. When the democrat wanted to abolish monopoly of offices, to have rotation and short terms, he was thinking of the township where anyone could do a public service, and return humbly to his own farm. The idea of a special class of politicians was just what the democrat did not like. But he could not have what he did like, because his theory was derived from an ideal environment, and he was living in a real one. The more deeply he felt the moral impulse of democracy, the less ready he was to see the profound truth of Hamilton's statement that communities deliberating at a distance and under different impressions could not long coöperate in the same views and pursuits. For that truth postpones anything like the full realization of democracy in public affairs until the art of obtaining common consent has been radically improved. And so while the revolution under Jefferson and Jackson produced the patronage which made the two party system, which created a substitute for the rule of the gentry, and a discipline for governing the deadlock of the checks and balances, all that happened, as it were, invisibly.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，轮换职位可能是表面上的理论，实际上职位在亲信之间来回变动。任期可能不是永久垄断，但职业政客却是永久垄断的。正如哈丁总统曾经说过的，政府可能很简单，但赢得选举却是一项复杂的工作。官员的薪水可能像杰斐逊的家常便饭一样节俭，但党组织的开支和胜利的果实却是宏伟的。民主的刻板印象控制着可见的政府；美国人民对其环境真实事实的修正、例外和适应必须是看不见的，即使每个人都知道这些。只有法律的文字、政客的演讲、政纲和正式的行政机构必须符合民主的原始形象。</p><p class="normal3">Thus, rotation in office might be the ostensible theory, in practice the offices oscillated between the henchmen. Tenure might not be a permanent monopoly, but the professional politician was permanent. Government might be, as President Harding once said, a simple thing, but winning elections was a sophisticated performance. The salaries in office might be as ostentatiously frugal as Jefferson's home-spun, but the expenses of party organization and the fruits of victory were in the grand manner. The stereotype of democracy controlled the visible government; the corrections, the exceptions and adaptations of the American people to the real facts of their environment have had to be invisible, even when everybody knew all about them. It was only the words of the law, the speeches of politicians, the platforms, and the formal machinery of administration that have had to conform to the pristine image of democracy.</p>

<p class="normal3">如果有人问一位哲学民主主义者，当公众舆论如此以自我为中心时，这些自给自足的社区如何合作，他会指出国会代表的代议制政府。没有什么比发现代议制政府的威望如何稳步下降，而总统的权力却在增长更让他惊讶的了。</p><p class="normal3">If one had asked a philosophical democrat how these self-contained communities were to cooperate, when their public opinions were so self-centered, he would have pointed to representative government embodied in the Congress. And nothing would surprise him more than the discovery of how steadily the prestige of representative government has declined, while the power of the Presidency has grown.</p>
<p class="normal3">一些批评家将此归因于只派遣当地名人前往华盛顿的习俗。他们认为，如果国会能由全国知名人士组成，首都的生活将会更加精彩。当然，如果即将退休的总统和内阁官员效仿约翰·昆西·亚当斯，那将是一件非常好的事情。但这些人的缺席并不能解释国会的困境，因为它的衰落始于它相对最杰出的政府部门。事实上，更可能的情况是相反的，国会不再吸引知名人士，因为它失去了对国家政策制定的直接影响。</p><p class="normal3">Some critics have traced this to the custom of sending only local celebrities to Washington. They have thought that if Congress could consist of the nationally eminent men, the life of the capital would be more brilliant. It would be, of course, and it would be a very good thing if retiring Presidents and Cabinet officers followed the example of John Quincy Adams. But the absence of these men does not explain the plight of Congress, for its decline began when it was relatively the most eminent branch of the government. Indeed it is more probable that the reverse is true, and that Congress ceased to attract the eminent as it lost direct influence on the shaping of national policy.</p>
<p class="normal3">我认为，造成这种世界性失信的主要原因在于，国会本质上是一群盲人，他们身处一个广阔而未知的世界。除了一些例外，宪法或代议制政府理论中承认的国会了解情况的唯一方法是交换各选区的意见。国会没有系统、充分和授权的方式来了解世界上正在发生的事情。理论认为，每个选区的最佳人选将选民的最佳智慧带到一个中心，而所有这些智慧加在一起就是国会所需要的智慧。现在，没有必要质疑表达和交换当地意见的价值。国会作为一个大陆国家的市场具有巨大的价值。在衣帽间、酒店大堂、国会山的寄宿公寓、国会女主人的茶话会以及偶尔进入国际化华盛顿的客厅，新的前景和更广阔的视野都被打开了。但即使应用这一理论，各地区也总是派出最聪明的人，当地印象的总和或组合也不足以成为国家政策的广泛基础，也根本不是控制外交政策的基础。由于大多数法律的实际影响都是微妙而隐蔽的，因此无法通过过滤当地经验和当地心态来了解它们。只有通过受控报道和客观分析才能了解它们。正如一家大工厂的负责人无法通过与工头交谈来了解工厂的效率，而必须检查只有会计师才能为他挖掘出的成本表和数据一样，立法者也无法通过拼凑当地图片来获得联邦状况的真实图景。他需要了解当地的情况，但除非他拥有校准它们的仪器，否则一幅图景与另一幅图景一样好，甚至好得多。</p><p class="normal3">The main reason for the discredit, which is world wide, is, I think, to be found in the fact that a congress of representatives is essentially a group of blind men in a vast, unknown world. With some exceptions, the only method recognized in the Constitution or in the theory of representative government, by which Congress can inform itself, is to exchange opinions from the districts. There is no systematic, adequate, and authorized way for Congress to know what is going on in the world. The theory is that the best man of each district brings the best wisdom of his constituents to a central place, and that all these wisdoms combined are all the wisdom that Congress needs. Now there is no need to question the value of expressing local opinions and exchanging them. Congress has great value as the market-place of a continental nation. In the coatrooms, the hotel lobbies, the boarding houses of Capitol Hill, at the tea-parties of the Congressional matrons, and from occasional entries into the drawing rooms of cosmopolitan Washington, new vistas are opened, and wider horizons. But even if the theory were applied, and the districts always sent their wisest men, the sum or a combination of local impressions is not a wide enough base for national policy, and no base at all for the control of foreign policy. Since the real effects of most laws are subtle and hidden, they cannot be understood by filtering local experiences through local states of mind. They can be known only by controlled reporting and objective analysis. And just as the head of a large factory cannot know how efficient it is by talking to the foreman, but must examine cost sheets and data that only an accountant can dig out for him, so the lawmaker does not arrive at a true picture of the state of the union by putting together a mosaic of local pictures. He needs to know the local pictures, but unless he possesses instruments for calibrating them, one picture is as good as the next, and a great deal better.</p>
<p class="normal3">总统确实通过发表国情咨文来协助国会。他之所以能这样做，是因为他掌管着一大批机构及其代理人，他们既要报告，又要采取行动。但他只告诉国会他想说的话。他不能被人阻拦，而审查哪些内容符合公众利益则由他决定。这是一种完全片面而棘手的关系，有时甚至荒谬至极，以至于国会为了获得一份重要文件，不得不感谢芝加哥一家报纸的辛勤工作，或者下属官员的蓄意轻率行为。立法者与必要事实的接触如此糟糕，以至于他们不得不依靠私人情报或合法的暴行——国会调查，在这种调查中，国会议员们缺乏合法的思考材料，开始疯狂而狂热地搜捕，甚至不止于吃人。</p><p class="normal3">The President does come to the assistance of Congress by delivering messages on the state of the Union. He is in a position to do that because he presides over a vast collection of bureaus and their agents, which report as well as act. But he tells Congress what he chooses to tell it. He cannot be heckled, and the censorship as to what is compatible with the public interest is in his hands. It is a wholly one-sided and tricky relationship, which sometimes reaches such heights of absurdity, that Congress, in order to secure an important document has to thank the enterprise of a Chicago newspaper, or the calculated indiscretion of a subordinate official. So bad is the contact of legislators with necessary facts that they are forced to rely either on private tips or on that legalized atrocity, the Congressional investigation, where Congressmen, starved of their legitimate food for thought, go on a wild and feverish man-hunt, and do not stop at cannibalism.</p>
<p class="normal3">除了这些调查结果很少、行政部门偶尔的通报、私人收集的感兴趣和不感兴趣的数据、国会议员阅读的报纸、期刊和书籍，以及向州际商务委员会、联邦贸易委员会和关税委员会等专家机构寻求帮助的新做法外，国会意见的形成是乱伦的。由此可见，要么国家立法是由少数知情人士准备的，并通过党派力量通过；要么立法被分解成一系列地方项目，每一项都是出于当地原因而制定的。关税表、海军造船厂、陆军哨所、河流和港口、邮局和联邦大楼、养老金和赞助：这些都被提供给凹陷社区，作为国家生活好处的有形证据。凹陷社区可以看到用联邦资金建造的白色大理石建筑，以提高当地房地产价值并雇用当地承包商，却无法判断政治分肥的累计成本。公平地说，在一个庞大的议会中，每个人只对自己的选区有实际了解，处理跨地区事务的法律会被大多数国会议员拒绝或接受，而没有任何创造性的参与。他们只参与制定那些可以作为一堆地方问题处理的法律。因为一个没有有效信息和分析手段的立法机构必须在盲目的规律性（偶尔会受到叛乱的影响）和互投赞成票之间摇摆不定。正是互投赞成票使规律性变得可以接受，因为通过互投赞成票，国会议员向更积极的选民证明，他正在关注他们所设想的利益。</p><p class="normal3">Except for the little that these investigations yield, the occasional communications from the executive departments, interested and disinterested data collected by private persons, such newspapers, periodicals, and books as Congressmen read, and a new and excellent practice of calling for help from expert bodies like the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Tariff Commission, the creation of Congressional opinion is incestuous. From this it follows either that legislation of a national character is prepared by a few informed insiders, and put through by partisan force; or that the legislation is broken up into a collection of local items, each of which is enacted for a local reason. Tariff schedules, navy yards, army posts, rivers and harbors, post offices and federal buildings, pensions and patronage: these are fed out to concave communities as tangible evidence of the benefits of national life. Being concave, they can see the white marble building which rises out of federal funds to raise local realty values and employ local contractors more readily than they can judge the cumulative cost of the pork barrel. It is fair to say that in a large assembly of men, each of whom has practical knowledge only of his own district, laws dealing with translocal affairs are rejected or accepted by the mass of Congressmen without creative participation of any kind. They participate only in making those laws that can be treated as a bundle of local issues. For a legislature without effective means of information and analysis must oscillate between blind regularity, tempered by occasional insurgency, and logrolling. And it is the logrolling which makes the regularity palatable, because it is by logrolling that a Congressman proves to his more active constituents that he is watching their interests as they conceive them.</p>
<p class="normal3">这不是国会议员个人的错，除非他对此沾沾自喜。最聪明、最勤奋的代表也不可能指望自己能理解他所投票表决的法案的一小部分。他所能做的最好的事情就是专注于少数法案，其余的则听从别人的意见。我知道国会议员在研究一个主题时，会像他们通过期末考试以来从未研究过的那样，喝很多大杯黑咖啡，用湿毛巾等等。他们必须挖掘信息，费尽心思整理和核实事实，而在任何有意识组织的政府中，这些事实都应该以适合决策的形式轻松获得。即使他们真的了解一个主题，他们的焦虑才刚刚开始。因为在国内，编辑、贸易委员会、中央联合工会和妇女俱乐部都省去了这些工作，准备通过当地的奇观来观察国会议员的表现。</p><p class="normal3">This is no fault of the individual Congressman's, except when he is complacent about it. The cleverest and most industrious representative cannot hope to understand a fraction of the bills on which he votes. The best he can do is to specialize on a few bills, and take somebody's word about the rest. I have known Congressmen, when they were boning up on a subject, to study as they had not studied since they passed their final examinations, many large cups of black coffee, wet towels and all. They had to dig for information, sweat over arranging and verifying facts, which, in any consciously organized government, should have been easily available in a form suitable for decision. And even when they really knew a subject, their anxieties had only begun. For back home the editors, the board of trade, the central federated union, and the women's clubs had spared themselves these labors, and were prepared to view the Congressman's performance through local spectacles.</p>

Patronage and pork amalgamate and stabilize thousands of special opinions, local discontents, private ambitions. There are but two other alternatives. One is government by terror and obedience, the other is government based on such a highly developed system of information, analysis, and self-consciousness that "the knowledge of national circumstances and reasons of state" is evident to all men. The autocratic system is in decay, the voluntary system is in its very earliest development; and so, in calculating the prospects of association among large groups of people, a League of Nations, industrial government, or a federal union of states, the degree to which the material for a common consciousness exists, determines how far cooperation will depend upon force, or upon the milder alternative to force, which is patronage and privilege. The secret of great state-builders, like Alexander Hamilton, is that they know how to calculate these principles.</p>

<p class="normal3">每当以自我为中心的群体之间的争吵变得无法忍受时，过去的改革者们就会发现自己被迫在两个重大选择之间做出选择。他们可以走上通往罗马的道路，将罗马的和平强加给交战的部落。他们可以走上孤立、自治和自给自足的道路。他们几乎总是选择那条他们最近最少走过的道路。如果他们尝试过帝国的单调乏味，他们最珍视的是他们自己社区的简单自由。但是，如果他们看到这种简单的自由被地方主义的嫉妒所浪费，他们就会渴望一个强大国家的广阔秩序。</p><p class="normal3">Whenever the quarrels of self-centered groups become unbearable, reformers in the past found themselves forced to choose between two great alternatives. They could take the path to Rome and impose a Roman peace upon the warring tribes. They could take the path to isolation, to autonomy and self-sufficiency. Almost always they chose that path which they had least recently travelled. If they had tried out the deadening monotony of empire, they cherished above all other things the simple freedom of their own community. But if they had seen this simple freedom squandered in parochial jealousies they longed for the spacious order of a great and powerful state.</p>
<p class="normal3">无论他们做出何种选择，根本困难都是一样的。如果决策分散，他们很快就会陷入当地意见的混乱之中。如果决策集中，国家的政策就基于首都一小撮社会群体的意见。无论如何，武力都是必要的，以捍卫一个地方权利，对抗另一个地方权利，或对地方实施法律和秩序，或抵抗中央的阶级政府，或保卫整个社会，无论是集中的还是分散的，以抵御外来的野蛮人。</p><p class="normal3">Whichever choice they made, the essential difficulty was the same. If decisions were decentralized they soon floundered in a chaos of local opinions. If they were centralized, the policy of the state was based on the opinions of a small social set at the capital. In any case force was necessary to defend one local right against another, or to impose law and order on the localities, or to resist class government at the center, or to defend the whole society, centralized or decentralized, against the outer barbarian.</p>
<p class="normal3">现代民主和工业体系都诞生于反对国王、王室政府和详细经济监管制度的时代。在工业领域，这种反应表现为极端权力下放，即所谓的自由放任的个人主义。每项经济决策都由拥有相关财产所有权的人做出。由于几乎所有东西都归某人所有，所以会有人来管理一切。这是复仇的多元主权。</p><p class="normal3">Modern democracy and the industrial system were both born in a time of reaction against kings, crown government, and a regime of detailed economic regulation. In the industrial sphere this reaction took the form of extreme devolution, known as laissez-faire individualism. Each economic decision was to be made by the man who had title to the property involved. Since almost everything was owned by somebody, there would be somebody to manage everything. This was plural sovereignty with a vengeance.</p>
<p class="normal3">这是由任何人的经济哲学决定的经济政府，尽管它应该受制于政治经济的不可改变的规律，而这些规律最终必将产生和谐。它产生了许多辉煌的事物，但也产生了足够多的肮脏和可怕的事物，从而引发了逆流。其中之一就是托拉斯，它在工业内部建立了一种罗马式的和平，而在工业外部建立了一种罗马式的掠夺性帝国主义。人们转向立法机构寻求救济。他们援引以乡镇农民形象为基础的代议制政府来管理半主权公司。工人阶级转向劳工组织。随后出现了一个日益集中的时期，以及一种军备竞赛。托拉斯相互关联，行业工会联合起来，组成一个劳工运动，随着改革者试图将其力量与大企业抗衡，政治体系在华盛顿变得更加强大，在各州则变得更加弱小。</p><p class="normal3">It was economic government by anybody's economic philosophy, though it was supposed to be controlled by immutable laws of political economy that must in the end produce harmony. It produced many splendid things, but enough sordid and terrible ones to start counter-currents. One of these was the trust, which established a kind of Roman peace within industry, and a Roman predatory imperialism outside. People turned to the legislature for relief. They invoked representative government, founded on the image of the township farmer, to regulate the semi-sovereign corporations. The working class turned to labor organization. There followed a period of increasing centralization and a sort of race of armaments. The trusts interlocked, the craft unions federated and combined into a labor movement, the political system grew stronger at Washington and weaker in the states, as the reformers tried to match its strength against big business.</p>
<p class="normal3">在这一时期，几乎所有社会主义思想流派，从马克思主义左派到西奥多·罗斯福周围的新民族主义者，都将集中化视为演变的第一阶段，最终将导致政治国家吸收所有半主权商业权力。除了战争期间的几个月外，这种演变从未发生。这已经足够了，并且转向了反对杂食国家，支持几种新形式的多元化。但这一次，社会将回归的不是亚当·斯密的经济人和托马斯·杰斐逊的农民的原子个人主义，而是一种自愿团体的分子个人主义。</p><p class="normal3">In this period practically all the schools of socialist thought from the Marxian left to the New Nationalists around Theodore Roosevelt, looked upon centralization as the first stage of an evolution which would end in the absorption of all the semi-sovereign powers of business by the political state. The evolution never took place, except for a few months during the war. That was enough, and there was a turn of the wheel against the omnivorous state in favor of several new forms of pluralism. But this time society was to swing back not to the atomic individualism of Adam Smith's economic man and Thomas Jefferson's farmer, but to a sort of molecular individualism of voluntary groups.</p>
<p class="normal3">所有这些理论摇摆不定的有趣之处之一在于，它们都承诺一个没有人为了生存而必须遵循马基雅维利的世界。它们都是通过某种形式的强制手段建立起来的，它们都为了维持自身而实施强制手段，它们都因强制手段而被抛弃。然而，它们并不接受强制手段，无论是物质力量还是特殊地位、赞助或特权，作为其理想的一部分。个人主义者说，自我启蒙的利己主义将带来内部和外部的和平。社会主义者确信侵略动机将会消失。新多元主义者希望它们会消失。除了马基雅维利主义，强制手段在几乎所有社会理论中都是无稽之谈。由于强制手段荒谬、不可言说且难以控制，任何试图使人类生活合理化的人都会受到忽视强制手段的诱惑。</p><p class="normal3">One of the interesting things about all these oscillations of theory is that each in turn promises a world in which no one will have to follow Machiavelli in order to survive. They are all established by some form of coercion, they all exercise coercion in order to maintain themselves, and they are all discarded as a result of coercion. Yet they do not accept coercion, either physical power or special position, patronage, or privilege, as part of their ideal. The individualist said that self-enlightened self-interest would bring internal and external peace. The socialist is sure that the motives to aggression will disappear. The new pluralist hopes they will. Coercion is the surd in almost all social theory, except the Machiavellian. The temptation to ignore it, because it is absurd, inexpressible, and unmanageable, becomes overwhelming in any man who is trying to rationalize human life.</p>

<p class="normal3">聪明人有时会不择手段地逃避对武力作用的充分认识，这一点在 GDH Cole 先生的《基尔特社会主义》一书中有所体现。他说，现在的国家“主要是一种强制手段”；在基尔特社会主义社会中，虽然会有一个协调机构，但不会存在主权。他称这个机构为公社。</p><p class="normal3">The lengths to which a clever man will sometimes go in order to escape a full recognition of the role of force is shown by Mr. G. D. H. Cole's book on Guild Socialism. The present state, he says, "is primarily an instrument of coercion;" in a guild socialist society there will be no sovereign power, though there will be a coordinating body. He calls this body the Commune.</p>
<p class="normal3">然后他开始列举公社的权力，我们记得，公社主要不是强制手段。它解决价格纠纷。有时它确定价格，分配盈余或分摊损失。它分配自然资源，控制信贷发行。它还“分配公共劳动力”。它批准行会和公务员的预算。它征税。“所有收入问题”都属于它的管辖范围。它“分配”收入给社区的非生产成员。它是行会之间所有政策和管辖权问题的最终仲裁者。它通过宪法法律确定职能机构的职能。它任命法官。它赋予行会强制权力，并在涉及强制的地方批准其章程。它宣战和缔结和平。它控制武装部队。它是国家在国外的最高代表。它解决民族国家内部的边界问题。它建立新的职能机构，或将新的职能分配给旧机构。它管理警察。它制定一切必要的法律来规范个人行为和个人财产。</p><p class="normal3">He then begins to enumerate the powers of the Commune, which, we recall, is to be primarily not an instrument of coercion. It settles price disputes. Sometimes it fixes prices, allocates the surplus or distributes the loss. It allocates natural resources, and controls the issue of credit. It also "allocates communal labor-power." It ratifies the budgets of the guilds and the civil services. It levies taxes. "All questions of income" fall within its jurisdiction. It "allocates" income to the non-productive members of the community. It is the final arbiter in all questions of policy and jurisdiction between the guilds. It passes constitutional laws fixing the functions of the functional bodies. It appoints the judges. It confers coercive powers upon the guilds, and ratifies their by-laws wherever these involve coercion. It declares war and makes peace. It controls the armed forces. It is the supreme representative of the nation abroad. It settles boundary questions within the national state. It calls into existence new functional bodies, or distributes new functions to old ones. It runs the police. It makes whatever laws are necessary to regulate personal conduct and personal property.</p>
<p class="normal3">这些权力不是由一个公社行使的，而是由地方和省级公社组成的联邦结构行使的，最高层是全国公社。当然，科尔先生可以坚持认为这不是一个主权国家，但如果现在任何现代政府都享有强制权力，而他却忘记为之留出空间，我想不出还有什么。</p><p class="normal3">These powers are exercised not by one commune, but by a federal structure of local and provincial communes with a National commune at the top. Mr. Cole is, of course, welcome to insist that this is not a sovereign state, but if there is a coercive power now enjoyed by any modern government for which he has forgotten to make room, I cannot think of it.</p>
<p class="normal3">然而，他告诉我们，行会社会将是非强制性的：“我们希望建立一个新社会，其精神不是强制，而是免费服务。”因此，与大多数男人和女人一样，所有怀有这种希望的人都会仔细研究行会社会主义计划中的内容，该计划承诺将强制减少到最低限度，尽管今天的行会成员已经为他们的公社保留了最广泛的强制权力。人们立即承认，新社会不能通过普遍同意而建立。科尔先生太诚实了，不会逃避实现过渡所需的武力因素。虽然他显然无法预测可能会发生多少内战，但他很清楚，工会必须采取一段直接行动。</p><p class="normal3">He tells us, however, that Guild society will be non-coercive: "we want to build a new society which will be conceived in the spirit, not of coercion, but of free service." Everyone who shares that hope, as most men and women do, will therefore look closely to see what there is in the Guild Socialist plan which promises to reduce coercion to its lowest limits, even though the Guildsmen of to-day have already reserved for their communes the widest kind of coercive power. It is acknowledged at once that the new society cannot be brought into existence by universal consent. Mr. Cole is too honest to shirk the element of force required to make the transition. And while obviously he cannot predict how much civil war there might be, he is quite clear that there would have to be a period of direct action by the trade unions.</p>

<p class="normal3">但是，抛开过渡问题，抛开对未来行动的影响，当人们一路闯进应许之地时，让我们想象一下行会社会的存在。是什么让它作为一个非强制性的社会运行？</p><p class="normal3">But leaving aside the problems of transition, and any consideration of what the effect is on their future action, when men have hacked their way through to the promised land, let us imagine the Guild Society in being. What keeps it running as a non-coercive society?</p>
<p class="normal3">科尔先生对这个问题有两个答案。一个是正统的马克思主义答案，即废除资本主义财产将消除侵略动机。但他并不真的相信这一点，因为如果他相信，他就不会像普通马克思主义者一样关心工人阶级在掌握政权后如何管理政府。如果他的诊断是正确的，马克思主义者就完全正确了：如果疾病是资本家阶级，而且只是资本家阶级，那么在其灭绝之后，救赎自然就会到​​来。但科尔先生非常关心革命后的社会是由国家集体主义、行会或合作社、民主议会还是职能代表来管理。事实上，行会社会主义作为一种新的代议制政府理论引起了人们的关注。</p><p class="normal3">Mr. Cole has two answers to this question. One is the orthodox Marxian answer that the abolition of capitalist property will remove the motive to aggression. Yet he does not really believe that, because if he did, he would care as little as does the average Marxian how the working class is to run the government, once it is in control. If his diagnosis were correct, the Marxian would be quite right: if the disease were the capitalist class and only the capitalist class, salvation would automatically follow its extinction. But Mr. Cole is enormously concerned about whether the society which follows the revolution is to be run by state collectivism, by guilds or cooperative societies, by a democratic parliament or by functional representation. In fact, it is as a new theory of representative government that guild socialism challenges attention.</p>
<p class="normal3">行会成员并不指望资本主义财产权的消失会带来奇迹。他们确实期望，当然这是完全正确的，如果收入平等成为常态，社会关系将发生深刻变化。但据我所知，他们在这方面与正统的俄罗斯共产主义者不同：共产主义者提议通过无产阶级专政的力量建立平等，认为一旦人们在收入和服务上都平等了，他们就会失去侵略的动机。行会成员也提议通过武力建立平等，但他们足够精明，看到如果要维持平衡，他们必须提供维持平衡的机构。因此，行会成员相信他们所相信的是一种新的民主理论。</p><p class="normal3">The guildsmen do not expect a miracle to result from the disappearance of capitalist property rights. They do expect, and of course quite rightly, that if equality of income were the rule, social relations would be profoundly altered. But they differ, as far as I can make out, from the orthodox Russian communist in this respect: The communist proposes to establish equality by force of the dictatorship of the proletariat, believing that if once people were equalized both in income and in service, they would then lose the incentives to aggression. The guildsmen also propose to establish equality by force, but are shrewd enough to see that if an equilibrium is to be maintained they have to provide institutions for maintaining it. Guildsmen, therefore, put their faith in what they believe to be a new theory of democracy.</p>
<p class="normal3">科尔先生说，他们的目标是“使机制正确，并尽可能地调整它以表达人们的社会意愿”。这些意愿需要在“任何形式的社会行动”中通过自治获得自我表达的机会。这些话背后是真正的民主冲动，是提高人类尊严的愿望，以及传统的假设，即除非每个人的意志都参与到影响他的一切事务的管理中，否则这种人类尊严就会受到损害。因此，行会成员和早期的民主人士一样，都在寻找一个可以实现这种自治理想的环境。自卢梭和杰斐逊以来已经过去了一百多年，关注的中心已经从乡村转移到了城市。新民主主义者不能再从理想化的乡村小镇寻找民主的形象。他现在转向了车间。 “联合精神必须在最能体现的领域中得到自由发挥。这显然是工厂，因为人们有一起工作的习惯和传统。工厂是工业民主的自然和基本单位。这不仅意味着工厂必须尽可能自由地管理自己的事务，还意味着工厂的民主单位必须成为行会更大民主的基础，行会管理和政府的较大机构必须主要以工厂代表制原则为基础。”</p><p class="normal3">Their object, says Mr. Cole, is "to get the mechanism right, and to adjust it as far as possible to the expression of men's social wills." These wills need to be given opportunity for self-expression in self-government "in any and every form of social action." Behind these words is the true democratic impulse, the desire to enhance human dignity, as well as the traditional assumption that this human dignity is impugned, unless each person's will enters into the management of everything that affects him. The guildsman, like the earlier democrat therefore, looks about him for an environment in which this ideal of self-government can be realized. A hundred years and more have passed since Rousseau and Jefferson, and the center of interest has shifted from the country to the city. The new democrat can no longer turn to the idealized rural township for the image of democracy. He turns now to the workshop. "The spirit of association must be given free play in the sphere in which it is best able to find expression. This is manifestly the factory, in which men have the habit and tradition of working together. The factory is the natural and fundamental unit of industrial democracy. This involves, not only that the factory must be free, as far as possible, to manage its own affairs, but also that the democratic unit of the factory must be made the basis of the larger democracy of the Guild, and that the larger organs of Guild administration and government must be based largely on the principle of factory representation."</p>
<p class="normal3">当然，工厂是一个非常宽泛的词，科尔先生要求我们将其理解为矿山、造船厂、码头、车站和每个“自然生产中心”的地方。但从这个意义上讲，工厂与工业完全不同。科尔先生认为，工厂是一个人们真正进行个人接触的工作场所，一个足够小的环境，所有工人都可以直接了解。“如果要实现这种民主，就必须深入工会的每一个成员，并由他们直接行使民主。”这一点很重要，因为科尔先生和杰斐逊一样，都在寻求一个自然的政府单位。唯一自然的单位是一个完全熟悉的环境。现在，一个大型工厂、一个铁路系统、一个大型煤田，都不是这个意义上的自然单位。除非它是一个非常小的工厂，否则科尔先生真正考虑的是车间。在那里，人们可以被认为有“一起工作的习惯和传统”。工厂的其余部分、行业的其余部分都是推断的环境。</p><p class="normal3">Factory is, of course, a very loose word, and Mr. Cole asks us to take it as meaning mines, shipyards, docks, stations, and every place which is "a natural center of production." But a factory in this sense is quite a different thing from an industry. The factory, as Mr. Cole conceives it, is a work place where men are really in personal contact, an environment small enough to be known directly to all the workers. "This democracy if it is to be real, must come home to, and be exercisable directly by, every individual member of the Guild." This is important, because Mr. Cole, like Jefferson, is seeking a natural unit of government. The only natural unit is a perfectly familiar environment. Now a large plant, a railway system, a great coal field, is not a natural unit in this sense. Unless it is a very small factory indeed, what Mr. Cole is really thinking about is the shop. That is where men can be supposed to have "the habit and tradition of working together." The rest of the plant, the rest of the industry, is an inferred environment.</p>

<p class="normal3">任何人都可以看到，而且几乎每个人都会承认，纯粹的车间内部事务的自治是“一目了然”的事务管理。但是，关于车间内部事务的构成，会出现争议。显然，最大的利益，如工资、生产标准、采购物资、产品营销、更大的工作规划，绝不是纯粹的内部利益。车间民主有自由，但受到来自外部的巨大限制条件。它可以在一定程度上处理车间的工作安排，它可以处理个人的脾气和性情，它可以执行琐碎的工业正义，并在较大的个人纠纷中充当初审法庭。最重要的是，它可以作为一个单位来处理其他车间，甚至整个工厂。但孤立是不可能的。工业民主的单位完全卷入了外交事务。正是对这些外部关系的管理构成了行会社会主义理论的检验标准。</p><p class="normal3">Anybody can see, and almost everybody will admit, that self-government in the purely internal affairs of the shop is government of affairs that "can be taken in at a single view." But dispute would arise as to what constitute the internal affairs of a shop. Obviously the biggest interests, like wages, standards of production, the purchase of supplies, the marketing of the product, the larger planning of work, are by no means purely internal. The shop democracy has freedom, subject to enormous limiting conditions from the outside. It can deal to a certain extent with the arrangement of work laid out for the shop, it can deal with the temper and temperament of individuals, it can administer petty industrial justice, and act as a court of first instance in somewhat larger individual disputes. Above all it can act as a unit in dealing with other shops, and perhaps with the plant as a whole. But isolation is impossible. The unit of industrial democracy is thoroughly entangled in foreign affairs. And it is the management of these external relations that constitutes the test of the guild socialist theory.</p>
<p class="normal3">这些工厂必须由代议制政府管理，代议制政府按照联邦的顺序从车间到工厂，从工厂到行业，从行业到国家，中间由地区代表组成。但所有这些结构都源于车间，车间的所有独特优点都归因于车间。科尔先生断言，选择最终“协调”和“管理”车间的代表的代表是由真正的民主选举产生的。由于他们最初来自自治单位，整个联邦机构将受到自治精神和现实的启发。代表们将致力于实现工人“自己理解的实际意愿”，即车间个人所理解的意愿。</p><p class="normal3">They have to be managed by representative government arranged in a federal order from the shop to the plant, the plant to the industry, the industry to the nation, with intervening regional grouping of representatives. But all this structure derives from the shop, and all its peculiar virtues are ascribed to this source. The representatives who choose the representatives who choose the representatives who finally "coordinate" and "regulate" the shops are elected, Mr. Cole asserts, by a true democracy. Because they come originally from a self-governing unit, the whole federal organism will be inspired by the spirit and the reality of self-government. Representatives will aim to carry out the workers' "actual will as understood by themselves," that is, as understood by the individual in the shops.</p>
<p class="normal3">如果历史可以作为参考，那么一个完全按照这一原则运行的政府要么是永无休止的争论，要么是车间争斗的混乱局面。因为虽然车间工人可以对车间内部的事务有真正的看法，但他对该车间与工厂、行业和国家的关系的“意愿”却受到其他任何以自我为中心的意见所受到的所有限制，包括访问、刻板印象和自身利益。他在车间的经验充其量只能引起他整体的关注。他可以通过直接了解基本事实来获得对车间内部正确的看法。如果他对看不见的复杂环境中正确的看法是从单个车间的经验中概括出来的，那么他很可能是错误的。根据经验，行会代表会发现，就像今天的高级工会官员发现的那样，在他们必须决定的大量问题上，车间并没有“实际的意愿”。</p><p class="normal3">A government run literally on this principle would, if history is any guide, be either a perpetual logroll, or a chaos of warring shops. For while the worker in the shop can have a real opinion about matters entirely within the shop, his "will" about the relation of that shop to the plant, the industry, and the nation is subject to all the limitations of access, stereotype, and self-interest that surround any other self-centered opinion. His experience in the shop at best brings only aspects of the whole to his attention. His opinion of what is right within the shop he can reach by direct knowledge of the essential facts. His opinion of what is right in the great complicated environment out of sight is more likely to be wrong than right if it is a generalization from the experience of the individual shop. As a matter of experience, the representatives of a guild society would find, just as the higher trade union officials find today, that on a great number of questions which they have to decide there is no "actual will as understood" by the shops.</p>

<p class="normal3">然而，行会成员坚持认为，这种批评是盲目的，因为它忽略了一个伟大的政治发现。他们会说，你可能完全正确，认为商店的代表必须对商店没有意见的许多问题做出自己的决定。但你只是陷入了一个古老的谬论：你在寻找某个人来代表一群人。他是找不到的。唯一可能的代表是代表“某些特定职能”的人，因此每个人都必须帮助选择尽可能多的代表，“因为要执行的职能不同，基本职能也不同”。</p><p class="normal3">The guildsmen insist, however, that such criticism is blind because it ignores a great political discovery. You may be quite right, they would say, in thinking that the representatives of the shops would have to make up their own minds on many questions about which the shops have no opinion. But you are simply entangled in an ancient fallacy: you are looking for somebody to represent a group of people. He cannot be found. The only representative possible is one who acts for "some particular function," and therefore each person must help choose as many representatives "as there are distinct essential groups of functions to be performed."</p>
<p class="normal3">那么假设代表们不是代表车间工人发言，而是代表工人感兴趣的某些职能发言。请注意，如果他们不按照小组的意愿执行小组所理解的职能，他们就是不忠诚的。这些职能代表会面。他们的工作是协调和监管。假设车间之间存在意见冲突，那么每个人以什​​么标准来判断对方的提议，因为如果没有意见冲突，就没有必要进行协调和监管？</p><p class="normal3">Assume then that the representatives speak, not for the men in the shops, but for certain functions in which the men are interested. They are, mind you, disloyal if they do not carry out the will of the group about the function, as understood by the group. These functional representatives meet. Their business is to coordinate and regulate. By what standard does each judge the proposals of the other, assuming, as we must, that there is conflict of opinion between the shops, since if there were not, there would be no need to coordinate and regulate?</p>
<p class="normal3">现在，功能性民主的独特美德被认为是人们根据自己的利益坦诚投票，而人们认为他们从日常经验中知道这一点。他们可以在自给自足的团体内做到这一点。但在对外关系中，整个团体或其代表正在处理超越直接经验的问题。商店不会自发地对整个情况形成看法。因此，商店对其在行业和社会中的权利和义务的公众意见是教育或宣传的问题，而不是商店意识的自动产物。无论行会成员选举代表还是代表，他们都无法摆脱正统民主的问题。无论是整个团体还是当选的发言人，都必须将他的思维拓展到直接经验的范围之外。他必须对来自其他商店的问题以及来自整个行业边界之外的问题进行投票。商店的主要利益甚至不涵盖整个工业行业的职能。职业、大行业、地区、国家的功能是一种概念，而不是一种经验，需要想象、发明、教授和相信。即使你尽可能谨慎地定义功能，一旦你承认每个商店对该功能的看法不一定与其他商店的看法一致，你就是说一个利益集团的代表关心其他利益集团提出的建议。你是说他必须有共同的利益。投票给他，你选择的这个人不仅代表你对你的功能的看法，这是你第一手了解的全部，而且代表你对其他人对该功能的看法的看法。你的投票和正统民主党人一样不确定。</p><p class="normal3">Now the peculiar virtue of functional democracy is supposed to be that men vote candidly according to their own interests, which it is assumed they know by daily experience. They can do that within the self-contained group. But in its external relations the group as a whole, or its representative, is dealing with matters that transcend immediate experience. The shop does not arrive spontaneously at a view of the whole situation. Therefore, the public opinions of a shop about its rights and duties in the industry and in society, are matters of education or propaganda, not the automatic product of shop-consciousness. Whether the guildsmen elect a delegate, or a representative, they do not escape the problem of the orthodox democrat. Either the group as a whole, or the elected spokesman, must stretch his mind beyond the limits of direct experience. He must vote on questions coming up from other shops, and on matters coming from beyond the frontiers of the whole industry. The primary interest of the shop does not even cover the function of a whole industrial vocation. The function of a vocation, a great industry, a district, a nation is a concept, not an experience, and has to be imagined, invented, taught and believed. And even though you define function as carefully as possible, once you admit that the view of each shop on that function will not necessarily coincide with the view of other shops, you are saying that the representative of one interest is concerned in the proposals made by other interests. You are saying that he must conceive a common interest. And in voting for him you are choosing a man who will not simply represent your view of your function, which is all that you know at first hand, but a man who will represent your views about other people's views of that function. You are voting as indefinitely as the orthodox democrat.</p>

<p class="normal3">行会成员在自己的头脑中通过玩弄“功能”一词解决了如何构想共同利益的问题。他们想象一个社会，在这个社会中，世界上所有的主要工作都被分析为功能，而这些功能又和谐地综合起来。他们假设整个社会的目的基本一致，每个有组织的团体在实现这些目的方面的作用基本一致。因此，这是一种美好的情感，促使他们从一个天主教封建社会中兴起的机构中取名他们的理论。但他们应该记住，那个时代的智者所假设的功能方案不是由凡人制定的。目前尚不清楚行会成员认为该方案将如何制定并在现代世界中被接受。有时他们似乎认为该方案将从工会组织发展而来，有时他们则认为公社将定义团体的宪法功能。但他们是否相信团体定义自己的功能，在实际中会产生相当大的差异。</p><p class="normal3">The guildsmen in their own minds have solved the question of how to conceive a common interest by playing with the word function. They imagine a society in which all the main work of the world has been analysed into functions, and these functions in turn synthesized harmoniously. They suppose essential agreement about the purposes of society as a whole, and essential agreement about the role of every organized group in carrying out those purposes. It was a nice sentiment, therefore, which led them to take the name of their theory from an institution that arose in a Catholic feudal society. But they should remember that the scheme of function which the wise men of that age assumed was not worked out by mortal man. It is unclear how the guildsmen think the scheme is going to be worked out and made acceptable in the modern world. Sometimes they seem to argue that the scheme will develop from trade union organization, at other times that the communes will define the constitutional function of the groups. But it makes a considerable practical difference whether they believe that the groups define their own functions or not.</p>
<p class="normal3">无论如何，科尔先生认为，社会可以通过基于“不同的基本功能组”这一公认理念的社会契约来运作。如何识别这些不同的基本功能组？据我所知，科尔先生认为，功能是一群人感兴趣的事情。“功能民主的本质是，一个人应该考虑他感兴趣的功能。”现在，感兴趣这个词至少有两个含义。你可以用它来表示一个人参与其中，或者他的思想被占据。例如，约翰·史密斯可能对斯蒂尔曼离婚案非常感兴趣。他可能读过龙虾版的每一个新闻字。另一方面，年轻的盖伊·斯蒂尔曼的合法性受到威胁，可能根本不会费心。约翰·史密斯对一场不影响他“利益”的诉讼感兴趣，而盖伊对一场决定他整个人生历程的诉讼不感兴趣。恐怕科尔先生更倾向于约翰·史密斯。他正在回答一个“非常愚蠢的反对意见”，即按职能投票就是经常投票：“如果一个人对投票没有足够的兴趣，并且无法激起足够的兴趣来让他对十几个不同的问题进行投票，那么他就放弃了投票权，其结果并不比他盲目和毫无兴趣地投票更不民主。”</p><p class="normal3">In either case, Mr. Cole assumes that society can be carried on by a social contract based on an accepted idea of "distinct essential groups of functions." How does one recognize these distinct essential groups? So far as I can make out, Mr. Cole thinks that a function is what a group of people are interested in. "The essence of functional democracy is that a man should count as many times over as there are functions in which he is interested." Now there are at least two meanings to the word interested. You can use it to mean that a man is involved, or that his mind is occupied. John Smith, for example, may have been tremendously interested in the Stillman divorce case. He may have read every word of the news in every lobster edition. On the other hand, young Guy Stillman, whose legitimacy was at stake, probably did not trouble himself at all. John Smith was interested in a suit that did not affect his "interests," and Guy was uninterested in one that would determine the whole course of his life. Mr. Cole, I am afraid, leans towards John Smith. He is answering the "very foolish objection" that to vote by functions is to be voting very often: "If a man is not interested enough to vote, and cannot be aroused to interest enough to make him vote, on, say, a dozen distinct subjects, he waives his right to vote and the result is no less democratic than if he voted blindly and without interest."</p>
<p class="normal3">科尔先生认为，未受过教育的选民“放弃了投票权”。由此可见，受过教育的选民的投票表明了他们的利益，他们的利益决定了职能。“因此，布朗、琼斯和罗宾逊必须拥有的不只是一票，而是与他们感兴趣的需要联合行动的问题一样多的不同职能投票。”我非常怀疑科尔先生是否认为布朗、琼斯和罗宾逊应该有资格参加他们声称感兴趣的任何选举，或者是否认为没有透露姓名的其他人选择了他们有权感兴趣的职能。如果有人让我说出我认为科尔先生的想法，我会说他已经通过一个非常奇怪的假设来消除困难，即未受过教育的选民放弃了他的投票权；并得出结论：无论功能性投票是由更高权力安排的，还是“自下而上”安排的，原则是当一个人有兴趣时可以投票，只有受指示的人才会投票，因此该制度才会发挥作用。</p><p class="normal3">Mr. Cole thinks that the uninstructed voter "waives his right to vote." From this it follows that the votes of the instructed reveal their interest, and their interest defines the function. "Brown, Jones, and Robinson must therefore have, not one vote each, but as many different functional votes as there are different questions calling for associative action in which they are interested." I am considerably in doubt whether Mr. Cole thinks that Brown, Jones and Robinson should qualify in any election where they assert that they are interested, or that somebody else, not named, picks the functions in which they are entitled to be interested. If I were asked to say what I believe Mr. Cole thinks, it would be that he has smoothed over the difficulty by the enormously strange assumption that it is the uninstructed voter who waives his right to vote; and has concluded that whether functional voting is arranged by a higher power, or "from below" on the principle that a man may vote when it interests him to vote, only the instructed will be voting anyway, and therefore the institution will work.</p>
<p class="normal3">但是，有两种没有受过教育的选民。一种人不知道，但知道自己不知道。他通常是一个开明的人。他是放弃投票权的人。但也有一种人没有受过教育，不知道自己受过教育，也不在乎。如果政党机器运转正常，他总是可以被带到投票站。他的选票是机器的基础。而且，由于行会社会的公社对税收、工资、价格、信贷和自然资源拥有巨大的权力，因此，假设选举不会像我们自己的选举一样激烈，那将是荒谬的。</p><p class="normal3">But there are two kinds of uninstructed voter. There is the man who does not know and knows that he does not know. He is generally an enlightened person. He is the man who waives his right to vote. But there is also the man who is uninstructed and does not know that he is, or care. He can always be gotten to the polls, if the party machinery is working. His vote is the basis of the machine. And since the communes of the guild society have large powers over taxation, wages, prices, credit, and natural resources, it would be preposterous to assume that elections will not be fought at least as passionately as our own.</p>
<p class="normal3">人们展现兴趣的方式不会界定一个功能性社会的功能。还有另外两种定义功能的方式。一种是工会，他们为建立行会社会主义而奋斗。这样的斗争将使一群人团结在一起，形成某种功能性关系，这些群体将成为行会社会主义社会的既得利益者。其中一些人，如矿工和铁路工人，会非常强大，可能深深地执着于他们从与资本主义的斗争中学到的关于他们功能的观点。在社会主义国家下，某些处于有利地位的工会成为凝聚力和政府的中心，这并非不可能。但行会社会不可避免地会发现他们是一个难以处理的问题，因为直接行动会暴露他们的战略力量，至少他们的一些领导人不会轻易地在自由的祭坛上献出这种力量。为了“协调”他们，行会社会必须集中力量，而且我认为，很快人们就会发现，行会社会主义下的激进分子会要求建立足够强大的公社来定义行会的职能。</p><p class="normal3">The way people exhibit their interest will not then delimit the functions of a functional society. There are two other ways that function might be defined. One would be by the trade unions which fought the battle that brought guild socialism into being. Such a struggle would harden groups of men together in some sort of functional relation, and these groups would then become the vested interests of the guild socialist society. Some of them, like the miners and railroad men, would be very strong, and probably deeply attached to the view of their function which they learned from the battle with capitalism. It is not at all unlikely that certain favorably placed trade unions would under a socialist state become the center of coherence and government. But a guild society would inevitably find them a tough problem to deal with, for direct action would have revealed their strategic power, and some of their leaders at least would not offer up this power readily on the altar of freedom. In order to "coordinate" them, guild society would have to gather together its strength, and fairly soon one would find, I think, that the radicals under guild socialism would be asking for communes strong enough to define the functions of the guilds.</p>
<p class="normal3">但是，如果你要让政府（公社）定义职能，那么该理论的前提就不复存在了。它必须假设职能方案是显而易见的，以便凹形商店自愿与社会建立联系。如果每个选民的头脑中没有固定的职能方案，那么在行会社会主义下，他没有比在正统民主下更好的方法将以自我为中心的观点转化为社会判断。当然，不可能有这样的固定方案，因为即使科尔先生和他的朋友们设计了一个好的方案，所有权力都源于的商店民主也会根据他们所了解的情况和他们所能想象的情况来判断方案的运作情况。行会对同一方案的看法会有所不同。因此，在行会社会主义下，与其他地方一样，试图定义方案应该是什么，而不是方案是维持行会社会团结的骨架，而是政治的主要业务。如果我们可以允许科尔先生制定他的职能方案，我们几乎可以允许他做任何事情。不幸的是，他在他的前提中插入了他希望行会社会推论出的东西。</p><p class="normal3">But if you are going to have the government (commune) define functions, the premise of the theory disappears. It had to suppose that a scheme of functions was obvious in order that the concave shops would voluntarily relate themselves to society. If there is no settled scheme of functions in every voter's head, he has no better way under guild socialism than under orthodox democracy of turning a self-centered opinion into a social judgment. And, of course, there can be no such settled scheme, because, even if Mr. Cole and his friends devised a good one, the shop democracies from which all power derives, would judge the scheme in operation by what they learn of it and by what they can imagine. The guilds would see the same scheme differently. And so instead of the scheme being the skeleton that keeps guild society together, the attempt to define what the scheme ought to be, would be under guild socialism as elsewhere, the main business of politics. If we could allow Mr. Cole his scheme of functions we could allow him almost everything. Unfortunately he has inserted in his premise what he wishes a guild society to deduce.</p>

</p>
<p class="normal3">我认为，这个教训相当明显。由于缺乏制度和教育，公众无法如此成功地报道环境，以至于公众生活的现实与以自我为中心的观点截然相反，公共利益在很大程度上完全逃避了公众舆论，只能由一个专业阶层来管理，而这个阶层的个人利益超越了地方范围。这个阶层是不负责任的，因为它根据不属于公共财产的信息采取行动，在公众无法想象的情况下采取行动，而且只能根据既成事实来追究它的责任。</p><p class="normal3">THE lesson is, I think, a fairly clear one. In the absence of institutions and education by which the environment is so successfully reported that the realities of public life stand out sharply against self-centered opinion, the common interests very largely elude public opinion entirely, and can be managed only by a specialized class whose personal interests reach beyond the locality. This class is irresponsible, for it acts upon information that is not common property, in situations that the public at large does not conceive, and it can be held to account only on the accomplished fact.</p>
<p class="normal3">民主理论未能承认以自我为中心的观点不足以实现良好的政府，因此导致理论与实践之间永远存在冲突。根据该理论，人的充分尊严要求他的意志应该如科尔先生所说，在“任何形式的社会行动中”得到表达。人们认为，表达意志是人们强烈的激情，因为他们被认为本能地拥有治理的艺术。但从简单的经验来看，自决只是人类个性的众多利益之一。成为自己命运的主人是一种强烈的愿望，但它必须适应其他同样强烈的愿望，例如对美好生活、和平、减轻负担的愿望。在民主的最初假设中，人们认为每个人意志的表达不仅会自发地满足他对自我表达的渴望，还会满足他对美好生活的渴望，因为在美好生活中表达自我的本能是与生俱来的。</p><p class="normal3">The democratic theory by failing to admit that self-centered opinions are not sufficient to procure good government, is involved in perpetual conflict between theory and practice. According to the theory, the full dignity of man requires that his will should be, as Mr. Cole says, expressed "in any and every form of social action." It is supposed that the expression of their will is the consuming passion of men, for they are assumed to possess by instinct the art of government. But as a matter of plain experience, self-determination is only one of the many interests of a human personality. The desire to be the master of one's own destiny is a strong desire, but it has to adjust itself to other equally strong desires, such as the desire for a good life, for peace, for relief from burdens. In the original assumptions of democracy it was held that the expression of each man's will would spontaneously satisfy not only his desire for self-expression, but his desire for a good life, because the instinct to express one's self in a good life was innate.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，重点始终放在表达意愿的机制上。民主的黄金国一直都是某种完美的环境，某种完美的投票和代表制度，每个人天生的善意和本能的政治才能都可以转化为行动。在有限的地区和短暂的时期内，环境是如此有利，也就是说，环境是如此孤立，机会如此丰富，以至于该理论行之有效，足以让人们相信它适用于所有时间和地点。然后，当孤立结束，社会变得复杂，人们不得不紧密地相互适应时，民主主义者花时间试图设计更完美的投票单位，希望他能以某种方式，如科尔先生所说，“使机制正确，并尽可能地适应人们的社会意愿。”但是，当民主理论家忙于此事时，他远离了人性的实际利益。他只关注一种利益：自治。人类对其他各种事物都感兴趣，比如秩序、权利、繁荣、视觉和声音，以及不感到无聊。只要自发民主不能满足他们的其他兴趣，那么在大多数人看来，自发民主在大多数时候都是空洞的。因为成功的自治艺术不是本能的，所以人们不会长期渴望自治本身。他们渴望自治是为了结果。这就是为什么自治的冲动总是作为对恶劣条件的抗议而最强烈的原因。</p><p class="normal3">The emphasis, therefore, has always been on the mechanism for expressing the will. The democratic El Dorado has always been some perfect environment, and some perfect system of voting and representation, where the innate good will and instinctive statesmanship of every man could be translated into action. In limited areas and for brief periods the environment has been so favorable, that is to say so isolated, and so rich in opportunity, that the theory worked well enough to confirm men in thinking that it was sound for all time and everywhere. Then when the isolation ended, and society became complex, and men had to adjust themselves closely to one another, the democrat spent his time trying to devise more perfect units of voting, in the hope that somehow he would, as Mr. Cole says, "get the mechanism right, and adjust it as far as possible to men's social wills." But while the democratic theorist was busy at this, he was far away from the actual interests of human nature. He was absorbed by one interest: self-government. Mankind was interested in all kinds of other things, in order, in its rights, in prosperity, in sights and sounds and in not being bored. In so far as spontaneous democracy does not satisfy their other interests, it seems to most men most of the time to be an empty thing. Because the art of successful self-government is not instinctive, men do not long desire self-government for its own sake. They desire it for the sake of the results. That is why the impulse to self-government is always strongest as a protest against bad conditions.</p>
<p class="normal3">民主的谬误在于它关注政府的起源，而不是过程和结果。民主主义者一直认为，如果政治权力能够以正确的方式获得，那将是有益的。他的全部注意力都集中在权力的来源上，因为他被这样的信念所催眠：最重要的事情是表达人民的意愿，首先因为表达是人类的最高利益，其次因为意愿本能是善良的。但是，在河流的源头进行任何监管都无法完全控制其行为，而民主主义者一直专注于寻找一种产生社会权力的良好机制，即一种良好的投票和代表机制，他们几乎忽视了人类的其他所有利益。因为无论权力如何产生，关键利益在于权力如何行使。决定文明质量的是权力的使用。而权力的使用无法从源头控制。</p><p class="normal3">The democratic fallacy has been its preoccupation with the origin of government rather than with the processes and results. The democrat has always assumed that if political power could be derived in the right way, it would be beneficent. His whole attention has been on the source of power, since he is hypnotized by the belief that the great thing is to express the will of the people, first because expression is the highest interest of man, and second because the will is instinctively good. But no amount of regulation at the source of a river will completely control its behavior, and while democrats have been absorbed in trying to find a good mechanism for originating social power, that is to say a good mechanism of voting and representation, they neglected almost every other interest of men. For no matter how power originates, the crucial interest is in how power is exercised. What determines the quality of civilization is the use made of power. And that use cannot be controlled at the source.</p>
<p class="normal3">如果你试图从源头上完全控制政府，你不可避免地会让所有重要决定都变得不可见。因为没有本能会自动做出带来美好生活的政治决定，实际行使权力的人不仅无法表达人民的意愿，因为在大多数问题上不存在意愿，而且他们根据选民看不到的意见行使权力。</p><p class="normal3">If you try to control government wholly at the source, you inevitably make all the vital decisions invisible. For since there is no instinct which automatically makes political decisions that produce a good life, the men who actually exercise power not only fail to express the will of the people, because on most questions no will exists, but they exercise power according to opinions which are hidden from the electorate.</p>
<p class="normal3">那么，如果你从民主哲学中根除政府是本能的，因此政府可以通过以自我为中心的观点来管理的整个假设及其所有后果，那么民主对人的尊严的信仰又会变成什么样子呢？它通过将自己与整个人格联系起来，而不是与人格的微不足道的方面联系起来，获得了新的生命力。因为传统的民主主义者冒着失去人的尊严的风险，认为人会本能地在明智的法律和良好的政府中表现出这种尊严。选民们没有这样做，所以民主主义者总是被意志坚定的人看作是有点愚蠢的。但是，如果你不把人的尊严挂在关于自治的假设上，而是坚持认为人的尊严需要一种生活水平，在这种水平上，他的能力得到适当的发挥，整个问题就变了。那么，你用来衡量政府的标准是，它是否提供了最低限度的健康、体面的住房、物质必需品、教育、自由、快乐、美，而不仅仅是它是否在牺牲所有这些东西的情况下，与人们头脑中浮现的以自我为中心的观点产生共鸣。在这些标准能够做到准确和客观的程度上，政治决策（这必然是相对较少人关心的问题）实际上与人们的利益有关。</p><p class="normal3">If, then, you root out of the democratic philosophy the whole assumption in all its ramifications that government is instinctive, and that therefore it can be managed by self-centered opinions, what becomes of the democratic faith in the dignity of man? It takes a fresh lease of life by associating itself with the whole personality instead of with a meager aspect of it. For the traditional democrat risked the dignity of man on one very precarious assumption, that he would exhibit that dignity instinctively in wise laws and good government. Voters did not do that, and so the democrat was forever being made to look a little silly by tough-minded men. But if, instead of hanging human dignity on the one assumption about self-government, you insist that man's dignity requires a standard of living, in which his capacities are properly exercised, the whole problem changes. The criteria which you then apply to government are whether it is producing a certain minimum of health, of decent housing, of material necessities, of education, of freedom, of pleasures, of beauty, not simply whether at the sacrifice of all these things, it vibrates to the self-centered opinions that happen to be floating around in men's minds. In the degree to which these criteria can be made exact and objective, political decision, which is inevitably the concern of comparatively few people, is actually brought into relation with the interests of men.</p>
<p class="normal3">在我们能够想象的任何时候，都不可能出现这样的前景：整个无形环境对所有人都如此清晰，以至于他们会自发地对整个政府事务形成合理的公众意见。即使有这样的前景，我们中是否有很多人愿意为此烦恼，或者愿意花时间对影响我们的“任何形式的社会行动”形成意见，这也是非常值得怀疑的。唯一不切实际的前景是，我们每个人在自己的领域将越来越多地根据无形世界的现实图景采取行动，我们将培养出越来越多擅长保持这些图景现实的人。在我们自己可能关注的相当狭窄的范围之外，社会控制取决于制定生活标准和审计方法，以此来衡量政府官员和工业主管的行为。我们自己无法像神秘的民主人士一直想象的那样，激励或指导所有这些行为。但我们可以通过坚持要求所有行为都应被清楚地记录下来，并客观地衡量其结果，来稳步增加我们对这些行为的实际控制。也许我应该说，我们可以逐步坚持下去。因为制定此类标准和此类审计才刚刚开始。</p><p class="normal3">There is no prospect, in any time which we can conceive, that the whole invisible environment will be so clear to all men that they will spontaneously arrive at sound public opinions on the whole business of government. And even if there were a prospect, it is extremely doubtful whether many of us would wish to be bothered, or would take the time to form an opinion on "any and every form of social action" which affects us. The only prospect which is not visionary is that each of us in his own sphere will act more and more on a realistic picture of the invisible world, and that we shall develop more and more men who are expert in keeping these pictures realistic. Outside the rather narrow range of our own possible attention, social control depends upon devising standards of living and methods of audit by which the acts of public officials and industrial directors are measured. We cannot ourselves inspire or guide all these acts, as the mystical democrat has always imagined. But we can steadily increase our real control over these acts by insisting that all of them shall be plainly recorded, and their results objectively measured. I should say, perhaps, that we can progressively hope to insist. For the working out of such standards and of such audits has only begun.</p>

<p class="normal3">人们必须走出去研究世界才能治理世界，这种观念在政治思想中只占很小一部分。这种观念之所以能被忽略，是因为从亚里士多德时代到民主前提确立的时代，以任何对政府有用的方式报道世界的方法都没有取得太大的进步。</p><p class="normal3">THE idea that men have to go forth and study the world in order to govern it, has played a very minor part in political thought. It could figure very little, because the machinery for reporting the world in any way useful to government made comparatively little progress from the time of Aristotle to the age in which the premises of democracy were established.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，如果你问一位民主先驱，人民意志所依据的信息从何而来，他一定会对这个问题感到困惑。这听起来有点像你问他生命或灵魂从何而来。他几乎总是认为，人民意志始终存在；政治科学的职责是制定选票和代议制政府的发明。如果在适当的条件下，如在自给自足的村庄或自给自足的商店中，正确地制定和应用这些发明，这种机制就会以某种方式克服亚里士多德所观察到的注意力的短暂性，以及其范围的狭窄性，这是自给自足社区理论默认的。我们已经看到，即使在这个晚期，行会社会主义者仍然被这样一种观念所吸引：只要你能建立在正确的投票和代表单位上，一个复杂的合作联邦就有可能实现。</p><p class="normal3">Therefore, if you had asked a pioneer democrat where the information was to come from on which the will of the people was to be based, he would have been puzzled by the question. It would have seemed a little as if you had asked him where his life or his soul came from. The will of the people, he almost always assumed, exists at all times; the duty of political science was to work out the inventions of the ballot and representative government. If they were properly worked out and applied under the right conditions, such as exist in the self-contained village or the self-contained shop, the mechanism would somehow overcome the brevity of attention which Aristotle had observed, and the narrowness of its range, which the theory of a self-contained community tacitly acknowledged. We have seen how even at this late date the guild socialists are transfixed by the notion that if only you can build on the right unit of voting and representation, an intricate cooperative commonwealth is possible.</p>
<p class="normal3">民主党人坚信只要你能找到智慧，他们就一定有智慧，因此他们把公众舆论形成问题视为公民自由问题。“谁知道在自由开放的冲突中真理被贬低了？”假设没有人见过真理被贬低，那么我们是否应该相信真理是由冲突产生的，就像两根木棍摩擦生火一样？美国民主党人在其《权利法案》中体现了这一经典的自由主义学说，事实上，在这种学说背后，存在着几种关于真理起源的不同理论。一种是相信在意见竞争中，最真实的人会获胜，因为真理具有一种特殊的力量。如果让竞争持续足够长的时间，这种说法可能是正确的。当人们以这种方式争论时，他们想到的是历史的裁决，他们特别想到了异教徒在生前受到迫害，死后被奉为圣徒。弥尔顿提出的问题也基于这样一种信念：认识真理的能力是所有人与生俱来的，而自由传播的真理将赢得认可。它同样源于经验，经验表明，如果人们不能说出真理，他们就不可能发现真理，除非在一位不理解真相的警察的眼皮底下。</p><p class="normal3">Convinced that the wisdom was there if only you could find it, democrats have treated the problem of making public opinions as a problem in civil liberties. "Who ever knew Truth put to the worse, in a free and open encounter?" Supposing that no one has ever seen it put to the worse, are we to believe then that the truth is generated by the encounter, like fire by rubbing two sticks? Behind this classic doctrine of liberty, which American democrats embodied in their Bill of Rights, there are, in fact, several different theories of the origin of truth. One is a faith that in the competition of opinions, the truest will win because there is a peculiar strength in the truth. This is probably sound if you allow the competition to extend over a sufficiently long time. When men argue in this vein they have in mind the verdict of history, and they think specifically of heretics persecuted when they lived, canonized after they were dead. Milton's question rests also on a belief that the capacity to recognize truth is inherent in all men, and that truth freely put in circulation will win acceptance. It derives no less from the experience, which has shown that men are not likely to discover truth if they cannot speak it, except under the eye of an uncomprehending policeman.</p>
<p class="normal3">没有人会高估这些公民自由的实际价值，也没有人会高估维护这些自由的重要性。当这些自由受到威胁时，人类精神也会受到威胁，如果真的到了必须限制这些自由的时候，比如在战争期间，压制思想就会给文明带来危险，如果歇斯底里的人利用这种必要性，把战争的禁忌带入和平时期，文明就可能无法从战争的影响中恢复过来。幸运的是，大多数人都太宽容了，不会长时间地享受职业审判官的待遇，因为在那些不愿被恐吓的人的批评下，他们逐渐被揭露为心胸狭窄的生物，十分之九的时间里他们都不知道自己在说什么。</p><p class="normal3">No one can possibly overestimate the practical value of these civil liberties, nor the importance of maintaining them. When they are in jeopardy, the human spirit is in jeopardy, and should there come a time when they have to be curtailed, as during a war, the suppression of thought is a risk to civilization which might prevent its recovery from the effects of war, if the hysterics, who exploit the necessity, were numerous enough to carry over into peace the taboos of war. Fortunately, the mass of men is too tolerant long to enjoy the professional inquisitors, as gradually, under the criticism of men not willing to be terrorized, they are revealed as mean-spirited creatures who nine-tenths of the time do not know what they are talking about.</p>
<p class="normal3">但是，尽管公民自由具有根本重要性，但这种意义上的公民自由并不能保证现代世界的舆论。因为它总是假设，要么真理是自发的，要么在没有外部干扰的情况下存在获取真理的手段。但是当你面对一个看不见的环境时，这个假设就是错误的。关于遥远或复杂问题的真相并不是不言而喻的，而收集信息的机制是技术性的和昂贵的。然而，政治学，特别是民主政治学，从来没有充分摆脱亚里士多德政治学的原始假设，重新阐述其前提，以便政治思想能够解决如何让现代国家的公民看到看不见的世界的问题。</p><p class="normal3">But in spite of its fundamental importance, civil liberty in this sense does not guarantee public opinion in the modern world. For it always assumes, either that truth is spontaneous, or that the means of securing truth exist when there is no external interference. But when you are dealing with an invisible environment, the assumption is false. The truth about distant or complex matters is not self-evident, and the machinery for assembling information is technical and expensive. Yet political science, and especially democratic political science, has never freed itself from the original assumption of Aristotle's politics sufficiently to restate the premises, so that political thought might come to grips with the problem of how to make the invisible world visible to the citizens of a modern state.</p>
<p class="normal3">这种传统根深蒂固，直到最近，例如，我们的大学还在教授政治学，就好像报纸不存在一样。我指的不是新闻学院，因为它们是职业学校，旨在为男性和女性做好职业准备。我指的是面向未来的商人、律师、政府官员和广大公民的政治学。在那门科学中，对新闻界和大众信息来源的研究是没有地位的。这是一个奇怪的事实。对于任何不沉浸于政治学日常兴趣的人来说，几乎无法解释为什么没有一位美国政府学生、美国社会学家写过一本关于新闻采访的书。偶尔会提到新闻界，并声称新闻界不是，或者应该是“自由”和“真实的”。但我几乎找不到其他的。这种对专业人士的蔑视在公众舆论中找到了对应。普遍承认，新闻界是与看不见的环境接触的主要手段。几乎到处都有人认为，报刊应该自发地为我们做原始民主所想象的我们每个人都可以自发地为自己做的事情，即每天两次向我们呈现我们所感兴趣的整个外部世界的真实图景。</p><p class="normal3">So deep is the tradition, that until quite recently, for example, political science was taught in our colleges as if newspapers did not exist. I am not referring to schools of journalism, for they are trade schools, intended to prepare men and women for a career. I am referring to political science as expounded to future business men, lawyers, public officials, and citizens at large. In that science a study of the press and the sources of popular information found no place. It is a curious fact. To anyone not immersed in the routine interests of political science, it is almost inexplicable that no American student of government, no American sociologist, has ever written a book on news-gathering. There are occasional references to the press, and statements that it is not, or that it ought to be, "free" and "truthful." But I can find almost nothing else. And this disdain of the professionals finds its counterpart in public opinions. Universally it is admitted that the press is the chief means of contact with the unseen environment. And practically everywhere it is assumed that the press should do spontaneously for us what primitive democracy imagined each of us could do spontaneously for himself, that every day and twice a day it will present us with a true picture of all the outer world in which we are interested.</p>

</p>
<p class="normal3">这种坚持而古老的信念——真理不是挣来的，而是灵感的、启示的、无偿提供的——在我们作为报纸读者的经济偏见中表现得非常明显。我们期望报纸向我们提供真理，无论真理是多么无利可图。对于这种困难且往往危险的服务，我们认为它是根本，直到最近，我们仍期望支付铸币厂铸造的最小硬币。现在，我们已经习惯了在工作日支付两分甚至三分钱，而在星期天，为了一本插图百科全书和附带的杂耍娱乐节目，我们甚至不得不支付五分钱甚至一角钱。没有人会想一想他应该为他的报纸付钱。他期望真理的泉源会沸腾，但他不会签订任何涉及任何风险、成本或麻烦的法律或道德合同。他会在适合他的时候支付象征性的价格，在适合他的时候停止支付，在适合他的时候转向另一份报纸。有人说得非常对，报纸编辑每天都要重新选举。</p><p class="normal3">This insistent and ancient belief that truth is not earned, but inspired, revealed, supplied gratis, comes out very plainly in our economic prejudices as readers of newspapers. We expect the newspaper to serve us with truth however unprofitable the truth may be. For this difficult and often dangerous service, which we recognize as fundamental, we expected to pay until recently the smallest coin turned out by the mint. We have accustomed ourselves now to paying two and even three cents on weekdays, and on Sundays, for an illustrated encyclopedia and vaudeville entertainment attached, we have screwed ourselves up to paying a nickel or even a dime. Nobody thinks for a moment that he ought to pay for his newspaper. He expects the fountains of truth to bubble, but he enters into no contract, legal or moral, involving any risk, cost or trouble to himself. He will pay a nominal price when it suits him, will stop paying whenever it suits him, will turn to another paper when that suits him. Somebody has said quite aptly that the newspaper editor has to be re-elected every day.</p>
<p class="normal3">读者与报刊之间这种随意、片面的关系是我们文明的异常现象。没有其他事物能与之相比，因此很难将报刊与任何其他行业或机构进行比较。报刊并非纯粹的行业，部分原因是产品经常以低于成本的价格出售，但主要原因是社会对报刊采用一种道德标准，对贸易或制造业采用另一种道德标准。从道德上讲，报纸就像教堂或学校一样被评判。但如果你试图将报纸与教堂或学校进行比较，你就失败了；纳税人支付公立学校的费用，私立学校由学费资助，教堂则有补贴和募捐。你不能将新闻业与法律、医学或工程进行比较，因为在这些职业中，消费者都要为服务付费。如果以读者的态度来判断，自由媒体意味着报纸实际上是免费的。</p><p class="normal3">This casual and one-sided relationship between readers and press is an anomaly of our civilization. There is nothing else quite like it, and it is, therefore, hard to compare the press with any other business or institution. It is not a business pure and simple, partly because the product is regularly sold below cost, but chiefly because the community applies one ethical measure to the press and another to trade or manufacture. Ethically a newspaper is judged as if it were a church or a school. But if you try to compare it with these you fail; the taxpayer pays for the public school, the private school is endowed or supported by tuition fees, there are subsidies and collections for the church. You cannot compare journalism with law, medicine or engineering, for in every one of these professions the consumer pays for the service. A free press, if you judge by the attitude of the readers, means newspapers that are virtually given away.</p>
<p class="normal3">然而，批评报刊的人只是在表达社会的道德标准，而他们却希望这样的机构能够与学校、教堂和无私的职业处于同一水平。这再次说明了民主的凹面性。人们认为不需要人工获取信息。信息必须自然而然地出现，也就是说，免费，如果不是出自公民的内心，那么就是免费来自报纸。公民会为他的电话、他的火车票、他的汽车、他的娱乐付费。但他不会公开为他的新闻付费。</p><p class="normal3">Yet the critics of the press are merely voicing the moral standards of the community, when they expect such an institution to live on the same plane as that on which the school, the church, and the disinterested professions are supposed to live. This illustrates again the concave character of democracy. No need for artificially acquired information is felt to exist. The information must come naturally, that is to say gratis, if not out of the heart of the citizen, then gratis out of the newspaper. The citizen will pay for his telephone, his railroad rides, his motor car, his entertainment. But he does not pay openly for his news.</p>
<p class="normal3">然而，他会为让别人读到他的文章而付出高昂的代价。他会直接付钱做广告。他也会间接为别人的广告付费，因为这种付费隐藏在商品价格中，是他无法有效理解的隐形环境的一部分。公开支付一杯好冰淇淋的价格来购买全世界的新闻，会被视为一种侮辱，尽管公众在购买广告商品时会支付这么多甚至更多的费用。公众为媒体付费，但只有在付费是隐蔽的情况下。</p><p class="normal3">He will, however, pay handsomely for the privilege of having someone read about him. He will pay directly to advertise. And he will pay indirectly for the advertisements of other people, because that payment, being concealed in the price of commodities is part of an invisible environment that he does not effectively comprehend. It would be regarded as an outrage to have to pay openly the price of a good ice cream soda for all the news of the world, though the public will pay that and more when it buys the advertised commodities. The public pays for the press, but only when the payment is concealed.</p>

<p class="normal3">因此，发行量是达到目的的手段。只有当它能够卖给广告商时，它才成为一种资产，广告商通过间接向读者征税获得收入来购买它。广告商购买的发行量取决于他要卖什么。可能是“优质”的，也可能是“大众”的。总的来说，没有明显的分界线，因为对于大多数通过广告销售的商品而言，客户既不是极富的少数人，也不是极穷的人。他们是那些在基本生活必需品之外有足够的剩余，可以自行决定购买的人。因此，进入相当富裕家庭的报纸大体上是广告商最看好的。它也可能进入穷人家庭，但除了某些商品外，分析广告代理不会将这种发行量视为一项巨大的资产，除非像赫斯特先生的某些财产的情况那样，发行量巨大。</p><p class="normal3">Circulation is, therefore, the means to an end. It becomes an asset only when it can be sold to the advertiser, who buys it with revenues secured through indirect taxation of the reader. The kind of circulation which the advertiser will buy depends on what he has to sell. It may be "quality" or "mass." On the whole there is no sharp dividing line, for in respect to most commodities sold by advertising, the customers are neither the small class of the very rich nor the very poor. They are the people with enough surplus over bare necessities to exercise discretion in their buying. The paper, therefore, which goes into the homes of the fairly prosperous is by and large the one which offers most to the advertiser. It may also go into the homes of the poor, but except for certain lines of goods, an analytical advertising agent does not rate that circulation as a great asset, unless, as seems to be the case with certain of Mr. Hearst's properties, the circulation is enormous.</p>
<p class="normal3">如果报纸激怒了那些最希望通过广告接触到的读者，那么对于广告商来说，它就是一种糟糕的媒介。而且，由于没有人声称广告是慈善行为，广告商购买的刊物空间肯定会接触到他们的未来客户。人们不必花太多时间担心干货商未报道的丑闻。这些丑闻并不代表什么重大问题，而且这类事件并不像许多新闻批评家所认为的那样常见。真正的问题是，报纸的读者不习惯支付新闻采访的费用，他们只有将新闻转化为可以卖给制造商和商人的流通品才能从中获利。而最需要从中获利的是那些有最多钱可以花的人。这样的报业必然会尊重购买公众的观点。报纸就是为购买公众编辑和出版的，因为没有这种支持，报纸就无法生存。报纸可以藐视广告商，可以攻击强大的银行或牵引利益，但如果它疏远了购买公众，它就会失去其存在不可或缺的资产。</p><p class="normal3">A newspaper which angers those whom it pays best to reach through advertisements is a bad medium for an advertiser. And since no one ever claimed that advertising was philanthropy, advertisers buy space in those publications which are fairly certain to reach their future customers. One need not spend much time worrying about the unreported scandals of the dry-goods merchants. They represent nothing really significant, and incidents of this sort are less common than many critics of the press suppose. The real problem is that the readers of a newspaper, unaccustomed to paying the cost of newsgathering, can be capitalized only by turning them into circulation that can be sold to manufacturers and merchants. And those whom it is most important to capitalize are those who have the most money to spend. Such a press is bound to respect the point of view of the buying public. It is for this buying public that newspapers are edited and published, for without that support the newspaper cannot live. A newspaper can flout an advertiser, it can attack a powerful banking or traction interest, but if it alienates the buying public, it loses the one indispensable asset of its existence.</p>
<p class="normal3">前《纽约太阳晚报》记者约翰·L·吉文先生于 1914 年表示，在美国出版的 2300 多家日报中，约有 175 家在人口超过十万的城市出版。这些报纸构成了“综合新闻”的报刊。它们是收集重大事件新闻的主要报纸，甚至那些不读这 175 家报纸的人最终也依靠它们来了解外部世界的消息。因为它们组成了大型新闻协会，在新闻交流方面进行合作。因此，每个报刊不仅是自己读者的消息来源，也是其他城市报纸的本地记者。农村报刊和专业报刊大体上从这些主要报纸获取综合新闻。其中有些报纸比其他报纸丰富得多，因此，对于国际新闻，全国的整个报刊主要依靠新闻协会的报道和一些大都市日报的特别服务。</p><p class="normal3">Mr. John L. Given, formerly of the New York Evening Sun, stated in 1914 that out of over two thousand three hundred dailies published in the United States, there were about one hundred and seventy-five printed in cities having over one hundred thousand inhabitants. These constitute the press for "general news." They are the key papers which collect the news dealing with great events, and even the people who do not read any one of the one hundred and seventy-five depend ultimately upon them for news of the outer world. For they make up the great press associations which cooperate in the exchange of news. Each is, therefore, not only the informant of its own readers, but it is the local reporter for the newspapers of other cities. The rural press and the special press by and large, take their general news from these key papers. And among these there are some very much richer than others, so that for international news, in the main, the whole press of the nation may depend upon the reports of the press associations and the special services of a few metropolitan dailies.</p>
<p class="normal3">粗略地说，一般新闻采集的经济支撑来自十万以上人口的城市中较为富裕的地区为广告商品支付的价格。这些购买者由家庭成员组成，他们的收入主要来自贸易、商品销售、制造业指导和金融。他们是报纸广告最有利的客户群。他们拥有集中的购买力，其购买力可能比农民和工人的总购买力要小；但在日报覆盖的范围内，他们是最快速的资产。</p><p class="normal3">Roughly speaking, the economic support for general news gathering is in the price paid for advertised goods by the fairly prosperous sections of cities with more than one hundred thousand inhabitants. These buying publics are composed of the members of families, who depend for their income chiefly on trade, merchandising, the direction of manufacture, and finance. They are the clientele among whom it pays best to advertise in a newspaper. They wield a concentrated purchasing power, which may be less in volume than the aggregate for farmers and workingmen; but within the radius covered by a daily newspaper they are the quickest assets.</p>

<p class="normal3">此外，他们还有双重关注。他们不仅是广告商的最佳客户，他们本身也包括广告商。因此，报纸给公众留下的印象至关重要。幸运的是，公众意见并不统一。他们可能是“资本主义的”，但对资本主义是什么以及如何运作资本主义有不同的看法。除了在危险时期，这种可敬的观点存在足够的分歧，导致政策存在相当大的分歧。如果不是出版商本身通常都是这些城市社区的成员，并诚实地通过同事和朋友的视角看待世界，这些分歧会更大。</p><p class="normal3">They have, moreover, a double claim to attention. They are not only the best customers for the advertiser, they include the advertisers. Therefore the impression made by the newspapers on this public matters deeply. Fortunately this public is not unanimous. It may be "capitalistic" but it contains divergent views on what capitalism is, and how it is to be run. Except in times of danger, this respectable opinion is sufficiently divided to permit of considerable differences of policy. These would be greater still if it were not that publishers are themselves usually members of these urban communities, and honestly see the world through the lenses of their associates and friends.</p>
<p class="normal3">他们从事投机性业务，这种业务取决于总体贸易状况，更特别的是，这种业务的发行量不是基于与读者的婚姻契约，而是基于自由恋爱。因此，每个出版商的目标都是将自己的发行量从一群随意购买报摊商品的杂乱无章的买家转变为一群忠实的固定读者。考虑到现代新闻业的经济状况，一份真正能够依靠读者忠诚度的报纸是最独立的报纸。一群不离不弃的读者的力量比任何单个广告商所能拥有的力量都要强大，这种力量足以瓦解广告商联盟。因此，每当你发现一份报纸为了广告商而背叛读者时，你都可以相当肯定，要么出版商真诚地赞同广告商的观点，要么他认为，也许错误地认为，如果他公开抵制命令，就不能指望读者的支持。问题在于，读者不会为新闻支付现金，但会不会以忠诚度付费。</p><p class="normal3">They are engaged in a speculative business, which depends on the general condition of trade, and more peculiarly on a circulation based not on a marriage contract with their readers, but on free love. The object of every publisher is, therefore, to turn his circulation from a medley of catch-as-catch-can news stand buyers into a devoted band of constant readers. A newspaper that can really depend upon the loyalty of its readers is as independent as a newspaper can be, given the economics of modern journalism. A body of readers who stay by it through thick and thin is a power greater than any which the individual advertiser can wield, and a power great enough to break up a combination of advertisers. Therefore, whenever you find a newspaper betraying its readers for the sake of an advertiser, you can be fairly certain either that the publisher sincerely shares the views of the advertiser, or that he thinks, perhaps mistakenly, he cannot count upon the support of his readers if he openly resists dictation. It is a question of whether the readers, who do not pay in cash for their news, will pay for it in loyalty.</p>

<p class="normal3">任何契约都不会规定购买者对报纸的忠诚度。在几乎所有其他企业中，期望获得服务的人都会签订协议来控制他一时兴起的想法。至少他会为所获得的东西付钱。在期刊出版中，最接近确定时间协议的方式是付费订阅，而我认为这并不是大都市日报经济的一个重要因素。读者是他忠诚度的唯一和日常评判者，不能以违反承诺或不提供支持为由起诉他。</p><p class="normal3">THE loyalty of the buying public to a newspaper is not stipulated in any bond. In almost every other enterprise the person who expects to be served enters into an agreement that controls his passing whims. At least he pays for what he obtains. In the publishing of periodicals the nearest approach to an agreement for a definite time is the paid subscription, and that is not, I believe, a great factor in the economy of a metropolitan daily. The reader is the sole and the daily judge of his loyalty, and there can be no suit against him for breach of promise or nonsupport.</p>
<p class="normal3">虽然一切都取决于读者的恒心，但甚至没有一个模糊的传统来提醒读者这一事实。读者的恒心取决于他当时的感觉或习惯。而这些不仅取决于新闻的质量，而且更经常取决于一些模糊的因素，在我们与新闻界的随意关系中，我们几乎不费吹灰之力去意识到这些因素。其中最重要的是，我们每个人都倾向于通过报纸对我们认为自己参与的那部分新闻的处理来判断报纸，如果我们要判断的话。报纸涉及大量我们经验之外的事件。但它也涉及一些我们经验范围内的事件。我们最常通过它对这些事件的处理来决定喜欢它还是不喜欢它，信任它还是拒绝在家里拥有这份报纸。如果报纸对我们认为我们知道的事情，我们的业务、我们的教堂、我们的政党，给出了令人满意的报道，那么它几乎肯定不会受到我们的猛烈批评。除了报纸版本与早餐桌上的人自己的观点相符之外，还有什么更好的标准呢？因此，大多数人倾向于以他们自己的身份，而不是普通读者的身份，而是以他们自己经历的问题的特殊辩护人的身份，要求报纸承担最严格的责任。</p><p class="normal3">Though everything turns on the constancy of the reader, there does not exist even a vague tradition to call that fact to the reader's mind. His constancy depends on how he happens to feel, or on his habits. And these depend not simply on the quality of the news, but more often on a number of obscure elements that in our casual relation to the press, we hardly take the trouble to make conscious. The most important of these is that each of us tends to judge a newspaper, if we judge it at all, by its treatment of that part of the news in which we feel ourselves involved. The newspaper deals with a multitude of events beyond our experience. But it deals also with some events within our experience. And by its handling of those events we most frequently decide to like it or dislike it, to trust it or refuse to have the sheet in the house. If the newspaper gives a satisfactory account of that which we think we know, our business, our church, our party, it is fairly certain to be immune from violent criticism by us. What better criterion does the man at the breakfast table possess than that the newspaper version checks up with his own opinion? Therefore, most men tend to hold the newspaper most strictly accountable in their capacity, not of general readers, but of special pleaders on matters of their own experience.</p>
<p class="normal3">除了利益相关方，很少有人能够检验报道的准确性。如果是本地新闻，而且有竞争，编辑知道他可能会听到那些认为他的报道不公平和不准确的人的消息。但如果是非本地新闻，随着主题逐渐淡出，纠正力度就会减弱。唯一能够纠正他们认为是另一个城市刊登的虚假报道的人是那些组织良好、雇佣宣传人员的团体的成员。</p><p class="normal3">Rarely is anyone but the interested party able to test the accuracy of a report. If the news is local, and if there is competition, the editor knows that he will probably hear from the man who thinks his portrait unfair and inaccurate. But if the news is not local, the corrective diminishes as the subject matter recedes into the distance. The only people who can correct what they think is a false picture of themselves printed in another city are members of groups well enough organized to hire publicity men.</p>
<p class="normal3">现在，值得注意的是，如果报纸的一般读者认为自己被新闻误导，则在法律上没有立足之地。只有受害方才能以诽谤或诽谤罪起诉，并且他必须证明自己受到了实质性伤害。法律体现了这样的传统，即一般新闻不是公众关注的问题，除非是被模糊地描述为不道德或煽动性的内容。</p><p class="normal3">Now it is interesting to note that the general reader of a newspaper has no standing in law if he thinks he is being misled by the news. It is only the aggrieved party who can sue for slander or libel, and he has to prove a material injury to himself. The law embodies the tradition that general news is not a matter of common concern, except as to matter which is vaguely described as immoral or seditious.</p>
<p class="normal3">但是，尽管新闻主体整体上不受无私读者的审查，但其中的内容却包含一些读者有非常明确的先入之见的内容。这些内容是读者判断的数据，而人们在阅读新闻时，如果没有这种个人标准，他们会根据准确性标准以外的其他标准来判断。他们在这里处理的主题对他们来说与虚构难以区分。真理的准则无法适用。如果新闻符合他们的刻板印象，他们不会对它感到困惑，如果他们感兴趣，他们会继续阅读。</p><p class="normal3">But the body of the news, though unchecked as a whole by the disinterested reader, consists of items about which some readers have very definite preconceptions. Those items are the data of his judgment, and news which men read without this personal criterion, they judge by some other standard than their standard of accuracy. They are dealing here with a subject matter which to them is indistinguishable from fiction. The canon of truth cannot be applied. They do not boggle over such news if it conforms to their stereotypes, and they continue to read it if it interests them.</p>

<p class="normal3">甚至在大城市，有些报纸的编辑原则是读者希望阅读有关他们自己的信息。这种理论认为，如果足够多的人经常在报纸上看到自己的名字，可以阅读有关他们的婚礼、葬礼、社交活动、国外旅行、分会会议、学校奖项、他们的五十岁生日、六十岁生日、银婚、郊游和蛤蜊聚会的信息，那么这些报纸的发行量就会稳定。</p><p class="normal3">There are newspapers, even in large cities, edited on the principle that the readers wish to read about themselves. The theory is that if enough people see their own names in the paper often enough, can read about their weddings, funerals, sociables, foreign travels, lodge meetings, school prizes, their fiftieth birthdays, their sixtieth birthdays, their silver weddings, their outings and clambakes, they will make a reliable circulation.</p>
<p class="normal3">这种报纸的经典公式包含在 1860 年 4 月 3 日，贺拉斯·格里利 (Horace Greeley) 写给“朋友弗莱彻”的一封信中，当时弗莱彻正准备创办一份乡村报纸：</p><p class="normal3">The classic formula for such a newspaper is contained in a letter written by Horace Greeley on April 3, 1860, to "Friend Fletcher" who was about to start a country newspaper:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">“I. 首先要明确一个概念，即普通人最感兴趣的对象是自己；其次才是邻居。亚洲和通戈群岛在他眼中远远落后于这些……不要让新教堂的建立、现有教堂的扩充、农场的出售、新房子的建造、磨坊的开张、商店的开张，或任何引起十几个家庭兴趣的事情发生，而没有在专栏中及时、简短地记录这些事实。如果一个农民砍伐了一棵大树，或者种出了一种巨大的甜菜，或者收获了丰收的小麦或玉米，请尽可能简洁、毫无例外地陈述这些事实。”</p>
</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">"I. Begin with a clear conception that the subject of deepest interest to an average human being is himself; next to that he is most concerned about his neighbors. Asia and the Tongo Islands stand a long way after these in his regard…. Do not let a new church be organized, or new members be added to one already existing, a farm be sold, a new house raised, a mill set in motion, a store opened, nor anything of interest to a dozen families occur, without having the fact duly, though briefly, chronicled in your columns. If a farmer cuts a big tree, or grows a mammoth beet, or harvests a bounteous yield of wheat or corn, set forth the fact as concisely and unexceptionally as possible."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="normal3">正如李先生所说，成为“家乡的印刷日记”这一功能是每一份报纸无论在哪里出版都必须在一定程度上履行的。而在纽约这样的大城市，通过广播发行的一般报纸无法满足这一功能，因此存在着按照格里利模式为城市各部分出版的小报纸。在曼哈顿和布朗克斯区，地方日报的数量可能是一般报纸的两倍。此外，还有各种针对行业、宗教和民族的特别出版物作为补充。</p><p class="normal3">The function of becoming, as Mr. Lee puts it, "the printed diary of the home town" is one that every newspaper no matter where it is published must in some measure fill. And where, as in a great city like New York, the general newspapers circulated broadcast cannot fill it, there exist small newspapers published on Greeley's pattern for sections of the city. In the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx there are perhaps twice as many local dailies as there are general newspapers. And they are supplemented by all kinds of special publications for trades, religions, nationalities.</p>
<p class="normal3">这些日记是为那些认为自己的生活有趣的人出版的。但也有许多人觉得自己的生活很枯燥，他们希望像海达·高布勒一样，过上更刺激的生活。为他们出版了几份完整的报纸和其他报纸的部分版面，专门介绍一群虚构人物的个人生活，读者可以在自己的想象中安全地认同他们华丽的恶习。赫斯特先生对上流社会的不懈兴趣迎合了那些从不希望进入上流社会的人，但他们却能从模糊的感觉中获得一些提升，即他们是他们所读到的生活的一部分。在大城市里，“家乡印刷的日记”往往是一群上流人士印刷的日记。</p><p class="normal3">These diaries are published for people who find their own lives interesting. But there are also great numbers of people who find their own lives dull, and wish, like Hedda Gabler, to live a more thrilling life. For them there are published a few whole newspapers, and sections of others, devoted to the personal lives of a set of imaginary people, with whose gorgeous vices the reader can in his fancy safely identify himself. Mr. Hearst's unflagging interest in high society caters to people who never hope to be in high society, and yet manage to derive some enhancement out of the vague feeling that they are part of the life that they read about. In the great cities "the printed diary of the home town" tends to be the printed diary of a smart set.</p>
<p class="normal3">正如我们已经指出的，城市日报承担着向普通公民提供远方新闻的重任。但主要不是政治和社会新闻在维持发行量。人们对政治和社会新闻的兴趣是断断续续的，很少有出版商能仅依靠政治和社会新闻。因此，报纸还拥有各种其他功能，所有这些功能主要是为了吸引读者，而读者对于重大新闻没有能力进行批评。此外，在重大新闻方面，任何一个社区的竞争都不是很激烈。新闻服务将主要事件标准化；只有偶尔才会有重大新闻；显然，如此大规模的报道并没有太多的读者，而近年来，《纽约时报》对各种观点的人来说都是必不可少的。为了使自己与众不同并吸引稳定的读者群，大多数报纸必须走出一般新闻领域。他们深入社会各个层面，关注丑闻和犯罪，关注体育、图片、女演员、给失恋者的建议、高中笔记、女性页面、买家页面、烹饪收据、国际象棋、惠斯特、园艺、漫画、激烈的党派之争，这并不是因为出版商和编辑对新闻以外的一切感兴趣，而是因为他们必须找到某种方式来留住那些所谓充满热情的读者，一些新闻批评家认为这些读者只要求真相，不要求别的。</p><p class="normal3">And it is, as we have already noted, the dailies of the cities which carry the burden of bringing distant news to the private citizen. But it is not primarily their political and social news which holds the circulation. The interest in that is intermittent, and few publishers can bank on it alone. The newspaper, therefore, takes to itself a variety of other features, all primarily designed to hold a body of readers together, who so far as big news is concerned, are not able to be critical. Moreover, in big news the competition in any one community is not very serious. The press services standardize the main events; it is only once in a while that a great scoop is made; there is apparently not a very great reading public for such massive reporting as has made the New York Times of recent years indispensable to men of all shades of opinion. In order to differentiate themselves and collect a steady public most papers have to go outside the field of general news. They go to the dazzling levels of society, to scandal and crime, to sports, pictures, actresses, advice to the lovelorn, highschool notes, women's pages, buyer's pages, cooking receipts, chess, whist, gardening, comic strips, thundering partisanship, not because publishers and editors are interested in everything but news, but because they have to find some way of holding on to that alleged host of passionately interested readers, who are supposed by some critics of the press to be clamoring for the truth and nothing but the truth.</p>
<p class="normal3">报纸编辑处于一个奇怪的位置。他的事业依赖于广告商向读者征收的间接税；广告商的赞助取决于编辑将有效客户群体聚集在一起的技巧。这些客户根据他们的私人经验和刻板的期望做出判断，因为本质上他们对所读的大多数新闻没有独立的了解。如果判断不是不利的，编辑至少在支付范围内。但为了确保发行量，他不能完全依赖大环境的新闻。当然，他会尽可能有趣地处理这些新闻，但一般新闻的质量，尤其是关于公共事务的新闻，本身不足以让大量读者在日报之间做出区分。</p><p class="normal3">The newspaper editor occupies a strange position. His enterprises depend upon indirect taxation levied by his advertisers upon his readers; the patronage of the advertisers depends upon the editor's skill in holding together an effective group of customers. These customers deliver judgment according to their private experiences and their stereotyped expectations, for in the nature of things they have no independent knowledge of most news they read. If the judgment is not unfavorable, the editor is at least within range of a circulation that pays. But in order to secure that circulation, he cannot rely wholly upon news of the greater environment. He handles that as interestingly as he can, of course, but the quality of the general news, especially about public affairs, is not in itself sufficient to cause very large numbers of readers to discriminate among the dailies.</p>
<p class="normal3">报纸与公共信息之间这种有点不协调的关系反映在新闻工作者的薪水上。从理论上讲，报道是整个机构的基础，但却是报纸工作中薪水最低、最不受重视的部门。总的来说，有能力的人只是出于需要或为了积累经验而进入这个行业，并且明确希望尽快毕业。因为直截了当的报道并不是一个能带来很多回报的职业。新闻业的回报属于专业工作、具有编辑质量的署名信函、主管以及具有自己天赋和品味的人。毫无疑问，这是由于经济学家所说的能力租金。但这一经济原则在新闻业中发挥着如此特殊的暴力作用，以至于新闻采访本身并不能吸引到与其公共重要性似乎要求的大量训练有素、能力出众的人。我认为，有能力的人从事“直言不讳”的工作，目的是尽快离开，这是该行业从未充分发展那些赋予该职业声望和嫉妒自尊的企业传统的主要原因。因为正是这些企业传统产生了手艺自豪感，往往会提高入职标准，惩罚违反守则的行为，并给予人们力量来坚持自己的社会地位。</p><p class="normal3">This somewhat left-handed relationship between newspapers and public information is reflected in the salaries of newspaper men. Reporting, which theoretically constitutes the foundation of the whole institution, is the most poorly paid branch of newspaper work, and is the least regarded. By and large, able men go into it only by necessity or for experience, and with the definite intention of being graduated as soon as possible. For straight reporting is not a career that offers many great rewards. The rewards in journalism go to specialty work, to signed correspondence which has editorial quality, to executives, and to men with a knack and flavor of their own. This is due, no doubt, to what economists call the rent of ability. But this economic principle operates with such peculiar violence in journalism that newsgathering does not attract to itself anything like the number of trained and able men which its public importance would seem to demand. The fact that the able men take up "straight reporting" with the intention of leaving it as soon as possible is, I think, the chief reason why it has never developed in sufficient measure those corporate traditions that give to a profession prestige and a jealous self-respect. For it is these corporate traditions which engender the pride of craft, which tend to raise the standards of admission, punish breaches of the code, and give men the strength to insist upon their status in society.</p>

<p class="normal3">然而，所有这些都没有触及问题的根源。因为，尽管新闻业的经济学会降低新闻报道的价值，但我确信，这是一种错误的决定论，它会在这一点上放弃分析。记者的内在力量似乎如此强大，通过报道获得成功的非常有能力的人的数量如此之多，因此，相对而言，很少有人认真努力将这一职业提升到医学、工程或法律的水平，这其中一定有更深层次的原因。</p><p class="normal3">Yet all this does not go to the root of the matter. For while the economics of journalism is such as to depress the value of news reporting, it is, I am certain, a false determinism which would abandon the analysis at that point. The intrinsic power of the reporter appears to be so great, the number of very able men who pass through reporting is so large, that there must be some deeper reason why, comparatively speaking, so little serious effort has gone into raising the vocation to the level say of medicine, engineering, or law.</p>
<p class="normal3">厄普顿·辛克莱先生代表了美国大部分民众的意见，他声称，在他所谓的“黄铜支票”中，他发现了这个更深层次的原因：</p><p class="normal3">Mr. Upton Sinclair speaks for a large body of opinion in America, when he claims that in what he calls "The Brass Check" he has found this deeper reason:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">“你们每周的薪水信封里都会有一张铜支票——你们负责撰写、印刷和分发我们的报纸和杂志。这张铜支票是你们的耻辱的代价——你们将美丽的真理带到市场上出售，将人类纯洁的希望出卖给大企业的可憎妓院。”</p>
</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre9">
<p class="normal3">"The Brass Check is found in your pay envelope every week—you who write and print and distribute our newspapers and magazines. The Brass check is the price of your shame—you who take the fair body of truth and sell it in the market place, who betray the virgin hopes of mankind into the loathsome brothel of Big Business."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="normal3">由此看来，存在着大量已知的事实和一系列有根据的希望，而这些事实和希望却被富有的报业巨头们或多或少有意识的阴谋所滥用。如果这一理论是正确的，那么就会得出一个结论。那就是，在与大企业没有任何关系的媒体中，公正的事实是不可侵犯的。因为如果一家不受大企业控制甚至与大企业不友好的媒体以某种方式未能包含公正的事实，那么辛克莱先生的理论就存在问题。</p><p class="normal3">It would seem from this that there exists a body of known truth, and a set of well founded hopes, which are prostituted by a more or less conscious conspiracy of the rich owners of newspapers. If this theory is correct, then a certain conclusion follows. It is that the fair body of truth would be inviolate in a press not in any way connected with Big Business. For if it should happen that a press not controlled by, and not even friendly with, Big Business somehow failed to contain the fair body of truth, something would be wrong with Mr. Sinclair's theory.</p>
<p class="normal3">确实有这样的报刊。说来奇怪，辛克莱先生在提出补救措施时，并没有建议读者订阅最近的激进报纸。为什么不呢？如果美国新闻业的麻烦可以追溯到大企业的“金支票”，那么为什么补救措施不在于阅读那些根本不接受“金支票”的报纸呢？为什么要资助一家拥有“各种信仰或事业”的大型董事会的“全国新闻”，来印刷一份充满事实的报纸，“不管受到什么损害，钢铁托拉斯、世界产业工人联盟、标准石油公司或社会主义党？”如果麻烦来自大企业，即钢铁托拉斯、标准石油公司等，为什么不敦促每个人都阅读世界产业工人联盟或社会主义报纸呢？辛克莱先生没有说为什么不。但原因很简单。他无法说服任何人，甚至他自己，反资本主义报刊是资本主义报刊的补救措施。他在“金支票”理论和建设性建议中都忽视了反资本主义报刊。但是，如果你在诊断美国新闻业，你就不能忽视它。如果你关心的是“公正的事实”，你就不会犯下严重的逻辑错误，把你能在一组报纸中找到的所有不公平和谎言的例子汇总起来，而忽略你在另一组报纸中很容易找到的所有例子，然后将你调查的媒体的一个所谓共同特征归咎为谎言的原因。如果你要把新闻业的缺陷归咎于“资本主义”，你就必须证明，这些缺陷只有在资本主义控制的地方才存在。辛克莱先生不能做到这一点，这一点可以从以下事实中看出：虽然他在诊断中把一切都归咎于资本主义，但在他的处方中，他却忽视了资本主义和反资本主义。</p><p class="normal3">There is such a press. Strange to say, in proposing a remedy Mr. Sinclair does not advise his readers to subscribe to the nearest radical newspaper. Why not? If the troubles of American journalism go back to the Brass Check of Big Business why does not the remedy lie in reading the papers that do not in any remote way accept the Brass Check? Why subsidize a "National News" with a large board of directors "of all creeds or causes" to print a paper full of facts "regardless of what is injured, the Steel Trust or the I. W. W., the Standard Oil Company or the Socialist Party?" If the trouble is Big Business, that is, the Steel Trust, Standard Oil and the like, why not urge everybody to read I. W. W. or Socialist papers? Mr. Sinclair does not say why not. But the reason is simple. He cannot convince anybody, not even himself, that the anti-capitalist press is the remedy for the capitalist press. He ignores the anti-capitalist press both in his theory of the Brass Check and in his constructive proposal. But if you are diagnosing American journalism you cannot ignore it. If what you care about is "the fair body of truth," you do not commit the gross logical error of assembling all the instances of unfairness and lying you can find in one set of newspapers, ignore all the instances you could easily find in another set, and then assign as the cause of the lying, the one supposedly common characteristic of the press to which you have confined your investigation. If you are going to blame "capitalism" for the faults of the press, you are compelled to prove that those faults do not exist except where capitalism controls. That Mr. Sinclair cannot do this, is shown by the fact that while in his diagnosis he traces everything to capitalism, in his prescription he ignores both capitalism and anti-capitalism.</p>
<p class="normal3">人们本以为，无法将任何非资本主义报纸视为真实性和能力的典范，这会导致辛克莱先生及其支持者更加批判地审视他们的假设。例如，他们会问自己，公平的真相在哪里？大企业会卖弄事实，而反大企业似乎无法获得真相。因为我认为，这个问题指向了问题的核心，即什么是新闻的问题。</p><p class="normal3">One would have supposed that the inability to take any non-capitalist paper as a model of truthfulness and competence would have caused Mr. Sinclair, and those who agree with him, to look somewhat more critically at their assumptions. They would have asked themselves, for example, where is the fair body of truth, that Big Business prostitutes, but anti-Big Business does not seem to obtain? For that question leads, I believe, to the heart of the matter, to the question of what is news.</p>

<p class="normal3">世界上所有记者即使整天工作，也不可能见证世界上发生的所有事情。记者的数量并不多。他们中没有一个人有能力同时出现在多个地方。记者不是千里眼，他们不会注视水晶球随意观察世界，他们没有思想转移的帮助。然而，如果不是标准化的例行工作，这些相对较少的记者能够报道的题材范围确实是一个奇迹。</p><p class="normal3">ALL the reporters in the world working all the hours of the day could not witness all the happenings in the world. There are not a great many reporters. And none of them has the power to be in more than one place at a time. Reporters are not clairvoyant, they do not gaze into a crystal ball and see the world at will, they are not assisted by thought-transference. Yet the range of subjects these comparatively few men manage to cover would be a miracle indeed, if it were not a standardized routine.</p>
<p class="normal3">报纸并不试图监视全人类。它们在某些地方派驻了观察员，如警察局、验尸官办公室、县书记官办公室、市政厅、白宫、参议院、众议院等。他们监视，或者更确切地说，在大多数情况下，他们属于一些协会，这些协会雇用人员监视“相对较少的地方，当任何人的生活偏离正常轨道，或发生值得一提的事件时，就会公布消息。”例如，假设约翰·史密斯成为一名经纪人。十年来，他一直过着平静的生活，除了他的客户和朋友，没有人会想到他。在报纸看来，他就像不存在一样。但在第十一年，他遭受了重大损失，最后，他的资源全部用完了，他召集了律师，安排了一项任务。律师把信件寄到县书记官办公室，那里的书记官在官方档案中做了必要的记录。报纸也紧随其后。当书记官在写史密斯的商业讣告时，一名记者从他身后瞥了一眼，几分钟后，记者们就知道了史密斯的麻烦，并且对他的商业状况了如指掌，就像他们十多年来每天都让一名记者守在他家门口一样。</p><p class="normal3">Newspapers do not try to keep an eye on all mankind. They have watchers stationed at certain places, like Police Headquarters, the Coroner's Office, the County Clerk's Office, City Hall, the White House, the Senate, House of Representatives, and so forth. They watch, or rather in the majority of cases they belong to associations which employ men who watch "a comparatively small number of places where it is made known when the life of anyone… departs from ordinary paths, or when events worth telling about occur. For example, John Smith, let it be supposed, becomes a broker. For ten years he pursues the even tenor of his way and except for his customers and his friends no one gives him a thought. To the newspapers he is as if he were not. But in the eleventh year he suffers heavy losses and, at last, his resources all gone, summons his lawyer and arranges for the making of an assignment. The lawyer posts off to the County Clerk's office, and a clerk there makes the necessary entries in the official docket. Here in step the newspapers. While the clerk is writing Smith's business obituary a reporter glances over his shoulder and a few minutes later the reporters know Smith's troubles and are as well informed concerning his business status as they would be had they kept a reporter at his door every day for over ten years.</p>
<p class="normal3">当吉文先生说报纸知道“史密斯的麻烦”和“他的商业状况”时，他并不是说他们像史密斯一样知道这些，或者像阿诺德·贝内特先生如果把史密斯写成三卷本小说的英雄一样知道这些。报纸只是在“几分钟内”知道县书记官办公室记录的赤裸裸的事实。这种公开的行为“揭露”了有关史密斯的消息。是否会跟进新闻是另一回事。关键在于，在一系列事件成为新闻之前，他们通常必须通过某种或多或少公开的行为让自己引人注目。通常也是以一种粗鲁的公开行为。史密斯的朋友可能多年来都知道他在冒险，如果史密斯的朋友健谈的话，谣言甚至可能传到了财经编辑那里。但除了这些都不能发表，因为这是诽谤之外，这些谣言中没有任何明确的东西可以作为故事的依据。必须发生一些具有明确形式的明确的事情。它可能是破产行为，也可能是火灾、碰撞、袭击、暴乱、逮捕、谴责、提出法案、演讲、投票、会议、知名公民表达的意见、报纸上的社论、销售、工资表、价格变动、建桥提案……必须有表现。事件的进程必须呈现某种可定义的形态，除非它处于某个方面成为既定事实的阶段，否则新闻不会脱离可能真相的海洋。</p><p class="normal3">When Mr. Given says that the newspapers know "Smith's troubles" and "his business status," he does not mean that they know them as Smith knows them, or as Mr. Arnold Bennett would know them if he had made Smith the hero of a three volume novel. The newspapers know only "in a few minutes" the bald facts which are recorded in the County Clerk's Office. That overt act "uncovers" the news about Smith. Whether the news will be followed up or not is another matter. The point is that before a series of events become news they have usually to make themselves noticeable in some more or less overt act. Generally too, in a crudely overt act. Smith's friends may have known for years that he was taking risks, rumors may even have reached the financial editor if Smith's friends were talkative. But apart from the fact that none of this could be published because it would be libel, there is in these rumors nothing definite on which to peg a story. Something definite must occur that has unmistakable form. It may be the act of going into bankruptcy, it may be a fire, a collision, an assault, a riot, an arrest, a denunciation, the introduction of a bill, a speech, a vote, a meeting, the expressed opinion of a well known citizen, an editorial in a newspaper, a sale, a wage-schedule, a price change, the proposal to build a bridge…. There must be a manifestation. The course of events must assume a certain definable shape, and until it is in a phase where some aspect is an accomplished fact, news does not separate itself from the ocean of possible truth.</p>

<p class="normal3">当然，对于事件何时具有可以报道的形式，存在着巨大的分歧。一个好的记者比一个雇佣文人更能发现新闻。如果他看到一栋有危险倾斜的建筑物，他不必等到它倒塌在街上才能识别出新闻。一位伟大的记者在听说某某勋爵正在询问气候时，猜出了下一任印度总督的名字。幸运的镜头是有的，但能拍到的人很少。通常，事件在明显的地方呈现的刻板形状揭示了新闻的走向。最明显的地方是人民事务触及公共权力的地方。De minimis non curat lex。正是在这些地方，婚姻、出生、死亡、合同、失败、到达、离开、诉讼、混乱、流行病和灾难才为人所知。</p><p class="normal3">Naturally there is room for wide difference of opinion as to when events have a shape that can be reported. A good journalist will find news oftener than a hack. If he sees a building with a dangerous list, he does not have to wait until it falls into the street in order to recognize news. It was a great reporter who guessed the name of the next Indian Viceroy when he heard that Lord So-and-So was inquiring about climates. There are lucky shots but the number of men who can make them is small. Usually it is the stereotyped shape assumed by an event at an obvious place that uncovers the run of the news. The most obvious place is where people's affairs touch public authority. De minimis non curat lex. It is at these places that marriages, births, deaths, contracts, failures, arrivals, departures, lawsuits, disorders, epidemics and calamities are made known.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，首先，新闻不是社会状况的镜子，而是对突显出来的事物的报道。新闻不会告诉你种子在地里是如何发芽的，但它可能会告诉你第一颗嫩芽何时破土而出。它甚至可能会告诉你有人说地下的种子发生了什么。它可能会告诉你嫩芽没有在预期的时间发芽。因此，任何事件可以被确定、客观化、衡量和命名的点越多，新闻发生的点就越多。</p><p class="normal3">In the first instance, therefore, the news is not a mirror of social conditions, but the report of an aspect that has obtruded itself. The news does not tell you how the seed is germinating in the ground, but it may tell you when the first sprout breaks through the surface. It may even tell you what somebody says is happening to the seed under ground. It may tell you that the sprout did not come up at the time it was expected. The more points, then, at which any happening can be fixed, objectified, measured, named, the more points there are at which news can occur.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，如果有一天立法机关在用尽了所有其他改善人类的方法之后，禁止棒球比赛计分，那么仍有可能进行某种比赛，裁判根据自己的公平观念决定比赛应该持续多长时间，每支球队应该在什么时候击球，谁应该被视为赢家。如果报纸报道了这场比赛，它将包括裁判判决的记录，加上记者对观众欢呼声的印象，以及充其量模糊地描述某些在球场上没有指定位置的人如何在没有标记的草地上走动几个小时。你越是试图想象如此荒谬的困境的逻辑，就越清楚，为了新闻采访的目的（更不用说玩游戏的目的），如果没有命名、计分和记录的设备和规则，就不可能做很多事情。由于这种机器远非完美，裁判的生活常常令人心烦意乱。许多关键的比赛他必须用眼睛来判断。如果有人认为值得拍摄每一场比赛，那么比赛的最后争议痕迹就可以消除，就像人们遵守规则时国际象棋中争议的痕迹已经消除一样。由于人眼反应迟钝，许多记者心中的疑问终于被动态画面打消了，他们不知道邓普西的哪一击击倒了卡彭蒂尔。</p><p class="normal3">So, if some day a legislature, having exhausted all other ways of improving mankind, should forbid the scoring of baseball games, it might still be possible to play some sort of game in which the umpire decided according to his own sense of fair play how long the game should last, when each team should go to bat, and who should be regarded as the winner. If that game were reported in the newspapers it would consist of a record of the umpire's decisions, plus the reporter's impression of the hoots and cheers of the crowd, plus at best a vague account of how certain men, who had no specified position on the field moved around for a few hours on an unmarked piece of sod. The more you try to imagine the logic of so absurd a predicament, the more clear it becomes that for the purposes of newsgathering, (let alone the purposes of playing the game) it is impossible to do much without an apparatus and rules for naming, scoring, recording. Because that machinery is far from perfect, the umpire's life is often a distracted one. Many crucial plays he has to judge by eye. The last vestige of dispute could be taken out of the game, as it has been taken out of chess when people obey the rules, if somebody thought it worth his while to photograph every play. It was the moving pictures which finally settled a real doubt in many reporters' minds, owing to the slowness of the human eye, as to just what blow of Dempsey's knocked out Carpentier.</p>
<p class="normal3">哪里有良好的记录机制，哪里的现代新闻服务就非常精确。证券交易所就有这样的机制，价格变动的消息会以可靠的准确性在行情显示机上闪现。选举结果也有记录机制，如果计票和制表工作做得好，全国选举的结果通常在选举当晚就能知道。在文明社会中，死亡、出生、结婚和离婚都会被记录下来，除非有隐瞒或疏忽，否则都会被准确知晓。这种机制只存在于工业和政府的某些方面，而且只存在于某些方面，对证券、货币和主要商品、银行结算、房地产交易、工资表的精确程度各不相同。进出口也有这种机制，因为它们要经过海关，可以直接记录。国内贸易，尤其是场外交易，其精确程度却大不相同。</p><p class="normal3">Wherever there is a good machinery of record, the modern news service works with great precision. There is one on the stock exchange, and the news of price movements is flashed over tickers with dependable accuracy. There is a machinery for election returns, and when the counting and tabulating are well done, the result of a national election is usually known on the night of the election. In civilized communities deaths, births, marriages and divorces are recorded, and are known accurately except where there is concealment or neglect. The machinery exists for some, and only some, aspects of industry and government, in varying degrees of precision for securities, money and staples, bank clearances, realty transactions, wage scales. It exists for imports and exports because they pass through a custom house and can be directly recorded. It exists in nothing like the same degree for internal trade, and especially for trade over the counter.</p>
<p class="normal3">我认为，人们会发现，新闻的确定性和记录系统之间存在着非常直接的关系。如果你回想一下改革者对新闻界的主要指控，你会发现，在这些话题中，报纸占据着棒球比赛中裁判的位置。所有关于心理状态的新闻都具有这种特征：所有关于个性、诚意、抱负、动机、意图、大众情感、民族情感、舆论、外国政府政策的描述也是如此。关于即将发生的事情的许多新闻也是如此。关于私人利润、私人收入、工资、工作条件、劳动效率、教育机会、失业、单调、健康、歧视、不公平、贸易限制、浪费、“落后民族”、保守主义、帝国主义、激进主义、自由、荣誉、正义的问题也是如此。所有这些都涉及充其量是断断续续记录的数据。这些数据可能因为审查制度或隐私传统而被隐藏，也可能因为没有人认为记录很重要、因为人们认为这是官僚作风或因为还没有人发明客观的测量系统而不存在。那么，当这些主题的新闻没有被完全忽视时，它必然会引起争议。没有被评分的事件要么被报道为个人和传统观点，要么就不是新闻。直到有人抗议、有人调查，或者有人公开（从这个词的词源意义上来说）提出问题，它们才会成形。</p><p class="normal3">It will be found, I think, that there is a very direct relation between the certainty of news and the system of record. If you call to mind the topics which form the principal indictment by reformers against the press, you find they are subjects in which the newspaper occupies the position of the umpire in the unscored baseball game. All news about states of mind is of this character: so are all descriptions of personalities, of sincerity, aspiration, motive, intention, of mass feeling, of national feeling, of public opinion, the policies of foreign governments. So is much news about what is going to happen. So are questions turning on private profit, private income, wages, working conditions, the efficiency of labor, educational opportunity, unemployment, monotony, health, discrimination, unfairness, restraint of trade, waste, "backward peoples," conservatism, imperialism, radicalism, liberty, honor, righteousness. All involve data that are at best spasmodically recorded. The data may be hidden because of a censorship or a tradition of privacy, they may not exist because nobody thinks record important, because he thinks it red tape, or because nobody has yet invented an objective system of measurement. Then the news on these subjects is bound to be debatable, when it is not wholly neglected. The events which are not scored are reported either as personal and conventional opinions, or they are not news. They do not take shape until somebody protests, or somebody investigates, or somebody publicly, in the etymological meaning of the word, makes an issue of them.</p>
<p class="normal3">这就是新闻代理人存在的根本原因。对于报道哪些事实和哪些印象拥有极大的自由裁量权，这让每一个有组织的团体都坚信，无论他们希望获得宣传还是避免宣传，自由裁量权都不能留给记者。雇佣一名站在团体和报纸之间的新闻代理人更为安全。雇佣了他之后，利用他的战略地位的诱惑就非常大了。 “战争爆发前不久，”弗兰克·科布先生说，“纽约的各家报纸对定期受雇和定期认证的新闻代理人进行了一次普查，发现大约有 1200 人。现在（1919 年）有多少人，我并不知道，但我知道的是，许多直接获取新闻的渠道已被关闭，公众的信息首先要通过宣传代理人进行过滤。大公司有宣传代理人，银行有宣传代理人，铁路有宣传代理人，所有商业和社会政治活动组织都有宣传代理人，他们是新闻传播的媒介。甚至政治家也有宣传代理人。”</p><p class="normal3">This is the underlying reason for the existence of the press agent. The enormous discretion as to what facts and what impressions shall be reported is steadily convincing every organized group of people that whether it wishes to secure publicity or to avoid it, the exercise of discretion cannot be left to the reporter. It is safer to hire a press agent who stands between the group and the newspapers. Having hired him, the temptation to exploit his strategic position is very great. "Shortly before the war," says Mr. Frank Cobb, "the newspapers of New York took a census of the press agents who were regularly employed and regularly accredited and found that there were about twelve hundred of them. How many there are now (1919) I do not pretend to know, but what I do know is that many of the direct channels to news have been closed and the information for the public is first filtered through publicity agents. The great corporations have them, the banks have them, the railroads have them, all the organizations of business and of social and political activity have them, and they are the media through which news comes. Even statesmen have them."</p>
<p class="normal3">如果报道的是显而易见的事实，新闻代理人只不过是个办事员。但是，由于就大多数重大新闻话题而言，事实并不简单，也一点也不明显，而是受选择和意见的影响，所以每个人都希望自己选择一些事实供报纸刊登，这是很自然的。宣传人员就是这样做的。这样做，他当然为记者省去了很多麻烦，因为他向记者展示了一幅清晰的画面，否则记者可能一头雾水。但由此可见，宣传人员为记者描绘的画面是他希望公众看到的画面。他是审查员和宣传员，只对他的雇主负责，只对符合雇主对他自身利益的看法的全部真相负责。</p><p class="normal3">Were reporting the simple recovery of obvious facts, the press agent would be little more than a clerk. But since, in respect to most of the big topics of news, the facts are not simple, and not at all obvious, but subject to choice and opinion, it is natural that everyone should wish to make his own choice of facts for the newspapers to print. The publicity man does that. And in doing it, he certainly saves the reporter much trouble, by presenting him a clear picture of a situation out of which he might otherwise make neither head nor tail. But it follows that the picture which the publicity man makes for the reporter is the one he wishes the public to see. He is censor and propagandist, responsible only to his employers, and to the whole truth responsible only as it accords with the employers' conception of his own interests.</p>
<p class="normal3">宣传人员的发展清楚地表明，现代生活的事实不会自发地形成一种可以被人知晓的形式。它们必须由某人来塑造，而由于在日常工作中记者无法塑造事实，而且由于几乎没有公正的情报组织，因此需要由相关方来满足对事实进行某种表述的需求。</p><p class="normal3">The development of the publicity man is a clear sign that the facts of modern life do not spontaneously take a shape in which they can be known. They must be given a shape by somebody, and since in the daily routine reporters cannot give a shape to facts, and since there is little disinterested organization of intelligence, the need for some formulation is being met by the interested parties.</p>

<p class="normal3">优秀的新闻代理人明白，他的事业的优点不算新闻，除非这些优点非常奇怪，以至于与日常生活格格不入。这并不是因为报纸不喜欢优点，而是因为当没有人期望发生任何事情时，说什么都没有发生是毫无意义的。因此，如果宣传人员希望获得免费宣传，那么他必须开始做点什么，说得更准确些。他安排了一个噱头：阻碍交通、戏弄警察，设法将他的客户或事业与已经是新闻的事件纠缠在一起。妇女参政主义者知道这一点，他们并不特别喜欢这种知识，但他们还是采取了行动，在赞成和反对的论点都毫无意义、人们即将安定下来将妇女参政运动视为美国生活中既定制度之一之后，他们仍然让妇女参政成为新闻话题。</p><p class="normal3">The good press agent understands that the virtues of his cause are not news, unless they are such strange virtues that they jut right out of the routine of life. This is not because the newspapers do not like virtue, but because it is not worth while to say that nothing has happened when nobody expected anything to happen. So if the publicity man wishes free publicity he has, speaking quite accurately, to start something. He arranges a stunt: obstructs the traffic, teases the police, somehow manages to entangle his client or his cause with an event that is already news. The suffragists knew this, did not particularly enjoy the knowledge but acted on it, and kept suffrage in the news long after the arguments pro and con were straw in their mouths, and people were about to settle down to thinking of the suffrage movement as one of the established institutions of American life.</p>
<p class="normal3">幸运的是，与女权主义者不同的是，妇女参政主义者有一个非常具体的目标，而且非常简单。投票权所象征的东西并不简单，这一点最有能力的支持者和最有能力的反对者都知道。但投票权是一项简单而熟悉的权利。现在，在劳资纠纷中，这可能是对报纸的指控中的主要内容，罢工权和投票权一样，非常简单。但特定罢工的原因和目标就像妇女运动的原因和目标一样，极其微妙。</p><p class="normal3">Fortunately the suffragists, as distinct from the feminists, had a perfectly concrete objective, and a very simple one. What the vote symbolizes is not simple, as the ablest advocates and the ablest opponents knew. But the right to vote is a simple and familiar right. Now in labor disputes, which are probably the chief item in the charges against newspapers, the right to strike, like the right to vote, is simple enough. But the causes and objects of a particular strike are like the causes and objects of the woman's movement, extremely subtle.</p>
<p class="normal3">让我们假设罢工前的条件很差。衡量邪恶的标准是什么？某种关于适当生活水平、卫生、经济保障和人类尊严的概念。该行业可能远低于社会理论标准，工人们可能太悲惨而无法抗议。条件可能高于标准，工人们可能会激烈抗议。标准充其量只是一个模糊的衡量标准。然而，我们假设条件低于标准，正如编辑所理解的那样。偶尔，他不会等工人威胁，而是在社会工作者的提示下，派记者去调查，并引起人们对恶劣条件的关注。他不一定能经常这样做。因为这些调查需要时间、金钱、特殊才能和大量版面。要使一份关于条件恶劣的报道可信，你需要很多栏的印刷品。为了讲述匹兹堡地区钢铁工人的真相，需要一队调查人员、大量的时间和几卷厚厚的印刷品。不可能想象任何日报会把制作《匹兹堡调查》或《教会间钢铁报告》视为自己的任务之一。需要如此费力才能获得的新闻超出了日报的资源范围。</p><p class="normal3">Let us suppose the conditions leading up to a strike are bad. What is the measure of evil? A certain conception of a proper standard of living, hygiene, economic security, and human dignity. The industry may be far below the theoretical standard of the community, and the workers may be too wretched to protest. Conditions may be above the standard, and the workers may protest violently. The standard is at best a vague measure. However, we shall assume that the conditions are below par, as par is understood by the editor. Occasionally without waiting for the workers to threaten, but prompted say by a social worker, he will send reporters to investigate, and will call attention to bad conditions. Necessarily he cannot do that often. For these investigations cost time, money, special talent, and a lot of space. To make plausible a report that conditions are bad, you need a good many columns of print. In order to tell the truth about the steel worker in the Pittsburgh district, there was needed a staff of investigators, a great deal of time, and several fat volumes of print. It is impossible to suppose that any daily newspaper could normally regard the making of Pittsburgh Surveys, or even Interchurch Steel Reports, as one of its tasks. News which requires so much trouble as that to obtain is beyond the resources of a daily press.</p>
<p class="normal3">恶劣条件本身并不是新闻，因为除了特殊情况外，新闻报道并不是对原始材料的第一手报道。它是对材料进行风格化后的报道。因此，如果卫生委员会报告某个工业区的死亡率异常高，恶劣条件就可能成为新闻。如果没有这种干预，事实就不会成为新闻，直到工人们组织起来并向雇主提出要求。即便如此，如果确定可以轻松解决，新闻价值也很低，无论条件本身是否在和解中得到改善。但如果劳资关系破裂为罢工或停工，新闻价值就会增加。如果停工涉及报纸读者直接依赖的服务，或者涉及违反秩序，新闻价值就更大。</p><p class="normal3">The bad conditions as such are not news, because in all but exceptional cases, journalism is not a first hand report of the raw material. It is a report of that material after it has been stylized. Thus bad conditions might become news if the Board of Health reported an unusually high death rate in an industrial area. Failing an intervention of this sort, the facts do not become news, until the workers organize and make a demand upon their employers. Even then, if an easy settlement is certain the news value is low, whether or not the conditions themselves are remedied in the settlement. But if industrial relations collapse into a strike or lockout the news value increases. If the stoppage involves a service on which the readers of the newspapers immediately depend, or if it involves a breach of order, the news value is still greater.</p>
<p class="normal3">潜在的麻烦通过某些容易识别的症状出现在新闻中，如要求、罢工、骚乱。从工人或公正的正义追求者的角度来看，要求、罢工和骚乱仅仅是一个对他们来说非常复杂的过程中的事件。但由于所有直接现实都不在记者和大多数报纸所依赖的特殊公众的直接经验范围内，因此他们通常必须等待以公开行为形式出现的信号。当这种信号出现时，比如工人罢工或警察传唤，它就会激发人们对罢工和骚乱的刻板印象。看不见的斗争没有自己的特色。它被抽象地注意到，然后这种抽象被读者和记者的直接经验所激发。显然，这与罢工者的经历截然不同。他们感受到，比如说，工头的脾气、机器令人神经紧张的单调、令人沮丧的糟糕空气、妻子的单调工作、孩子的发育迟缓、住房的肮脏。罢工的口号充满了这些感受。但记者和读者一开始只看到罢工和一些口号。他们把这些口号融入了感情。他们的感觉可能是，他们的工作没有保障，因为罢工者阻止了他们工作所需的商品，会出现短缺和价格上涨，这一切都非常不方便。这些也是现实。当他们给罢工的抽象新闻增添色彩时，事情的本质就是工人处于不利地位。也就是说，在现有的劳资关系制度的本质中，工人的不满或希望产生的新闻几乎总是会通过公开攻击生产来揭露。</p><p class="normal3">The underlying trouble appears in the news through certain easily recognizable symptoms, a demand, a strike, disorder. From the point of view of the worker, or of the disinterested seeker of justice, the demand, the strike, and the disorder, are merely incidents in a process that for them is richly complicated. But since all the immediate realities lie outside the direct experience both of the reporter, and of the special public by which most newspapers are supported, they have normally to wait for a signal in the shape of an overt act. When that signal comes, say through a walkout of the men or a summons for the police, it calls into play the stereotypes people have about strikes and disorders. The unseen struggle has none of its own flavor. It is noted abstractly, and that abstraction is then animated by the immediate experience of the reader and reporter. Obviously this is a very different experience from that which the strikers have. They feel, let us say, the temper of the foreman, the nerve-racking monotony of the machine, the depressingly bad air, the drudgery of their wives, the stunting of their children, the dinginess of their tenements. The slogans of the strike are invested with these feelings. But the reporter and reader see at first only a strike and some catchwords. They invest these with their feelings. Their feelings may be that their jobs are insecure because the strikers are stopping goods they need in their work, that there will be shortage and higher prices, that it is all devilishly inconvenient. These, too, are realities. And when they give color to the abstract news that a strike has been called, it is in the nature of things that the workers are at a disadvantage. It is in the nature, that is to say, of the existing system of industrial relations that news arising from grievances or hopes by workers should almost invariably be uncovered by an overt attack on production.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，你会看到各种错综复杂的情况、发出信号的公开行为、发布信号的陈词滥调的公告，以及读者自己从直接影响他的经历中得出的意义。现在，读者对罢工的经历可能确实非常重要，但从引起罢工的核心问题的角度来看，这是奇怪的。然而，这种奇怪的意义自然是最有趣的。以想象的方式进入核心问题，对读者来说，就是走出自我，进入截然不同的生活。</p><p class="normal3">You have, therefore, the circumstances in all their sprawling complexity, the overt act which signalizes them, the stereotyped bulletin which publishes the signal, and the meaning that the reader himself injects, after he has derived that meaning from the experience which directly affects him. Now the reader's experience of a strike may be very important indeed, but from the point of view of the central trouble which caused the strike, it is eccentric. Yet this eccentric meaning is automatically the most interesting. To enter imaginatively into the central issues is for the reader to step out of himself, and into very different lives.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，在报道罢工事件时，最简单的方法就是让新闻通过公开行为来揭露，并将事件描述为干扰读者生活的故事。这是读者注意力首先被唤起的地方，也是最容易引起读者兴趣的地方。在工人和改革者看来，报纸故意歪曲事实，其中很大一部分，我认为是关键部分，是揭露新闻的实际困难的直接结果，以及使遥远的事实变得有趣的情感困难的直接结果，除非如爱默生所说，我们能够“将它们视为我们熟悉经验的新版本”，并能够“立即着手将它们转化为我们的平行事实”。</p><p class="normal3">It follows that in the reporting of strikes, the easiest way is to let the news be uncovered by the overt act, and to describe the event as the story of interference with the reader's life. That is where his attention is first aroused, and his interest most easily enlisted. A great deal, I think myself the crucial part, of what looks to the worker and the reformer as deliberate misrepresentation on the part of newspapers, is the direct outcome of a practical difficulty in uncovering the news, and the emotional difficulty of making distant facts interesting unless, as Emerson says, we can "perceive (them) to be only a new version of our familiar experience" and can "set about translating (them) at once into our parallel facts."</p>
<p class="normal3">如果你研究一下媒体报道罢工事件的方式，你会发现，很多时候，这些问题很少出现在头条新闻中，很少出现在前几段中，有时甚至根本没有提到。另一个城市的劳资纠纷必须非常重要，新闻报道才会包含任何有关争议的明确信息。新闻的常规就是这样运作的，在政治问题和国际新闻方面也是如此，只是有所修改。新闻是对有趣的公开阶段的报道，报纸坚持这一常规的压力来自多方面。它来自只关注情况的刻板阶段的经济效益。它来自很难找到能看到他们没有学会看到的东西的记者。它来自几乎不可避免的困难，即找到足够的空间，即使是最好的记者也可以让一个非传统的观点变得可信。它来自迅速引起读者兴趣的经济需要，以及完全不引起读者兴趣或因描述不充分或笨拙的意外新闻而冒犯读者所涉及的经济风险。所有这些困难加在一起，使得编辑在面临危险问题时感到不确定，并自然而然地倾向于无可争辩的事实和更易于适应读者兴趣的处理方式。无可争辩的事实和容易的兴趣，就是罢工本身和读者的不便。</p><p class="normal3">If you study the way many a strike is reported in the press, you will find, very often, that the issues are rarely in the headlines, barely in the leading paragraphs, and sometimes not even mentioned anywhere. A labor dispute in another city has to be very important before the news account contains any definite information as to what is in dispute. The routine of the news works that way, with modifications it works that way in regard to political issues and international news as well. The news is an account of the overt phases that are interesting, and the pressure on the newspaper to adhere to this routine comes from many sides. It comes from the economy of noting only the stereotyped phase of a situation. It comes from the difficulty of finding journalists who can see what they have not learned to see. It comes from the almost unavoidable difficulty of finding sufficient space in which even the best journalist can make plausible an unconventional view. It comes from the economic necessity of interesting the reader quickly, and the economic risk involved in not interesting him at all, or of offending him by unexpected news insufficiently or clumsily described. All these difficulties combined make for uncertainty in the editor when there are dangerous issues at stake, and cause him naturally to prefer the indisputable fact and a treatment more readily adapted to the reader's interest. The indisputable fact and the easy interest, are the strike itself and the reader's inconvenience.</p>
<p class="normal3">在目前的行业组织中，所有更微妙、更深刻的真相都是非常不可靠的真相。它们涉及对生活水平、生产力、人权的判断，而这些判断在没有准确记录和定量分析的情况下是无休止地争论的。只要这些在行业中不存在，那么有关它的新闻就会像爱默生引用伊索克拉底的话所说的那样，“把鼹鼠变成山，把山变成鼹鼠。”如果行业没有宪法程序，也没有专家对证据和主张进行筛选，那么让读者感到耸人听闻的事实就是几乎每个记者都会寻找的事实。鉴于普遍存在的劳资关系，即使有会议或仲裁，但没有独立的事实筛选以供决定，报纸公众的问题往往不会成为行业的问题。因此，通过报纸上诉来审理纠纷会给报纸和读者带来负担，而这是他们无法也不应该承担的。只要真正的法律和秩序不存在，除非有意识地勇敢地加以纠正，否则大部分新闻都会对那些没有合法有序维护自己权利的人不利。来自行动现场的公告将记录由这种主张引起的麻烦，而不是导致这种主张的原因。原因是无形的。</p><p class="normal3">All the subtler and deeper truths are in the present organization of industry very unreliable truths. They involve judgments about standards of living, productivity, human rights that are endlessly debatable in the absence of exact record and quantitative analysis. And as long as these do not exist in industry, the run of news about it will tend, as Emerson said, quoting from Isocrates, "to make of moles mountains, and of mountains moles." Where there is no constitutional procedure in industry, and no expert sifting of evidence and the claims, the fact that is sensational to the reader is the fact that almost every journalist will seek. Given the industrial relations that so largely prevail, even where there is conference or arbitration, but no independent filtering of the facts for decision, the issue for the newspaper public will tend not to be the issue for the industry. And so to try disputes by an appeal through the newspapers puts a burden upon newspapers and readers which they cannot and ought not to carry. As long as real law and order do not exist, the bulk of the news will, unless consciously and courageously corrected, work against those who have no lawful and orderly method of asserting themselves. The bulletins from the scene of action will note the trouble that arose from the assertion, rather than the reasons which led to it. The reasons are intangible.</p>

<p class="normal3">编辑负责处理这些公报。他坐在办公室里阅读公报，很少看到事件本身的大部分内容。正如我们所看到的，他必须每天吸引至少一部分读者，因为如果竞争对手的报纸恰好符合他们的口味，他们会毫不留情地离开他。他承受着巨大的压力，因为报纸的竞争往往是几分钟的事情。每一份公报都需要迅速而复杂的判断。它必须被理解，与其他同样被理解的公报联系起来，并根据编辑对公众的可能兴趣来夸大或淡化它。如果没有标准化、没有刻板印象、没有常规判断、没有相当无情地忽视微妙之处，编辑很快就会兴奋得死去活来。最终的页面是确定的大小，必须在精确的时间准备好；每篇文章的标题只能有一定数量的标题，每个标题中的字母数也必须确定。总是存在着购买者的迫切需求、诽谤法和无尽麻烦的可能性。没有系统化，事情根本无法管理，因为标准化产品可以节省时间和精力，还可以部分保证不会失败。</p><p class="normal3">The editor deals with these bulletins. He sits in his office, reads them, rarely does he see any large portion of the events themselves. He must, as we have seen, woo at least a section of his readers every day, because they will leave him without mercy if a rival paper happens to hit their fancy. He works under enormous pressure, for the competition of newspapers is often a matter of minutes. Every bulletin requires a swift but complicated judgment. It must be understood, put in relation to other bulletins also understood, and played up or played down according to its probable interest for the public, as the editor conceives it. Without standardization, without stereotypes, without routine judgments, without a fairly ruthless disregard of subtlety, the editor would soon die of excitement. The final page is of a definite size, must be ready at a precise moment; there can be only a certain number of captions on the items, and in each caption there must be a definite number of letters. Always there is the precarious urgency of the buying public, the law of libel, and the possibility of endless trouble. The thing could not be managed at all without systematization, for in a standardized product there is economy of time and effort, as well as a partial guarantee against failure.</p>
<p class="normal3">正是在这里，各家报纸相互影响最为深刻。因此，当战争爆发时，美国报纸面临着一个他们以前没有经验的话题。某些日报有足够的钱支付电报费，率先获得新闻，新闻呈现方式成为整个新闻界的典范。但这种模式从何而来？它来自英国媒体，不是因为诺思克利夫拥有美国报纸，而是因为起初购买英文通讯更容易，而且后来，美国记者阅读英文报纸比阅读其他报纸更容易。伦敦是电报和新闻中心，正是在那里，一种报道战争的技术得以发展。在报道俄国革命时也发生了类似的事情。在那个例子中，俄罗斯和盟军的军事审查制度封锁了进入俄罗斯的渠道，而俄语的困难更是封锁了进入俄罗斯的渠道。但最重要的是，它无法进行有效的新闻报道，因为最难报道的是混乱，尽管它是一种不断发展的混乱。这使得俄罗斯新闻的制作权从赫尔辛基、斯德哥尔摩、日内瓦、巴黎和伦敦等地的源头落入了审查者和宣传者的手中。很长一段时间里，他们没有受到任何形式的审查。在他们变得可笑之前，他们从俄罗斯大漩涡的某些真实方面创造了一套刻板印象，让我们承认，这些刻板印象如此令人厌恶和恐惧，以至于新闻业最优秀的本能，即去看看、去报道的愿望，在很长一段时间内被压制了。</p><p class="normal3">It is here that newspapers influence each other most deeply. Thus when the war broke out, the American newspapers were confronted with a subject about which they had no previous experience. Certain dailies, rich enough to pay cable tolls, took the lead in securing news, and the way that news was presented became a model for the whole press. But where did that model come from? It came from the English press, not because Northcliffe owned American newspapers, but because at first it was easier to buy English correspondence, and because, later, it was easier for American journalists to read English newspapers than it was for them to read any others. London was the cable and news center, and it was there that a certain technic for reporting the war was evolved. Something similar occurred in the reporting of the Russian Revolution. In that instance, access to Russia was closed by military censorship, both Russian and Allied, and closed still more effectively by the difficulties of the Russian language. But above all it was closed to effective news reporting by the fact that the hardest thing to report is chaos, even though it is an evolving chaos. This put the formulating of Russian news at its source in Helsingfors, Stockholm, Geneva, Paris and London, into the hands of censors and propagandists. They were for a long time subject to no check of any kind. Until they had made themselves ridiculous they created, let us admit, out of some genuine aspects of the huge Russian maelstrom, a set of stereotypes so evocative of hate and fear, that the very best instinct of journalism, its desire to go and see and tell, was for a long time crushed.</p>

<p class="normal3">每一份报纸送到读者手中，都是经过一系列选择的结果，包括要印什么内容、印在什么位置、每篇内容占据多少版面、每篇内容的重点是什么。这里没有客观标准。只有惯例。以同一天早上在同一城市出版的两份报纸为例。一份报纸的标题是：“英国承诺向柏林提供援助，抵抗法国的侵略；法国公开支持波兰人。”第二份报纸的标题是“斯蒂尔曼夫人的另一种爱”。你喜欢哪一份报纸取决于你的品味，但并不完全取决于编辑的品味。这取决于他的判断，即什么内容会吸引某一群读者对他的报纸的半小时的注意力。现在，吸引注意力的问题绝不等同于以宗教教义或某种形式的道德文化所规定的视角来展示新闻。这是一个激发读者情感的问题，促使读者对他正在阅读的故事产生个人认同感。如果新闻不能提供机会让人们参与到它所描绘的斗争中，那么它就不可能吸引广大的观众。观众必须通过个人认同来参与新闻，就像参与戏剧一样。就像女主角遇到危险时每个人都屏住呼吸，帮助贝比·鲁斯挥动球棒一样，读者以更微妙的方式进入新闻。为了进入新闻，他必须在故事中找到一个熟悉的立足点，而这正是通过使用刻板印象提供给他的。他们告诉他，如果一个水管工协会被称为“联合体”，那么培养他的敌意是合适的；如果它被称为“一群主要的商人”，那么暗示着他会做出有利的反应。</p><p class="normal3">Every newspaper when it reaches the reader is the result of a whole series of selections as to what items shall be printed, in what position they shall be printed, how much space each shall occupy, what emphasis each shall have. There are no objective standards here. There are conventions. Take two newspapers published in the same city on the same morning. The headline of one reads: "Britain pledges aid to Berlin against French aggression; France openly backs Poles." The headline of the second is "Mrs. Stillman's Other Love." Which you prefer is a matter of taste, but not entirely a matter of the editor's taste. It is a matter of his judgment as to what will absorb the half hour's attention a certain set of readers will give to his newspaper. Now the problem of securing attention is by no means equivalent to displaying the news in the perspective laid down by religious teaching or by some form of ethical culture. It is a problem of provoking feeling in the reader, of inducing him to feel a sense of personal identification with the stories he is reading. News which does not offer this opportunity to introduce oneself into the struggle which it depicts cannot appeal to a wide audience. The audience must participate in the news, much as it participates in the drama, by personal identification. Just as everyone holds his breath when the heroine is in danger, as he helps Babe Ruth swing his bat, so in subtler form the reader enters into the news. In order that he shall enter he must find a familiar foothold in the story, and this is supplied to him by the use of stereotypes. They tell him that if an association of plumbers is called a "combine" it is appropriate to develop his hostility; if it is called a "group of leading business men" the cue is for a favorable reaction.</p>
<p class="normal3">正是这些因素的结合，才产生了创造舆论的力量。社论则起到了加强作用。有时，在新闻版面上的某种情况过于混乱而无法辨别时，社论会给读者提供线索，让读者参与进来。如果他想像我们大多数人一样，迅速抓住新闻，他就必须有这样的线索。他需要某种建议，告诉他，作为一个认为自己是某某的人，他应该在何处将自己的感受与他所读到的新闻结合起来。</p><p class="normal3">It is in a combination of these elements that the power to create opinion resides. Editorials reinforce. Sometimes in a situation that on the news pages is too confusing to permit of identification, they give the reader a clue by means of which he engages himself. A clue he must have if, as most of us must, he is to seize the news in a hurry. A suggestion of some sort he demands, which tells him, so to speak, where he, a man conceiving himself to be such and such a person, shall integrate his feelings with the news he reads.</p>
<p class="normal3">沃尔特·白芝浩写道：“据说，如果你能让一个中产阶级英国人思考‘天狼星里是否有蜗牛’，他很快就会对此有自己的看法。让他思考很难，但如果他真的思考了，他就不会固步自封，他会做出某种决定。当然，对于任何普通话题，情况都是如此。杂货商对外交政策有着完整的信念，年轻女士对圣礼有着完整的理论，他们对此都没有任何怀疑。”</p><p class="normal3">"It has been said" writes Walter Bagehot, "that if you can only get a middleclass Englishman to think whether there are 'snails in Sirius,' he will soon have an opinion on it. It will be difficult to make him think, but if he does think, he cannot rest in a negative, he will come to some decision. And on any ordinary topic, of course, it is so. A grocer has a full creed as to foreign policy, a young lady a complete theory of the sacraments, as to which neither has any doubt whatever."</p>
<p class="normal3">然而，那位杂货商会对他所买的杂货产生许多疑虑，而那位对圣礼十分确信的年轻女士，可能会对是否要嫁给这位杂货商，以及如果不嫁给这位杂货商，是否应该接受他的关注产生各种疑虑。能够保持消极态度意味着要么对结果不感兴趣，要么对竞争性选择有强烈的感觉。在外交政策或圣礼方面，人们对结果的兴趣非常强烈，而核实意见的手段却很少。这就是一般新闻读者的困境。如果他要读新闻，他必须感兴趣，也就是说，他必须进入情境并关心结果。但如果他这样做，他就不能保持消极态度，除非存在独立核实报纸给他的线索的手段，否则他感兴趣的事实本身就可能使他难以达成最接近真相的意见平衡。他越是热情地参与其中，他就越倾向于不仅对不同的观点感到不满，而且对令人不安的新闻也感到不满。这就是为什么许多报纸发现，在诚实地激起读者的党派偏见之后，即使编辑认为事实需要改变立场，它也无法轻易改变立场。如果必须改变立场，就必须以最精湛的技巧和细腻的手段来处理这一转变。通常报纸不会尝试如此危险的行为。让该主题的新闻逐渐减少并消失，从而通过扼杀它来扑灭火焰，这样更容易、更安全。</p><p class="normal3">Yet that same grocer will have many doubts about his groceries, and that young lady, marvelously certain about the sacraments, may have all kinds of doubts as to whether to marry the grocer, and if not whether it is proper to accept his attentions. The ability to rest in the negative implies either a lack of interest in the result, or a vivid sense of competing alternatives. In the case of foreign policy or the sacraments, the interest in the results is intense, while means for checking the opinion are poor. This is the plight of the reader of the general news. If he is to read it at all he must be interested, that is to say, he must enter into the situation and care about the outcome. But if he does that he cannot rest in a negative, and unless independent means of checking the lead given him by his newspaper exists, the very fact that he is interested may make it difficult to arrive at that balance of opinions which may most nearly approximate the truth. The more passionately involved he becomes, the more he will tend to resent not only a different view, but a disturbing bit of news. That is why many a newspaper finds that, having honestly evoked the partisanship of its readers, it can not easily, supposing the editor believes the facts warrant it, change position. If a change is necessary, the transition has to be managed with the utmost skill and delicacy. Usually a newspaper will not attempt so hazardous a performance. It is easier and safer to have the news of that subject taper off and disappear, thus putting out the fire by starving it.</p>

<p class="normal3">当我们开始对新闻界进行越来越精确的研究时，我们持有的假设将发挥很大作用。如果我们与辛克莱先生及其大多数反对者一样，认为新闻和真相是同一个事物的两个词，那么我相信我们将一事无成。我们将证明报纸在这一点上撒了谎。我们将证明辛克莱先生在那一点上的叙述是撒谎的。我们将证明当辛克莱先生说某人撒谎时，他撒了谎，当辛克莱先生说某人撒谎时，他撒了谎。我们将发泄我们的感情，但我们会把它们发泄到空气中。</p><p class="normal3">As we begin to make more and more exact studies of the press, much will depend upon the hypothesis we hold. If we assume with Mr. Sinclair, and most of his opponents, that news and truth are two words for the same thing, we shall, I believe, arrive nowhere. We shall prove that on this point the newspaper lied. We shall prove that on that point Mr. Sinclair's account lied. We shall demonstrate that Mr. Sinclair lied when he said that somebody lied, and that somebody lied when he said Mr. Sinclair lied. We shall vent our feelings, but we shall vent them into air.</p>
<p class="normal3">在我看来，最有说服力的假设是，新闻和真相不是一回事，必须明确区分。新闻的作用是报道事件，真相的作用是揭露隐藏的事实，将它们相互关联，并描绘出一幅人们可以采取行动的现实图景。只有在社会条件变得可识别和可衡量的时候，真相和新闻才会重合。这只是整个人类兴趣领域中相对较小的一部分。在这个领域，也只有在这个领域，对新闻的检验才足够准确，足以使歪曲或压制的指控不仅仅是党派判断。报纸六次声称列宁已死，而报纸所掌握的唯一信息是一份来自一个一再被证明不可靠的消息来源的关于他已死的报道，这没有任何辩护、任何减轻罪责的理由、任何借口。在这种情况下，新闻不是“列宁死了”，而是“赫尔辛基说列宁死了”。报纸可以被要求承担责任，不让列宁的死讯超过新闻来源的可靠性；如果说编辑最有责任心的话，那就是他们对消息来源可靠性的判断。但是，当涉及到处理俄罗斯人民想要什么的故事时，就没有这样的标准了。</p><p class="normal3">The hypothesis, which seems to me the most fertile, is that news and truth are not the same thing, and must be clearly distinguished. The function of news is to signalize an event, the function of truth is to bring to light the hidden facts, to set them into relation with each other, and make a picture of reality on which men can act. Only at those points, where social conditions take recognizable and measurable shape, do the body of truth and the body of news coincide. That is a comparatively small part of the whole field of human interest. In this sector, and only in this sector, the tests of the news are sufficiently exact to make the charges of perversion or suppression more than a partisan judgment. There is no defense, no extenuation, no excuse whatever, for stating six times that Lenin is dead, when the only information the paper possesses is a report that he is dead from a source repeatedly shown to be unreliable. The news, in that instance, is not "Lenin Dead" but "Helsingfors Says Lenin is Dead." And a newspaper can be asked to take the responsibility of not making Lenin more dead than the source of the news is reliable; if there is one subject on which editors are most responsible it is in their judgment of the reliability of the source. But when it comes to dealing, for example, with stories of what the Russian people want, no such test exists.</p>
<p class="normal3">我认为，缺乏这些精确的测试，是新闻职业的本质所在，其他任何解释都无法解释。新闻职业需要的精确知识非常少，不需要出色的能力或训练就能掌握。其余的则由新闻工作者自行决定。一旦新闻工作者离开县书记官办公室明确记录的约翰·史密斯破产的区域，所有固定的标准就都消失了。约翰·史密斯失败的原因、他的人性弱点、导致他破产的经济状况的分析，所有这些都可以用一百种不同的方式来讲述。应用心理学没有一门学科，就像医学、工程学甚至法律中有一门学科一样，在新闻工作者从新闻转向模糊的真相领域时，它有权指导他的思想。没有准则来指导他自己的思想，也没有准则来强迫读者或出版商做出判断。他对真相的看法只是他自己的看法。他如何能证明他所看到的真相呢？他无法证明这一点，就像辛克莱·刘易斯先生无法证明自己说出了有关大街的全部真相一样。他越了解自己的弱点，就越愿意承认，在没有客观检验的情况下，他自己的观点在某种程度上是基于他自己的刻板印象、按照他自己的准则以及他自己兴趣的紧迫性而构建的。他知道自己是通过主观的视角看待世界的。他无法否认，正如雪莱所说，他也是一座五彩缤纷的玻璃穹顶，玷污了永恒的白色光芒。</p><p class="normal3">The absence of these exact tests accounts, I think, for the character of the profession, as no other explanation does. There is a very small body of exact knowledge, which it requires no outstanding ability or training to deal with. The rest is in the journalist's own discretion. Once he departs from the region where it is definitely recorded at the County Clerk's office that John Smith has gone into bankruptcy, all fixed standards disappear. The story of why John Smith failed, his human frailties, the analysis of the economic conditions on which he was shipwrecked, all of this can be told in a hundred different ways. There is no discipline in applied psychology, as there is a discipline in medicine, engineering, or even law, which has authority to direct the journalist's mind when he passes from the news to the vague realm of truth. There are no canons to direct his own mind, and no canons that coerce the reader's judgment or the publisher's. His version of the truth is only his version. How can he demonstrate the truth as he sees it? He cannot demonstrate it, any more than Mr. Sinclair Lewis can demonstrate that he has told the whole truth about Main Street. And the more he understands his own weaknesses, the more ready he is to admit that where there is no objective test, his own opinion is in some vital measure constructed out of his own stereotypes, according to his own code, and by the urgency of his own interest. He knows that he is seeing the world through subjective lenses. He cannot deny that he too is, as Shelley remarked, a dome of many-colored glass which stains the white radiance of eternity.</p>
<p class="normal3">正是由于这种认识，他的自信才得以缓和。他可能拥有各种道德勇气，有时确实如此，但他缺乏对某种技术的坚定信念，而正是这种技术最终将物理科学从神学控制中解放出来。正是逐渐发展出一种不可辩驳的方法，才使物理学家获得了与世界所有权力相对抗的思想自由。他的证据如此清晰，他的证据如此明显优于传统，以至于他最终摆脱了一切控制。但记者在自己的良心或事实上没有这样的支持。雇主和读者的意见对他施加的控制，不是偏见对真理的控制，而是一种意见对另一种意见的控制，而后者显然并不不那么真实。在加里法官断言工会将摧毁美国机构与冈珀先生断言工会是人权机构之间，选择在很大程度上必须由信仰的意愿来支配。</p><p class="normal3">And by this knowledge his assurance is tempered. He may have all kinds of moral courage, and sometimes has, but he lacks that sustaining conviction of a certain technic which finally freed the physical sciences from theological control. It was the gradual development of an irrefragable method that gave the physicist his intellectual freedom as against all the powers of the world. His proofs were so clear, his evidence so sharply superior to tradition, that he broke away finally from all control. But the journalist has no such support in his own conscience or in fact. The control exercised over him by the opinions of his employers and his readers, is not the control of truth by prejudice, but of one opinion by another opinion that it is not demonstrably less true. Between Judge Gary's assertion that the unions will destroy American institutions, and Mr. Gomper's assertion that they are agencies of the rights of man, the choice has, in large measure, to be governed by the will to believe.</p>
<p class="normal3">平息这些争议，并将它们降到可以作为新闻报道的程度，这不是记者能够完成的任务。记者有可能也有必要让人们认识到他们的观点所依据的真相的不确定性，并通过批评和鼓动，促使社会科学对社会事实做出更有用的表述，并促使政治家建立更明显的机构。换句话说，新闻界可以为扩大可报道的真相而斗争。但是，由于当今社会真相的组织方式，新闻界无法从一期到下一期提供民主舆论理论所要求的知识量。这并不是由于激进报纸的新闻质量所显示的“黄铜支票”，而是由于新闻界面对的是一个统治力量记录不完善的社会。新闻界本身可以记录这些力量的理论是错误的。它通常只能记录机构运作为其记录的内容。其余一切都是争论和观点，随着人类心灵的变迁、自我意识和勇气而波动。</p><p class="normal3">The task of deflating these controversies, and reducing them to a point where they can be reported as news, is not a task which the reporter can perform. It is possible and necessary for journalists to bring home to people the uncertain character of the truth on which their opinions are founded, and by criticism and agitation to prod social science into making more usable formulations of social facts, and to prod statesmen into establishing more visible institutions. The press, in other words, can fight for the extension of reportable truth. But as social truth is organized to-day, the press is not constituted to furnish from one edition to the next the amount of knowledge which the democratic theory of public opinion demands. This is not due to the Brass Check, as the quality of news in radical papers shows, but to the fact that the press deals with a society in which the governing forces are so imperfectly recorded. The theory that the press can itself record those forces is false. It can normally record only what has been recorded for it by the working of institutions. Everything else is argument and opinion, and fluctuates with the vicissitudes, the self-consciousness, and the courage of the human mind.</p>
<p class="normal3">如果新闻界并非如辛克莱先生所言，普遍邪恶，阴谋诡计多端，那么它就比民主理论迄今承认的要脆弱得多。它太脆弱了，无法承担人民主权的全部重担，无法自发提供民主人士所希望的与生俱来的真相。当我们期望它提供这样一种真相时，我们采用的判断标准是错误的。我们误解了新闻的有限性和社会的无限复杂性；我们高估了自己的忍耐力、公共精神和全面的能力。我们假设人们对无趣的真相有胃口，而任何诚实分析我们自己的品味都无法发现这种胃口。</p><p class="normal3">If the press is not so universally wicked, nor so deeply conspiring, as Mr. Sinclair would have us believe, it is very much more frail than the democratic theory has as yet admitted. It is too frail to carry the whole burden of popular sovereignty, to supply spontaneously the truth which democrats hoped was inborn. And when we expect it to supply such a body of truth we employ a misleading standard of judgment. We misunderstand the limited nature of news, the illimitable complexity of society; we overestimate our own endurance, public spirit, and all-round competence. We suppose an appetite for uninteresting truths which is not discovered by any honest analysis of our own tastes.</p>
<p class="normal3">那么，如果报纸要承担起传达人类整个公共生活的责任，以便每个成年人都能对每个有争议的话题发表意见，那么它们就失败了，注定会失败，而且可以想象，它们在未来的任何时间都将继续失败。我们不可能假设一个由劳动分工和权力分配所驱动的世界能够由全民普遍意见所统治。这种理论在不知不觉中将单个读者设定为理论上无所不能的人，并让媒体承担起完成代议制政府、工业组织和外交未能完成的任务。在二十四小时内，媒体对每个人施加三十分钟的影响，被要求创造一种名为舆论的神秘力量，以弥补公共机构的不足。媒体常常错误地假装它能够做到这一点。它付出了巨大的道德代价，鼓励民主仍然局限于其原有的前提，期望报纸自发地为每一个政府机构、每一个社会问题提供信息机制，而这些机制通常不会自己提供。机构未能为自己提供知识工具，已成为一堆“问题”，而这些问题应该由全体民众、全体读者来解决。</p><p class="normal3">If the newspapers, then, are to be charged with the duty of translating the whole public life of mankind, so that every adult can arrive at an opinion on every moot topic, they fail, they are bound to fail, in any future one can conceive they will continue to fail. It is not possible to assume that a world, carried on by division of labor and distribution of authority, can be governed by universal opinions in the whole population. Unconsciously the theory sets up the single reader as theoretically omnicompetent, and puts upon the press the burden of accomplishing whatever representative government, industrial organization, and diplomacy have failed to accomplish. Acting upon everybody for thirty minutes in twenty-four hours, the press is asked to create a mystical force called Public Opinion that will take up the slack in public institutions. The press has often mistakenly pretended that it could do just that. It has at great moral cost to itself, encouraged a democracy, still bound to its original premises, to expect newspapers to supply spontaneously for every organ of government, for every social problem, the machinery of information which these do not normally supply themselves. Institutions, having failed to furnish themselves with instruments of knowledge, have become a bundle of "problems," which the population as a whole, reading the press as a whole, is supposed to solve.</p>
<p class="normal3">换言之，新闻界已被视为直接民主的机构，其职责范围更广，而且日复一日地承担着通常归因于创议、全民公决和罢免的职能。舆论法庭日夜开放，随时为一切事物制定法律。这是行不通的。当你考虑到新闻的性质时，这甚至不可想象。因为，正如我们所见，新闻的精确性与事件记录的精确性成正比。除非事件能够被命名、衡量、塑造和具体化，否则它要么无法呈现新闻的特征，要么会受到观察的偶然性和偏见的影响。</p><p class="normal3">The press, in other words, has come to be regarded as an organ of direct democracy, charged on a much wider scale, and from day to day, with the function often attributed to the initiative, referendum, and recall. The Court of Public Opinion, open day and night, is to lay down the law for everything all the time. It is not workable. And when you consider the nature of news, it is not even thinkable. For the news, as we have seen, is precise in proportion to the precision with which the event is recorded. Unless the event is capable of being named, measured, given shape, made specific, it either fails to take on the character of news, or it is subject to the accidents and prejudices of observation.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，总体而言，有关现代社会的新闻质量是其社会组织的一个指标。制度越好，所有相关利益就越多地得到正式代表，问题越能得到理清，引入的客观标准越多，事件就越能完美地呈现为新闻。在最好的情况下，新闻界是制度的仆人和守护者；在最坏的情况下，它只是少数人利用社会混乱来达到自己目的的一种手段。在制度无法发挥作用的程度上，不道德的记者可能会浑水摸鱼，而有良心的记者则必须冒着不确定性的风险进行赌博。</p><p class="normal3">Therefore, on the whole, the quality of the news about modern society is an index of its social organization. The better the institutions, the more all interests concerned are formally represented, the more issues are disentangled, the more objective criteria are introduced, the more perfectly an affair can be presented as news. At its best the press is a servant and guardian of institutions; at its worst it is a means by which a few exploit social disorganization to their own ends. In the degree to which institutions fail to function, the unscrupulous journalist can fish in troubled waters, and the conscientious one must gamble with uncertainties.</p>
<p class="normal3">报刊不能代替机构。它就像探照灯的光束，不停地移动，把一个又一个事件从黑暗中带入视野。人们不能仅凭这束光来完成世界的工作。他们不能通过事件、事件和爆发来统治社会。只有当他们靠自己稳定的光来工作时，报刊在他们身上时，才能揭示出一种足够清晰的形势，以便做出民意决定。问题比报刊更深，解决办法也是如此。它存在于基于分析和记录系统的社会组织中，以及该原则的所有推论中；存在于放弃全能公民理论中，存在于决策分散中，存在于通过可比记录和分析来协调决策中。如果在管理中心有一个运行审计，使那些做这项工作的人和那些监督这项工作的人能够理解工作，那么当问题出现时，就不仅仅是盲人的碰撞了。然后，新闻也是通过情报系统向新闻界披露的，而情报系统同时也对新闻界进行了制约。</p><p class="normal3">The press is no substitute for institutions. It is like the beam of a searchlight that moves restlessly about, bringing one episode and then another out of darkness into vision. Men cannot do the work of the world by this light alone. They cannot govern society by episodes, incidents, and eruptions. It is only when they work by a steady light of their own, that the press, when it is turned upon them, reveals a situation intelligible enough for a popular decision. The trouble lies deeper than the press, and so does the remedy. It lies in social organization based on a system of analysis and record, and in all the corollaries of that principle; in the abandonment of the theory of the omnicompetent citizen, in the decentralization of decision, in the coordination of decision by comparable record and analysis. If at the centers of management there is a running audit, which makes work intelligible to those who do it, and those who superintend it, issues when they arise are not the mere collisions of the blind. Then, too, the news is uncovered for the press by a system of intelligence that is also a check upon the press.</p>
<p class="normal3">这是激进的做法。因为媒体的麻烦，就像代议制政府（无论是领土型还是功能型政府）的麻烦，就像资本主义、合作型还是共产主义工业的麻烦，都源于一个共同的根源：自治的人民未能通过发明、创造和组织知识机制来超越他们的偶然经验和偏见。正是因为他们被迫在没有可靠的世界观的情况下采取行动，政府、学校、报纸和教会才在对抗民主的更明显缺陷、对抗暴力偏见、冷漠、偏爱奇异琐事而非枯燥重要事物以及对杂耍和三条腿小牛的渴望方面取得了如此微小的进展。这是民选政府的主要缺陷，是其传统中固有的缺陷，我相信，它的所有其他缺陷都可以追溯到这一点。</p><p class="normal3">That is the radical way. For the troubles of the press, like the troubles of representative government, be it territorial or functional, like the troubles of industry, be it capitalist, cooperative, or communist, go back to a common source: to the failure of self-governing people to transcend their casual experience and their prejudice, by inventing, creating, and organizing a machinery of knowledge. It is because they are compelled to act without a reliable picture of the world, that governments, schools, newspapers and churches make such small headway against the more obvious failings of democracy, against violent prejudice, apathy, preference for the curious trivial as against the dull important, and the hunger for sideshows and three legged calves. This is the primary defect of popular government, a defect inherent in its traditions, and all its other defects can, I believe, be traced to this one.</p>

<p class="normal3">如果补救措施有趣，查尔斯·麦卡锡、罗伯特·瓦伦丁和弗雷德里克·W·泰勒等美国先驱者就不必如此努力地争取听证会了。但他们为什么要斗争，以及为什么政府研究、工业审计、预算等机构是改革中的丑小鸭，这是很清楚的。他们逆转了有趣的公众意见形成的过程。他们没有呈现一个偶然的事实、一大堆刻板印象和戏剧性的认同，而是打破了戏剧，打破了刻板印象，为人们提供了一幅事实的图景，这对他们来说是陌生的，也是非个人化的。当这并不痛苦时，它就会变得乏味，而那些感到痛苦的人，即贸易政客和有很多事情要隐瞒的党派人士，往往会利用公众感到的乏味，以消除他们感到的痛苦。</p><p class="normal3">If the remedy were interesting, American pioneers like Charles McCarthy, Robert Valentine, and Frederick W. Taylor would not have had to fight so hard for a hearing. But it is clear why they had to fight, and why bureaus of governmental research, industrial audits, budgeting and the like are the ugly ducklings of reform. They reverse the process by which interesting public opinions are built up. Instead of presenting a casual fact, a large screen of stereotypes, and a dramatic identification, they break down the drama, break through the stereotypes, and offer men a picture of facts, which is unfamiliar and to them impersonal. When this is not painful, it is dull, and those to whom it is painful, the trading politician and the partisan who has much to conceal, often exploit the dullness that the public feels, in order to remove the pain that they feel.</p>

<p class="normal3">然而，每一个复杂的社会都寻求过特殊人物、占卜者、牧师、长老的帮助。我们自己的民主，虽然是建立在普遍能力理论的基础上的，也寻求过律师来管理政府，帮助管理工业。人们认识到，受过专门训练的人在某种程度上比业余爱好者头脑中自发产生的真理体系更倾向于更广泛的真理体系。但经验表明，传统律师的装备不足以提供帮助。大社会通过应用技术知识，迅速发展到庞大的规模。它是由学会使用精确测量和定量分析的工程师建造的。人们开始发现，它不能由那些对是非进行推理思考的人来管理。它只能由创造它的技术来控制。然后，逐渐地，更开明的指导思想者开始聘请受过训练或自己受过训练的专家，让管理这个大社会的人能够理解这个大社会的某些部分。这些人有各种各样的称谓，比如统计员、会计师、审计师、工业顾问、各种工程师、科学经理、人事管理员、研究人员、“科学家”，有时他们也被称为普通的私人秘书。他们各自都带来了自己的专业术语，还有文件柜、卡片目录、图表、活页小玩意，最重要的是，他们身上都体现了完美理想的高管形象：坐在一张平顶办公桌前，面前放着一张打字纸，就以随时可以让他拒绝或批准的形式呈现的政策问题做出决定。</p><p class="normal3">Yet every complicated community has sought the assistance of special men, of augurs, priests, elders. Our own democracy, based though it was on a theory of universal competence, sought lawyers to manage its government, and to help manage its industry. It was recognized that the specially trained man was in some dim way oriented to a wider system of truth than that which arises spontaneously in the amateur's mind. But experience has shown that the traditional lawyer's equipment was not enough assistance. The Great Society had grown furiously and to colossal dimensions by the application of technical knowledge. It was made by engineers who had learned to use exact measurements and quantitative analysis. It could not be governed, men began to discover, by men who thought deductively about rights and wrongs. It could be brought under human control only by the technic which had created it. Gradually, then, the more enlightened directing minds have called in experts who were trained, or had trained themselves, to make parts of this Great Society intelligible to those who manage it. These men are known by all kinds of names, as statisticians, accountants, auditors, industrial counsellors, engineers of many species, scientific managers, personnel administrators, research men, "scientists," and sometimes just as plain private secretaries. They have brought with them each a jargon of his own, as well as filing cabinets, card catalogues, graphs, loose-leaf contraptions, and above all the perfectly sound ideal of an executive who sits before a flat-top desk, one sheet of typewritten paper before him, and decides on matters of policy presented in a form ready for his rejection or approval.</p>
<p class="normal3">整个发展过程与其说是自发的创造性进化，倒不如说是盲目的自然选择。政治家、行政人员、政党领袖、志愿协会的负责人发现，如果他一天要讨论二十多个不同的主题，就必须有人指导他。他开始吵着要备忘录。他发现自己读不懂邮件。他要求有人用铅笔勾掉重要信件中有趣的句子。他发现自己无法消化桌上堆积如山的打字报告。他要求摘要。他发现自己读不懂一连串没完没了的数字。他拥抱了那些给这些数字制作彩色图片的人。他发现自己真的分不清机器与机器。他雇佣工程师挑选机器，告诉他它们的价格和用途。他卸下了一个又一个负担，就像一个人在努力搬动笨重的负载时，先脱下帽子，然后脱下外套，然后脱下衣领一样。</p><p class="normal3">This whole development has been the work, not so much of a spontaneous creative evolution, as of blind natural selection. The statesman, the executive, the party leader, the head of a voluntary association, found that if he had to discuss two dozen different subjects in the course of the day, somebody would have to coach him. He began to clamor for memoranda. He found he could not read his mail. He demanded somebody who would blue-pencil the interesting sentences in the important letters. He found he could not digest the great stacks of type-written reports that grew mellow on his desk. He demanded summaries. He found he could not read an unending series of figures. He embraced the man who made colored pictures of them. He found that he really did not know one machine from another. He hired engineers to pick them, and tell him how much they cost and what they could do. He peeled off one burden after another, as a man will take off first his hat, then his coat, then his collar, when he is struggling to move an unwieldy load.</p>

<p class="normal3">然而奇怪的是，尽管他知道自己需要帮助，但他迟迟没有向社会科学家求助。化学家、物理学家、地质学家受到的欢迎要早得多，也更友好。他们设立了实验室，并提供了诱因，因为他们很快就意识到战胜自然的胜利。但以人性为问题的科学家则不同。原因有很多：最主要的是，他几乎没有什么胜利可展示。他之所以如此少，是因为除非他处理历史，否则他无法在向公众提供理论之前证明自己的理论。物理学家可以提出假设，进行测试，数百次修改假设，如果经过所有这些，他错了，没有人需要为此付出代价。但社会科学家无法提供实验室测试的保证，如果听从了他的建议，结果错了，后果可能是无法估量的。从本质上讲，他要承担更大的责任，也更不确定。</p><p class="normal3">Yet curiously enough, though he knew that he needed help, he was slow to call in the social scientist. The chemist, the physicist, the geologist, had a much earlier and more friendly reception. Laboratories were set up for them, inducements offered, for there was quick appreciation of the victories over nature. But the scientist who has human nature as his problem is in a different case. There are many reasons for this: the chief one, that he has so few victories to exhibit. He has so few, because unless he deals with the historic past, he cannot prove his theories before offering them to the public. The physical scientist can make an hypothesis, test it, revise the hypothesis hundreds of times, and, if after all that, he is wrong, no one else has to pay the price. But the social scientist cannot begin to offer the assurance of a laboratory test, and if his advice is followed, and he is wrong, the consequences may be incalculable. He is in the nature of things far more responsible, and far less certain.</p>
<p class="normal3">但不仅如此。在实验科学中，学生已经克服了思想和行动的两难境地。他将行动样本带到一个安静的地方，在那里可以随意重复，并在闲暇时进行检查。但社会科学家却经常陷入两难境地。如果他呆在图书馆里，有闲暇思考，他就必须依靠通过官方报告、报纸和采访得到的极其随意和贫乏的印刷记录。如果他走进正在发生事情的“世界”，他必须经历一段漫长的、往往是浪费时间的学徒期，才能被允许进入正在做出决定的圣殿。他不能做的是，只要适合他，就立即行动，然后又退出。没有特权听众。实务人士观察到，社会科学家只是从外部了解他所知道的事情，至少部分是从内部了解，认识到社会科学家的假设不是能够通过实验室证明的事物的本质，而且只有在“现实”世界中才有可能得到验证，因此，对那些不同意他的公共政策观点的社会科学家的评价相当低。</p><p class="normal3">But more than that. In the laboratory sciences the student has conquered the dilemma of thought and action. He brings a sample of the action to a quiet place, where it can be repeated at will, and examined at leisure. But the social scientist is constantly being impaled on a dilemma. If he stays in his library, where he has the leisure to think, he has to rely upon the exceedingly casual and meager printed record that comes to him through official reports, newspapers, and interviews. If he goes out into "the world" where things are happening, he has to serve a long, often wasteful, apprenticeship, before he is admitted to the sanctum where they are being decided. What he cannot do is to dip into action and out again whenever it suits him. There are no privileged listeners. The man of affairs, observing that the social scientist knows only from the outside what he knows, in part at least, from the inside, recognizing that the social scientist's hypothesis is not in the nature of things susceptible of laboratory proof, and that verification is possible only in the "real" world, has developed a rather low opinion of social scientists who do not share his views of public policy.</p>
<p class="normal3">社会科学家在内心深处也这样评价自己。他对自己的工作缺乏内在的确定性。他只是半信半疑，而且由于什么都不确定，他找不到任何令人信服的理由来坚持自己的思想自由。根据他自己的良心，他究竟能为此主张什么呢？他所获得的数据不确定，他缺乏验证手段。他身上最优秀的品质也令人沮丧。因为如果他真的具有批判精神和科学精神，他就不可能成为教条主义者，为了一个他不确定的理论而与校董、学生、公民联合会和保守派媒体进行世界末日决战。如果你要走向世界末日决战，你就必须为上帝而战，但政治学家总是有点怀疑上帝是否召唤了他。</p><p class="normal3">In his heart of hearts the social scientist shares this estimate of himself. He has little inner certainty about his own work. He only half believes in it, and being sure of nothing, he can find no compelling reason for insisting on his own freedom of thought. What can he actually claim for it, in the light of his own conscience? His data are uncertain, his means of verification lacking. The very best qualities in him are a source of frustration. For if he is really critical and saturated in the scientific spirit, he cannot be doctrinaire, and go to Armageddon against the trustees and the students and the Civic Federation and the conservative press for a theory of which he is not sure. If you are going to Armageddon, you have to battle for the Lord, but the political scientist is always a little doubtful whether the Lord called him.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，如果社会科学如此多的内容是辩护性的而非建设性的，那么解释就在于社会科学的机会，而不是“资本主义”。物理学家通过制定出一种能够得出无法压制或忽视的结论的方法，摆脱了教权主义。他们说服了自己，获得了尊严，并且知道他们在为何而战。社会科学家在制定出自己的方法后，将获得尊严和力量。他将通过把大社会领导者对分析工具的需求转化为机会来做到这一点，通过分析工具，一种看不见的、可理解的现象得以显现。</p><p class="normal3">Consequently if so much of social science is apologetic rather than constructive, the explanation lies in the opportunities of social science, not in "capitalism." The physical scientists achieved their freedom from clericalism by working out a method that produced conclusions of a sort that could not be suppressed or ignored. They convinced themselves and acquired dignity, and knew what they were fighting for. The social scientist will acquire his dignity and his strength when he has worked out his method. He will do that by turning into opportunity the need among directing men of the Great Society for instruments of analysis by which an invisible and made intelligible.</p>
<p class="normal3">但就目前的情况来看，社会科学家从大量不相关的材料中收集数据。社会过程是断断续续地记录下来的，通常是作为行政事故。一份提交给国会的报告、一场辩论、一项调查、一份法律摘要、一份人口普查、一项关税、一份税表；这些材料，就像皮尔当人的头骨一样，必须通过巧妙的推理拼凑起来，学生才能对他所研究的事件有任何印象。虽然它涉及同胞的有意识生活，但它往往令人沮丧地晦涩难懂，因为试图概括的人几乎没有监督他的数据收集方式。想象一下，医学研究是由那些很少去医院、被剥夺动物实验机会、被迫从病人的故事、护士的报告（每个护士都有自己的诊断系统）和国内税收局编制的关于药剂师超额利润的统计数据中得出结论的学生进行的。社会科学家通常必须从执行法律的官员或试图辩护、说服、主张或证明的官员头脑中不加批判地形成的范畴中找出他能做的。学生知道这一点，为了防止这种情况发生，他们发展了学术研究的这一分支，即对哪些地方可以忽略自己的信息进行了精心的怀疑。</p><p class="normal3">But as things go now, the social scientist assembles his data out of a mass of unrelated material. Social processes are recorded spasmodically, quite often as accidents of administration. A report to Congress, a debate, an investigation, legal briefs, a census, a tariff, a tax schedule; the material, like the skull of the Piltdown man, has to be put together by ingenious inference before the student obtains any sort of picture of the event he is studying. Though it deals with the conscious life of his fellow citizens, it is all too often distressingly opaque, because the man who is trying to generalize has practically no supervision of the way his data are collected. Imagine medical research conducted by students who could rarely go into a hospital, were deprived of animal experiment, and compelled to draw conclusions from the stories of people who had been ill, the reports of nurses, each of whom had her own system of diagnosis, and the statistics compiled by the Bureau of Internal Revenue on the excess profits of druggists. The social scientist has usually to make what he can out of categories that were uncritically in the mind of an official who administered some part of a law, or who was out to justify, to persuade, to claim, or to prove. The student knows this, and, as a protection against it, has developed that branch of scholarship which is an elaborated suspicion about where to discount his information.</p>
<p class="normal3">这是一种美德，但是当它只是对社会科学不健康立场的一种纠正时，它就变得非常单薄了。因为学者注定要尽可能精明地猜测为什么在不清楚的情况下会发生某事或某事。但是，作为代表之间的调解人以及作为管理的镜子和衡量标准的专家，对事实的控制却截然不同。他不再是从行动者提供给他的事实中进行概括的人，而是成为为行动者准备事实的人。这是他战略地位的深刻变化。他不再站在外面，咀嚼忙碌的事务人员提供的东西，而是站在决策的前面而不是后面。今天的顺序是，事务人员找到事实，并根据事实做出决定；然后，一段时间后，社会科学家推断出他做出或没有做出明智决定的极好理由。这种事后关系是学术性的，在这个好词的坏意义上。真正的顺序应该是，公正的专家首先为行动者寻找和表述事实，然后通过对他所理解的决策和他所组织的事实进行比较，做出其所能做出的明智决定。</p><p class="normal3">That is a virtue, but it becomes a very thin virtue when it is merely a corrective for the unwholesome position of social science. For the scholar is condemned to guess as shrewdly as he can why in a situation not clearly understood something or other may have happened. But the expert who is employed as the mediator among representatives, and as the mirror and measure of administration, has a very different control of the facts. Instead of being the man who generalizes from the facts dropped to him by the men of action, he becomes the man who prepares the facts for the men of action. This is a profound change in his strategic position. He no longer stands outside, chewing the cud provided by busy men of affairs, but he takes his place in front of decision instead of behind it. To-day the sequence is that the man of affairs finds his facts, and decides on the basis of them; then, some time later, the social scientist deduces excellent reasons why he did or did not decide wisely. This ex post facto relationship is academic in the bad sense of that fine word. The real sequence should be one where the disinterested expert first finds and formulates the facts for the man of action, and later makes what wisdom he can out of comparison between the decision, which he understands, and the facts, which he organized.</p>

<p class="normal3">对于自然科学而言，这种战略地位的变化开始缓慢，然后迅速加速。曾经有一段时间，发明家和工程师是浪漫的、半饥不饱的局外人，被当作怪人对待。商人和工匠知道他们手艺的所有奥秘。然后这些奥秘变得更加神秘，最后工业开始依赖于肉眼无法看到、只有受过训练的头脑才能想象的物理定律和化学组合。科学家从拉丁区的高贵阁楼搬进了办公楼和实验室。因为只有他才能构建出工业所依赖的现实的工作形象。从这种新的关系中，他得到的和付出的一样多，也许更多：纯科学的发展速度比应用科学快，尽管它的经济支持、大量灵感，甚至更多的相关性，都来自与实际决策的不断接触。但自然科学仍然受到巨大的限制，即决策者只能依靠常识来指导他们。他们在没有科学帮助的情况下管理着一个被科学家复杂化的世界。他们再次不得不处理他们无法理解的事实，正如他们曾经不得不请工程师一样，现在他们不得不请统计学家、会计师和各种各样的专家。</p><p class="normal3">For the physical sciences this change in strategic position began slowly, and then accelerated rapidly. There was a time when the inventor and the engineer were romantic half-starved outsiders, treated as cranks. The business man and the artisan knew all the mysteries of their craft. Then the mysteries grew more mysterious, and at last industry began to depend upon physical laws and chemical combinations that no eye could see, and only a trained mind could conceive. The scientist moved from his noble garret in the Latin Quarter into office buildings and laboratories. For he alone could construct a working image of the reality on which industry rested. From the new relationship he took as much as he gave, perhaps more: pure science developed faster than applied, though it drew its economic support, a great deal of its inspiration, and even more of its relevancy, from constant contact with practical decision. But physical science still labored under the enormous limitation that the men who made decisions had only their commonsense to guide them. They administered without scientific aid a world complicated by scientists. Again they had to deal with facts they could not apprehend, and as once they had to call in engineers, they now have to call in statisticians, accountants, experts of all sorts.</p>
<p class="normal3">这些实践型的学生是新社会科学的真正先驱。他们“与驱动轮紧密相连”，从科学和行动的这种实践互动中，两者都将受益匪浅：行动通过澄清其信念而受益；信念通过不断的行动检验而受益。我们正处于最初的开端。但如果承认所有大型人类协会形式都必须包含那些会认识到需要专家报告其特定环境的人，那么想象力就有了一个可以发挥作用的前提。我认为，在专家人员之间交换技术和结果时，我们可以看到社会科学实验方法的开始。当每个学区和预算、卫生部门、工厂和关税表成为彼此的知识材料时，可比经验的数量就开始接近真正的实验的规模。在 48 个州、2400 个城市、277,000 所学校、270,000 家制造企业、27,000 个矿场和采石场，只要记录下来并可供查阅，就有丰富的经验。而且，还有机会进行试验和犯错，风险很小，任何合理的假设都可以得到公平的检验，而不会动摇社会的基础。</p><p class="normal3">These practical students are the true pioneers of a new social science. They are "in mesh with the driving wheels" and from this practical engagement of science and action, both will benefit radically: action by the clarification of its beliefs; beliefs by a continuing test in action. We are in the earliest beginnings. But if it is conceded that all large forms of human association must, because of sheer practical difficulty, contain men who will come to see the need for an expert reporting of their particular environment, then the imagination has a premise on which to work. In the exchange of technic and result among expert staffs, one can see, I think, the beginning of experimental method in social science. When each school district and budget, and health department, and factory, and tariff schedule, is the material of knowledge for every other, the number of comparable experiences begins to approach the dimensions of genuine experiment. In forty-eight states, and 2400 cities, and 277,000 school houses, 270,000 manufacturing establishments, 27,000 mines and quarries, there is a wealth of experience, if only it were recorded and available. And there is, too, opportunity for trial and error at such slight risk that any reasonable hypothesis might be given a fair test without shaking the foundations of society.</p>
<p class="normal3">造成这种分歧的不仅是一些工业主管和一些不得不寻求帮助的政治家，还有市政研究局、立法参考图书馆、企业和工会及公共事业的专门游说团体，还有妇女选民联盟、消费者联盟、制造商协会等志愿组织、数百个行业协会和公民联盟、《国会探照灯》和《调查》等出版物以及普通教育委员会等基金会。但并非所有人都不关心此事。这不是重点。所有这些组织都开始表明，需要在普通公民和他所处的广阔环境之间介入某种形式的专业知识。</p><p class="normal3">The wedge has been driven, not only by some directors of industry and some statesmen who had to have help, but by the bureaus of municipal research, the legislative reference libraries, the specialized lobbies of corporations and trade unions and public causes, and by voluntary organizations like the League of Women Voters, the Consumers' League, the Manufacturers' Associations: by hundreds of trade associations, and citizens' unions; by publications like the Searchlight on Congress and the Survey; and by foundations like the General Education Board. Not all by any means are disinterested. That is not the point. All of them do begin to demonstrate the need for interposing some form of expertness between the private citizen and the vast environment in which he is entangled.</p>

<p class="normal3">民主的实践已经超越了其理论。因为该理论认为，成年选民共同做出的决定是基于他们内心的意愿。但正如理论上看不见的统治阶层逐渐形成一样，也出现了大量建设性的适应，这些适应在民主的形象中也未得到体现。人们已经找到了代表许多通常看不见的利益和职能的方法。</p><p class="normal3">THE practice of democracy has been ahead of its theory. For the theory holds that the adult electors taken together make decisions out of a will that is in them.

Ways have been found to represent many interests and functions that are normally out of sight.</p>
<p class="normal3">我们在法院理论中对此最为清楚，我们解释法院的立法权和否决权时，认为有些利益需要保护，而这些利益可能会被民选官员遗忘。但是，人口普查局在统计、分类和关联人、事和变化时，也代表了环境中看不见的因素。地质调查局使矿产资源显而易见，农业部在国家委员会中代表每个农民只看到其中很小一部分的因素。学校当局、关税委员会、领事服务、国内税收局代表了个人、思想和事物，而选举永远不会自动代表这些个人、思想和事物。儿童局是选民通常看不到的一系列利益和职能的代言人，因此无法自发成为选民舆论的一部分。因此，婴儿死亡率的比较统计数据的印刷往往会导致婴儿死亡率的下降。在公布之前，市政官员和选民们并没有在他们心中为这些婴儿留下任何位置。统计数据让这些婴儿的情况显而易见，就像这些婴儿选出一位市议员来表达他们的不满一样。</p><p class="normal3">We are most conscious of this in our theory of the courts, when we explain their legislative powers and their vetoes on the theory that there are interests to be guarded which might be forgotten by the elected officials. But the Census Bureau, when it counts, classifies, and correlates people, things, and changes, is also speaking for unseen factors in the environment. The Geological Survey makes mineral resources evident, the Department of Agriculture represents in the councils of the nation factors of which each farmer sees only an infinitesimal part. School authorities, the Tariff Commission, the consular service, the Bureau of Internal Revenue give representation to persons, ideas, and objects which would never automatically find themselves represented in this perspective by an election. The Children's Bureau is the spokesman of a whole complex of interests and functions not ordinarily visible to the voter, and, therefore, incapable of becoming spontaneously a part of his public opinions. Thus the printing of comparative statistics of infant mortality is often followed by a reduction of the death rate of babies. Municipal officials and voters did not have, before publication, a place in their picture of the environment for those babies. The statistics made them visible, as visible as if the babies had elected an alderman to air their grievances.</p>
<p class="normal3">美国政府在国务院设有一个远东事务司。它是干什么用的？日本和中国政府都在华盛顿设有大使。难道他们没有资格代表远东发言吗？他们是远东的代表。然而，没有人会否认，通过咨询这些大使，美国政府可以了解它需要了解的所有远东信息。即使他们尽可能坦诚，他们仍然是有限的信息渠道。因此，为了补充这些渠道，我们在东京和北京设有大使馆，在许多地方设有领事代理。我想，还有一些秘密特工。这些人应该将通过远东事务司的报告发送给国务卿。那么，国务卿对远东事务司有什么期望呢？我知道有人希望它花掉拨款。但有些国务卿得不到特殊启示，于是他们向自己的部门寻求帮助。他们最不希望找到的就是一个为美国立场辩护的巧妙论据。</p><p class="normal3">In the State Department the government maintains a Division of Far Eastern Affairs. What is it for? The Japanese and the Chinese Governments both maintain ambassadors in Washington. Are they not qualified to speak for the Far East? They are its representatives. Yet nobody would argue that the American Government could learn all that it needed to know about the Far East by consulting these ambassadors. Supposing them to be as candid as they know how to be, they are still limited channels of information. Therefore, to supplement them we maintain embassies in Tokio and Peking, and consular agents at many points. Also, I assume, some secret agents. These people are supposed to send reports which pass through the Division of Far Eastern Affairs to the Secretary of State. Now what does the Secretary expect of the Division? I know one who expected it to spend its appropriation. But there are Secretaries to whom special revelation is denied, and they turn to their divisions for help. The last thing they expect to find is a neat argument justifying the American position.</p>
<p class="normal3">他们要求专家们把远东问题带到国务卿的办公桌上，把所有要素都联系起来，就好像国务卿与远东本身接触一样。专家必须翻译、简化、概括，但结果的推论必须适用于东方，而不仅仅是报告的前提。如果国务卿是称职的，他最不能容忍的就是专家们怀疑他们有“政策”。他不想从他们那里知道他们是否喜欢日本对华政策。他想知道不同阶层的中国人、日本人、英国人、法国人、德国人和俄罗斯人对此有何看法，以及他们可能会根据自己的想法做什么。他希望把所有这些情况都反映给他，作为他做决定的基础。该部门越能忠实地代表日本或美国大使或太平洋海岸的参议员和众议员没有代表的东西，他就越能成为一个优秀的国务卿。他可能决定采用太平洋海岸的政策，但他对日本的看法将沿袭日本的立场。</p><p class="normal3">What they demand is that the experts shall bring the Far East to the Secretary's desk, with all the elements in such relation that it is as if he were in contact with the Far East itself. The expert must translate, simplify, generalize, but the inference from the result must apply in the East, not merely on the premises of the report. If the Secretary is worth his salt, the very last thing he will tolerate in his experts is the suspicion that they have a "policy." He does not want to know from them whether they like Japanese policy in China. He wants to know what different classes of Chinese and Japanese, English, Frenchmen, Germans, and Russians, think about it, and what they are likely to do because of what they think. He wants all that represented to him as the basis of his decision. The more faithfully the Division represents what is not otherwise represented, either by the Japanese or American ambassadors, or the Senators and Congressmen from the Pacific coast, the better Secretary of State he will be. He may decide to take his policy from the Pacific Coast, but he will take his view of Japan from Japan.</p>

<p class="normal3">世界上最好的外交服务是知识的汇集和政策的控制最完美地分离的，这绝非偶然。战争期间，许多英国大使馆和英国外交部几乎总是有一些人，无论是常任官员还是特别任命的官员，他们都非常成功地忽视了当时盛行的战争思想。他们抛弃了赞成和反对的繁文缛节，抛弃了偏爱的国籍、讨厌的事物和怀揣未发表的演说。他们把这些留给了政治领袖。但在一家美国大使馆，我曾听到一位大使说，他从不向华盛顿报告任何不能让国内人民高兴的事情。他迷住了所有遇到他的人，帮助了许多滞留的战争工人，当他揭幕一座纪念碑时，他表现得非常出色。</p><p class="normal3">It is no accident that the best diplomatic service in the world is the one in which the divorce between the assembling of knowledge and the control of policy is most perfect. During the war in many British Embassies and in the British Foreign Office there were nearly always men, permanent officials or else special appointees, who quite successfully discounted the prevailing war mind. They discarded the rigmarole of being pro and con, of having favorite nationalities, and pet aversions, and undelivered perorations in their bosoms. They left that to the political chiefs. But in an American Embassy I once heard an ambassador say that he never reported anything to Washington which would not cheer up the folks at home. He charmed all those who met him, helped many a stranded war worker, and was superb when he unveiled a monument.</p>
<p class="normal3">他没有理解专家的权力取决于将自己与决策者分开，取决于他自己对所作的决定毫不关心。像大使一样，采取某种路线并干预决策的人很快就会被忽视。他就是这样，只是问题那一边的又一个。因为当他开始过于关心时，他开始看到他希望看到的东西，而事实上，他不再看到他应该看到的东西。他代表看不见的东西。他代表不是选民的人、不明显的选民职能、看不见的事件、哑巴、未出生的人、事物与人之间的关系。他拥有无形的选民群体。而无形的东西不能用来形成政治多数，因为投票归根结底是力量的考验，是升华的战斗，而专家并不代表眼前的力量。但他可以通过扰乱力量的排列来行使力量。通过使无形变为有形，他为那些运用物质力量的人提供了新的环境，在他们心中植入思想和情感，使他们失去原有的地位，从而以最深刻的方式影响了决策。</p><p class="normal3">He did not understand that the power of the expert depends upon separating himself from those who make the decisions, upon not caring, in his expert self, what decision is made. The man who, like the ambassador, takes a line, and meddles with the decision, is soon discounted. There he is, just one more on that side of the question. For when he begins to care too much, he begins to see what he wishes to see, and by that fact ceases to see what he is there to see. He is there to represent the unseen. He represents people who are not voters, functions of voters that are not evident, events that are out of sight, mute people, unborn people, relations between things and people. He has a constituency of intangibles. And intangibles cannot be used to form a political majority, because voting is in the last analysis a test of strength, a sublimated battle, and the expert represents no strength available in the immediate. But he can exercise force by disturbing the line up of the forces. By making the invisible visible, he confronts the people who exercise material force with a new environment, sets ideas and feelings at work in them, throws them out of position, and so, in the profoundest way, affects the decision.</p>
<p class="normal3">人们不可能长期以他们知道与他们所设想的环境相矛盾的方式行事。如果他们执意要以某种方式行事，他们就必须重新设想环境，他们必须审查，合理化。但是，如果他们面前有一个如此突出的事实，以至于他们无法解释，那么他们有三种选择。他们可以固执地忽视它，尽管他们会在这个过程中陷入困境，会过度扮演自己的角色并遭遇不幸。他们可以考虑它但拒绝采取行动。他们付出的代价是内心的不适和沮丧。或者，我认为这是最常见的情况，他们会调整自己的整个行为以适应扩大的环境。</p><p class="normal3">Men cannot long act in a way that they know is a contradiction of the environment as they conceive it. If they are bent on acting in a certain way they have to reconceive the environment, they have to censor out, to rationalize. But if in their presence, there is an insistent fact which is so obtrusive that they cannot explain it away, one of three courses is open. They can perversely ignore it, though they will cripple themselves in the process, will overact their part and come to grief. They can take it into account but refuse to act. They pay in internal discomfort and frustration. Or, and I believe this to be the most frequent case, they adjust their whole behavior to the enlarged environment.</p>
<p class="normal3">认为专家让别人做决定，所以他是一个无能的人，这种想法与经验完全相反。决策中的因素越微妙，专家所拥有的不负责任的权力就越大。而且，他将来肯定会比以前行使更多的权力，因为选民和行政人员越来越无法了解相关事实。所有管理机构都倾向于组织研究和信息机构，这些机构将伸出触角并不断扩张，就像世界上所有军队的情报部门一样。但专家仍然是人。他们将享有权力，他们的诱惑是任命自己为审查员，从而吸收决策的真正职能。除非他们的职能得到正确界定，否则他们往往会传递他们认为合适的事实，并传递他们批准的决定。简而言之，他们往往会成为一个官僚机构。</p><p class="normal3">The idea that the expert is an ineffectual person because he lets others make the decisions is quite contrary to experience. The more subtle the elements that enter into the decision, the more irresponsible power the expert wields. He is certain, moreover, to exercise more power in the future than ever he did before, because increasingly the relevant facts will elude the voter and the administrator. All governing agencies will tend to organize bodies of research and information, which will throw out tentacles and expand, as have the intelligence departments of all the armies in the world. But the experts will remain human beings. They will enjoy power, and their temptation will be to appoint themselves censors, and so absorb the real function of decision. Unless their function is correctly defined they will tend to pass on the facts they think appropriate, and to pass down the decisions they approve. They will tend, in short, to become a bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="normal3">唯一的制度保障是尽可能将执行人员与调查人员完全分开。这两个机构应该是平行但又截然不同的人员队伍，以不同的方式招募，如果可能的话，从不同的资金中支付工资，对不同的负责人负责，本质上对彼此的个人成功不感兴趣。在工业中，审计师、会计师和检查员应该独立于经理、主管、工头，我相信，随着时间的推移，我们将会看到，为了将工业置于社会控制之下，记录机制必须独立于董事会和股东。</p><p class="normal3">The only institutional safeguard is to separate as absolutely as it is possible to do so the staff which executes from the staff which investigates. The two should be parallel but quite distinct bodies of men, recruited differently, paid if possible from separate funds, responsible to different heads, intrinsically uninterested in each other's personal success. In industry, the auditors, accountants, and inspectors should be independent of the manager, the superintendents, foremen, and in time, I believe, we shall come to see that in order to bring industry under social control the machinery of record will have to be independent of the boards of directors and the shareholders.</p>

<p class="normal3">但在建立工业和政治情报部门时，我们并非从一片空白开始。而且，除了坚持这种基本的职能分离外，过于精确地坚持该原则在任何特定情况下应采取的形式也是很麻烦的。有些人相信情报工作，并会采纳它；有些人不理解它，但没有它就无法开展工作；有些人会抵制它。但只要该原则在每个社会机构的某个地方都有立足之地，它就会取得进展，而开始的方式就是开始。例如，在联邦政府中，没有必要理清行政混乱和一个世纪发展中不合逻辑的重复，以便为华盛顿急需的情报局找到一个整洁的地方。在选举之前，你可以承诺勇敢地冲进缺口。但当你气喘吁吁地到达那里时，你会发现每一个荒谬之处都带有习惯、强烈的利益和亲密的国会议员。从各个方面发起攻击，你就会与每一种反动力量交战。正如诗人所说，你上战场，你总会倒下。你可以在这里砍掉一个过时的局，在那里砍掉一群职员，你可以合并两个局。到那时，你就会忙于关税和铁路，改革时代就结束了。此外，为了实现真正合乎逻辑的政府改组，正如所有候选人总是承诺的那样，你必须激起比你平息的更多的激情。任何新的计划，假设你已经准备好了，都需要官员来执行。不管人们对公职人员有什么看法，即使是苏维埃俄罗斯也很高兴能把许多老官员带回来；如果这些老官员受到太无情的对待，就会破坏乌托邦本身。</p><p class="normal3">But in building the intelligence sections of industry and politics, we do not start on cleared ground. And, apart from insisting on this basic separation of function, it would be cumbersome to insist too precisely on the form which in any particular instance the principle shall take. There are men who believe in intelligence work, and will adopt it; there are men who do not understand it, but cannot do their work without it; there are men who will resist. But provided the principle has a foothold somewhere in every social agency it will make progress, and the way to begin is to begin. In the federal government, for example, it is not necessary to straighten out the administrative tangle and the illogical duplications of a century's growth in order to find a neat place for the intelligence bureaus which Washington so badly needs. Before election you can promise to rush bravely into the breach. But when you arrive there all out of breath, you find that each absurdity is invested with habits, strong interests, and chummy Congressmen. Attack all along the line and you engage every force of reaction. You go forth to battle, as the poet said, and you always fall. You can lop off an antiquated bureau here, a covey of clerks there, you can combine two bureaus. And by that time you are busy with the tariff and the railroads, and the era of reform is over. Besides, in order to effect a truly logical reorganization of the government, such as all candidates always promise, you would have to disturb more passions than you have time to quell. And any new scheme, supposing you had one ready, would require officials to man it. Say what one will about officeholders, even Soviet Russia was glad to get many of the old ones back; and these old officials, if they are too ruthlessly treated, will sabotage Utopia itself.</p>
<p class="normal3">没有善意，任何行政计划都行不通，没有教育，对奇怪做法的善意就不可能实现。更好的方法是，在现有机制中，只要你能找到机会，就引入一些机构，这些机构可以每周、每月照镜子。这样，你就可以希望让机器的操作者、负责的首领和外部公众都能看到它。当官员开始看清自己时——或者更确切地说，当局外人、首领和下属都开始看到同样的事实，如果你愿意的话，同样的谴责事实，阻碍就会减少。改革者认为某个部门效率低下只是他的观点，在部门眼中，这种观点并不像它自己的观点那么好。但是，如果分析和记录该部门的工作，然后与其他部门和私营公司进行比较，争论就会转移到另一个层面。</p><p class="normal3">No administrative scheme is workable without good will, and good will about strange practices is impossible without education. The better way is to introduce into the existing machinery, wherever you can find an opening, agencies that will hold up a mirror week by week, month by month. You can hope, then, to make the machine visible to those who work it, as well as to the chiefs who are responsible, and to the public outside. When the office-holders begin to see themselves,—or rather when the outsiders, the chiefs, and the subordinates all begin to see the same facts, the same damning facts if you like, the obstruction will diminish. The reformer's opinion that a certain bureau is inefficient is just his opinion, not so good an opinion in the eyes of the bureau, as its own. But let the work of that bureau be analysed and recorded, and then compared with other bureaus and with private corporations, and the argument moves to another plane.</p>
<p class="normal3">华盛顿有十个部门代表内阁。那么假设每个部门都有一个常设情报部门。那么，要达到有效性，需要哪些条件呢？最重要的是，情报官员应该独立于负责该部门的国会委员会和部长；他们不应该卷入决策或行动中。那么，独立性主要取决于三个方面：资金、任期和获取事实的渠道。因为很明显，如果某个国会或部门官员可以剥夺他们的资金、解雇他们或关闭档案，那么工作人员就成了他们的傀儡。</p><p class="normal3">There are ten departments at Washington represented in the Cabinet. Suppose, then, there was a permanent intelligence section for each. What would be some of the conditions of effectiveness? Beyond all others that the intelligence officials should be independent both of the Congressional Committees dealing with that department, and of the Secretary at the head of it; that they should not be entangled either in decision or in action. Independence, then, would turn mainly on three points on funds, tenure, and access to the facts. For clearly if a particular Congress or departmental official can deprive them of money, dismiss them, or close the files, the staff becomes its creature.</p>

<p class="normal3">资金问题既重要又困难。如果一个研究机构每年都依赖于国会的救济金，那么它就不可能真正自由，而国会可能嫉妒或吝啬。然而，资金的最终控制权不能从立法机构手中夺走。财务安排应确保工作人员免受左撇子、小丑和骑手攻击，免受狡猾破坏，同时应为增长提供保障。工作人员应该根深蒂固，以至于对其存在的攻击必须公开进行。也许，它可能在联邦宪章的背后工作，设立一个信托基金，并根据情报局所属部门的拨款情况，在几年内按比例浮动。无论如何，这不会涉及大笔资金。信托基金可以支付一定最低限度工作人员的管理费用和资本费用，浮动比例可以支付扩大费用。无论如何，拨款应该像支付任何长期债务一样，避免意外。与通过宪法修正案或发行政府债券相比，这是一种“束缚国会手脚”的不太严重的方法。国会可以废除宪章。但它必须废除它，而不是给它设置障碍。</p><p class="normal3">The question of funds is both important and difficult. No agency of research can be really free if it depends upon annual doles from what may be a jealous or a parsimonious congress. Yet the ultimate control of funds cannot be removed from the legislature. The financial arrangement should insure the staff against left-handed, joker and rider attack, against sly destruction, and should at the same time provide for growth. The staff should be so well entrenched that an attack on its existence would have to be made in the open. It might, perhaps, work behind a federal charter creating a trust fund, and a sliding scale over a period of years based on the appropriation for the department to which the intelligence bureau belonged. No great sums of money are involved anyway. The trust fund might cover the overhead and capital charges for a certain minimum staff, the sliding scale might cover the enlargements. At any rate the appropriation should be put beyond accident, like the payment of any long term obligation. This is a much less serious way of "tying the hands of Congress" than is the passage of a Constitutional amendment or the issuance of government bonds. Congress could repeal the charter. But it would have to repeal it, not throw monkey wrenches into it.</p>
<p class="normal3">任期应为终身，退休后可领取丰厚的退休金，休假年限用于高级学习和培训，只有在经过专业同事的试用后才能被解雇。适用于任何非盈利性知识分子职业的条件也应适用于此。如果这项工作要引人注目，从事这项工作的人必须有尊严、有保障，至少在高层，还要有思想自由，而这种自由只有在人们不太直接参与实际决策的地方才能找到。</p><p class="normal3">Tenure should be for life, with provision for retirement on a liberal pension, with sabbatical years set aside for advanced study and training, and with dismissal only after a trial by professional colleagues. The conditions which apply to any non-profit-making intellectual career should apply here. If the work is to be salient, the men who do it must have dignity, security, and, in the upper ranks at least, that freedom of mind which you find only where men are not too immediately concerned in practical decision.</p>
<p class="normal3">组织法中应规定查阅材料的权限。该局应有权审查所有文件，并质询任何官员或局外人。这种持续的调查与现在已成为我们政府常见特征的耸人听闻的立法调查和断断续续的钓鱼调查完全不同。该局应有权向部门提出会计方法建议，如果建议被拒绝或在被接受后遭到违反，则可根据其章程向国会提出上诉。</p><p class="normal3">Access to the materials should be established in the organic act. The bureau should have the right to examine all papers, and to question any official or any outsider. Continuous investigation of this sort would not at all resemble the sensational legislative inquiry and the spasmodic fishing expedition which are now a common feature of our government. The bureau should have the right to propose accounting methods to the department, and if the proposal is rejected, or violated after it has been accepted, to appeal under its charter to Congress.</p>
<p class="normal3">首先，每个情报局都将成为国会和国防部之间的纽带，在我看来，这种纽带比内阁官员同时出现在众议院和参议院更佳，尽管一个提议绝不会排斥另一个。情报局将成为国会对其政策执行情况的监督。它将成为国防部对国会批评的回应。然后，由于国防部的运作将永远可见，国会也许将不再需要那些因不信任和错误的三权分立原则而产生的细致立法，而这些立法使有效的行政管理变得非常困难。</p><p class="normal3">In the first instance each intelligence bureau would be the connecting link between Congress and the Department, a better link, in my judgment, than the appearance of cabinet officers on the floor of both House and Senate, though the one proposal in no way excludes the other. The bureau would be the Congressional eye on the execution of its policy. It would be the departmental answer to Congressional criticism. And then, since operation of the Department would be permanently visible, perhaps Congress would cease to feel the need of that minute legislation born of distrust and a false doctrine of the separation of powers, which does so much to make efficient administration difficult.</p>

<p class="normal3">但是，当然，这十个局不可能各自独立工作。他们之间的相互关系是实现“协调”的最佳机会，而人们对此知之甚多，见之甚少。显然，各参谋部需要尽可能采用可比的测量标准。他们会交换记录。这样，如果陆军部和邮政局都购买木材、雇用木匠或建造砖墙，他们就不必通过同一机构进行，因为这可能意味着繁琐的过度集中；但他们将能够对相同的事情使用相同的衡量标准，意识到比较，并被视为竞争对手。这种竞争越多越好。</p><p class="normal3">But, of course, each of the ten bureaus could not work in a watertight compartment. In their relation one to another lies the best chance for that "coordination" of which so much is heard and so little seen. Clearly the various staffs would need to adopt, wherever possible, standards of measurement that were comparable. They would exchange their records. Then if the War Department and the Post Office both buy lumber, hire carpenters, or construct brick walls they need not necessarily do them through the same agency, for that might mean cumbersome over-centralization; but they would be able to use the same measure for the same things, be conscious of the comparisons, and be treated as competitors. And the more competition of this sort the better.</p>
<p class="normal3">因为竞争的价值是由衡量竞争的标准的价值决定的。因此，我们不应该问自己是否相信竞争，而应该问自己是否相信竞争者所竞争的东西。没有一个理智的人会希望“废除竞争”，因为当最后一丝竞争的痕迹消失时，社会努力将由机械地服从惯例组成，少数人会受到本土灵感的缓和。然而，没有人希望在每个人与所有人的残酷斗争中将竞争推向其合乎逻辑的结论。问题在于选择竞争的目标和游戏规则。几乎总是最明显、最明显的衡量标准将决定游戏规则：比如金钱、权力、声望、掌声或凡勃伦先生的“炫耀性浪费”。我们的文明通常提供哪些其他衡量标准？它如何衡量我们一直呼吁的效率、生产力、服务？</p><p class="normal3">For the value of competition is determined by the value of the standards used to measure it. Instead, then, of asking ourselves whether we believe in competition, we should ask ourselves whether we believe in that for which the competitors compete. No one in his senses expects to "abolish competition," for when the last vestige of emulation had disappeared, social effort would consist in mechanical obedience to a routine, tempered in a minority by native inspiration. Yet no one expects to work out competition to its logical conclusion in a murderous struggle of each against all. The problem is to select the goals of competition and the rules of the game. Almost always the most visible and obvious standard of measurement will determine the rules of the game: such as money, power, popularity, applause, or Mr. Veblen's "conspicuous waste." What other standards of measurement does our civilization normally provide? How does it measure efficiency, productivity, service, for which we are always clamoring?</p>
<p class="normal3">总的来说，没有衡量标准，因此，也没有那么多为实现这些理想而进行的竞争。因为高尚动机与低俗动机之间的差异，并不像人们常常声称的那样，是利他主义与自私之间的差异。它是为容易理解的目标而行动，还是为晦涩难懂的目标而行动之间的差异。劝一个人比他的邻居赚取更多的利润，他就知道要瞄准什么。劝他为社会提供更多服务，他怎么能确定什么服务是社会的呢？标准是什么，衡量标准是什么？一种主观的感觉，某人的观点。在和平时期告诉一个人，他应该为国家服务，你说的是一句虔诚的陈词滥调，在战争时期告诉他，服务这个词就有了意义；这是一系列具体的行为，如入伍、购买债券、节省食物或每年工作一美元，他把每一项服务都明确视为一个具体目的的一部分，即在前线部署一支比敌人规模更大、装备更精良的军队。</p><p class="normal3">By and large there are no measures, and there is, therefore, not so much competition to achieve these ideals. For the difference between the higher and the lower motives is not, as men often assert, a difference between altruism and selfishness. It is a difference between acting for easily understood aims, and for aims that are obscure and vague. Exhort a man to make more profit than his neighbor, and he knows at what to aim. Exhort him to render more social service, and how is he to be certain what service is social? What is the test, what is the measure? A subjective feeling, somebody's opinion. Tell a man in time of peace that he ought to serve his country and you have uttered a pious platitude, Tell him in time of war, and the word service has a meaning; it is a number of concrete acts, enlistment, or buying bonds, or saving food, or working for a dollar a year, and each one of these services he sees definitely as part of a concrete purpose to put at the front an army larger and better armed, than the enemy's.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，你越能分析管理并找出可比较的要素，你越能为想要提升的品质发明量化指标，你就越能将竞争转化为理想的结果。如果你能设计出正确的指数，你就可以在商店中的个体工人之间、商店之间、工厂之间、学校之间、政府部门之间、军团之间、师之间、船只之间、州之间、县之间、城市之间建立竞争；指数越好，竞争就越有用。</p><p class="normal3">So the more you are able to analyze administration and work out elements that can be compared, the more you invent quantitative measures for the qualities you wish to promote, the more you can turn competition to ideal ends. If you can contrive the right index numbers you can set up a competition between individual workers in a shop; between shops; between factories; between schools; between government departments; between regiments; between divisions; between ships; between states; counties; cities; and the better your index numbers the more useful the competition.</p>

<p class="normal3">材料交换的可能性是显而易见的。政府的每个部门都在随时要求获取其他部门可能已经获得的信息，尽管形式可能略有不同。比如说，国务院需要知道墨西哥石油储量的范围、它们与世界其他地区石油供应的关系、墨西哥石油土地的现有所有权、石油对正在建造或计划建造的军舰的重要性、不同领域的比较成本。今天它如何获得这些信息？这些信息可能分散在内政部、司法部、商务部、劳工部和海军部。要么是国务院的一名职员在参考书中查找墨西哥石油，而这些信息可能准确也可能不准确，要么是某人的私人秘书打电话给另一个人的私人秘书，要求提供备忘录，而随着时间的推移，一个黑人信使带着一大堆难以理解的报告到来。国务院应该能够要求自己的情报局以适合于需要解决的外交问题的方式收集事实。外交情报局将从中央清算所获得这些事实。</p><p class="normal3">The possibilities that lie in the exchange of material are evident. Each department of government is all the time asking for information that may already have been obtained by another department, though perhaps in a somewhat different form. The State Department needs to know, let us say, the extent of the Mexican oil reserves, their relation to the rest of the world's supply, the present ownership of Mexican oil lands, the importance of oil to warships now under construction or planned, the comparative costs in different fields. How does it secure such information to-day? The information is probably scattered through the Departments of Interior, Justice, Commerce, Labor and Navy. Either a clerk in the State Department looks up Mexican oil in a book of reference, which may or may not be accurate, or somebody's private secretary telephones somebody else's private secretary, asks for a memorandum, and in the course of time a darkey messenger arrives with an armful of unintelligible reports. The Department should be able to call on its own intelligence bureau to assemble the facts in a way suited to the diplomatic problem up for decision. And these facts the diplomatic intelligence bureau would obtain from the central clearing house.</p>
<p class="normal3">这个机构很快就会成为最特别的信息中心。里面的人会意识到政府的真正问题是什么。他们将处理定义、术语、统计技术和逻辑问题；他们将具体地涉及整个社会科学领域。很难理解为什么所有这些材料，除了一些外交和军事机密外，不应该向该国的学者公开。正是在那里，政治学家会找到真正的难题和真正的研究成果供他的学生进行。这项工作不必全部在华盛顿完成，但可以参考华盛顿来完成。因此，中央机构将具备一所国立大学的素质。工作人员可以从大学毕业生中招募到局里。他们将研究在国立大学馆长和遍布全国的教师协商后选定的论文。如果该协会具有应有的灵活性，那么作为常任工作人员的补充，大学将不断聘用临时和专业人员，并从华盛顿调来交流讲师。这样，工作人员的培训和招聘就可以同步进行。研究本身的一部分将由学生完成，大学里的政治学将与美国政治联系起来。</p><p class="normal3">This establishment would pretty soon become a focus of information of the most extraordinary kind. And the men in it would be made aware of what the problems of government really are. They would deal with problems of definition, of terminology, of statistical technic, of logic; they would traverse concretely the whole gamut of the social sciences. It is difficult to see why all this material, except a few diplomatic and military secrets, should not be open to the scholars of the country. It is there that the political scientist would find the real nuts to crack and the real researches for his students to make. The work need not all be done in Washington, but it could be done in reference to Washington. The central agency would, thus, have in it the makings of a national university. The staff could be recruited there for the bureaus from among college graduates. They would be working on theses selected after consultation between the curators of the national university and teachers scattered over the country. If the association was as flexible as it ought to be, there would be, as a supplement to the permanent staff, a steady turnover of temporary and specialist appointments from the universities, and exchange lecturers called out from Washington. Thus the training and the recruiting of the staff would go together. A part of the research itself would be done by students, and political science in the universities would be associated with politics in America.</p>

<p class="normal3">原则的主要内容同样适用于州政府、城市和农村县。比较和交换工作可以由州、市和县局联盟进行。在这些联盟内，可以组织任何理想的区域组合。只要会计系统具有可比性，就可以避免大量重复。区域协调尤其可取。因为法律边界通常与有效环境不一致。然而，它们有一定的习惯基础，如果打乱它们，代价将不菲。通过协调信息，几个行政区域可以协调决策自主权与合作。例如，纽约市已经是一个难以从市政厅管理的单位。然而，对于许多目的，如健康和交通，大都会区是真正的行政单位。然而，在那个地区，有大城市，如扬克斯、泽西市、帕特森、伊丽莎白、霍博肯、贝永。它们不可能全部由一个中心管理，但它们应该共同发挥作用。最终，也许像西德尼和比阿特丽斯·韦伯所建议的某些地方政府灵活方案可能是合适的解决方案。但第一步是协调，不是决策和行动的协调，而是信息和研究的协调。让各个市政当局的官员根据相同的事实看待他们共同的问题。</p><p class="normal3">In its main outlines the principle is equally applicable to state governments, to cities, and to rural counties. The work of comparison and interchange could take place by federations of state and city and county bureaus. And within those federations any desirable regional combination could be organized. So long as the accounting systems were comparable, a great deal of duplication would be avoided. Regional coordination is especially desirable. For legal frontiers often do not coincide with the effective environments. Yet they have a certain basis in custom that it would be costly to disturb. By coordinating their information several administrative areas could reconcile autonomy of decision with cooperation. New York City, for example, is already an unwieldy unit for good government from the City Hall. Yet for many purposes, such as health and transportation, the metropolitan district is the true unit of administration. In that district, however, there are large cities, like Yonkers, Jersey City, Paterson, Elizabeth, Hoboken, Bayonne. They could not all be managed from one center, and yet they should act together for many functions. Ultimately perhaps some such flexible scheme of local government as Sidney and Beatrice Webb have suggested may be the proper solution. But the first step would be a coordination, not of decision and action, but of information and research. Let the officials of the various municipalities see their common problems in the light of the same facts.</p>

<p class="normal3">否认这种政治和工业界情报局网络可能会成为累赘和永久的烦恼是毫无意义的。人们很容易想象它对那些寻找轻松工作的人、学究和爱管闲事的人的吸引力。人们可以看到官僚作风、堆积如山的文件、令人厌烦的问卷、每份文件七份、签注、延误、文件丢失、使用表格 136 而不是表格 2gb、文件被退回，因为用铅笔代替墨水，或者用黑色墨水代替红色墨水。工作可能做得很糟糕。没有万无一失的机构。</p><p class="normal3">It would be idle to deny that such a net work of intelligence bureaus in politics and industry might become a dead weight and a perpetual irritation. One can easily imagine its attraction for men in search of soft jobs, for pedants, for meddlers. One can see red tape, mountains of papers, questionnaires ad nauseam, seven copies of every document, endorsements, delays, lost papers, the use of form 136 instead of form 2gb, the return of the document because pencil was used instead of ink, or black ink instead of red ink. The work could be done very badly. There are no fool-proof institutions.</p>
<p class="normal3">但是，如果可以假设整个政府部门、工厂、办公室和大学之间都有流通，人员流通、数据流通和批评流通，那么干腐病的风险就不会那么大。说这些情报局会使生活复杂化也不正确。相反，它们会倾向于简化，揭示出现在人类无法处理的复杂性。目前基本上看不见的政府系统是如此复​​杂，以至于大多数人已经放弃尝试去理解它，因为他们不去尝试，所以他们倾向于认为它相对简单。相反，它是难以捉摸的、隐蔽的、不透明的。使用情报系统意味着每单位结果所需的人员减少，因为通过让每个人都能获得各自的经验，它将减少反复试验的次数；并且通过使社会过程可见，它将帮助人员进行自我批评。如果把特别调查委员会、大陪审团、地方检察官、改革组织和困惑的公职人员在试图从一片混乱中找到出路的过程中所花费的时间考虑在内，这并不需要大量额外的官员。</p><p class="normal3">But if one could assume that there was circulation through the whole system between government departments, factories, offices, and the universities; a circulation of men, a circulation of data and of criticism, the risks of dry rot would not be so great. Nor would it be true to say that these intelligence bureaus will complicate life. They will tend, on the contrary, to simplify, by revealing a complexity now so great as to be humanly unmanageable. The present fundamentally invisible system of government is so intricate that most people have given up trying to follow it, and because they do not try, they are tempted to think it comparatively simple. It is, on the contrary, elusive, concealed, opaque. The employment of an intelligence system would mean a reduction of personnel per unit of result, because by making available to all the experience of each, it would reduce the amount of trial and error; and because by making the social process visible, it would assist the personnel to self-criticism. It does not involve a great additional band of officials, if you take into account the time now spent vainly by special investigating committees, grand juries, district attorneys, reform organizations, and bewildered office holders, in trying to find their way through a dark muddle.</p>
<p class="normal3">如果对民意和民主理论与现代环境关系的分析在原则上是正确的，那么我认为人们无法逃避这样的结论：这种情报工作是改善环境的线索。我指的不是本章中的几条建议。它们只是例证。制定技术的任务掌握在受过训练的人手中，甚至他们今天也无法完全预见形式，更不用说细节了。现在记录的社会现象数量很少，分析工具非常粗糙，概念往往模糊且未经批判。但我认为，已经做了足够多的工作来证明，看不见的环境可以得到有效的报道，可以以一种不影响他们偏见的方式向不同的人群报道，并能够克服他们的主观主义。</p><p class="normal3">If the analysis of public opinion and of the democratic theories in relation to the modern environment is sound in principle, then I do not see how one can escape the conclusion that such intelligence work is the clue to betterment. I am not referring to the few suggestions contained in this chapter. They are merely illustrations. The task of working out the technic is in the hands of men trained to do it, and not even they can to-day completely foresee the form, much less the details. The number of social phenomena which are now recorded is small, the instruments of analysis are very crude, the concepts often vague and uncriticized. But enough has been done to demonstrate, I think, that unseen environments can be reported effectively, that they can be reported to divergent groups of people in a way which is neutral to their prejudice, and capable of overcoming their subjectivism.</p>
<p class="normal3">如果这是真的，那么在制定智力原则的过程中，人们将找到克服自治的核心困难的方法，即处理看不见的现实的困难。由于这一困难，任何自治社区都不可能调和其孤立的需要与广泛接触的必要性，调和地方决策的尊严和个性与安全和广泛协调，在不牺牲责任的情况下确保有效的领导人，在不试图就所有问题达成普遍的公众意见的情况下获得有用的公众意见。只要没有办法建立看不见的事件的共同版本、单独行动的共同措施，那么唯一可行的民主形象，即使在理论上，也是一种基于一个孤立的社区的民主，根据亚里士多德的著名格言，这些人的政治能力受到视野范围的限制。</p><p class="normal3">If that is true, then in working out the intelligence principle men will find the way to overcome the central difficulty of self-government, the difficulty of dealing with an unseen reality. Because of that difficulty, it has been impossible for any self-governing community to reconcile its need for isolation with the necessity for wide contact, to reconcile the dignity and individuality of local decision with security and wide coordination, to secure effective leaders without sacrificing responsibility, to have useful public opinions without attempting universal public opinions on all subjects. As long as there was no way of establishing common versions of unseen events, common measures for separate actions, the only image of democracy that would work, even in theory, was one based on an isolated community of people whose political faculties were limited, according to Aristotle's famous maxim, by the range of their vision.</p>
<p class="normal3">但现在有一条出路，虽然路途漫长，但总归是一条出路。这条出路与芝加哥市民（他们的眼睛和耳朵并不比雅典人好）能够远距离看到和听到声音的出路基本相同。今天，减少设想环境与实际环境之间的差异是可能的，如果投入更多的劳动，这种可能性将更大。随着这一目标的实现，联邦制将越来越多地通过同意而不是强制手段发挥作用。因为虽然联邦制是自治团体之间唯一可能的联合方式，但只要联合不是基于正确和普遍接受的联邦事务理念，联邦制就会走向帝国集权或地方无政府状态。这些理念不是自发产生的。必须通过基于分析的概括将它们拼凑起来，并且必须通过研究发明和测试用于分析的工具。</p><p class="normal3">But now there is a way out, a long one to be sure, but a way. It is fundamentally the same way as that which has enabled a citizen of Chicago, with no better eyes or ears than an Athenian, to see and hear over great distances. It is possible to-day, it will become more possible when more labor has gone into it, to reduce the discrepancies between the conceived environment and the effective environment. As that is done, federalism will work more and more by consent, less and less by coercion. For while federalism is the only possible method of union among self-governing groups, federalism swings either towards imperial centralization or towards parochial anarchy wherever the union is not based on correct and commonly accepted ideas of federal matters. These ideas do not arise spontaneously. They have to be pieced together by generalization based on analysis, and the instruments for that analysis have to be invented and tested by research.</p>
<p class="normal3">任何选举手段、任何选区操纵、任何财产制度的改变都不能触及问题的根源。你不可能从人类身上榨取比他们本身更多的政治智慧。任何改革，无论多么轰动，都是真正激进的，如果它没有自觉地提供一种克服基于个人经验局限性的人类意见主观主义的方法。有些政府、投票和代表制度比其他制度榨取的更多。但最终知识必须不是来自良心，而是来自良心所面对的环境。当人们按照智慧原则行事时，他们会出去寻找事实并创造智慧。当他们忽视它时，他们会进入自己的内心，只发现那里的东西。他们只会加深偏见，而不是增加知识。</p><p class="normal3">No electoral device, no manipulation of areas, no change in the system of property, goes to the root of the matter. You cannot take more political wisdom out of human beings than there is in them. And no reform, however sensational, is truly radical, which does not consciously provide a way of overcoming the subjectivism of human opinion based on the limitation of individual experience. There are systems of government, of voting, and representation which extract more than others. But in the end knowledge must come not from the conscience but from the environment with which that conscience deals. When men act on the principle of intelligence they go out to find the facts and to make their wisdom. When they ignore it, they go inside themselves and find only what is there. They elaborate their prejudice, instead of increasing their knowledge.</p>

<p class="normal3">在现实生活中，没有人会按照他可以对每个公共问题发表公众意见的理论行事，尽管这一事实常常被掩盖，因为一个人认为没有公共问题，因为他没有公众意见。但在我们的政治理论中，我们继续比布莱斯勋爵的意图更字面地思考，“舆论的作用是连续的”，即使“它的作用……只涉及广泛的原则”。然后，因为我们试图认为自己有连续的意见，却完全不确定什么是广泛的原则，我们很自然地会以痛苦的哈欠迎接一个似乎需要阅读更多政府报告、更多统计数据、更多曲线和更多图表的争论。因为所有这些首先都和党派言论一样令人困惑，而且更不有趣。</p><p class="normal3">IN real life no one acts on the theory that he can have a public opinion on every public question, though this fact is often concealed where a person thinks there is no public question because he has no public opinion. But in the theory of our politics we continue to think more literally than Lord Bryce intended, that "the action of Opinion is continuous," even though "its action… deals with broad principles only." And then because we try to think of ourselves having continuous opinions, without being altogether certain what a broad principle is, we quite naturally greet with an anguished yawn an argument that seems to involve the reading of more government reports, more statistics, more curves and more graphs. For all these are in the first instance just as confusing as partisan rhetoric, and much less entertaining.</p>
<p class="normal3">任何计划都无法满足人们的需要，因为人们认为，在阅读了所有情报局的出版物后，全国所有公民都会对大量实际问题保持警惕、知情和热切，而这些问题从来都不能很好地融入任何广泛的原则中。我并不是在做这样的假设。情报局主要是行动者、负责决策的代表和工作人员的工具，如果它不能帮助他们，那么最终对任何人都没有帮助。但是，只要它能帮助他们了解他们所处的工作环境，它就能让他们的工作变得显而易见。这样一来，他们对公众就更加负责了。</p><p class="normal3">The amount of attention available is far too small for any scheme in which it was assumed that all the citizens of the nation would, after devoting themselves to the publications of all the intelligence bureaus, become alert, informed, and eager on the multitude of real questions that never do fit very well into any broad principle. I am not making that assumption. Primarily, the intelligence bureau is an instrument of the man of action, of the representative charged with decision, of the worker at his work, and if it does not help them, it will help nobody in the end. But in so far as it helps them to understand the environment in which they are working, it makes what they do visible. And by that much they become more responsible to the general public.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，目的不是让每个公民都背负专家对所有问题的见解，而是将这一负担从公民身上转移到负责任的管理者身上。情报系统当然具有作为一般信息来源和每日新闻制约因素的价值。但那是次要的。它的实际用途是作为政治和工业领域代议制政府和行政管理的辅助。对会计师、统计学家、秘书等专业记者的帮助的需求并非来自公众，而是来自那些不能再凭经验行事的公共事务人员。从本质上讲，情报系统是一种更好地处理公共事务的工具，而不是一种更好地了解公共事务做得有多糟糕的工具。</p><p class="normal3">The purpose, then, is not to burden every citizen with expert opinions on all questions, but to push that burden away from him towards the responsible administrator. An intelligence system has value, of course, as a source of general information, and as a check on the daily press. But that is secondary. Its real use is as an aid to representative government and administration both in politics and industry. The demand for the assistance of expert reporters in the shape of accountants, statisticians, secretariats, and the like, comes not from the public, but from men doing public business, who can no longer do it by rule of thumb. It is in origin and in ideal an instrument for doing public business better, rather than an instrument for knowing better how badly public business is done.</p>

<p class="normal3">作为一名普通公民，作为一名主权选民，没有人能够试图消化这些文件。但作为争议的一方，作为立法机构的委员，作为政府、企业或工会的官员，作为工业委员会的成员，关于具体问题的报告将越来越受欢迎。对某些事业感兴趣的普通公民将像现在一样加入自愿社团，这些社团雇用工作人员研究文件，并制作报告，以制衡官僚机构。新闻工作者、专家和政治学家将对这些材料进行一些研究。但局外人，我们每个人都是现代生活除少数方面以外的所有方面的局外人，既没有时间，也没有注意力，没有兴趣，也没有具体判断的能力。社会的日常管理必须依靠内部人员在健全的条件下工作。</p><p class="normal3">As a private citizen, as a sovereign voter, no one could attempt to digest these documents. But as one party to a dispute, as a committeeman in a legislature, as an officer in government, business, or a trade union, as a member of an industrial council, reports on the specific matter at issue will be increasingly welcome. The private citizen interested in some cause would belong, as he does now, to voluntary societies which employed a staff to study the documents, and make reports that served as a check on officialdom. There would be some study of this material by newspaper men, and a good deal by experts and by political scientists. But the outsider, and every one of us is an outsider to all but a few aspects of modern life, has neither time, nor attention, nor interest, nor the equipment for specific judgment. It is on the men inside, working under conditions that are sound, that the daily administrations of society must rest.</p>
<p class="normal3">外界公众只能根据事件发生后的结果和事件发生前的程序来判断这些条件是否合理。公众舆论得以持续行动的广泛原则本质上是程序原则。局外人可以请专家告诉他相关事实是否得到了充分考虑；在大多数情况下，他无法自己决定什么是相关的，什么是应有的考虑。局外人也许可以判断是否充分听取了与决定有关的团体的意见，投票（如果有的话）是否诚实地进行，也许可以判断结果是否被诚实地接受。当新闻表明有值得关注的事情时，他可以观察程序。如果程序的正常结果与他对美好生活的理想相冲突，他可以质疑程序本身是否正确。但如果他在每种情况下都试图用自己来代替程序，像戏剧危机中的天赐叔叔一样引入公众舆论，他就会弄巧成拙。他不会连续地跟上任何思路。</p><p class="normal3">The general public outside can arrive at judgments about whether these conditions are sound only on the result after the event, and on the procedure before the event. The broad principles on which the action of public opinion can be continuous are essentially principles of procedure. The outsider can ask experts to tell him whether the relevant facts were duly considered; he cannot in most cases decide for himself what is relevant or what is due consideration. The outsider can perhaps judge whether the groups interested in the decision were properly heard, whether the ballot, if there was one, was honestly taken, and perhaps whether the result was honestly accepted. He can watch the procedure when the news indicates that there is something to watch. He can raise a question as to whether the procedure itself is right, if its normal results conflict with his ideal of a good life. But if he tries in every case to substitute himself for the procedure, to bring in Public Opinion like a providential uncle in the crisis of a play, he will confound his own confusion. He will not follow any train of thought consecutively.</p>
<p class="normal3">因为在各种复杂问题上向公众呼吁的做法几乎总是意味着希望通过争取大多数没有机会知道的人来逃避那些知情人士的批评。判决取决于谁的声音最大或最迷人，谁是最熟练或最厚颜无耻的宣传人员，谁最能获得报纸上最多的版面。因为即使编辑对“另一方”一丝不苟地公平，公平还不够。可能还有其他几个方面，任何有组织的、有资金的和活跃的党派都没有提到。</p><p class="normal3">For the practice of appealing to the public on all sorts of intricate matters means almost always a desire to escape criticism from those who know by enlisting a large majority which has had no chance to know. The verdict is made to depend on who has the loudest or the most entrancing voice, the most skilful or the most brazen publicity man, the best access to the most space in the newspapers. For even when the editor is scrupulously fair to "the other side," fairness is not enough. There may be several other sides, unmentioned by any of the organized, financed and active partisans.</p>
<p class="normal3">被党派呼吁借用公众意见所困扰的普通公民，也许很快就会发现，这些呼吁不是对他智慧的赞美，而是对他善良本性的侮辱，是对他证据意识的侮辱。由于他的公民教育考虑到了他所处环境的复杂性，他会关心程序的公平性和健全性，甚至在大多数情况下，他也会希望他选出的代表能为他注意这一点。他将拒绝接受这些决定的负担，在大多数情况下，他会拒绝那些急于取胜、从会议桌前匆匆忙忙地向记者提供第一手消息的人。</p><p class="normal3">The private citizen, beset by partisan appeals for the loan of his Public Opinion, will soon see, perhaps, that these appeals are not a compliment to his intelligence, but an imposition on his good nature and an insult to his sense of evidence. As his civic education takes account of the complexity of his environment, he will concern himself about the equity and the sanity of procedure, and even this he will in most cases expect his elected representative to watch for him. He will refuse himself to accept the burden of these decisions, and will turn down his thumbs in most cases on those who, in their hurry to win, rush from the conference table with the first dope for the reporters.</p>
<p class="normal3">只有坚持问题在经过程序之前不会提交给他，现代国家的忙碌公民才有可能希望以一种可理解的方式处理这些问题。因为，正如党派人士所言，问题几乎总是由他观察到的一系列错综复杂的事实组成，周围是一大堆充满情绪的陈词滥调。按照当时的流行做法，他会从会议室走出来，坚持说他想要的是一些能满足灵魂的想法，如正义、福利、美国主义、社会主义。在这些问题上，外人有时会感到恐惧或钦佩，但绝不会感到评判。在他能对论点做任何事情之前，必须先把论点中的脂肪煮出来。</p><p class="normal3">Only by insisting that problems shall not come up to him until they have passed through a procedure, can the busy citizen of a modern state hope to deal with them in a form that is intelligible. For issues, as they are stated by a partisan, almost always consist of an intricate series of facts, as he has observed them, surrounded by a large fatty mass of stereotyped phrases charged with his emotion. According to the fashion of the day, he will emerge from the conference room insisting that what he wants is some soulfilling idea like Justice, Welfare, Americanism, Socialism. On such issues the citizen outside can sometimes be provoked to fear or admiration, but to judgment never. Before he can do anything with the argument, the fat has to be boiled out of it for him.</p>

<p class="normal3">可以通过让代表在某人（主席或调解人）在场的情况下进行讨论来实现这一点，该人会迫使讨论处理专家提供的分析。这是任何处理远距离事务的代表机构的基本组织。党派的声音应该存在，但党派应该发现自己面对的是没有亲自参与的人，他们掌握足够的事实，并具有辩证技能，能够从刻板印象、模式和阐述中分辨出什么是真实的看法。这是苏格拉底式的对话，苏格拉底用尽了所有精力来突破词语，找到意义，甚至更多，因为现代生活中的辩证法必须由探索过环境和人类思想的人来完成。</p><p class="normal3">That can be done by having the representative inside carry on discussion in the presence of some one, chairman or mediator, who forces the discussion to deal with the analyses supplied by experts. This is the essential organization of any representative body dealing with distant matters. The partisan voices should be there, but the partisans should find themselves confronted with men, not personally involved, who control enough facts and have the dialectical skill to sort out what is real perception from what is stereotype, pattern and elaboration. It is the Socratic dialogue, with all of Socrates's energy for breaking through words to meanings, and something more than that, because the dialectic in modern life must be done by men who have explored the environment as well as the human mind.</p>
<p class="normal3">例如，钢铁行业存在着一场严重的争端。双方都发表了充满最高理想的宣言。在这个阶段，唯一值得尊重的舆论是坚持召开会议的舆论。对于声称其事业太正义而不能被会议玷污的一方来说，他们几乎不会得到同情，因为凡人中没有这样的事业。也许那些反对会议的人并不是这么说的。也许他们说对方太邪恶了；他们不能和叛徒握手。舆论所能做的就是组织政府官员举行听证会，听取邪恶的证据。它不能相信党派的话。但假设同意召开一次会议，假设有一位中立的主席，他随时听候公司、工会和劳工部的顾问专家的差遣。</p><p class="normal3">There is, for example, a grave dispute in the steel industry. Each side issues a manifesto full of the highest ideals. The only public opinion that is worth respect at this stage is the opinion which insists that a conference be organized. For the side which says its cause is too just to be contaminated by conference there can be little sympathy, since there is no such cause anywhere among mortal men. Perhaps those who object to conference do not say quite that. Perhaps they say that the other side is too wicked; they cannot shake hands with traitors. All that public opinion can do then is to organize a hearing by public officials to hear the proof of wickedness. It cannot take the partisans' word for it. But suppose a conference is agreed to, and suppose there is a neutral chairman who has at his beck and call the consulting experts of the corporation, the union, and, let us say, the Department of Labor.</p>
<p class="normal3">加里法官非常真诚地表示，他的工人工资很高，没有过度劳累，然后开始概述俄罗斯从彼得大帝时代到沙皇被谋杀的历史。福斯特先生站起来，同样真诚地表示，工人受到剥削，然后开始概述从拿撒勒的耶稣到亚伯拉罕·林肯的人类解放史。此时，主席要求情报人员提供工资表，以便用一张显示不同阶层工资的表格来代替“高薪”和“受剥削”这两个词<i class="calibre10">。</i>
 加里法官认为他们所有人都薪水很高吗？他认为是的。福斯特先生认为他们所有人都受到剥削吗？不，他认为 C、M 和 X 组受到剥削。他所说的“受剥削”是什么意思？他的意思是他们没有得到足够的生活工资。加里法官说，他们确实受到剥削。主席问，一个人用这份工资能买到什么。福斯特先生说，什么也买不到。加里法官说，他需要的一切。主席查阅了政府的预算和价格统计数据。他裁定 X 可以满足平均预算，但 C 和 M 不能。加里法官发出通知，称他认为官方统计数据不合理。预算太高，价格却下降了。福斯特先生也发出了例外通知。预算太低，价格却上涨了。主席裁定，这一点不属于会议的管辖范围，官方数据仍然有效，加里法官的专家和福斯特先生的专家应向联邦情报局常务委员会提出上诉。</p><p class="normal3">Judge Gary states with perfect sincerity that his men are well paid and not overworked, and then proceeds to sketch the history of Russia from the time of Peter the Great to the murder of the Czar. Mr. Foster rises, states with equal sincerity that the men are exploited, and then proceeds to outline the history of human emancipation from Jesus of Nazareth to Abraham Lincoln. At this point the chairman calls upon the intelligence men for wage tables in order to substitute for the words "well paid" and "exploited" a table showing what the different classes <i class="calibre10">are</i>
 paid. Does Judge Gary think they are all well paid? He does. Does Mr. Foster think they are all exploited? No, he thinks that groups C, M, and X are exploited. What does he mean by exploited? He means they are not paid a living wage. They are, says Judge Gary. What can a man buy on that wage, asks the chairman. Nothing, says Mr. Foster. Everything he needs, says Judge Gary. The chairman consults the budgets and price statistics of the government. He rules that X can meet an average budget, but that C and M cannot. Judge Gary serves notice that he does not regard the official statistics as sound. The budgets are too high, and prices have come down. Mr. Foster also serves notice of exception. The budget is too low, prices have gone up. The chairman rules that this point is not within the jurisdiction of the conference, that the official figures stand, and that Judge Gary's experts and Mr. Foster's should carry their appeals to the standing committee of the federated intelligence bureaus.</p>
<p class="normal3">然而，法官加里说，如果我们改变这些工资标准，我们就会破产。主席问道，破产是什么意思？拿出你的账簿。法官加里说，我不能，它们是私人的。主席说，私人的东西我们不感兴趣，因此，他向公众发表声明，宣布 C 组和 M 组工人的工资远低于官方最低生活工资，法官加里拒绝提高工资，理由是他拒绝说明。经过这样的程序，就可以形成一种赞美意义上的公众舆论。</p><p class="normal3">Nevertheless, says Judge Gary, we shall be ruined if we change these wage scales. What do you mean by ruined, asks the chairman, produce your books. I can't, they are private, says Judge Gary. What is private does not interest us, says the chairman, and, therefore, issues a statement to the public announcing that the wages of workers in groups C and M are so-and-so much below the official minimum living wage, and that Judge Gary declines to increase them for reasons that he refuses to state. After a procedure of that sort, a public opinion in the eulogistic sense of the term can exist.</p>
<p class="normal3">专家调解的价值不在于它树立意见以胁迫党派，而在于它瓦解了党派之争。加里法官和福斯特先生可能仍然像刚开始时一样不相信，尽管他们不得不用不同的语气说话。但几乎所有没有个人纠缠的人都会避免被纠缠。因为这种辩证法解开了纠缠不清的刻板印象和口号，而他的反应是如此迅速。</p><p class="normal3">The value of expert mediation is not that it sets up opinion to coerce the partisans, but that it disintegrates partisanship. Judge Gary and Mr. Foster may remain as little convinced as when they started, though even they would have to talk in a different strain. But almost everyone else who was not personally entangled would save himself from being entangled. For the entangling stereotypes and slogans to which his reflexes are so ready to respond are by this kind of dialectic untangled.</p>

<p class="normal3">在许多具有重大公共意义的话题上，以及在不同程度上，在更私人的问题上，不同的人记忆和情感的线索都陷入了混乱。同一个词会表示许多不同的想法：情感从它们所属的图像转移到与这些图像的名称相似的名称。在思想中未被批判的部分，仅仅通过叮当声、接触和连续，就会产生大量的联想。有零散的情感依恋，有曾经是名字和面具的词语。在梦境、遐想和恐慌中，我们发现了一些混乱，足以看到天真的心灵是如何组成的，以及当它没有被清醒的努力和外部阻力所约束时，它是如何表现的。我们看到，没有比尘土飞扬的旧阁楼更自然的秩序了。事实、思想和情感之间经常存在着矛盾，就像歌剧院里的情况一样，如果把所有的服装都堆成一堆，把所有的乐谱都混在一起，那么蝴蝶夫人就会穿着女武神的服装，满怀诗意地等待浮士德的归来。“在圣诞节的时候，”一篇社论说，“往日的回忆软化了人心。当思绪回到童年时，神圣的教义就会重新被记起。透过半快乐半悲伤的回忆，现在与上帝同在的亲人，看世界似乎并不那么糟糕。没有一颗心能不受神秘影响……这个国家充斥着红色宣传——但有充足的绳索、肌肉和灯柱……当这个世界运转时，自由的精神将在人类的心中燃烧。”</p><p class="normal3">On many subjects of great public importance, and in varying degree among different people for more personal matters, the threads of memory and emotion are in a snarl. The same word will connote any number of different ideas: emotions are displaced from the images to which they belong to names which resemble the names of these images. In the uncriticized parts of the mind there is a vast amount of association by mere clang, contact, and succession. There are stray emotional attachments, there are words that were names and are masks. In dreams, reveries, and panic, we uncover some of the disorder, enough to see how the naive mind is composed, and how it behaves when not disciplined by wakeful effort and external resistance. We see that there is no more natural order than in a dusty old attic. There is often the same incongruity between fact, idea, and emotion as there might be in an opera house, if all the wardrobes were dumped in a heap and all the scores mixed up, so that Madame Butterfly in a Valkyr's dress waited lyrically for the return of Faust. "At Christmas-tide" says an editorial, "old memories soften the heart. Holy teachings are remembered afresh as thoughts run back to childhood. The world does not seem so bad when seen through the mist of half-happy, half-sad recollections of loved ones now with God. No heart is untouched by the mysterious influence…. The country is honeycombed with red propaganda—but there is a good supply of ropes, muscles and lampposts… while this world moves the spirit of liberty will burn in the breast of man."</p>
<p class="normal3">在脑海中找到这些短语的人需要帮助。他需要一个苏格拉底来分离这些单词，盘问他直到他定义它们，并将单词变成思想的名称。使它们意味着一个特定的对象，而不是其他任何东西。因为这些紧张的音节通过原始联想在他的脑海中联系在一起，并被他对圣诞节的记忆、他作为保守派的愤慨以及他作为革命传统继承者的激动所捆绑在一起。有时咆哮声太大太久远，无法快速解开。有时，就像在现代心理治疗中一样，记忆层层回溯到婴儿时期，必须将它们分开并命名。</p><p class="normal3">The man who found these phrases in his mind needs help. He needs a Socrates who will separate the words, cross-examine him until he has defined them, and made words the names of ideas. Made them mean a particular object and nothing else. For these tense syllables have got themselves connected in his mind by primitive association, and are bundled together by his memories of Christmas, his indignation as a conservative, and his thrills as the heir to a revolutionary tradition. Sometimes the snarl is too huge and ancient for quick unravelling. Sometimes, as in modern psychotherapy, there are layers upon layers of memory reaching back to infancy, which have to be separated and named.</p>
<p class="normal3">命名的效果，即说劳动群体 C 和 M（而不是 X）的报酬过低，而不是说劳动被剥削的效果，是深刻的。感知恢复了其身份，它们所引起的情感是特定的，因为它不再通过与从圣诞节到莫斯科的一切的大规模和偶然联系而得到强化。具有自己名称和经过仔细审查的情感的解开的想法更容易通过问题中的新数据进行纠正。它已经嵌入整个人格中，与整个自我有某种联系：挑战将在整个灵魂中回荡。在彻底批评之后，这个想法不再是<i class="calibre10">我</i>
 ，而是<i class="calibre10">那个</i>
 。它被客观化了，它遥不可及。它的命运与我的命运无关，而是与我所行动的外部世界的命运有关。</p><p class="normal3">The effect of naming, the effect, that is, of saying that the labor groups C and M, but not X, are underpaid, instead of saying that Labor is Exploited, is incisive. Perceptions recover their identity, and the emotion they arouse is specific, since it is no longer reinforced by large and accidental connections with everything from Christmas to Moscow. The disentangled idea with a name of its own, and an emotion that has been scrutinized, is ever so much more open to correction by new data in the problem. It had been imbedded in the whole personality, had affiliations of some sort with the whole ego: a challenge would reverberate through the whole soul. After it has been thoroughly criticized, the idea is no longer <i class="calibre10">me</i>
 but <i class="calibre10">that</i>
 . It is objectified, it is at arm's length. Its fate is not bound up with my fate, but with the fate of the outer world upon which I am acting.</p>

<p class="normal3">这种再教育将有助于使我们的公众舆论与环境相适应。这就是消除庞大的审查、定型和戏剧化手段的方法。如果很容易了解相关环境，批评家、教师、医生就可以解开思想的谜团。但是，如果环境对分析师和他的学生来说都一样模糊，那么任何分析技术都不够用。需要情报工作。在政治和工业问题上，批评家本身可以做一些事情，但除非他能指望从专家记者那里得到对环境的有效描述，否则他的辩证法就走不远。</p><p class="normal3">Re-education of this kind will help to bring our public opinions into grip with the environment. That is the way the enormous censoring, stereotyping, and dramatizing apparatus can be liquidated. Where there is no difficulty in knowing what the relevant environment is, the critic, the teacher, the physician, can unravel the mind. But where the environment is as obscure to the analyst as to his pupil, no analytic technic is sufficient. Intelligence work is required. In political and industrial problems the critic as such can do something, but unless he can count upon receiving from expert reporters a valid picture of the environment, his dialectic cannot go far.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，尽管在这里，就像在大多数其他事情中一样，“教育”是终极解决方案，但这种教育的价值将取决于知识的发展。而我们对人类制度的了解仍然极其贫乏和印象主义。社会知识的收集总体上仍然是杂乱无章的；它不会成为行动的正常伴随物，而这必然会成为行动的正常伴随物。然而，可以肯定的是，信息的收集不会是为了最终的用途。之所以收集信息，是因为现代决策需要这样做。但在收集信息的过程中，会积累大量的数据，政治科学可以将其转化为概括，并为学校构建出一幅概念性的世界图景。当这幅图景成形时，公民教育就可以成为应对看不见的环境的准备。</p><p class="normal3">Therefore, though here, as in most other matters, "education" is the supreme remedy, the value of this education will depend upon the evolution of knowledge. And our knowledge of human institutions is still extraordinarily meager and impressionistic. The gathering of social knowledge is, on the whole, still haphazard; not, as it will have to become, the normal accompaniment of action. And yet the collection of information will not be made, one may be sure, for the sake of its ultimate use. It will be made because modern decision requires it to be made. But as it is being made, there will accumulate a body of data which political science can turn into generalization, and build up for the schools into a conceptual picture of the world. When that picture takes form, civic education can become a preparation for dealing with an unseen environment.</p>
<p class="normal3">当教师掌握了社会制度的工作模型后，他可以利用它让学生敏锐地意识到自己的思维是如何处理不熟悉的事实的。除非他有这样的模型，否则教师无法指望让人们充分做好面对他们将要发现的世界的准备。他能做的是让他们做好准备，以更成熟的思维方式来应对这个世界。他可以通过案例教学法，教会学生检查信息来源的习惯。例如，他可以教学生在报纸上查找电报的发稿地点、记者姓名、新闻社名称、声明的授权机构、声明的背景。他可以教学生自问记者是否看到了他所描述的内容，并记住记者如何描述过去的其他事件。他可以教学生审查制度的性质、隐私的概念，并向他提供过去宣传的知识。通过正确使用历史，他可以让他意识到刻板印象，并培养对印刷文字所唤起的意象进行内省的习惯。通过比较历史和人类学课程，他可以培养终身的认识，即代码如何将特殊的模式强加于想象力。他可以教人们发现自己在编造寓言、戏剧化关系和拟人化抽象。他可以向学生展示他如何将自己与这些寓言联系起来，如何产生兴趣，以及如何选择在持有特定观点时采取的英雄、浪漫、经济的态度。对错误的研究不仅具有最高程度的预防作用，而且可以作为对真理研究的激励性介绍。随着我们的思想越来越深刻地意识到自己的主观主义，我们会发现客观方法的热情，而这种热情是其他方法所没有的。我们清楚地看到了我们的偏见的巨大危害和随意的残忍，而通常我们不应该看到这一点。而消除偏见，虽然一开始会很痛苦，因为它与我们的自尊有关，但一旦成功，就会带来极大的解脱和自豪感。注意力的范围会大大扩大。随着现有范畴的消失，一个僵硬、简单的世界观就瓦解了。场景变得生动而充实。随之而来的是情感上的激励，促使人们由衷地欣赏科学方法，否则这种激励很难激发，也不可能维持下去。偏见要容易得多，也更有趣。因为如果你把科学原理当作一直被接受的东西来教授，那么它们作为一门学科的主要优点，即客观性，就会使它们变得乏味。但一开始要把它们当作战胜思想迷信的胜利来教授，追逐和征服的兴奋可能会让学生从自我束缚的经历过渡到好奇心成熟的阶段，他的理智也获得了激情。</p><p class="normal3">As a working model of the social system becomes available to the teacher, he can use it to make the pupil acutely aware of how his mind works on unfamiliar facts. Until he has such a model, the teacher cannot hope to prepare men fully for the world they will find. What he can do is to prepare them to deal with that world with a great deal more sophistication about their own minds. He can, by the use of the case method, teach the pupil the habit of examining the sources of his information. He can teach him, for example, to look in his newspaper for the place where the dispatch was filed, for the name of the correspondent, the name of the press service, the authority given for the statement, the circumstances under which the statement was secured. He can teach the pupil to ask himself whether the reporter saw what he describes, and to remember how that reporter described other events in the past. He can teach him the character of censorship, of the idea of privacy, and furnish him with knowledge of past propaganda. He can, by the proper use of history, make him aware of the stereotype, and can educate a habit of introspection about the imagery evoked by printed words. He can, by courses in comparative history and anthropology, produce a life-long realization of the way codes impose a special pattern upon the imagination. He can teach men to catch themselves making allegories, dramatizing relations, and personifying abstractions. He can show the pupil how he identifies himself with these allegories, how he becomes interested, and how he selects the attitude, heroic, romantic, economic which he adopts while holding a particular opinion. The study of error is not only in the highest degree prophylactic, but it serves as a stimulating introduction to the study of truth. As our minds become more deeply aware of their own subjectivism, we find a zest in objective method that is not otherwise there. We see vividly, as normally we should not, the enormous mischief and casual cruelty of our prejudices. And the destruction of a prejudice, though painful at first, because of its connection with our self-respect, gives an immense relief and a fine pride when it is successfully done. There is a radical enlargement of the range of attention. As the current categories dissolve, a hard, simple version of the world breaks up. The scene turns vivid and full. There follows an emotional incentive to hearty appreciation of scientific method, which otherwise it is not easy to arouse, and is impossible to sustain. Prejudices are so much easier and more interesting. For if you teach the principles of science as if they had always been accepted, their chief virtue as a discipline, which is objectivity, will make them dull. But teach them at first as victories over the superstitions of the mind, and the exhilaration of the chase and of the conquest may carry the pupil over that hard transition from his own self-bound experience to the phase where his curiosity has matured, and his reason has acquired passion.</p>

<p class="normal3">我曾为这本书写过几个结尾，但后来又都扔掉了。所有这些结尾都笼罩着最后一章的宿命，似乎每个想法都找到了自己的位置，所有作者没有忘记的谜团都解开了。在政治中，英雄不会从此过上幸福的生活，也不会完美地结束自己的一生。没有结局章节，因为政治中的英雄面前的未来比他身后的历史还要多。最后一章只是作者想象礼貌的读者已经开始偷偷看手表的地方。</p><p class="normal3">I HAVE written, and then thrown away, several endings to this book. Over all of them there hung that fatality of last chapters, in which every idea seems to find its place, and all the mysteries, that the writer has not forgotten, are unravelled. In politics the hero does not live happily ever after, or end his life perfectly. There is no concluding chapter, because the hero in politics has more future before him than there is recorded history behind him. The last chapter is merely a place where the writer imagines that the polite reader has begun to look furtively at his watch.</p>

<p class="normal3">当柏拉图说到他应该总结的时候，他的自信变成了怯场，因为他觉得说出他内心关于理性在政治中的地位听起来是多么荒谬。《理想国》第五卷中的这些句子甚至连柏拉图都难以说出；它们是如此纯粹和鲜明，以至于人们既不能忘记它们，也不能靠它们生活。所以他让苏格拉底对格劳孔说，他将因说出“什么样的最小变化才能使一个国家转变为更真实的形式”而被笑死，因为他“很想说出，如果不是太夸张的话”的想法是“直到哲学家成为国王，或者这个世界的国王和王子拥有哲学的精神和力量，政治伟大和智慧融为一体……城市永远不会停止邪恶，——不会，人类也不会……”</p><p class="normal3">When Plato came to the point where it was fitting that he should sum up, his assurance turned into stage-fright as he thought how absurd it would sound to say what was in him about the place of reason in politics. Those sentences in book five of the Republic were hard even for Plato to speak; they are so sheer and so stark that men can neither forget them nor live by them. So he makes Socrates say to Glaucon that he will be broken and drowned in laughter for telling "what is the least change which will enable a state to pass into the truer form," because the thought he "would fain have uttered if it had not seemed too extravagant" was that "until philosophers are kings, or the kings and princes of this world have the spirit and power of philosophy, and political greatness and wisdom meet in one… cities will never cease from ill,—no, nor the human race…"</p>
<p class="normal3">他刚说出这些可怕的话，就意识到这是完美的忠告，并为自己的想法无法企及的宏伟感到尴尬。于是他赶紧补充说，当然，“真正的领航员”将被称为“喋喋不休的人、观星者、一无是处的人”。但是，这种若有所思的承认，虽然可以保护他免受希腊人对他缺乏幽默感的指控，但却为严肃的想法提供了令人羞辱的结尾。他变得挑衅起来，警告阿德曼图斯，他必须“把哲学家的无用归咎于那些不使用哲学家的人，而不是他们自己的过错。领航员不应该谦卑地请求水手们听从他的指挥——这不是自然规律。”带着这种傲慢的姿态，他匆匆拿起理性的工具，消失在学院里，把世界留给了马基雅维利。</p><p class="normal3">Hardly had he said these awful words, when he realized they were a counsel of perfection, and felt embarrassed at the unapproachable grandeur of his idea. So he hastens to add that, of course, "the true pilot" will be called "a prater, a star-gazer, a good-for-nothing." But this wistful admission, though it protects him against whatever was the Greek equivalent for the charge that he lacked a sense of humor, furnished a humiliating tailpiece to a solemn thought. He becomes defiant and warns Adeimantus that he must "attribute the uselessness" of philosophers "to the fault of those who will not use them, and not to themselves. The pilot should not humbly beg the sailors to be commanded by him—that is not the order of nature." And with this haughty gesture, he hurriedly picked up the tools of reason, and disappeared into the Academy, leaving the world to Machiavelli.</p>
<p class="normal3">因此，在理性与政治的第一次重大交锋中，理性的策略是愤怒地退却。但与此同时，正如柏拉图告诉我们的那样，船在海上。自柏拉图写作以来，海上有许多船只，而今天，无论我们的信念是明智还是愚蠢，我们都不能仅仅因为一个人知道如何“关注年份、季节、天空、星星和风，以及属于他的艺术的一切”就称他为真正的领航员。他不能忽视让那艘船顺利航行所需的一切。因为船上有叛乱者，他不能说：这对我们所有人来说都很糟糕……我不应该处理叛乱，这不符合自然规律……我不应该考虑叛乱……我知道如何航行……我不知道如何驾驶一艘满载水手的船……如果他们不认为我是掌舵人，我也没办法。我们都会触礁，他们将为自己的罪孽受到惩罚；我确信我更了解……</p><p class="normal3">Thus, in the first great encounter between reason and politics, the strategy of reason was to retire in anger. But meanwhile, as Plato tells us, the ship is at sea. There have been many ships on the sea, since Plato wrote, and to-day, whether we are wise or foolish in our belief, we could no longer call a man a true pilot, simply because he knows how to "pay attention to the year and seasons and sky and stars and winds, and whatever else belongs to his art." He can dismiss nothing which is necessary to make that ship sail prosperously. Because there are mutineers aboard, he cannot say: so much the worse for us all… it is not in the order of nature that I should handle a mutiny… it is not in the order of philosophy that I should consider mutiny… I know how to navigate… I do not know how to navigate a ship full of sailors… and if they do not see that I am the man to steer, I cannot help it. We shall all go on the rocks, they to be punished for their sins; I, with the assurance that I knew better….</p>

<p class="normal3">每当我们在政治上诉诸理性时，这个寓言中的困难就会重现。因为用理性的方法来处理一个不讲道理的世界本身就很困难。即使你和柏拉图一样认为真正的领航员知道什么对船最好，你也必须记住，他并不是那么容易被识别的，而且这种不确定性让大部分船员不相信。根据定义，船员不知道他所知道的，而领航员被星星和风迷住了，不知道如何让船员认识到他所知道的东西的重要性。在海上叛乱期间，没有时间让每个水手成为专家中的专家。领航员也没有时间咨询他的船员，看看他是否真的像他认为的那样聪明。因为教育需要几年的时间，紧急情况只需要几个小时。那么，告诉领航员，真正的补救措施是，例如，一种能让水手更好地掌握证据的教育，那就完全是学术性的了。你只能告诉陆地上的船长这一点。在危机中，唯一的建议是使用枪支，或发表演讲，喊出激动人心的口号，提出妥协，使用任何可用的快速手段来平息叛乱，证据就是证据。只有在岸上，人们计划进行多次航行，他们才有能力，也必须为了自己的救赎，处理那些需要很长时间才能消除的原因。他们将在几年和几代人的时间里处理，而不仅仅是在紧急情况下。没有什么比区分假危机和真危机更能考验他们的智慧了。因为当空气中弥漫着恐慌，一个危机接踵而至，真实的危险与想象的恐惧混杂在一起时，根本没有机会建设性地运用理性，任何秩序很快就会显得比任何混乱都好。</p><p class="normal3">Whenever we make an appeal to reason in politics, the difficulty in this parable recurs. For there is an inherent difficulty about using the method of reason to deal with an unreasoning world. Even if you assume with Plato that the true pilot knows what is best for the ship, you have to recall that he is not so easy to recognize, and that this uncertainty leaves a large part of the crew unconvinced. By definition the crew does not know what he knows, and the pilot, fascinated by the stars and winds, does not know how to make the crew realize the importance of what he knows. There is no time during mutiny at sea to make each sailor an expert judge of experts. There is no time for the pilot to consult his crew and find out whether he is really as wise as he thinks he is. For education is a matter of years, the emergency a matter of hours. It would be altogether academic, then, to tell the pilot that the true remedy is, for example, an education that will endow sailors with a better sense of evidence. You can tell that only to shipmasters on dry land. In the crisis, the only advice is to use a gun, or make a speech, utter a stirring slogan, offer a compromise, employ any quick means available to quell the mutiny, the sense of evidence being what it is. It is only on shore where men plan for many voyages, that they can afford to, and must for their own salvation, deal with those causes that take a long time to remove. They will be dealing in years and generations, not in emergencies alone. And nothing will put a greater strain upon their wisdom than the necessity of distinguishing false crises from real ones. For when there is panic in the air, with one crisis tripping over the heels of another, actual dangers mixed with imaginary scares, there is no chance at all for the constructive use of reason, and any order soon seems preferable to any disorder.</p>
<p class="normal3">只有在长期稳定的前提下，人们才有可能遵循理性的方法。这并不是因为人类无能，也不是因为诉诸理性是空想，而是因为政治主题上的理性发展才刚刚开始。我们在政治上的理性观念仍然是庞大而单薄的概括，过于抽象和粗略，无法提供实际指导，除非总量大到足以抵消个人特质并表现出很大的一致性。政治上的理性在预测个人行为方面尤其不成熟，因为在人类行为中，最小的初始变化往往会产生最复杂的差异。也许这就是为什么当我们试图在处理突发情况时仅仅坚持诉诸理性时，我们会被打败并被笑死。</p><p class="normal3">It is only on the premise of a certain stability over a long run of time that men can hope to follow the method of reason. This is not because mankind is inept, or because the appeal to reason is visionary, but because the evolution of reason on political subjects is only in its beginnings. Our rational ideas in politics are still large, thin generalities, much too abstract and unrefined for practical guidance, except where the aggregates are large enough to cancel out individual peculiarity and exhibit large uniformities. Reason in politics is especially immature in predicting the behavior of individual men, because in human conduct the smallest initial variation often works out into the most elaborate differences. That, perhaps, is why when we try to insist solely upon an appeal to reason in dealing with sudden situations, we are broken and drowned in laughter.</p>

</p>
<p class="normal3">因为我们拥有的理性本身的发展速度比采取行动的速度要慢。因此，在政治科学的现状下，一种情况在被清楚地理解之前就倾向于转变为另一种情况，因此，政治批评大多是事后诸葛亮，其他的就不多。无论是在发现未知事物时，还是在传播已被证实的事物时，都存在时间差异，政治哲学家应该比以往任何时候都更加关注这一差异。我们已经开始研究看不见的环境对我们观点的影响，主要是在格雷厄姆·沃拉斯先生的启发下。我们目前还不了解政治中的时间因素，除了一点点经验法则，尽管它与任何建设性建议的可行性有着最直接的关系。例如，我们可以看到，任何计划的相关性在某种程度上都取决于行动所需的时间长度。因为时间的长短将决定计划假设的数据是否真的保持不变。这里有一个因素，现实和经验丰富的人确实会考虑到，这有助于以某种方式将他们与机会主义者、空想家、庸人和学究区分开来。但目前我们还不知道时间计算是如何以任何系统的方式进入政治的。</p><p class="normal3">For the rate at which reason, as we possess it, can advance itself is slower than the rate at which action has to be taken. In the present state of political science there is, therefore, a tendency for one situation to change into another, before the first is clearly understood, and so to make much political criticism hindsight and little else. Both in the discovery of what is unknown, and in the propagation of that which has been proved, there is a time-differential, which ought to, in a much greater degree than it ever has, occupy the political philosopher. We have begun, chiefly under the inspiration of Mr. Graham Wallas, to examine the effect of an invisible environment upon our opinions. We do not, as yet, understand, except a little by rule of thumb, the element of time in politics, though it bears most directly upon the practicability of any constructive proposal. We can see, for example, that somehow the relevancy of any plan depends upon the length of time the operation requires. Because on the length of time it will depend whether the data which the plan assumes as given, will in truth remain the same. There is a factor here which realistic and experienced men do take into account, and it helps to mark them off somehow from the opportunist, the visionary, the philistine and the pedant. But just how the calculation of time enters into politics we do not know at present in any systematic way.</p>
<p class="normal3">在我们更清楚地理解这些问题之前，我们至少可以记住，存在一个在理论上极其困难、在实践上也极为重要的问题。这将帮助我们珍惜柏拉图的理想，而不赞同他关于不听从理性的人的乖僻的草率结论。在政治上服从理性是困难的，因为你试图让两个进程一起前进，而这两个进程目前还具有不同的步调和速度。在理性变得微妙和具体之前，政治的直接斗争将继续需要一定数量的天生的智慧、力量和无法证实的信念，而这些是理性既不能提供也不能控制的，因为生活的事实太过单一，超出了理性的理解能力。社会科学的方法还很不完善，以至于在许多严肃的决定和大多数随意的决定中，目前还没有选择，只能按照直觉的提示与命运赌一把。</p><p class="normal3">Until we understand these matters more clearly, we can at least remember that there is a problem of the utmost theoretical difficulty and practical consequence. It will help us to cherish Plato's ideal, without sharing his hasty conclusion about the perversity of those who do not listen to reason. It is hard to obey reason in politics, because you are trying to make two processes march together, which have as yet a different gait and a different pace. Until reason is subtle and particular, the immediate struggle of politics will continue to require an amount of native wit, force, and unprovable faith, that reason can neither provide nor control, because the facts of life are too undifferentiated for its powers of understanding. The methods of social science are so little perfected that in many of the serious decisions and most of the casual ones, there is as yet no choice but to gamble with fate as intuition prompts.</p>
<p class="normal3">但是，我们可以把对理性的信仰变成直觉之一。我们可以用我们的智慧和力量为理性找到立足点。在我们对世界的描绘背后，我们可以试图看到更长事件持续时间的远景，只要有可能摆脱紧迫的现实，就让这段更长的时间来控制我们的决定。然而，即使我们有这种让未来发挥作用的意愿，我们还是一次又一次地发现，我们不知道如何根据理性的指示行事。理性准备指示的人类问题数量很少。</p><p class="normal3">But we can make a belief in reason one of those intuitions. We can use our wit and our force to make footholds for reason. Behind our pictures of the world, we can try to see the vista of a longer duration of events, and wherever it is possible to escape from the urgent present, allow this longer time to control our decisions. And yet, even when there is this will to let the future count, we find again and again that we do not know for certain how to act according to the dictates of reason. The number of human problems on which reason is prepared to dictate is small.</p>

<p class="normal3">然而，这种慈善行为源自自我认知，以及我们这个群居物种中没有一个人在渴望一个更加友好的世界，这种信念是无可争辩的。人们彼此之间做出的许多鬼脸动作都只是随着脉搏的跳动而消失，因此它们并非全部都重要。在如此多不确定因素、如此多行动必须基于猜测的情况下，对单纯体面的储备要求是巨大的，我们必须像善意会起作用一样生活。我们无法证明它在每个例子中都会起作用，也无法证明为什么仇恨、不宽容、怀疑、偏执、保密、恐惧和撒谎是反对公众舆论的七宗罪。我们只能坚持认为，它们在诉诸理性时毫无用处，从长远来看，它们是一种毒药；如果我们坚持一种比我们自己的困境和生命更持久的世界观，我们就会对这些产生强烈的偏见。</p><p class="normal3">There is, however, a noble counterfeit in that charity which comes from self-knowledge and an unarguable belief that no one of our gregarious species is alone in his longing for a friendlier world. So many of the grimaces men make at each other go with a flutter of their pulse, that they are not all of them important. And where so much is uncertain, where so many actions have to be carried out on guesses, the demand upon the reserves of mere decency is enormous, and it is necessary to live as if good will would work. We cannot prove in every instance that it will, nor why hatred, intolerance, suspicion, bigotry, secrecy, fear, and lying are the seven deadly sins against public opinion. We can only insist that they have no place in the appeal to reason, that in the longer run they are a poison; and taking our stand upon a view of the world which outlasts our own predicaments, and our own lives, we can cherish a hearty prejudice against them.</p>
<p class="normal3">如果我们不让恐惧和狂热深深地影响我们，以至于我们因为对人类的未来失去信心而恼怒地举手投降，对长远的未来失去兴趣，那么我们就能做得更好。这种绝望是没有理由的，因为正如詹姆斯所说，我们的命运所依赖的所有假设<i class="calibre10">都</i>
 像以往一样充满意义。我们已经看到了残酷，而且因为它很奇怪，所以它不是决定性的。1914 年至 1919 年，那只是柏林、莫斯科、凡尔赛，而不是我们夸张地说的世界末日。人们越是现实地面对残酷和歇斯底里，他们就越有权说，人们因为又一场大战而相信智慧、勇气和努力永远无法为所有人创造美好的生活，这并不是愚蠢的。</p><p class="normal3">We can do this all the better if we do not allow frightfulness and fanaticism to impress us so deeply that we throw up our hands peevishly, and lose interest in the longer run of time because we have lost faith in the future of man. There is no ground for this despair, because all the <i class="calibre10">ifs</i>
 on which, as James said, our destiny hangs, are as pregnant as they ever were. What we have seen of brutality, we have seen, and because it was strange, it was not conclusive. It was only Berlin, Moscow, Versailles in 1914 to 1919, not Armageddon, as we rhetorically said. The more realistically men have faced out the brutality and the hysteria, the more they have earned the right to say that it is not foolish for men to believe, because another great war took place, that intelligence, courage and effort cannot ever contrive a good life for all men.</p>
<p class="normal3">尽管恐怖十分严重，但并非普遍现象。有腐败的，也有廉洁的。有混乱的，也有奇迹的。有弥天大谎。也有人有意愿揭露谎言。这不是判断，而是一种情绪，当人们否认某些人曾经是，更多的人，最终是足够多的人，可能会是。你可以对从未发生过的事情感到绝望。你可以对有三个脑袋感到绝望，尽管萧伯纳甚至拒绝对此感到绝望。但你不能对人类所表现出的任何人类品质可能存在的可能性感到绝望。如果在这十年的所有罪恶中，你还没有看到你想增加的男人和女人，以及已知的时刻，上帝自己也帮不了你。</p><p class="normal3">Great as was the horror, it was not universal. There were corrupt, and there were incorruptible. There was muddle and there were miracles. There was huge lying. There were men with the will to uncover it. It is no judgment, but only a mood, when men deny that what some men have been, more men, and ultimately enough men, might be. You can despair of what has never been. You can despair of ever having three heads, though Mr. Shaw has declined to despair even of that. But you cannot despair of the possibilities that could exist by virtue of any human quality which a human being has exhibited. And if amidst all the evils of this decade, you have not seen men and women, known moments that you would like to multiply, the Lord himself cannot help you.</p>
