<p class="noindent">法律无处不在。随便看看新闻，你都会听到臭名昭著的刑事审判、大规模诉讼或新的宪法主张。这一切看起来都错综复杂。为什么有些法律技术细节会难倒警察，让罪犯逍遥法外？为什么诉讼耗时如此之长，费用如此高昂？法院如何判断宪法条款如何适用于那些制定者从未想过的情况？</p><p class="noindent">Law is everywhere. Check the news any day and you’ll hear about a notorious criminal trial, a massive lawsuit, or a new constitutional claim. And it all seems so complicated. Why are there legal technicalities that trip up the police and allow criminals to get off? Why does litigation take so long and cost so much? How do the courts figure out how the words of the Constitution apply to situations the framers never dreamed of?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>律师受过专业训练，能够理解这类问题，而且有很多资源可以帮助他们。我所在的法学院图书馆藏书近50万册，还有无数的在线资源，律师可以在其中找到法规、司法意见和法律评论。这本书适合所有人阅读。<em class="calibre8">《法律入门》</em>对律师和法官使用的规则和原则进行了基础讲解。本书的前提很简单：解决法律问题并非易事，但任何人都可以对这些问题所涉及的内容获得基本的了解。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Lawyers are trained to understand issues like these, and there are plenty of resources to help them. The library at my law school has almost 500,000 volumes and innumerable online resources in which lawyers can find statutes, judicial opinions, and learned commentary on the law. This book is for everybody else. <em class="calibre8">Law 101</em> is a basic explanation of the rules and principles that lawyers and judges use. The premise of the book is straightforward: It’s not easy to decide legal questions, but anyone can acquire a basic understanding of what the questions involve.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>本书的每个章节都涵盖了每位律师在法学院一年级学习的基本主题之一：宪法、民权、民事诉讼程序和诉讼程序、侵权行为、合同、财产、刑法以及刑事诉讼程序。在每一章中，你将学习该主题背后的基本原则，掌握一些法律词汇，并了解这些规则在常见和不常见情况下的运用。（如果你想了解更多法律术语的简单定义，请参阅本书的姊妹篇《<em class="calibre8">你需要知道的1001个法律词汇》</em>。）本书不仅向你讲解法律，更重要的是，它引导你参与到法律制定的过程中，思考律师和法官面临的棘手问题和棘手案例。你也会在阅读过程中获得一些乐趣，因为法律所涉及的情况总是引人入胜，有时甚至令人捧腹大笑或匪夷所思。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Each of the substantive chapters of the book covers one of the basic subjects that every lawyer learns during the first year of law school: constitutional law, civil rights, civil procedure and the litigation process, torts, contracts, property, criminal law, and criminal procedure. In each chapter you will learn the fundamental principles that underlie the subject, acquire a legal vocabulary, and see how the rules are applied in ordinary and unusual situations. (If you want simple definitions of even more legal terms, consult this book’s companion volume, <em class="calibre8">1001 Legal Words You Need to Know</em>.) The book not only tells you about the law—more importantly, it engages you in the process of lawmaking by asking you to think about the tough questions and troubling cases that lawyers and judges face. You will have some fun along the way as well, because the situations the law deals with are always interesting and sometimes amusing or outrageous.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>读完本书后，当你听到有争议的法律问题时，你会更好地理解这些问题的背景和复杂性，并能够更好地判断法律应该如何制定。你也能更好地思考日常生活中可能遇到的法律问题，从拥有房产到起诉他人，再到维护你的宪法权利。如果你曾经考虑过上法学院，<em class="calibre8">法律入门课程</em>将让你体验一下。如果你是一名学生，无论是在法学院<a id="text/part0005.html.page_xii" class="calibre4"></a>或者在其他地方，它将为你提供一些通过其他方式很难获得的基本法律主题的全景。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After reading this book, when you hear about controversial legal issues you will have a better sense of the background and the complexity of the issues and you will be better able to make your own judgments about what the law should be. You also will be better prepared to think about the legal problems that you may encounter in everyday life, from owning a home to suing someone to asserting your constitutional rights. If you ever have considered going to law school, <em class="calibre8">Law 101</em> will give you a taste of what it is like. And if you are a student, either in law school <a class="calibre4"></a>or elsewhere, it will give you the big picture of basic legal subjects that otherwise can be hard to obtain.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>虽然我是一名律师和法学教授，但撰写和修订本书的过程对我来说，如同我希望对读者一样，都是一种教育。我不得不重新思考许多并非我专长的主题，并重新审视了我多年来一直研究的领域。我非常感谢所有在此过程中给予我帮助的人。Carl Bogus、Dennis Braithwaite、Ed Chase、Kim Ferzan、Beth Hillman、Greg Lastowka、Thomas LeBien、Earl Maltz、Stanislaw Pomorski、Mike Sepanic、Rick Singer、Allan Stein 和 Bob Williams 给了我极好的评价。Elizabeth Boyd、Sheryl Fay、Nicole Friant、Amy Newnam 和 Beth Pascal 提供了有益的研究协助。Chris Carr 和 Bill Lutz 提供了早期支持。罗格斯大学卡姆登分校法学院及其各位院长为开展此类工作提供了良好的环境。最重要的是，感谢 John Wright，是他促成了这一切。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Although I am a lawyer and law professor, writing and revising this book have been as much of an education for me as I hope it will be for its readers.

Carl Bogus, Dennis Braithwaite, Ed Chase, Kim Ferzan, Beth Hillman, Greg Lastowka, Thomas LeBien, Earl Maltz, Stanislaw Pomorski, Mike Sepanic, Rick Singer, Allan Stein, and Bob Williams gave me excellent comments. Elizabeth Boyd, Sheryl Fay, Nicole Friant, Amy Newnam, and Beth Pascal provided helpful research assistance. Chris Carr and Bill Lutz gave early support.

Liebeck’s injuries sent her to the hospital for seven days for burn treatment, including skin grafts, so she sued McDonald’s, alleging that the coffee was dangerously hot. A jury awarded her $160,000 to compensate her for her injuries and $2.7 million to punish McDonald’s, an amount the jury calculated was equal to two days of coffee sales for McDonald’s.

<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>大多数法律并非关乎总统对敌方战斗人员的定义之类的重要案件，也不是乔治·齐默尔曼那样的戏剧性案件。法律以多种方式渗透到我们的日常生活中。批评人士指责，近年来我们饱受“词汇超量”（法律太多，律师太多）的困扰，但法律从一开始就渗透到我们的社会中。甚至在清教徒登陆马萨诸塞州之前，他们就制定了《五月花号公约》，这是一份规范他们在新大陆定居的法律文件。在殖民时期，对经济、公共行为和社会道德的法律规制至少同样广泛。<a id="text/part0007_split_001.html.page_3" class="calibre4"></a>就像今天一样。诸如通奸、酗酒和懒惰等人类常见的缺陷都会受到法律的惩罚，而且经常受到惩罚。法律也对经济事务进行严格的监管，规定了面包的大小以及商品出售的时间和地点。普通的诉讼为公众集会提供了机会，律师们会发表长篇大论，公众也会发表大量评论。如今，当我们租房或买房、结婚、开车、借钱、购买商品、加入组织、上学或工作以及获得医疗保健时，法律都会影响到我们个人；而当政府征税、监管电波和网络空间、打击犯罪和控制污染时，法律也会影响到我们集体。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Most of the law is not about important cases like the president’s definition of enemy combatants or dramatic cases like George Zimmerman’s. Law penetrates our everyday life in many ways. Critics charge that in recent years we have become plagued with “hyperlexis”—too much law and too many lawyers—but law has pervaded our society from the beginning. Even before the Pilgrims landed in Massachusetts they formulated the Mayflower Compact, a legal document that governed their settlement of the new world. In colonial times, legal regulation of the economy, public conduct, and social morality was at least as extensive <a class="calibre4"></a>as it is today. Common human failings such as fornication, drunkenness, and idleness were legally—and frequently—punished, and laws closely regulated economic affairs, prescribing the size of loaves of bread and the time and place at which goods could be sold. Ordinary litigation provided an occasion for public gathering, with great orations by the lawyers and much comment by the public. Today the law affects us individually when we rent apartments or own homes, marry, drive cars, borrow money, purchase goods, belong to organizations, go to school or work, and obtain health care and collectively when the government taxes, regulates the airwaves and cyberspace, polices crime, and controls pollution.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>尽管我们对法律有着无尽的迷恋，但大多数人却难以真正理解其本质。法律如此复杂浩瀚，以至于没有人，即使是最博学的律师，也无法完全理解。此外，律师和法律学者也并未竭尽全力让普通人能够理解法律。恰恰相反：法律专业人士，就像某些冷门宗教的牧师一样，常常试图让法律保持神秘莫测、难以理解。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For all our endless fascination with the law, it is hard for most people to learn much about its substance. The law is so complex and voluminous that no one, not even the most knowledgeable lawyer, can understand it all. Moreover, lawyers and legal scholars have not gone out of their way to make the law accessible to the ordinary person. Just the opposite: Legal professionals, like the priests of some obscure religion, too often try to keep the law mysterious and inaccessible.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>但每个人都可以学到一些法律知识。这就是<em class="calibre8">“法律入门”</em>的宗旨。它讲解了法律的基础知识——律师和法官使用的规则、原则和辩论论点。并非所有法律都涵盖在这本书里；法律内容实在太多，任何人都无法只学习其中的几个部分。这也是大多数律师选择专业的原因之一，这样他们就可以深入学习新泽西州的医疗事故法或与公司相关的联邦税法。但所有律师在基本科目和基本概念方面掌握的知识都大同小异，因为他们都拥有类似的法学院经历。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But everybody can learn something about the law. That is what <em class="calibre8">Law 101</em> is for. It explains the basics of the law—the rules, principles, and arguments that lawyers and judges use. Not all the law is here; there is just too much law for anyone to learn more than a few pieces of it here and there. That’s one reason that most lawyers specialize, so that they can learn in depth the law of medical malpractice in New Jersey or federal tax law relating to corporations, for example. But all lawyers do know pretty much the same things when it comes to basic subjects and basic concepts, because they all go through a similar law school experience.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>公众似乎对法学院的痴迷程度不亚于对法律的痴迷程度。从<em class="calibre8">《平步青云》</em>到<em class="calibre8">《律政俏佳人》</em>等书籍和电影，都让法学院一年级的传说成为一种既能激发智力，又令人精疲力竭、毫无人性的经历。由于法学院一年级几乎是所有律师的训练场，本书聚焦于法学院学生在一年级学到的知识的实质内容，将其作为核心知识，对非律师人士也同样有用且有趣。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The public seems to be morbidly fascinated by law school as much as by law. Books and movies from <em class="calibre8">The Paper Chase</em> to <em class="calibre8">Legally Blonde</em> have fed the folklore of the first year of law school as an intellectually stimulating but grueling and dehumanizing experience. Because the first year of law school is the near-universal training ground for lawyers, this book focuses on the substance of what law students learn there as the core of knowledge that is useful and interesting to nonlawyers as well.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>几乎所有美国法学院的第一年课程都大同小异。本书探讨了一些基础主题。宪法涉及政府结构（<a id="text/part0007_split_001.html.n0103" href="#text/part0008_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-2" class="calibre4">第二章</a>）以及免受政府行为影响的个人自由（<a id="text/part0007_split_001.html.n0104" href="#text/part0009_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-3" class="calibre4">第三章</a>）。民事诉讼程序涉及诉讼程序（<a id="text/part0007_split_001.html.n0105" href="#text/part0010_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-4" class="calibre4">第四</a>章）。侵权法涉及人身伤害（<a id="text/part0007_split_001.html.n0106" href="#text/part0011_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-5" class="calibre4">第五章</a>）。合同法是关于私人协议的法律（<a id="text/part0007_split_001.html.n0107" href="#text/part0012_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-6" class="calibre4">第六章</a>）。财产法则规范个人与他人之间的关系。<a id="text/part0007_split_001.html.page_4" class="calibre4"></a>人们对物权的所有权（<a id="text/part0007_split_001.html.n0108" href="#text/part0013_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-7" class="calibre4">第七章</a>）。刑法界定了国家可以剥夺个人生命或自由的不法行为（<a id="text/part0007_split_001.html.n0109" href="#text/part0014_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-8" class="calibre4">第八章</a>）。刑事诉讼程序规定了刑事审判的程序和被告的权利（<a id="text/part0007_split_001.html.n0110" href="#text/part0015_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-9" class="calibre4">第九章</a>）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The first-year curriculum in nearly every American law school looks alike. A few topics are fundamental, and this book explores those topics. Constitutional law involves the structure of government (<a href="#text/part0008_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-2" class="calibre4">Chapter 2</a>) and personal liberties protected from government action (<a href="#text/part0009_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-3" class="calibre4">Chapter 3</a>).

<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>几乎每所法学院都开设宪法、合同法等课程，不同学院的课程在所用材料和涵盖主题方面有相当大的相似性。新泽西州、爱荷华州和加利福尼亚州的法学院都教授国家法律的基本原则，通常使用相同的司法意见和成文法。如果你读完本书后再去法学院学习，你会发现第一年的大部分课程对你来说都很熟悉。然而，每门课程都由不同的教授讲授，而且每位教授都有不同的视角。这些视角上的差异有些微不足道，但有些却至关重要。一位教授可能是政治自由派，另一位教授可能是保守派。一位教授可能倾向于将经济分析作为理解法律的关键，而另一位教授则采取自然法的视角。这些视角上的差异，以及其他许多存在的差异，都导致对法律的理解截然不同。因此，尽管法学院学生和律师在原则上都理解同一条法律，但他们理解的方式却各不相同。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Nearly every law school offers courses in constitutional law, contract law, and the rest, and the courses taught in different schools resemble each other to a considerable degree in the materials used and the topics covered. Schools in New Jersey, Iowa, and California all teach basic principles of national law, often using the same judicial opinions and statutes. If you attend law school after reading this book, you will find much of the first year will be familiar to you. Every course is taught by a different professor, however, and every professor has a different perspective. Some of those differences in perspective are trivial, but some are crucial. One professor may be a political liberal, another a conservative. One may favor economic analysis as a key to understanding the law, while another takes a natural law approach. Each of these differences in perspective, and the many others that occur, leads to a very different understanding of what the law is. So while law students and lawyers all understand the same law in principle, they understand it in different ways.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这本书也有一个独特的视角。它不可能以其他任何方式呈现。本书的视角汲取了众多关于法律的优秀学术成果。其中一些观点被广泛接受，而另一些则颇具争议。这些观点可以概括为以下几点关于法律的见解。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This book has a perspective, too. It couldn’t be any other way. The perspective of this book is informed by much of the best scholarship about the law. Some of the elements of the perspective are widely accepted, and others are more controversial. The perspective can be summed up in a few insights about the law, as follows.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">法律并非存在于法律书籍之中</em>。当我们想到法律时，首先想到的便是书籍：厚厚的、几乎无法搬动的文字；布满灰尘、皮革封面的大量判例；堆满成排成排法规和司法意见的法律图书馆。虽然书籍能告诉我们很多关于法律的知识，但它们并非法律本身。相反，法律存在于行为之中，而非纸面上；它存在于法官、律师和普通公民的互动之中。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">Law is not in the law books</em>. Books are one of the first things that come to mind when we think about law: fat texts almost too heavy to lift; dust-covered, leather-bound tomes of precedents; law libraries filled with rows and rows of statutes and judicial opinions. While books tell us a lot about the law, they are not the law. Instead, law lives in conduct, not on the printed page; it exists in the interactions of judges, lawyers, and ordinary citizens.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>比如，想想我们最常遇到的法律之一：限速。大多数州际公路的法定限速是多少？只查法律书籍的人可能会认为答案是65英里/小时，但我们更清楚。如果你在新泽西收费公路上以65英里/小时的速度行驶，就要做好被卡车撞到的准备，卡车会闪着警灯，逼你驶入慢车道。根据司机的行为，限速远高于65英里/小时。执法人员也是如此。警察会给司机3到5英里/小时的缓冲速度，绝不会给开到66英里/小时的人开超速罚单。如果他们开罚单，法官会在交通法庭上一笑置之。作为一个实际的例子<a id="text/part0007_split_001.html.page_5" class="calibre4"></a>重要的是，法院不想把时间浪费在超速1到2英里/小时的人身上，而且从法律角度来看，警方的雷达通常不够精确，无法划出这么高的罚单。那么，法律是如何规定车速的呢？和书上说的不一样。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Think, for example, about one of the laws we most commonly encounter: the speed limit. What is the legal speed limit on most interstate highways? Someone who looked only in the law books might think the answer is 65 mph, but we know better. If you drive at 65 mph on the New Jersey Turnpike, be prepared to have a truck bearing down on you, flashing its lights to get you to pull into the slow lane. The speed limit according to drivers’ conduct is considerably higher than 65. And legal officials act the same way. The police give drivers a cushion of 3 to 5 mph, never giving a speeding ticket to someone who is going 66. If they did, the judges would laugh them out of traffic court. As a practical <a class="calibre4"></a>matter, the court doesn’t want to waste its time with someone who violated the speed limit by 1 or 2 mph, and as a matter of law, the police radar often isn’t accurate enough to draw that fine a line anyway. So what is the law on how fast you can drive? Something different than the books say.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>因此，要理解法律，我们必须审视世界上发生的事件。我们可以从这些事件中概括出来，创建理论和概念来指导我们对法律的理解，但试金石永远是世界而不是想法。在法学院做到这一点的一种方法是关注引起诉讼的个别事实情况以及解决这些情况的司法意见，即<em class="calibre8">案例</em>。每一个案例都始于现实世界的事件，例如乔治齐默尔曼杀害特雷沃恩马丁或敌方战斗人员被拘留，并成为思考许多相关事件的载体，让我们能够在特定事实情况和一般法律原则之间来回切换。本书遵循该模型，并使用许多有趣的案例来探讨法律原则。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To understand the law, then, we have to examine events as they occur in the world. We can generalize from those events and create theories and concepts to inform our understanding of the law, but the touchstone is always the world and not the idea. One way this is done in law school is by focusing on individual fact situations that give rise to litigation and on the judicial opinions that resolve the situations, known as <em class="calibre8">cases</em>. Each of these cases starts out as a real-world event, such as the killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman or the detention of enemy combatants, and becomes the vehicle for thinking about many related events in a way that allows us to go back and forth between the particular fact situation and a general principle of law. This book follows that model and uses many interesting cases to explore legal principles.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">法律并非秘密</em>。除了认为法律存在于书本中这一错误观念之外，还有一种同样错误的观念，认为法律是秘密的，或者至少是普通人无法接触的。要理解和运用像律师那样高深的技术层面的法律，需要专业知识，但理解法律的基本内容则无需专业知识。法律反映生活。法律中体现的原则和问题与我们在生活其他方面所经历的并无二致。例如，合同法是对人们在商业和非商业环境中做出、解释、遵守和违背承诺的方式的评述。很少有非律师人士能够描述合同成立的客观理论或《反欺诈法》（读完<a id="text/part0007_split_001.html.n0111" href="#text/part0012_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-6" class="calibre4">第六章</a>后你就能理解），但他们对合同和承诺进行了大量的思考。如果你在许诺时交叉手指，这是否意味着这个承诺不算数？如果你答应带孩子去看电影，如果在此期间有一场重要的商务会议，你是否可以逃脱责任？如果你只是不喜欢它怎么办？如果你新买的电视机坏了，可以退货吗？等等。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">Law is not secret</em>. Along with the mistaken notion that the law resides in the books goes the equally mistaken idea that law is secret, or at least inaccessible to the ordinary person. To understand and apply the law at the advanced, technical level that lawyers do requires professional knowledge, but to understand the basic substance of the law does not. Law reflects life. The principles and issues embodied in the law are not different from those that we experience in other aspects of our lives. Contract law, for example, is a commentary on the way people make, interpret, keep, and break their promises in commercial and noncommercial settings. Few nonlawyers can describe the objective theory of contract formation or the Statute of Frauds (you will be able to after you read <a href="#text/part0012_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-6" class="calibre4">Chapter 6</a>), but they have thought a lot about contracts and promises. If you cross your fingers when you make a promise, does it mean that the promise doesn’t count? If you promise to take your children to the movies, are you off the hook if an important business meeting comes up in the meantime? What about if you just don’t feel like it? If your newly purchased television doesn’t work, can you return it to the store? And so on.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这些都是我们每天都会遇到的问题。法律提供了一个不同的平台来讨论这些问题，探索其中的原则，而且其中涉及的基本思想即使非律师人士也能理解。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These are the kinds of issues that we all confront every day. The law provides a different forum for the discussion of these issues and the exploration of the principles, and the basic ideas involved are wholly accessible to the nonlawyer.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">没有简单的答案</em>。法律反映生活，而生活错综复杂。因此，法律问题难以用简单的方法解决。<a id="text/part0007_split_001.html.page_6" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">There are no simple answers</em>. Law reflects life, and life is complicated. Therefore, legal problems defy simple solutions.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>生活在两个方面很复杂。首先，事情往往很复杂，很难界定一个法律问题并构建合适的解决方案。想想速度限制。如果我们制定一条明确的规则，在本例中是“超速驾驶是犯罪”，我们不可避免地会遇到例外，例如“父母急着送重病的孩子去医院，可以超速行驶”。如果我们制定一条模糊的规则——“以当时情况下合理的速度行驶”，那么在每个案例中，我们都会引发关于如何应用该规则的争论。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Life is complicated in two ways. First, things are often messy, so it is hard to define a legal issue and construct an appropriate solution. Think about the speed limit. If we formulate a clear rule, in this instance “driving faster than the speed limit is a crime,” we will inevitably end up with exceptions, such as “a parent rushing a desperately ill child to the hospital may exceed the speed limit.” If we formulate a fuzzy rule—“drive at a speed that is reasonable under the circumstances”—we will engender arguments in every case about how the rule should apply.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>其次，生活之所以复杂，是因为我们常常对某个问题持有不同意见。我们希望有明确的法律规则来确保一致性、公平性和可预见性。但当某项规则的适用会导致不公平结果时，我们也希望为个案的公平性留出空间，以减轻特定当事人因该规则而遭受的困境。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Second, life is complicated because we often are of two minds about an issue. We would like to have clear legal rules to ensure consistency, fairness, and predictability. But we want to make room for the equities of individual cases in which the application of a rule would produce an unfair result, in order to relieve a particular party of the hardship of the rule.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>政客们常常想让我们相信，棘手的法律问题总有简单的答案。过去几年，我们已经习惯了那些空洞的政治言论和过于简单的意识形态，它们声称所有问题都可以通过减少无谓的诉讼、严厉打击犯罪、追究个人责任或遵循其他口号来解决。但从本书的视角来看，事实并非如此。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Politicians often would like us to think that there are simple answers to tough legal questions. Over the past few years we have become accustomed to sound-bite politics and simplistic ideologies that assert that all our problems can be solved by cutting down on frivolous litigation, getting tough on crime, making people responsible for their actions, or adhering to some other slogan. From the perspective used in this book, it’s just not so.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">法律是政治冲突的战场</em>。法律处理的复杂问题和我们对这些问题的相互矛盾的回应都是政治争议的焦点。这不是共和党和民主党选举意义上的政治，而是围绕社会资源和社会价值观的斗争。法律裁决所涉及的是任何社会都必须努力解决的最基本问题：谁得到了什么？谁生谁死？什么是对的，什么是错的？每个人都可以在堕胎争议等重大宪法问题上看到这一点，但它也适用于所有其他法律问题。快餐连锁店是否应该对肥胖相关疾病负责，因为它们宣传和销售超大份量的增肥食品？我们必须把所有此类法律裁决都视为广义的政治裁决。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">Law is a battleground of political conflict</em>. The complex questions with which law deals and our conflicting responses to them are the stuff of political controversy. This is not politics in the Republican–Democratic, electoral sense, but a struggle over social resources and social values just the same. At stake in legal decisions are the most fundamental kinds of questions with which any society has to grapple: Who gets what? Who lives and who dies? What is right and what is wrong? Everyone can see this in major constitutional issues like the abortion controversy, but it applies to all other legal issues, too. Should fast-food chains be liable for obesity-related illnesses because they promote and sell super-sized portions of fattening foods? We have to see all legal decisions like this as political in a broad sense.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">人民制定法律</em>。法律常常被视为事物自然秩序的一部分。法律和法律裁决可以被视为不可避免的，基于不可改变的正义原则，几乎不是人类行为的产物。律师和法官的言论仿佛法律本身在行动，不受他们干预：“法律要求……”或“先例决定结果……”。一派胡言。法律是由人民制定的，“法律”或“先例”从不控制任何事情；是我们控制了它们。这种观点所做的一切，就是让一小部分人——特权阶层、政治强人和法律专业人士——控制法律。<a id="text/part0007_split_001.html.page_7" class="calibre4"></a>他们一边推行制度，一边却否认自己这样做的责任。无论问题是堕胎、制造商责任，还是握手协议的可执行性，我们所有人——不仅仅是律师和法官——都必须决定我们认为公平且有用的结果。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">People make the law</em>. Often, the law appears to be part of the natural order of things. The law and legal decisions can be seen as inevitable, based on immutable principles of justice, hardly the product of human action at all. Lawyers and judges speak as if the law itself were acting, free from their intervention: “The law requires that. . .” or “The precedents determine a result. . . .” Nonsense. Law is made by people, and “the law” or “the precedents” never control anything; we control them. All this view does is let a small group of people—the privileged, the politically powerful, and the legal professionals—control the legal <a class="calibre4"></a>system while they deny their responsibility for doing so. Whether the issue is abortion, manufacturers’ liability, or the enforceability of handshake agreements, all of us—not just the lawyers and judges—have to decide what we think is a fair and useful result.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>本书揭开法律的神秘面纱，让非律师人士也能理解法律规则及其背后的原则和冲突。它不会告诉你如何成为自己的律师。你不会学到如何申请离婚、在小额索赔法庭起诉或起草自己的遗嘱。其他书籍会传达这类建议；而本书探讨的问题虽然不那么紧迫，但更为重要。它探讨的是法律的根本问题，而非特定交易的机制。之后，无论你是使用操作手册还是寻求律师帮助处理法律事务，你都会更好地理解规则和机制背后的运作。这本书与其他法律书籍（无论是律师的专业论文还是遗嘱起草指南）有一个重要的区别：这本书读起来很有趣。虚构的儿童作家雷蒙·斯尼奇特写道：“法律书籍以篇幅长、枯燥乏味、难以阅读而闻名。” 这不是<em class="calibre8">《法律入门》</em>。就像法律本身一样，这本书充满了谜题、挑战、有趣的花絮、发人深省的问题和智力刺激。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This book strips away the mystery of the law to allow the nonlawyer to understand the rules of law and the principles and conflicts that are behind them. It doesn’t tell you how to be your own lawyer. You won’t learn how to file for divorce, sue in small claims court, or draft your own will. Other books convey that kind of advice; this one deals with issues that are more important, if less immediate. It explores the big issues that are fundamental to law, not the mechanics of particular transactions. Later, whether you use a how-to manual or go to a lawyer to deal with a legal matter, you will have a better sense of what is going on behind the rules and mechanics. And there is an important difference between this book and other law books, whether professional treatises for lawyers or how-to manuals on will drafting: This one is fun to read. The invented children’s author Lemony Snicket wrote, “Books about the law are notorious for being very long, very dull, and very difficult to read.” Not <em class="calibre8">Law 101</em>. Like the law itself, this book is full of puzzles, challenges, interesting tidbits, thought-provoking questions, and intellectual stimulation.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>每章都采用问答形式。这些问题为章节的展开提供了指引，也使读者能够通过深入研究感兴趣的特定主题进行选择性阅读。在很多地方，问题多于答案，一些问题悬而未决。法律系的学生——包括你——经常会遇到这种情况，并且会感到非常沮丧。但这也是必然的。法律并没有明确地回答某些问题，而有些争议也从未得到最终解决。法院无法裁决所有问题；找到解决难题的公正方案是每个知情人士的权利和义务。读完本书后，你应该能够更好地参与到这个过程之中。<a id="text/part0007_split_001.html.page_8" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Each chapter is organized in question-and-answer format. The questions provide guideposts to the development of the chapter, and they make it possible to read selectively by dipping into particular topics of interest. At many points there are more questions than answers, and issues are left unresolved. Students of the law—and now you are one of them—experience this frequently and find it very frustrating. But that’s the way it has to be. The law doesn’t clearly answer some questions, and some issues are never finally settled. The courts cannot decide everything; figuring out the just solutions to hard problems is the right and duty of every informed person. After reading this book, you should be in a better position to participate in the process.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>

<p class="noindent">即使对民事诉讼法或财产法一无所知的人，也能回忆起八年级公民课上学到的宪法基本要素：权力分立；权力制衡；司法审查；正当程序和法律的平等保护；言论、宗教和新闻自由。如果他们记不住八年级学到的知识，报纸和电视新闻也会提醒他们宪法的持续重要性。堕胎受宪法保护吗？平权法案呢？政府可以把美国公民作为恐怖分子嫌疑人关进军事监狱吗？</p><p class="noindent">People who don’t know anything about civil procedure or property law can still recall the basic elements of constitutional law from their eighth-grade civics class: separation of powers; checks and balances; judicial review; due process and equal protection of law; freedom of speech, religion, and press. And if they can’t remember what they learned in the eighth grade, the newspapers and the television news will remind them of the continuing significance of constitutional law. Is abortion constitutionally protected? How about affirmative action? Can the government hold an American citizen in a military prison as a suspected terrorist?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>政府的一切行为都受宪法约束。宪法界定了总统与国会、联邦政府与各州之间的关系，并规范了政府征税、修建公路、维持和部署武装部队以及印制邮票的能力。此外，每个热点问题似乎都与宪法有关。过去，问题涉及奴隶制的合宪性，以及规定工人最高工时和最低工资的法律；现在，问题涉及堕胎、强制购买医疗保险、在关塔那摩湾拘留敌方战斗人员以及竞选资金。2000年大选之后，甚至连谁应该担任总统都成了宪法问题，这场诉讼最终导致了最高法院在<em class="calibre8">“布什诉戈尔案”</em>中作出裁决。因此，宪法——我们的政府是如何组织的，以及它能做什么和不能做什么——是我们探索美国法律的起点。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Everything the government does is bounded by the Constitution. Constitutional law defines the relations between the president and Congress and between the federal government and the states, and it regulates the government’s ability to assess taxes, to build highways, to maintain and deploy the armed forces, and to print stamps. Moreover, every hot issue seems to become a constitutional question. Once it was the constitutionality of slavery or of laws establishing maximum hours and minimum wages for workers; now it is abortion, the mandatory purchase of health insurance, detaining enemy combatants at Guantanamo Bay, and campaign financing. In the aftermath of the 2000 election, even who should be president became a constitutional issue, in the litigation resulting in the Supreme Court’s decision in <em class="calibre8">Bush v. Gore</em>. So constitutional law—how our government is organized and what it can and cannot do—is the place to begin our exploration of American law.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0008_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-2-div1-2"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0003" class="calibre1">什么是宪法？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0003" class="calibre1">What Is Constitutional Law?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">宪法涉及美国宪法的解释和适用。美国宪法起草于1787年，其内容较少<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_10" class="calibre4"></a>这部宪法超过4400字，分为七个短篇，称为“条款”。《权利法案》（宪法的前十条修正案）于1791年加入，此后两个多世纪里仅增加了十七条修正案。你很快就能像少数美国人那样——从头到尾通读整部宪法。</p><p class="noindent">Constitutional law involves the interpretation and application of the U.S. Constitution. Drafted in 1787, the Constitution contains fewer <a class="calibre4"></a>than 4,400 words, divided into seven short parts called articles. The Bill of Rights (the first ten amendments to the Constitution) was added in 1791, and only seventeen more amendments have been added in the more than two centuries since. It wouldn’t take you long to do what few Americans do—read the whole Constitution, front to back.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>宪法看似浅显易懂，但尽管宪法简洁明了——或许正因为如此——宪法的含义以及如何应用宪法，才是法律中最受争议的话题。在本书探讨的所有法律体系中，宪法显得尤为独特，原因有四。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It seems that constitutional law ought to be easy to understand. But despite the Constitution’s simplicity—or perhaps because of it—what the Constitution means and how it should apply are the most hotly debated topics of the law. And constitutional law is unique among all the bodies of law we will consider in this book, for four reasons.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>首先，其他法律体系相互协作。财产法确立了土地和冰箱等物品的权利，合同法规定了如何将这些权利转让给他人。侵权法规定了受害人向不法行为人追偿损害赔偿的权利，民事诉讼程序则规定了受害人获得赔偿的程序。但宪法与其他法律领域相比，其主题和地位有所不同。宪法不像财产法、合同法和侵权法那样处理个人之间的关系。相反，它定义了政府的结构和职能，以及政府与公民个人之间的关系。它还定义了国家政府和州政府的相对权力，并禁止政府采取某些行动，例如侵犯宗教自由的行动。在定义和限制政府权力方面，宪法高于所有其他法律体系。宪法宣称自己是“国家的最高法律”。任何与宪法相冲突的州或联邦法律（合同、刑事处罚、选举捐款或公立学校）均无效。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>First, other bodies of law work together. Property law creates rights in things like land and refrigerators, and contract law prescribes how to transfer those rights to another person. Tort law defines the right of an injured person to recover damages from a wrongdoer, and civil procedure establishes the process by which the victim can recover. But constitutional law has a different subject matter and a different status than the other fields of law. Constitutional law doesn’t address relations among individuals the way property, contract, and tort law do. Instead, it defines the structure and function of the government and the relationships between the government and individual citizens. It also defines the relative powers of the national government and the state governments and prohibits the government from taking certain actions, such as those that infringe on freedom of religion. In defining and limiting government powers, constitutional law is superior to every other body of law. The Constitution proclaims itself to be “the supreme Law of the Land.” Any state or federal law on any topic—contracts, criminal punishment, election contributions, or public schools—that conflicts with the Constitution is invalid.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>其次，其他法律体系则以一系列成文法和司法判决为基础，这些判决为规则、原则和论点提供了广泛的来源。例如，合同法最初是由法官裁定的普通法科目，后来被许多成文法所覆盖。为了裁决合同案件，法院可以参考各种各样的资料，从古老的英国判例到现代的国家法规。宪法则不同。所有宪法判决最终都指向一个单一的、狭义的来源：宪法正文及其修正案。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Second, other bodies of law are based on a mix of statutes and judicial decisions that provide a wide range of sources for rules, principles, and arguments. Contract law, for example, began as a common law subject determined by judges and has been overlaid by many statutes. To decide a contracts case, a court can look to a rich variety of sources, from old English precedents to modern state statutes. Constitutional law is different. All constitutional decisions ultimately refer to a single, narrow source: the text of the Constitution with its amendments.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>必须参考单一文本，这使得宪法的制定极具挑战性，因为文本必须涵盖极其广泛的情况。当宪法文本针对一个狭窄的问题，并且具体阐述时，我们很容易就能弄清楚如何应用该文本；更常见的情况是，文本内容模糊，其涵盖的案例也更加多样化，因此我们必须确定文本的含义，并<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_11" class="calibre4"></a>在特定情况下会导致什么结果。有时，人们普遍认为这些词的含义与它们表面的意思不同。第一修正案规定“国会不得制定关于下列事项的法律：确立国教或禁止信教自由”，但即使是最热心的严格解释主义者也明白，这项修正案也适用于总统和法院。其他时候，这些词需要广泛的解释。宪法规定任何州不得“拒绝给予其管辖范围内的任何人法律的平等保护”，这是否意味着州立大学不能为了实现学生群体多元化而在招生时优先考虑非裔美国学生？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The necessary reference to a single text makes constitutional law so challenging because of the infinitely broad range of situations that the text must cover. When the constitutional text addresses a narrow issue and does so specifically, we have little problem in figuring out how to apply the text; more often, the text is vague and the cases that it covers are much more diverse, so we have to decide what the text means and <a class="calibre4"></a>what result follows from it in a particular case. Sometimes, by universal agreement, the words mean something other than what they appear to mean. The First Amendment states that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,” but even the most ardent strict constructionist understands that the amendment also applies to the president and the courts. Other times the words demand extensive interpretation. Does the constitutional command that no state may “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws” mean that a state university cannot give a preference in admissions to African American students in order to diversify its student body?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第三，宪法比其他法律领域更明显地提出了根本的政治问题和价值选择。本书的主题之一是，每一项法律和每一项法律判决都蕴含着重要的价值观；例如，侵权法迫使我们做出重要的选择，即人们必须在多大程度上考虑他人的利益。但在宪法中，价值问题更加显而易见，因此也更具争议性。如果所有法律在某种程度上都具有政治性，那么宪法比其他法律更明确地体现了政治性。在解释和适用宪法时，很少有简单或不具争议性的问题。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Third, constitutional law, more obviously than other areas of law, raises fundamental political issues and value choices. One of the themes of this book is that every body of law and every legal decision implicates important values; tort law, for example, forces us to make important choices about to what extent people must take account of the interests of other people. But in constitutional law, the value questions are more readily apparent and therefore are more controversial. If all law is politics to some extent, constitutional law is more explicitly political than other bodies of law. There are very few simple or noncontroversial issues in interpreting and applying the Constitution.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第四，在其他法律领域，制定和适用法律的过程似乎是显而易见且恰当的。立法机关和法院制定法律原则，法院将这些原则应用于个案裁定。在宪法领域，决策过程同样清晰，但其是否恰当则备受争议。在其他法律领域，法院的权力被视为理所当然，即使其裁决结果的正确性可能并非如此。相比之下，在宪法领域，核心问题是法官为何有权成为宪法的最终裁决者，以及他们在解释和适用宪法时应该运用哪些宪法解释理论。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Fourth, in other areas of law the processes of making and applying law seem obvious and appropriate. Legislatures and courts formulate principles of law, and courts apply those principles in deciding individual cases. In constitutional law the decision process also is clear, but whether it is appropriate is much more contested. In other areas of law the power of the courts is taken for granted, even if the correctness of the results they reach may not be. In constitutional law, by contrast, the central issues are why judges have the power to be the final arbiters of constitutional law and what theories of constitutional interpretation they should use in interpreting and applying the Constitution.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>当宪法文本需要解释时，法院会进行解释，尤其是在联邦层面。如有必要，案件会被提交至最高法院，由美国最高法院的九名大法官审理。但最高法院大法官是任命的，而非选举产生的，而且一旦任命，他们就终身任职，无需再次接受审查。如果宪法涉及根本的政治问题，为什么这些问题可以由这样一个不民主的机构为民主社会做出决定？此外，像国会这样政治色彩更浓厚的政府机构，通过咨询选民、接受利益集团的游说、关注民意调查以及公开辩论赞成和反对的立场来解决政治问题。<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_12" class="calibre4"></a>缺点：最高法院显然与政治进程隔绝，它如何裁决热点政治问题？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When the constitutional text requires interpreting, the courts do so, especially at the federal level. If necessary, cases are taken to the top, to be heard by the nine justices of the U.S. Supreme Court. But the Supreme Court justices are appointed, not elected, and once appointed they serve for life, without ever being subject to review again. If constitutional law involves fundamental political issues, why can those issues be decided for a democratic society by such an undemocratic institution? Moreover, the more overtly political institutions of government such as Congress resolve political issues by consulting constituents, being lobbied by interest groups, looking at opinion polls, and openly debating the pros and <a class="calibre4"></a>cons. How does the Supreme Court decide hot political issues when it apparently is insulated from the political process?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>宪法的这四个显著特征催生了本章讨论的主题。最基本的问题涉及联邦政府的结构和权力。宪法的批准创建了国家政府，并规定了其组织和权力。宪法首先明确了联邦政府如何组织成三个分支——行政、立法和司法——以及每个分支以及整个联邦政府的职权范围。至少在概念上，联邦政府既拥有有限权力，又拥有最高权力——权力仅限于宪法赋予的权力，但在其管辖范围内拥有最高权力。因此，界定国家政府的权力也界定了联邦主义的原则，即国家政府与各州之间的关系。（国家政府和州政府的权力也受到宪法对个人自由保障的限制，尤其是在《权利法案》和内战后修正案中，这些内容将在<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.n0112" href="#text/part0009_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-3" class="calibre4">第三章</a>讨论。）贯穿所有这些特定主题的都是宪法解释的问题。联邦法院，尤其是最高法院，是宪法的权威解释者。他们如何确定宪法文本在具体案件中的适用含义？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These four distinctive features of constitutional law generate the subject matter discussed in this chapter. The most basic issues concern the structure and authority of the federal government. The ratification of the Constitution created the national government and dictated its organization and powers. Constitutional law first specifies how the federal government is organized into three branches—executive, legislative, and judicial—and what each branch, and the federal government as a whole, can do. In concept, at least, the federal government is a government of both limited and supreme powers—limited to those powers granted it by the Constitution but supreme within its sphere. Accordingly, defining the powers of the national government also defines the principles of federalism, or the relationship between the national government and the states. (The powers of both national and state governments also are limited by the constitutional guarantees of individual liberty, especially in the Bill of Rights and the post–Civil War amendments, which are discussed in <a href="#text/part0009_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-3" class="calibre4">Chapter 3</a>.) Running through all of these particular topics is the issue of constitutional interpretation. The federal courts, especially the Supreme Court, are the authoritative interpreters of the Constitution. How do they determine what the constitutional text means when applied in a particular case?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>当我们想到宪法时，我们通常会想到美国宪法，但每个州都有自己的宪法，因此也有自己的宪法体系。州宪法在许多方面与联邦宪法相似，因为它们确立了立法、行政和司法部门的结构，并包含权利法案。但州宪法与联邦法律在一些重要方面存在差异。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We usually think of the U.S. Constitution when we think of constitutional law, but each state has its own constitution and therefore its own body of constitutional law, too. The state constitutions are in many respects like the federal Constitution, as they establish the structure of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches and include bills of rights. But state constitutional law differs from federal law in important ways.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>大多数州宪法都比联邦宪法篇幅更长、更详细。例如，阿拉巴马州宪法长达600多页，大约是本书的两倍。1947年新泽西州宪法是一部现代改革宪法，其篇幅仍然是美国宪法的三倍左右。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Most state constitutions are much longer and more detailed than the federal Constitution. The Alabama constitution, for example, is more than 600 pages long—about twice as long as this book. The New Jersey constitution of 1947, a modern, reform constitution, is still about three times the length of the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>州宪法篇幅较长有几个因素。国家政府是权力列举型政府，仅拥有宪法赋予的权力，且通常措辞含糊。另一方面，各州天生拥有普遍的治理权，因此州宪法限制而非授予权力，而且这些限制通常表述得非常具体。州宪法也经常包含一些并非特别“合宪”的条款，即关于权利或政府组织基本问题的指令。其中一些条款涉及特定主题<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_13" class="calibre4"></a>州关注的宪法问题；爱达荷州的宪法规定了水权和牲畜，新墨西哥州则规定了双语教育。其他一些仅仅是一些人认为应该写入宪法的细节问题；加利福尼亚州宪法包含了发布法院意见的指导方针。最后，国家宪法只能通过繁琐的程序才能修改，自1791年《权利法案》通过以来仅修改过17次。州宪法修正案通常可以由立法机关、宪法委员会或公民请愿书提出，并通过全民公决通过。因此，州宪法经常被修改；例如，马萨诸塞州宪法已被修改过一百多次。事实上，州宪法甚至经常被完全替换；现行的佐治亚州宪法是其第十部宪法。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Several factors contribute to the length of state constitutions. The national government is a government of enumerated powers, possessing only the authority granted to it under the Constitution, typically in vague language. The states, on the other hand, inherently have general authority to govern, so state constitutions limit rather than grant power, and the limitations often are stated very specifically. State constitutions also often contain provisions that are not particularly “constitutional,” in the sense of being directives about fundamental issues of rights or government organization. Some of these provisions address topics of particular <a class="calibre4"></a>concern to a state; Idaho has constitutional provisions on water rights and livestock, and New Mexico on bilingual education. Others are simply matters of detail that someone thought belonged in the constitution; the California constitution contains guidelines for the publication of court opinions. Finally, the national Constitution can be amended only through a cumbersome process and has been amended only seventeen times since the adoption of the Bill of Rights in 1791. State constitutional amendments generally can be proposed by the legislature, a constitutional commission, or citizens’ petition and can be adopted by referendum. As a result, state constitutions are often amended; the Massachusetts constitution, for example, has been amended over a hundred times. Indeed, state constitutions can and frequently are even replaced altogether; the current Georgia constitution is its tenth.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>州宪法中的权利法案也比联邦权利法案更加详细，在某些方面也更为重要。州权利法案通常先于联邦宪法附加到宪法正文，而不是像联邦宪法那样附加到宪法正文。这一传统可以追溯到最早的州宪法，其中包括一些著名的文件，例如《弗吉尼亚权利宣言》，该宣言是美国宪法中权利法案的样板。这些早期文件包括保障人民权利的条款，也包括对政府原则的劝诫性声明，例如《宾夕法尼亚权利宣言》建议立法机关由“以智慧和美德而闻名的人”组成。如今，州权利法案看起来更像联邦权利法案，但在两个重要方面对其进行了补充。它们通常包含与联邦权利法案类似的保护措施，但更加详细。例如，路易斯安那州宪法禁止“残酷或不寻常的惩罚”，这一限制类似于第八修正案禁止“残酷和不寻常的惩罚”，但它也禁止“过度”惩罚，路易斯安那州最高法院将这一要求解释为刑事处罚必须与罪行成比例。此外，该州宪法还表达了许多联邦宪法未保障的权利；11部宪法明确规定了隐私权，最高法院认为隐私权已隐含在《权利法案》中（如<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.n0113" href="#text/part0009_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-3" class="calibre4">第三章</a>所述），39个州保障遭受法律伤害的人获得法律救济的权利。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The bills of rights in state constitutions also are more detailed and are in some ways more important than the federal Bill of Rights. Instead of being added on to the main body of the constitution as in the federal Constitution, state bills of rights typically come first. This tradition dates from the earliest state constitutions that contained such well-known documents as the Virginia Declaration of Rights, a model for the Bill of Rights in the U.S. Constitution. These early documents included provisions guaranteeing the rights of the people and also hortatory statements of government principle, such as the recommendation in the Pennsylvania Declaration of Rights that the legislature consist of “persons most noted for wisdom and virtue.” Today state bills of rights look more like the federal Bill of Rights but add to it in two important ways. They often contain protections that are similar to those in the federal Bill of Rights but are more detailed. The Louisiana constitution, for example, prohibits “cruel or unusual punishment,” a restriction analogous to the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of “cruel and unusual punishment,” but it also bars “excessive” punishment, a requirement that the Louisiana Supreme Court has interpreted to mean that criminal penalties must be proportionate to the offense. And they express many rights not guaranteed by the federal Constitution; eleven constitutions expressly state a right of privacy, which the Supreme Court has found implicit in the Bill of Rights (as described in <a href="#text/part0009_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-3" class="calibre4">Chapter 3</a>), and thirty-nine states guarantee access to a legal remedy for persons who suffer a legal injury.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>州宪法中的权利声明比美国宪法赋予的权利更为广泛，这导致了威廉·布伦南大法官所称的“新司法联邦主义”。长期以来，律师和广大公众主要依靠联邦法院来保护个人权利。然而，自20世纪70年代以来，人们对州宪法的兴趣日益浓厚，将其视为一种<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_14" class="calibre4"></a>独立的权利定义和潜在扩展来源。自那时起，州法院一直积极地将州宪法应用于与联邦法院所处理的情况类似和不同的情况。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The statement of rights in state constitutions that are broader than those granted under the U.S. Constitution has led to what Justice William Brennan labeled “the new judicial federalism.” For a long time lawyers and the public at large looked mostly to the federal courts for the protection of individual rights. Since the 1970s, however, there has been a surge of interest in attention to state constitutional law as an <a class="calibre4"></a>independent source for the definition and potential expansion of rights. Since then state courts have been actively engaged in applying state constitutions to situations both like and unlike those addressed by the federal courts.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>例如，在 1988 年的一个案件中，美国最高法院裁定，人们对于被丢弃等待收集的垃圾袋没有合理的隐私期望，因此警察搜查垃圾袋寻找犯罪证据并不违反第四修正案（<em class="calibre8">加州诉格林伍德案</em>）。此后不久，新泽西州最高法院在<em class="calibre8">州诉亨佩尔案</em>（1990 年）中也面临同样的问题。新泽西州宪法和第四修正案一样，禁止“无理搜查和扣押”，但新泽西州法院认为，人们对于垃圾袋中的隐私确实有合理的期望。“人们最私密的特征和事情的线索可以在他们的垃圾中找到，”罗伯特·克利福德大法官写道。“就像翻找办公桌抽屉或拦截电话一样，翻找垃圾可能会泄露目标的财务和职业状况、政治立场和倾向、私人想法、个人关系和恋爱兴趣。”他承认最高法院做出了相反的裁决，但却用相当夸张的语言指出了州法院的独立责任。“尽管最高法院可能是指引我们遵循新泽西州宪法的北极星，但我们对这艘船的安全航行负有最终责任。我们的目光不能过于盯着那颗星星，以至于将乘客的福祉置于宪法学说的浅滩上。在解释新泽西州宪法时，我们既要放眼未来，也要放眼高处。”两位大法官持不同意见，部分原因是他们认为“联邦主义的价值观”要求法院服从最高法院的裁决。偏离联邦的解释会让公众感到困惑——地方警察不能搜查垃圾，但联邦调查局特工可以——并且会损害最高法院作为“我们自由的守护者”的道德权威。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In a 1988 case, for example, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy in garbage bags left out for collection, so it did not constitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment when the police searched the garbage for evidence of a crime (<em class="calibre8">California v. Greenwood</em>). The same issue came to the New Jersey Supreme Court shortly thereafter in <em class="calibre8">State v. Hempele</em> (1990). The New Jersey constitution contained the same proscription against “unreasonable searches and seizures” as the Fourth Amendment, but the New Jersey court believed that a person does have a reasonable expectation of privacy in trash. “Clues to people’s most private traits and affairs can be found in their garbage,” wrote Justice Robert Clifford. “Like rifling through desk drawers or intercepting phone calls, rummaging through trash can divulge the target’s financial and professional status, political affiliations and inclinations, private thoughts, personal relationships, and romantic interests.” He recognized the Supreme Court’s contrary decision but in rather grandiose language pointed out the independent responsibility of state courts. “[A]‌lthough that Court may be a polestar that guides us as we navigate the New Jersey Constitution, we bear ultimate responsibility for the safe passage of our ship. Our eyes must not be so fixed on that star that we risk the welfare of our passengers on the shoals of constitutional doctrine. In interpreting the New Jersey Constitution, we must look in front of us as well as above us.” Two justices dissented in part because they believed “the values of federalism” required the court to defer to the Supreme Court’s decision. Diverging from the federal interpretation would be confusing to the public—local police could not search garbage but FBI agents could—and would undermine the moral authority of the Supreme Court as the “guardian of our liberties.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>免受不合理搜查和扣押是联邦和州宪法的共同权利，尽管联邦和州法院对该权利的解释可能有所不同。然而，州宪法包含的权利来源比联邦宪法更广泛。州法院曾运用这些权利，例如，推翻人身伤害案件中的损害赔偿上限，认为其侵犯了诉诸法庭的权利；要求发展中城市提供低收入和中等收入住房；以及迫使州政府为贫困城市学区提供专项资金等等。<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_15" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Protection against unreasonable search and seizure is a right common to federal and state constitutions, though federal and state courts may interpret the right differently. State constitutions contain broader sources of rights than the federal Constitution, however. State courts have applied these rights to strike down damage caps in personal injury cases as a violation of the right of access to the courts, to require developing municipalities to provide low- and moderate-income housing, and to compel the state to provide special funding for poor urban school districts, among other things.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>此类案件中最具争议的是关于同性婚姻是否属于州宪法权利的问题。1999 年，佛蒙特州最高法院裁定，根据佛蒙特州宪法的共同利益条款，同性伴侣不能被剥夺婚姻的合法权益（<em class="calibre8">贝克诉州</em>）。法院指示立法机关纠正违宪行为，立法机关重申婚姻是一男一女之间的结合，但创造了具有同等法律地位的民事结合。随后，马萨诸塞州最高司法法院在<em class="calibre8">古德里奇诉公共卫生部</em>（2003 年）案中裁定，禁止同性婚姻违反了州宪法的正当程序和平等保护条款。婚姻赋予人们巨大的法律利益，从联合申报所得税和继承权等经济利益到非经济优势，包括子女亲子关系推定和不在法庭上作不利于配偶的证词。它还赋予了非法律方面的好处：“民事婚姻既是对另一个人的深刻个人承诺，也是对互惠、陪伴、亲密、忠诚和家庭理想的公开庆祝……是否结婚以及与谁结婚的决定是人生中自我定义的重大行为之一。”因此，除非有正当理由，否则国家不得将婚姻限制在异性恋夫妇范围内。该州辩称，其理由是提供“有利的生育环境”，确保在双亲家庭中为养育子女提供最佳环境，并保护财务资源，因为同性伴侣在经济上更独立，因此不太需要婚姻带来的经济利益，例如联合报税。法院驳回了该州的每一个论点，并得出结论，此后的婚姻将是“两个人作为配偶的自愿结合，排除所有其他人”，而不考虑配偶的性别；与佛蒙特州不同，采用民事结合法来替代婚姻并不符合宪法。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The most controversial cases of this kind address the question of whether there is a state constitutional right to same-sex marriage. In 1999 the Vermont Supreme Court held that under the Common Benefits Clause of the Vermont constitution, same-sex couples could not be denied the legal benefits of marriage (<em class="calibre8">Baker v. State</em>). The court directed the legislature to remedy the unconstitutionality, which it did by reaffirming marriage was between a man and a woman but creating civil unions with equivalent legal status. Then the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in <em class="calibre8">Goodridge v. Department of Public Health</em> (2003) held that the ban on same-sex marriage violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the state constitution. Marriage confers enormous legal benefits, from financial benefits such as joint income tax filing and inheritance rights to nonfinancial advantages including the presumption of parentage of children and the privilege not to testify against a spouse in court. It confers nonlegal benefits, too: “Civil marriage is at once a deeply personal commitment to another human being and a highly public celebration of the ideals of mutuality, companionship, intimacy, fidelity, and family....[T]‌he decision whether and whom to marry is among life’s momentous acts of self-definition.” Therefore, the state may not restrict marriage to heterosexual couples unless it has legitimate reasons to do so. The state argued that its reasons were providing a “favorable setting for procreation,” ensuring the optimal setting for childrearing in a two-parent family with one parent of each sex, and protecting financial resources because same-sex couples are more financially independent and so less in need of the financial benefits of marriage such as filing joint tax returns. The court rejected each of the state’s arguments and concluded that marriage thereafter would be “the voluntary union of two persons as spouses, to the exclusion of all others,” without regard to the gender of the spouses; unlike in Vermont, the adoption of a civil union statute as an alternative to marriage would not satisfy the constitution.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">古德里奇法案</em>引发的反响十分强烈。在马萨诸塞州，结婚证发放的第一天，就有一千多对同性恋伴侣申请。在全国范围内，要求颁布联邦宪法修正案，将婚姻定义为男女之间的结合的运动势头强劲，并成为全国性运动的主要议题。但是，与佛蒙特州和马萨诸塞州的情况一样，州宪法才是辩论的主要载体。康涅狄格州、爱荷华州和加利福尼亚州的最高法院援引州宪法，推翻了将婚姻限制在异性伴侣之间的规定，许多州也通过了禁止同性婚姻的宪法修正案。<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_16" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The reaction to <em class="calibre8">Goodridge</em> was dramatic. In Massachusetts, more than a thousand gay and lesbian couples applied for marriage licenses on the first day they were available. At the national level, the movement to enact a federal Constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman gained momentum, and the subject became a major issue in national campaigns. But, as in Vermont and Massachusetts, state constitutional law was a primary vehicle for the debate. The Connecticut, Iowa, and California supreme courts applied their state constitutions to invalidate limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples, and constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage were adopted in many states.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0008_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-2-div1-3"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0004" class="calibre1">为什么我们需要宪法？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0004" class="calibre1">Why Do We Need Constitutional Law?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">这似乎是一个奇怪的问题。我们已经如此习惯于宪法，以至于我们需要它的原因显而易见：为了组织政府和保护公民自由。无论我们是否需要它，我们都有它；宪法就在那里，它是我们政治体系的基石。</p><p class="noindent">This seems like an odd question. We have become so used to constitutional law that it is obvious why we need it: to organize the government and to protect civil liberties. And whether or not we need it, we have it; the Constitution is there, and it is the foundational document of our political system.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，法律中没有任何内容是不可避免或必要的。其他国家即使没有我们这种形式的宪政，也能拥有民主的政治制度和丰富的公民自由。例如，英国既没有成文宪法，也没有对立法进行司法审查。当我们思考是否需要宪法时，真正的问题是，我们这种宪法能为我们做些什么。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Nothing in the law is inevitable or necessary, though. Other nations manage to have a democratic political system and abundant civil liberties without our form of constitutionalism. Great Britain, for example, has neither a written constitution nor judicial review of legislation. When we think about whether we need constitutional law, the real question is what our brand of constitutional law does for us.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>为了共同完成我们个人无法完成的事情，我们组建或支持一个政府来代表我们采取行动。政府促进集体行动，例如，使我们能够集中资源建造学校、聘请教师，并建立一个面向所有人的公共教育体系。政府还提供安全保障，保护我们免受犯罪分子、不法商人、危险毒品制造商和外国恐怖分子的侵害。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To accomplish together the things we cannot accomplish individually, we constitute or support a government to act on our behalf. Government facilitates collective action, enabling us to pool our resources to build schools, hire teachers, and make a system of public education available to everyone, for example. Government also provides security, protecting us from criminals, unscrupulous merchants, manufacturers of dangerous drugs, and foreign terrorists.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>要做到这一切，政府必须强大。它需要强大的权力来征税，以支付学校的费用，监管制药公司，罚款不法商人，监禁强盗，并维持陆军和海军。如此强大的政府本身就存在问题。我们如何确保政府不会过度征税，不会对小企业施加不合理的繁重监管，不会监禁不该监禁的人，也不会动用军队镇压异见？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Government, to do all these things, must be strong. It needs the power to tax us to pay for the schools, to regulate drug companies, to fine crooked merchants, to put muggers in jail, and to maintain an army and navy. Such a powerful government presents a problem in itself. How do we make sure that the government won’t tax us beyond our means, impose unreasonably burdensome regulations on small businesses, imprison the wrong people, or use the army to repress dissent?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>我们制约政府权力的一种方式是使其成为民主政府。民主政府由人民控制，因此政府不能做人民不愿做的事情或侵犯人民权利的事情。但即使民主有效，人民真正控制着政府（在现代美国，有些人可能会质疑这一点），也存在一个潜在的问题。宪法的一个基本要素是保护少数群体和个人的权利免受多数群体的攻击。宪法不仅保护民主进程的完整性，也保护少数群体、抗议者、异见人士以及民主进程中的异见人士。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One way we check the power of government is to make it a democratic government. The people control a democratic government, so the government cannot do something the people don’t want or that infringes on their rights. But even if democracy is effective and the people have real control over the government (which some may question in modern America), there is a potential problem. An essential element of constitutional law is protecting the rights of minorities and individuals against attack by the majority. Constitutional law not only protects the integrity of the democratic process, but it protects minorities, protesters, dissidents, and eccentrics from the democratic process.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>宪法致力于解决赋权与限制政府之间的冲突。它涉及诸多问题，例如：政府是如何组织的？政府拥有多少权力？行使权力需要遵循哪些程序？人民生活的哪些方面不受政府干涉？<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_17" class="calibre4"></a>宪法并不是唯一考虑这些问题的，它也从未最终解决这些问题，但它提供了一个与这些问题斗争的过程。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Constitutional law grapples with this conflict between empowering and limiting government. It deals with questions such as: How is the government organized? How much authority does it have? What processes does it have to follow in exercising that authority? What areas of people’s lives are free from intrusion by the government? <a class="calibre4"></a>Constitutional law is not alone in considering these issues, and it never resolves them finally, but it provides a process for struggling with them.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>但它是如何做到这一点的呢？将宪法视为一个过程或许会有所帮助。宪法为重要议题的辩论提供了一种语言和平台。宪法的语言始于宪法文本，并扩展至解释宪法的先例以及可以从中汲取的原则。重要的社会和政治问题通常都以这种语言来表述：权力分立、联邦制、言论自由、正当程序。律师们倾向于认为这是一种只有专业人士才会使用的特殊法律语言，但事实上，宪法辩论不仅由法院和律师进行，其他政府官员、利益集团以及广大公众也参与其中。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But how does it do this? It may be helpful to think of constitutional law as a process. Constitutional law provides a language and a forum for the debate of important issues. The language of constitutional law begins with the text of the Constitution and expands to the precedents that interpret it and the principles that can be drawn from it. Important social and political issues are habitually framed in this language: separation of powers, federalism, free speech, due process. Lawyers would like to think that this is a peculiarly legal language spoken only by professionals, but in fact constitutional debate is carried on not only by courts and lawyers but also by other government officials, interest groups, and the public at large.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>宪法辩论在很多地方都以这种语言进行，但我们的宪法传统已将法院——尤其是美国最高法院——指定为能够权威地解决辩论的场所。最高法院并非非政治性的，但由于其法官的职能有限且终身任职，它与其他政府部门相比，与直接政治影响的距离更大。最高法院并非永久解决所有问题，但提交给它的辩论及其在宪法案件中的裁决，在构建重大争议的分析和解决方面发挥着重要作用。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Constitutional debate goes on in this language in many places, but our constitutional tradition has designated the courts—especially the U.S. Supreme Court—as the forum that can resolve the debate authoritatively. The Court is hardly nonpolitical, but it operates at a greater distance from immediate political influence than other branches of government because its judges have a limited function and they serve for life. The Court does not settle all matters for all time, but the arguments made before it and its decisions in constitutional cases play a significant role in structuring the analysis and resolution of major controversies.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>以美国宪法在种族问题上遭遇的一些亮点和暗淡之处为例。在导致内战的奴隶制激烈争议中，一位名叫德雷德·斯科特的奴隶向联邦法院提起诉讼，声称他在返回密苏里州主人家中之前，曾与主人一起居住在伊利诺伊州和威斯康星领地，因此获得了自由。伊利诺伊州是一个自由州，而根据1820年的《密苏里妥协案》，北纬36°30'以北的路易斯安那领地禁止奴隶制；斯科特辩称，一旦他踏足一个他享有合法自由的州和领地，当他返回奴隶州密苏里州时，就不能再被奴役。奴隶制是一个对国家极其重要的问题，具有巨大的政治、道德和经济意义，但在<em class="calibre8">斯科特诉桑福德案</em>（最高法院对德雷德·斯科特的案件进行审理，通常也被称为<em class="calibre8">德雷德·斯科特案</em>）中，这个问题是用宪法术语来表述的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Take as an example some highlights and lowlights of the Constitution’s encounter with the race problem in America. In the heated controversy over slavery that led up to the Civil War, a slave named Dred Scott brought an action in federal court alleging that he had become free as a result of residing with his master in Illinois and the Wisconsin Territory prior to their return to the master’s home in Missouri. Illinois was a free state, and slavery was prohibited in the Louisiana Territory north of latitude 36°30’ by the Missouri Compromise of 1820; Scott argued that once he set foot in a state and territory where he was legally free, he could not be kept in slavery when he returned to Missouri, a slave state. Slavery was an issue of overwhelming importance for the nation with immense political, moral, and economic dimensions, but in <em class="calibre8">Scott v. Sandford</em> (as Dred Scott’s case was styled in the Supreme Court, also commonly known as <em class="calibre8">The Dred Scott Case</em>), the issue was framed in constitutional terms.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>1857 年，首席大法官罗杰·坦尼 (Roger Taney) 在一份意见书中指出，法院认为，像斯科特这样的黑人不是宪法第三条和第四条所定义的“公民”，因此他不能提起<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_18" class="calibre4"></a>联邦法院的诉讼；更引人注目的是，法院裁定密苏里妥协案违宪。在坦尼看来，在制定宪法时，黑人“被视为从属的、低劣的生物阶级”，不属于《独立宣言》“人人生而平等”的范畴，因此不属于可以作为公民在联邦法院起诉的人。尽管国会精心制定了密苏里妥协案，作为平衡南北利益的一系列政治判决之一，但它这样做已经超越了宪法赋予的权力。一旦一个领地的定居者组织了自己的政府，国会就不能再为该领地立法。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In an 1857 opinion by Chief Justice Roger Taney, the Court held that blacks such as Scott were not “citizens” within the meaning of Articles III and IV of the Constitution, and he therefore could not bring <a class="calibre4"></a>a lawsuit in federal court; even more remarkably, the court determined that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional. In Taney’s view, at the time of the framing of the Constitution blacks were “considered as a subordinate and inferior class of beings” not included within the Declaration of Independence’s claim that “all men are created equal” and thus not within the class of persons who, as citizens, could sue in federal court. And even though Congress had carefully crafted the Missouri Compromise as one in a series of political judgments that balanced the interests of North and South, it had exceeded its constitutional authority in doing so. Once the settlers of a territory organized their own government, Congress could no longer legislate for the territory.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">德雷德·斯科特</em>案体现了宪法的性质和局限性。自美国建国以来，奴隶制一直是一个高度敏感的议题，体现在宪法本身的妥协性条款中，也是国会、法院和整个国家争论的主题。与<em class="calibre8">德雷德·斯科特案</em>一样，这场辩论涉及实质性的宪法问题，不仅运用宪法语言，还运用道德、政治和经济术语。国会有何权力立法决定领地和新加入州的奴隶或自由地位？一个州在禁止奴隶制或有效阻止奴隶主和奴隶穿越其边境方面能走多远？黑人是否是可以在联邦法院起诉的宪法共同体成员？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The <em class="calibre8">Dred Scott</em> case illustrates the nature and limits of constitutional law. Slavery had been a highly charged issue since the founding of the nation, embodied in compromise provisions in the Constitution itself and the subject of debate in the Congress, the courts, and the country at large. As in <em class="calibre8">Dred Scott</em>, the debate dealt with substantive constitutional issues and was carried on in constitutional language as well as in moral, political, and economic terms. What was Congress’s authority to legislate concerning the slave or free status of territories and newly admitted states? How far could a state go in prohibiting slavery or in effectively preventing the travel of masters and slaves through its borders? Were blacks members of the constitutional community who could sue in federal court?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>关于宪法的争论也延伸到了法庭之外。1858年参议院竞选期间，亚伯拉罕·林肯和斯蒂芬·道格拉斯在著名的辩论中就<em class="calibre8">德雷德·斯科特案</em>和宪法权威的性质展开了激烈的争论。道格拉斯肯定了最高法院裁决的最终性：“一旦做出裁决，我的个人意见、你的意见以及所有其他意见都必须服从于这一权威裁决的权威性。” 林肯则认为，其他政府部门可以对宪法提出自己的解读：“如果我在国会，尽管德雷德·<em class="calibre8">斯科特</em>案已经作出裁决，但仍需要就是否应在新领土禁止奴隶制进行投票，我会投票赞成。”</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The debate in constitutional terms spilled outside the courtroom as well. Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas clashed over <em class="calibre8">Dred Scott</em> and the nature of constitutional authority in their famous debates during the Senate campaign of 1858. Douglas affirmed the finality of the Court’s decision: “[W]‌hen the decision is made, my private opinion, your opinion, all other opinions must yield to the majesty of that authoritative adjudication.” Lincoln argued that the other branches of government could offer their own interpretation of the Constitution: “If I were in Congress, and a vote should come up on a question whether slavery should be prohibited in a new territory, in spite of that <em class="calibre8">Dred Scott</em> decision, I would vote that it should.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">这场争议触及了美国宪政的核心问题——最高法院是否拥有宪法解释的最终权威。早在德雷德·斯科特案</em>之前半个世纪，最高法院就宣称自己拥有宪法解释的最终决定权，而政治体制也默许了这一说法。然而，政治界对<em class="calibre8">德雷德·</em>斯科特案的反应暴露了最高法院职能的局限性。首席大法官坦尼显然希望<em class="calibre8">德雷德·斯科特案的</em>判决能够解决<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_19" class="calibre4"></a>彻底结束了全国性的奴隶制争议。然而，政治部门在密苏里妥协案和1850年妥协案中未能做到的事情，司法部门也未能通过其裁决实现。<em class="calibre8">德雷德·斯科特案</em>非但没有带来解决方案，反而激起了不久后将导致战争的激情。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This dispute went to a central element of American constitutionalism—whether the Supreme Court is the final authority on constitutional interpretation. A half-century before <em class="calibre8">Dred Scott</em> the Supreme Court had proclaimed itself the last word on constitutional interpretation, and the political system had acquiesced. However, the political reaction to <em class="calibre8">Dred Scott</em> demonstrated the limits of the Court’s role. Chief Justice Taney apparently hoped that the <em class="calibre8">Dred Scott</em> decision would resolve <a class="calibre4"></a>the national controversy over slavery once and for all. But what the political branches could not do in the Missouri Compromise and the Compromise of 1850 the judicial branch could not accomplish through its decision. Instead of bringing resolution, <em class="calibre8">Dred Scott</em> only inflamed the passions that shortly would lead to war.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>尽管最高法院未能通过宪法裁决解决奴隶制问题，但种族问题在内战后仍被视为一个宪法问题。新的宪法条款——第十三、第十四和第十五修正案——被认为是终结奴隶制、防止种族歧视和确保黑人政治参与的手段。第十四修正案尤为重要，它借鉴了原宪法和权利法案中的概念，保障新获得自由的奴隶的公民身份（推翻了<em class="calibre8">德雷德·斯科特案</em>）、公民的特权和豁免权、正当法律程序以及法律的平等保护。这些重建修正案既赋予政府根除奴隶制残余的权力，也限制了政府歧视或干涉公民生活的能力。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Despite the failure of the Supreme Court to settle the slavery issue through constitutional adjudication, the race problem was still seen as a constitutional issue after the Civil War. New constitutional provisions—the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments—were believed to be the vehicles for ending slavery, preventing racial discrimination, and ensuring political participation by blacks. The Fourteenth Amendment was especially important, drawing on concepts in the original Constitution and the Bill of Rights to guarantee newly freed slaves citizenship (overruling <em class="calibre8">Dred Scott</em>), the privileges and immunities of citizens, due process of law, and equal protection of the laws. These Reconstruction Amendments both empowered government to eradicate the vestiges of slavery and limited government’s ability to discriminate or interfere with the lives of its citizens.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在接下来的一个半世纪里，对这些条款的解释无论在原则上还是在结果上都并不一致。例如，在两个著名的案例中，法院首先允许火车车厢内实行种族隔离（<em class="calibre8">普莱西诉弗格森案</em>，1896 年），随后又禁止学校内的种族隔离（<em class="calibre8">布朗诉教育委员会案</em>，1954 年）。无需重复这个漫长而复杂的故事，请注意，与<em class="calibre8">德雷德·斯科特案</em>一样，在法庭和公共场合，关于种族的辩论都是在这些宪法原则的帮助下进行的。根据第十四修正案定义“法律的平等保护”——确定平等的含义以及政府可以或必须做什么来创造平等或防止或纠正不平等——一直是种族辩论的核心问题。政府可以在公路项目中偏袒少数族裔承包商吗？大学可以优先考虑黑人申请者以增强学生群体的多样性吗？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The interpretation of these provisions over the succeeding century and a half has not been uniform either in principle or in result. In two famous cases, for example, the Court first allowed racial segregation of railroad cars (<em class="calibre8">Plessy v. Ferguson</em>, 1896) and subsequently prohibited racial segregation in schools (<em class="calibre8">Brown v. Board of Education</em>, 1954). Without rehearsing this long and complicated story, note that, as with <em class="calibre8">Dred Scott</em>, in court and in the public arena, the debate about race has been carried on with the aid of these constitutional principles. Defining “equal protection of the laws” under the Fourteenth Amendment—ascertaining what equality means and what government may or must do to create equality or to prevent or remedy inequality—has been a central inquiry in the debate about race. May the government favor minority contractors for highway projects? May a college give preference to black applicants to enhance the diversity of its student body?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>对于此类问题，辩论部分通过宪法话语进行，部分答案则来自法院判决。然而，辩论的范围超出了法庭，也超出了宪法的界限，受到立法机构、选举过程、媒体和公众情绪的影响。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For questions like these, the debate is partially carried on through constitutional discourse, and part of the answer comes through court decisions. The debate spills outside the courtroom, however, and outside the bounds of constitutional law, to be influenced by the legislatures, the electoral process, the media, and public sentiment.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>因此，宪法提供了处理重要问题的词汇和流程。它既不是唯一的词汇，也不是唯一的流程，但两百多年来，它一直是一个重要且为人熟知的词汇，尽管它一直在变化。<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_20" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Constitutional law, therefore, provides a vocabulary and a process for dealing with important issues. It is neither the only vocabulary nor the only process, but it has been an important and familiar one, if ever-changing, for more than two hundred years.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0008_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-2-div1-4"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0005" class="calibre1">最高法院如何决定宪法的含义？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0005" class="calibre1">How Does the Supreme Court Decide What the Constitution Means?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">最高法院在适用宪法时，界定并限制政府的权力。但是什么限制了最高法院呢？假设最高法院宣布，从现在起，它将指示国会在修建公路上投入多少资金，或者假设最高法院宣布要求每个美国人每周日都必须去罗马天主教堂？又是什么阻止最高法院篡夺其他政府部门或各州的合法权力，或通过令人发指的裁决践踏人民的权利呢？</p><p class="noindent">In applying the Constitution, the Supreme Court defines and limits the powers of the government. But what limits the Court? Suppose the Court declared that from now on it would tell Congress how much to spend on building highways, or suppose it announced that every American was required to attend a Roman Catholic Church every Sunday? What prevents the Court from usurping the rightful powers of the other branches of government or of the states, or from trampling on the rights of the people through outrageous decisions?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>正如这些荒谬的假设所暗示的那样，最高法院最终受到政治现实的制约。如果最高法院试图指示国会拨款修建高速公路或强迫人们去教堂，由此引发的骚动将淹没最高法院意见的真谛。由于最高法院无法强制执行其裁决，其宪法权威得到了我们文化中尊重司法权威和法治的传统的支持。这种尊重源于这样一种信念：在适用宪法时，最高法院的法官们并非仅仅在表达他们自己对法律应有的偏好。相反，宪法本身指导着他们的裁决。宪法文本或其解释方式中的某些内容控制或限制了最高法院在特定案件中的行动。正如最高法院所解释的宪法规范了政府其他部门的权力一样，宪法也限制了最高法院本身的权力。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As these absurd hypotheticals suggest, ultimately the Supreme Court is constrained by political realities. If the Court tried to direct Congress to spend money on highways or to force people to go to church, the resulting uproar would drown out the words of the Court’s opinions. Because the Court cannot coerce compliance with its decisions, its constitutional authority is supported by our culture’s tradition of respect for judicial authority and the rule of law. This respect is supported by the belief that in applying the Constitution, the justices of the Supreme Court are not simply expressing their own preferences about what the law ought to be. Rather, the Constitution itself directs their decision. Something in the text or the means of its interpretation controls or limits what the Court can do in a particular case. Just as the Constitution as interpreted by the Court regulates the authority of the rest of the government, the Constitution limits the authority of the Court itself.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>但问题在于，宪法文本简短而模糊，但法院却必须用它来裁决大量案件。例如，第一条第八款第三项授权国会“规范与外国、各州之间以及与印第安部落之间的贸易”。法院如何知道这是否意味着国会可以要求个人购买健康保险？（法院表示，根据贸易条款，国会不能这样做，但可以对未购买保险的人处以税收罚款。）或者考虑堕胎案罗伊诉<em class="calibre8">韦德</em>案。法院是如何得出结论，认为宪法赋予妇女在怀孕前三个月基本上不受约束地选择堕胎的权利，但也允许州在怀孕过程中规范或禁止堕胎？或者想想1954 年的<em class="calibre8">布朗诉教育委员会</em>案，该案下令取消公立学校的种族隔离。今天几乎每个人都同意这个决定是正确的，它是美国社会正义发展的一个里程碑。但是，当通过第十四修正案的国会也授权在哥伦比亚特区设立种族隔离的公立学校时，法院怎么能得出结论说种族隔离的学校受到第十四修正案平等保护条款的禁止呢？<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_21" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The problem, though, is that the constitutional text is short and vague, yet the Court has to use it to decide a huge array of cases. Article I, section 8, clause 3, for example, empowers Congress “To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.” How does the Court know if this means Congress can require individuals to purchase health insurance? (The Court said Congress could not do so under the commerce clause but could establish a tax penalty for failing to buy insurance.) Or consider the abortion case <em class="calibre8">Roe v. Wade</em>. How did the Court conclude that the Constitution gives a woman an essentially unconstrained choice to have an abortion in the first trimester of her pregnancy but that it also allows the state to regulate or prohibit abortion as the pregnancy progresses? Or think about <em class="calibre8">Brown v. Board of Education</em>, the 1954 case that ordered the desegregation of public schools. Today virtually everyone agrees that the decision was correct and a landmark in the development of social justice in America. But how could the Court conclude that segregated schools were prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection clause when the Congress that passed the amendment also authorized segregated public schools in the District of Columbia?<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>宪法中从未提及医疗保险、堕胎、种族隔离或学校。然而，最高法院必须裁决涉及这些以及成千上万个其他问题的案件。宪法解释理论对宪法至关重要，但宪法本身并未提供其自身解释的指南。因此，构建这样的理论一直是法官和学者们关注的重点。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Constitution nowhere mentions health insurance, abortion, segregation, or schools. Yet the Court has to decide cases dealing with these and thousands of other subjects. A theory of constitutional interpretation is crucial to constitutional law, but the Constitution does not provide a guide to its own interpretation. Accordingly, constructing such a theory has been a major concern of judges and scholars.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如果宪法文本本身含义清晰，解读宪法就会很容易。然而，事实并非如此。大多数宪法条款都含糊不清，例如商业条款。国会可以监管“各州之间”的商业活动，这并不能说明强制购买医疗保险是否包含在国会的州际商业权力中。此外，有时我们会发现，文本的含义并非字面意思。第一修正案规定“国会不得制定……剥夺言论自由的法律”，但所有宪法学家都同意，即使宪法中没有明确规定，这项宪法禁令也适用于总统和法院。由于词语本身从来就没有意义，我们需要一种解读它们的方法。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It would be easy to interpret the Constitution if its meaning were clear from the text itself. Unfortunately, that’s not the case. Most constitutional provisions are vague, like the commerce clause. Saying that Congress may regulate commerce “among the several states” just doesn’t tell us whether mandating the purchase of health insurance is included in Congress’s interstate commerce power. Moreover, sometimes we come to understand that the text doesn’t mean what it says anyway. The First Amendment states that “Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech,” but all constitutional lawyers agree that this constitutional prohibition applies to the president and the courts as well, even though this isn’t specifically stated. Because words never have meaning by themselves, we need a way to interpret them.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>关于宪法解释理论的主要争论，主要集中在两派法官和学者之间。一派认为，宪法的解释应仅依据制宪者的意图或宪法通过时人们对其条款的理解，而另一派则主张，我们必须超越这些意图和理解。前者理论认为，宪法具有“不变的性质和含义”，正如大卫·布鲁尔大法官（ 1905年<em class="calibre8">南卡罗来纳州诉美国案</em>）所言，这种理论被称为<em class="calibre8">原旨主义</em>或<em class="calibre8">解释主义</em>；后者被称为<em class="calibre8">非原旨主义，有时也被描述为“</em><em class="calibre8">活宪法”</em>的理念。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The major struggle over theories of constitutional interpretation is between those judges and scholars who believe that the Constitution should be narrowly interpreted only according to the intent of the framers or the understanding of its provisions at the time of adoption and those who assert that we have to look beyond those intentions and understandings. The former theory, that the Constitution has a “changeless nature and meaning,” as Justice David Brewer wrote (<em class="calibre8">South Carolina v. United States</em>, 1905) is known as <em class="calibre8">originalism</em> or <em class="calibre8">interpretivism</em>; the latter is known as <em class="calibre8">nonoriginalism</em> and is sometimes described as the idea of a <em class="calibre8">living Constitution</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>对于原旨主义者来说，坚持对宪法条款的原始理解是宪法结构所要求的，并能防止法官滥用职权。宪法制定者代表人民，将权力授予联邦政府。司法审查权就是其中之一。但政府的任何部门，包括法院，都不能超越被授予的权力范围，因此最高法院在作出裁决时必须始终遵循宪法制定者的意图。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For originalists, adhering to the original understanding of constitutional provisions is mandated by the structure of the Constitution and keeps judges from running amok. The framers of the Constitution, acting on behalf of the people, delegated powers to the federal government. The power of judicial review is one of those powers. But no part of the government, including the courts, may exceed the scope of the powers that have been delegated to it, so the Supreme Court always must abide by the intent of the framers in making its decisions.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>原旨主义者认为，这种对原始理解的坚持不仅仅是基于宪法结构的法律必要性，也是实践上的必要性。原始意图为宪法裁决提供了坚实的基础。正如当代最杰出的原旨主义者斯卡利亚大法官所写：“原旨主义者至少知道他在寻找什么：文本的原始含义。通常——事实上，我敢说<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_22" class="calibre4"></a>通常——这很容易辨别，也很容易应用。”一旦法院超越了这一基础，它必然必须诉诸于制定者确定性的理解之外的其他东西——比如政治、经济或哲学理论，来确定案件的公正结果是什么。但是，有许多这样的理论——自由主义、保守主义和其他理论——大法官除了自己的偏好之外，没有其他选择的基础。这种选择能力引发了激进审判的担忧，大法官们可能仅仅根据自己的个人偏好就推翻国会或各州的决定。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This adherence to the original understanding is more than a legal necessity based on the structure of the Constitution, originalists argue; it is a practical necessity as well. Original intent provides a firm basis for constitutional decisions. As Justice Scalia, the most prominent contemporary originalist, has written, “The originalist at least knows what he is looking for: the original meaning of the text. Often—indeed, I dare say <a class="calibre4"></a>usually—that is easy to discern and simple to apply.” Once the Court goes beyond this basis, it necessarily must resort to something other than the determinate understanding of the framers—something such as a political, economic, or philosophical theory as to what a just result would be in the case. But there are many such theories available—liberal, conservative, and otherwise—and a justice has no basis for choosing among them other than his or her own preferences. This ability to choose raises the specter of activist judging, of the justices superseding the decisions of the Congress or the states simply on the basis of their own personal preferences.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>将原旨主义作为宪法坚实渊源的概念，与文本含义清晰的概念一样具有吸引力，但非原旨主义的法官和学者们指出了这一概念存在的问题。我们最初存在一个问题，即我们能否对原意或理解做出历史性的判断。“制宪者的意图”这一说法表明存在一个可定义的制宪者群体，并且我们可以高度确定地确定他们的意图。但制宪者是谁？最初的宪法是在由来自不同州、持有不同观点的代表组成的制宪会议上起草、谈判和表决的，然后由十三个州的立法机构和制宪会议的成员批准。权利法案在第一届国会起草，然后提交各州批准。后续修正案由后来的国会起草，并由更多州的立法机构批准。我们应该关注谁的意图：有争议条款的起草者、参加大会或国会辩论的其他人，还是批准立法机构的成员？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The concept of originalism as a solid source of constitutional law is as attractive as the idea of a text with plain meaning, but nonoriginalist judges and scholars have identified problems with the concept. There is an initial problem of our ability to render a historical judgment about original intent or understanding. Reference to “the intention of the framers” suggests that there existed a definable group of framers and that we can determine their intentions with a high degree of certainty. But who are the framers? The original Constitution was drafted, negotiated, and voted on in a convention composed of delegates from different states with different points of view and then ratified by the members of thirteen state legislatures and conventions. The Bill of Rights was drafted in the First Congress and then submitted to the states for ratification. Subsequent amendments were drafted by later Congresses and ratified by still more state legislatures. Whose intent are we to focus on: the drafters of the provision at issue, others who participated in the debate at the convention or in the Congress, or members of the ratifying legislatures?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>确定历史意图的困难导致一些原旨主义者将关注点从制宪者的意图转移到宪法条款颁布时人们对其的普遍理解，即斯卡利亚大法官所描述的“一个理性的人从法律文本中得出的意图”。因此，寻求原旨理解的前提是，我们能够理解制宪者的世界，并将这种理解应用于我们自己的世界。但非原旨主义者指出，实现这种理解的难度很大。原旨主义认为历史意图是事实，就像一件等待被发掘的实物。然而，历史学家知道，对过去的理解总是受我们自身观点的影响。我们不可能不经过对现在的理解的过滤就获得对过去的了解；我们怎么能假装不知道过去200年发生的事情呢？此外，我们所拥有的任何历史理解都必须应用于已经发生巨大变化的情况。当《第一修正案》的起草者和批准者想到……的自由时，<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_23" class="calibre4"></a>言论和新闻自由，他们脑子里想的可能只是字面意义上的言论和新闻自由，因为说话和出版是唯一可用的沟通方式。我们如何将这种理解转化为对互联网上唾手可得的色情内容或电视上无处不在的商业广告等的监管？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The difficulties of ascertaining historical intention have led some originalists to shift focus from the intention of the framers to the general understanding of a constitutional provision at the time of its enactment, what Justice Scalia described as “the intent that a reasonable person would gather from the text of the law.” The search for original understanding therefore presumes that we can comprehend the framers’ world and apply that comprehension to our own world. But nonoriginalists point out the difficulty of achieving that comprehension. Originalism presumes that historical intent is a fact, like a physical artifact waiting to be unearthed. Historians know, however, that an understanding of the past is always shaped by our own views. It is impossible to achieve knowledge of the past unfiltered by our understanding of the present; how can we pretend not to know what we do know about what has happened over the past 200 years? Moreover, any historical understanding we do have must be applied to vastly changed circumstances. When the authors and ratifiers of the First Amendment thought of freedom of <a class="calibre4"></a>speech and freedom of press, they could only have in mind some idea of freedom of speech and press—literally—because speaking and publishing were the only forms of communication available. How do we translate that understanding to the regulation of, for example, readily accessible pornography on the Internet or pervasive commercial advertising on television?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在处理如此规模的社会变革时，法院不能简单地确定并适用一种实际上不可能成立的原始理解。相反，法院或许应该更广泛地寻找促成特定宪法条款、一系列规定或整部宪法的原始原则。严格原旨主义的问题可能在于，它过于狭隘地寻找条款背后的意图。一些原旨主义者和非原旨主义者则建议，可以通过发展源自文本的原则来限制法院对宪法的解释。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In dealing with social changes of this magnitude, the Court cannot simply ascertain and apply an original understanding that could not actually have been held. Instead, perhaps the Court should look more broadly for the original principles motivating a particular constitutional term, a set of provisions, or the Constitution as a whole. The problem with a strict originalism may be that it looks too narrowly for the intention behind a provision. Some originalists and nonoriginalists suggest instead that it is possible to constrain the Court’s interpretation of the Constitution through the development of principles that arise from the text.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>以第五修正案和第十四修正案中的正当程序条款为例，这些条款规定，未经正当法律程序，任何人不得被剥夺生命、自由或财产。假设我们能够判断，在法案颁布时，人们对这些条款的含义持有一些特定的看法。我们甚至可以参考《权利法案》的其余部分来推断其内容。自由包括人身自由，政府不得在未经陪审团审判的情况下剥夺任何人的自由。在陪审团审判中，被告有权聘请律师代理、与证人对质等等。但是，如果正当程序条款仅仅重申第四修正案、第五修正案和第六修正案的保护措施，那么它们就显得多余。这些条款可以阐明一项更为普遍的原则，即美国人享有免受政府干预的权利。这种更为普遍的理解中的“自由”是指不受干扰地处理日常生活和个人事务的权利，并且只有在有重要依据的情况下，政府才可以侵犯自由权益。因此，在确定和适用正当程序条款的含义时，最高法院既可以参考其狭义——接受陪审团审判的权利，也可以参考其广义——免受政府干预的权利。当法院面临一些案件时，广义的含义可能尤其有用，因为这些案件的制定者们由于当时的技术或社会条件尚未发展而不会考虑这些案件。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Consider the due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, which state that no person may be denied life, liberty, or property without due process of law. Assume that we can tell that at the time of enactment people held some specific ideas about the meaning of the clauses. Here we can even refer to the rest of the Bill of Rights to suggest the content. Liberty includes physical liberty, and the government may not take someone’s liberty away without a trial by jury in which the defendant is allowed to be represented by counsel, to confront witnesses, and so forth. But the due process clauses would be superfluous if all they did was to restate the protections of the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. The clauses may state a more general principle about the right of Americans to be protected from government interference. “Liberty” in this more general understanding means the right to be left alone to carry on one’s daily life and personal affairs, and that liberty interest may only be invaded by the government when it has an important basis for doing so. Thus in determining and applying the meaning of the due process clause, the Supreme Court can refer both to the narrower meaning—the right to a jury trial—and the broader meaning—the right to be free from government interference. The broader meaning may be particularly useful as the Court faces cases that the framers would not have considered because the technology or social conditions that present them had not yet been developed.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，这种方法本身存在两个问题。首先，诸如“不受干扰的权利”之类的原则，其历史渊源甚至可能比试图确立更狭隘的初衷还要薄弱。当法院试图<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_24" class="calibre4"></a>建立对宪法条款的普遍理解。这就好像法院不仅要问制宪者“你们理解的正当程序条款的含义是什么？”，还要让他们参与对话，探讨“你们的思考背后隐藏着哪些更广泛的概念，包括那些你们可能从未明确表达的概念？”这种质询脱离了历史意图，使法院能够自由地尝试赋予宪法条款自身的含义，而不受原有理解的束缚。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Two problems inhere in this approach, however. First, principles such as the right to be left alone may have even a weaker historical pedigree than attempts to establish a narrower original intent. All the problems of reconstructing a historical intention are magnified when the Court tries <a class="calibre4"></a>to establish a general understanding of a constitutional provision. It is as if the Court were to ask the framers not just “What did you understand the due process clause to mean?” but also to engage them in dialogue about “What broader conceptions, including those you may never have made explicit, lay behind your thinking?” This inquiry is unmoored from historical intention and sets the Court loose to try to attach its own meaning to the constitutional provision without being bounded by original understanding.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>一旦法院开始沿着这条路走下去，第二个问题就显而易见了。对于任何宪法条款，都有可能以不同程度的普遍性表述该条款所固有的原则。具体案件的判决将取决于法院表述控制原则的普遍性程度。困难在于，每一项原则，无论广义还是狭义，都是由法院基于其自身对构成争议条款合理解读的观点而发展出来的。法院的观点受到文本、其历史、其后续解释以及当代政治和社会现实的影响。当然，风险在于宪法解释最初就存在的问题；在形成其观点时，除了法院自身的良好判断以及最终的政治现实之外，没有什么可以制约法院。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Once the Court begins down this path, the second problem becomes apparent. For any constitutional provision, it is possible to state principles at different levels of generality as inhering in the provision. The decision in a particular case will depend on the level of generality at which the Court states the controlling principle. The difficulty is that every principle, whether broad or narrow, is developed by the Court based on its own view of what constitutes a sensible reading of the provision at issue. The Court’s view is informed by the text, its history, its subsequent interpretation, and contemporary political and social realities. The risk, of course, is the problem with which constitutional interpretation began; in formulating its view, nothing checks the Court except its own good judgment and, ultimately, political realities.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>归根结底，在原旨主义与非原旨主义之间，以及在它们众多变体之间做出选择，是基于政治理论的选择：宪法的本质是什么？它为何要求人们服从？法院在解释宪法时扮演着什么角色？这些都是难以解答的问题，历史也无法为我们解答。事实上，宪法史学家认为，宪法制定者本身并非原旨主义者。18世纪后期的律师和政治家并不认为基本法是立法机构（例如制宪会议）的积极制定，立法机构在制定法律时的理解应该指导法律的解释。正如肯尼迪大法官所写，宪法及其修正案的制定者或许有意让宪法有所修改：</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the end, the choice between originalism and nonoriginalism and among their many variations is a choice based on political theory: What is the nature of the Constitution, why does it command obedience, and what is the role of the Court in interpreting it? These are difficult questions to resolve, and history does not answer them for us. Indeed, constitutional historians argue that the framers themselves were not originalists. Lawyers and statesmen in the late eighteenth century did not hold a conception of fundamental law as the positive enactment of a legislative body, such as a constitutional convention, whose understanding in enacting the law should guide its interpretation. And as Justice Kennedy wrote, the authors of the Constitution and its amendments may have intended it to be subject to change:</p>
<p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如果那些起草并批准第五修正案或第十四修正案中正当程序条款的人能够洞悉自由的诸多可能性，他们或许会更加具体。他们并非妄自揣测，自以为拥有这种洞察力。他们深知时代会蒙蔽我们，使我们看不到某些真理，而后世子孙则会发现，曾经被认为必要且恰当的法律，实际上只会带来压迫。随着宪法的延续，每一代人都可以援引其原则，寻求更大的自由。（<em class="calibre8">劳伦斯诉德克萨斯州案</em>，2003年）<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_25" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Had those who drew and ratified the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment known the components of liberty in its manifold possibilities, they might have been more specific. They did not presume to have this insight. They knew times can blind us to certain truths and later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress. As the Constitution endures, persons in every generation can invoke its principles in their own search for greater freedom. (<em class="calibre8">Lawrence v. Texas</em>, 2003) <a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="noindent">这是否意味着宪法解释只能取决于法官们的观点，法官们可以从宪法中解读出自己的政治观点和个人偏好？答案是肯定的，也是否定的。“肯定”的意思是，宪法文本的字面含义、历史证据或客观原则都无法决定法官们的裁决。宪法解释不可避免地涉及最高法院法官在众多选项中进行选择，而且，如同生活中其他领域的选择一样，法官会根据自己对正确答案的理解做出选择。“否定”的意思是，法官并不能完全自由地以任何自己想要的依据做出任何裁决。法官们受到宪法文本在历史上被理解的方式以及政治和法律文化的制约。</p><p class="noindent">Does this leave constitutional interpretation at the point where we simply say that it’s all up to the justices’ points of view and that they can read into the Constitution their own political views and personal preferences? Yes and no. “Yes,” in the sense that no plain meaning of the text, historical evidence, or objective principles determine their decisions. Constitutional interpretation inevitably involves an act of choice by a Supreme Court justice among many alternatives, and, as with choices elsewhere in life, the judge will choose based on his or her sense of what the right answer is. And “no,” in the sense that a justice is not completely free to reach any decision on any basis he or she wants. Justices are constrained by the ways the constitutional text has been understood historically and by the political and legal culture.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这让我们回到这样一个观点，即宪法不仅是一种规则和权利的体系，也是一种语言和过程。宪法的措辞以及法院内外对宪法的理解、解释和争论的方式，为法官在解释和适用宪法时必须使用的语言提供了语言。宪法提供了一种构建问题和表达论点的方式。可以说很多不同的事情而又不违背宪法传统，但是，就像自然语言一样，有些事情不能说，因为没有可用的词语或者因为它们看起来不恰当或不合适。1857年<em class="calibre8">德雷德·斯科特</em>案中的法院可以使用宪法术语和宪法历史来宣布黑人是“从属和劣等的生物阶级”，不能成为美国公民，但今天的法院不能做同样的事情。然而，今天的法院可以裁决支持或反对平权行动，因为无论哪种结果都在公认的宪法话语范围内；即使我们不同意该判决，或者认为它是“错误的”，我们也会承认它至少具有可争论性，而现代的<em class="calibre8">德雷德·斯科特案</em>判决则不然。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This brings us back to the idea that constitutional law is as much a language and a process as a body of rules and rights. The words of the Constitution and the ways it has been understood, interpreted, and argued about inside and outside the courts provide the language the justices must use in interpreting and applying the Constitution. Constitutional law provides a way of framing issues and expressing arguments. It is possible to say many different things and remain within the constitutional tradition, but, as with natural languages, some things cannot be said because the words are unavailable or because they seem improper or inappropriate. The Court in the <em class="calibre8">Dred Scott</em> case in 1857 could use constitutional terms and constitutional history to declare that blacks were a “subordinate and inferior class of beings” who could not be citizens of the United States, but a court today could not do the same thing. A court today could, however, rule in favor of or against affirmative action because either result would be within the scope of accepted constitutional discourse; even if we would not agree with the decision or would find it “wrong,” we would recognize it to be at least arguable in a way that a modern-day <em class="calibre8">Dred Scott</em> decision would not be.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>当宪法解释被认真对待并真诚地推行时，它就成为就重要社会议题进行原则性辩论的典范。它可以在远离直接政治争议的层面上进行，从而更容易考量后果、构建原则并类比其他情况——而这正是法律程序最擅长的。除了说服他人之外，宪法分析还可以成为一种审视自身假设和信念的方式。当然，宪法辩论往往并非在这个层面上进行。相反，它沦为表达先入为主信念的又一个载体。由于宪法可以有多种解释，<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_26" class="calibre4"></a>法官和其他人可以选择最符合他们希望得出的结论的解释，而不需要经过严肃的解释过程。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When it is taken seriously and pursued in good faith, constitutional interpretation becomes a model of principled debate on important social issues. It can be conducted at one level removed from immediate political controversies, making it easier to consider consequences, construct principles, and analogize to other situations—the kinds of things the legal process is best at. In addition to persuading others, constitutional analysis can be a way of examining one’s own assumptions and beliefs. Too often, of course, constitutional debate is not carried on at this level. Instead, it becomes one more vehicle for the expression of preconceived beliefs. Because the Constitution is subject to varying interpretations, <a class="calibre4"></a>justices and others can select the interpretation that best fits the conclusion they wish to reach without engaging in a serious process of interpretation.</p>

<p class="noindent">由于最高法院拥有司法审查权，最高法院如何解释宪法的问题至关重要。在大多数情况下，最高法院对宪法的含义及其在特定案件中的适用拥有最终决定权。（每个法院，无论是联邦法院还是州法院，都有责任和权力就宪法问题作出裁决，但所有这些裁决最终都可能由美国最高法院审查。）我们已经习以为常，司法审查似乎是我们政府架构中自然、不可或缺、甚至必要的组成部分。但请注意，这项权力的覆盖范围之广。总统、国会、州立法机构、州长、州法院、州和联邦行政机构、公职人员以及所有普通公民，在宪法问题上都受九位大法官的管辖。在宪法起草之时，如此广泛的权力在其他任何地方都闻所未闻，即使在今天，这种权力在世界各地的司法体系中也十分罕见。</p><p class="noindent">The issue of how the Supreme Court interprets the Constitution is vitally important because of the Court’s power of judicial review. In most cases, the Court has the final say on what the Constitution means and how it applies in a particular case. (Every court, federal and state, has the responsibility and the authority to render decisions on constitutional issues, but all of those other decisions can ultimately be reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court.) We have become so used to judicial review that it seems a natural, inevitable, and even necessary part of our government structure. But note how sweeping the power is. The president, Congress, state legislatures, governors, state courts, state and federal administrative agencies, public officials, and all ordinary citizens are subject to the commands of the nine justices on questions of constitutional law. At the time of the drafting of the Constitution, a power this broad was unknown anywhere else, and even today it is unusual among judicial systems around the world.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>值得注意的是，司法审查权并非宪法本身赋予最高法院。第三条规定：“合众国的司法权，属于最高法院及国会随时规定和设立的下级法院”，并将该权力扩展至“根据本宪法产生的一切法律和衡平法案件”以及其他类别。这些规定是组织性和司法性的。它们设立了最高法院，但“最高”仅指“最高”，表明了最高法院在等级制度中的地位，而非法院的权威。审理根据宪法产生的案件的权力同样授予了审理某些类型案件的管辖权，但并非授予了在审理这些案件时进行合宪性审查的权力。第六条规定：“本宪法和依据本宪法制定的合众国法律……应为国家最高法律。”这项规定并没有告诉我们宪法优先于其他“美国法律”——换句话说，宪法高于国会法案——也没有告诉我们最高法院，而不是国会、总统或各州，有权最终确定宪法的含义。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Remarkably, the power of judicial review is not given to the Supreme Court in the Constitution itself. Article III states that “The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish,” and it extends that power to “all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution” and to other categories. These provisions are organizational and jurisdictional. They create the Supreme Court, but “supreme” means only “highest,” designating a place in the hierarchy but not the Court’s authority. The power to hear cases arising under the Constitution is likewise a grant of jurisdiction to hear certain kinds of cases but not a grant of authority to exercise constitutional review in hearing them. Article VI states that “This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof...shall be the supreme Law of the Land.” This provision does not tell us either that the Constitution takes precedence over other “laws of the United States”—in other words, that the Constitution is superior to acts of Congress—nor that the Supreme Court, rather than the Congress, the president, or the states, has the authority to conclusively determine what the Constitution means.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>司法审查权是由最高法院在1803年<em class="calibre8">马伯里诉麦迪逊</em>案中的判决确立的。宪法学者们<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_27" class="calibre4"></a>普遍认为，<em class="calibre8">马伯里案</em>是最高法院有史以来判决的最重要的案件，它的故事值得一读。如同我们这个时代许多重要的法律事件一样，这个故事涉及重要人物、党派政治，以及伴随法律而来的小阴谋。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The power of judicial review was established by the Court’s decision in the 1803 case of <em class="calibre8">Marbury v. Madison</em>. Constitutional scholars, by <a class="calibre4"></a>consensus, regard <em class="calibre8">Marbury</em> as the most important case the Court ever has decided, and its story bears retelling. As with so many important legal events in our own time, the story involves important personalities, partisan politics, and a little intrigue to go along with the law.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>乔治·华盛顿总统任期即将结束时，国家政治逐渐被两大阵营所主导：联邦党，该党选举约翰·亚当斯为总统，并从1796年到1800年控制了国会；民主共和党（现民主党的前身），该党在国会中占据多数席位，并于1800年选举托马斯·杰斐逊为总统。当联邦党意识到他们将失去对行政和立法部门的控制时，他们开始巩固其在司法部门的权力。亚当斯总统提名他的国务卿约翰·马歇尔担任首席大法官。联邦党国会还通过立法，增加下级联邦法官的人数，减少最高法院的法官人数（以防止新任共和党人填补空缺），并授权在哥伦比亚特区增设42名新的治安法官。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Toward the end of George Washington’s presidency, national politics came to be dominated by two groups: the Federalist Party, which elected John Adams president and controlled the Congress from 1796 until 1800, and the Democratic Republican Party (predecessor of today’s Democratic Party), which would gain a majority in the Congress and elect Thomas Jefferson in 1800. When it became apparent to the Federalists that they would lose control of the executive and legislative branches, they moved to consolidate their power in the judiciary. President Adams nominated his secretary of state, John Marshall, to be chief justice. The Federalist Congress also passed legislation to increase the number of lower federal judges, reduce the number of members of the Supreme Court (to prevent the incoming Republicans from filling a vacancy), and authorize forty-two new justices of the peace in the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>亚当斯总统在其任期的最后几天，提名了忠诚的党员担任新职位，并经参议院批准。在杰斐逊即将就任总统的前夜，约翰·马歇尔——仍在亚当斯任期最后一个月担任国务卿——履行了国务卿的传统职责，为新法官的委任状加盖美国国徽。由于疏忽，当晚有几份委任状未能送达新任官员。第二天，新上任的杰斐逊总统指示国务卿詹姆斯·麦迪逊扣留剩余的委任状，其中包括即将成名的威廉·马伯里的委任状，他已被任命为治安法官。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the last days of his administration, President Adams nominated faithful party members to the new positions, and the Senate confirmed them. On the night before Jefferson was to become president, John Marshall—still serving as secretary of state for the last month of Adams’s term—performed the secretary’s traditional duty of affixing the Seal of the United States to the commissions of the new judges. Through inadvertence, a few commissions were not delivered to the new officeholders that night, and the next day the newly inaugurated President Jefferson directed his secretary of state, James Madison, to withhold the remaining commissions, including one belonging to the soon-to-be-famous William Marbury, who had been appointed as a justice of the peace.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>马伯里提起诉讼，要求获得委任状，并向最高法院提交了所谓的“履行职责令”（writ of mandamus）。（履行职责令是法院向政府官员发出的命令，指示该官员履行其职责。）尽管他于1801年提起诉讼，但新成立的共和党国会已废除了最高法院1801年和1802年的条款，因此该案直到1803年才得以判决。最终，最高法院根据首席大法官马歇尔的意见对此案作出裁决，马歇尔秉持当时的伦理道德，认为他作为这出闹剧的参与者和最终裁决者的角色之间并不冲突。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Marbury sued for his commission, bringing what was known as a writ of mandamus in the Supreme Court. (A writ of mandamus is an order from a court to a government official directing the official to perform some duty of his or her office.) Although he brought his action in 1801, the new Republican Congress had abolished the 1801 and 1802 terms of the Supreme Court, and therefore the case was not decided until 1803. Finally, the Court decided the case in an opinion by Chief Justice Marshall who, consistent with the ethical sensibilities of the time, saw no conflict between his roles as participant in the drama and judge of its resolution.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">在对马伯里案</em>作出裁决时，马歇尔和他的法庭面临着一个两难的境地。如果马歇尔不裁定马伯里有权获得委任状，他就等于默许行政部门接管权力。<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_28" class="calibre4"></a>这违背了他的联邦主义原则以及维护司法权的必要性。但当时最高法院的权威尚未完全确立，因此，如果他下令交付委任状，杰斐逊和麦迪逊可能会直接拒绝执行，从而引发宪法危机。马歇尔巧妙地回避了争议，他声称最高法院拥有司法审查权，但行使这一权力的方式却拒绝了马伯里的委任状。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In deciding <em class="calibre8">Marbury</em>, Marshall and his Court faced a dilemma. If Marshall failed to rule that Marbury was entitled to his commission, he would be acquiescing in an assumption of power by the executive <a class="calibre4"></a>branch, contrary to his Federalist principles and his belief in the need to assert the power of the judiciary. But the authority of the Supreme Court was not yet well established, so if he ordered that the commission be delivered, Jefferson and Madison might simply refuse to comply, provoking a constitutional crisis. Marshall’s ingenious response was to sidestep the controversy by claiming the power of judicial review for the Court but exercising it in a way that denied Marbury his commission.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>马歇尔代表法院的意见首先认为，马伯里的任命在总统签署委任状时即已完成。此时，国务卿密封并交付委任状的职责属于部长级事务，未能履行这些职责并不影响马伯里的地位。其次，由于马伯里有权获得委任状，因此法律规定的适当救济是向国务卿发出强制令。问题出现在第三步。最高法院是否是寻求这一救济的适当场所？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Marshall’s opinion for the Court first held that Marbury’s appointment was complete when his commission was signed by the president. At that point the secretary of state’s duties in sealing and delivering the commission were ministerial details, and failing to carry them out did not affect Marbury’s status. Next, because Marbury had a right to his commission, the appropriate remedy under law was mandamus directed to the secretary. The catch arose at the third step. Was the Supreme Court the proper forum in which to seek this remedy?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第三条赋予最高法院在外国外交官或州作为当事人的案件中拥有初审管辖权（即一审审理案件的权力）；在所有其他案件中，最高法院仅有权审理下级法院的上诉。1789年的《司法法案》扩大了最高法院的初审管辖权，使其有权向联邦官员发出强制令。马伯里声称，根据《司法法案》，最高法院对他起诉麦迪逊的诉讼拥有管辖权。首席大法官马歇尔在意见书中力排众议，裁定《司法法案》将最高法院的初审管辖权扩大到第三条赋予的范围之外，这是不可接受的，因此最高法院不能给予马伯里救济，因为它对该案件没有管辖权。这满足了共和党人的切身关切，但该案的重大意义在于，最高法院自诩拥有最终裁定《司法法案》或任何其他国会法案是否合宪的权力。因此，该意见书在放弃眼前问题的同时，极大地增强了最高法院的权威。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Article III granted the Supreme Court original jurisdiction (i.e., the authority to hear cases in the first instance) in cases in which a foreign diplomat or a state was a party; in all other cases, it had only the authority to hear appeals from lower courts. The Judiciary Act of 1789 had expanded the Court’s original jurisdiction to include the power to issue writs of mandamus against federal officials. Marbury asserted that the Court had jurisdiction of his suit against Madison under the Judiciary Act. In the opinion’s tour de force, Chief Justice Marshall ruled that the Judiciary Act had impermissibly extended the Court’s original jurisdiction beyond that granted by Article III and therefore the Court could not grant relief to Marbury because it did not have jurisdiction of the case. This satisfied the immediate concerns of the Republicans, but the great significance of the case lay in the Court’s assumption to itself of the final authority to determine if the Judiciary Act or any other act of Congress was constitutional. Thus the opinion ceded the immediate issue while profoundly enhancing the Court’s authority.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>对马歇尔来说，法院是否有权审查立法的合宪性是一个简单的问题。人民制定了宪法，将其作为根本的、最高的、永久的法律。宪法框架的一部分是，联邦政府是一个权力有限的政府。各部门只能行使人民在宪法中授予的权力。因此，任何违反宪法或超出宪法所列权力的行为均无效。宪法第三条授予的有限管辖权是排他性的，因此国会没有宪法权力将法院的管辖权扩大到包括强制令行动。<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_29" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For Marshall, whether the Court had the power to review the constitutionality of legislation was an easy question. The people created the Constitution to be fundamental, supreme, and permanent law. Part of the constitutional scheme is that the federal government is a government of limited powers. The branches may exercise only the authority that the people have delegated to them in the Constitution. Therefore, any act that is contrary to the Constitution or beyond the powers enumerated in it is void. Article III’s grant of limited jurisdiction was exclusive, so Congress had no constitutional authority to expand the Court’s jurisdiction to include mandamus actions.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>到目前为止，一切都很好。关键在于论证的下一阶段。宪法是根本法，因此它就是<em class="calibre8">法律</em>，而法律的解释和适用是法院的传统职权范围。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>So far, so good. The key comes at the next stage of the argument. The Constitution is fundamental law, so it is <em class="calibre8">law</em>, and the interpretation and application of law is the traditional domain of the courts.</p>
<p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>明确法律是什么，这无疑是司法部门的职责所在。那些将规则应用于具体案件的人，必然要阐述和解释该规则。如果两条法律相互冲突，法院必须就每条法律的适用作出裁决。因此，如果一条法律与宪法相抵触；如果该法律和宪法都适用于某个案件，法院要么根据法律裁决案件，而无视宪法；要么根据宪法裁决案件，而无视法律；法院必须确定哪一条相互冲突的规则适用于案件。这正是司法职责的本质所在。</p><p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. Those who apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the operation of each. So if a law be in opposition to the constitution; if both the law and the constitution apply to a particular case, so that the court must either decide the case conformably to the law, disregarding the constitution; or conformably to the constitution, disregarding the law; the court must determine which of these conflicting rules governs the cases. This is of the very essence of judicial duty.</p>
<p class="noindent">因此，马歇尔巧妙地总结了三段论。宪法即法律。法院解释法律。因此，法院解释宪法。但对马歇尔来说显而易见的事情，对其他人来说却并非如此。法院传统上解释的法律与宪法所体现的法律可能是两码事。如果宪法是根本法，或许不应将其与普通法规和案例同等对待。正因为它是根本法，宪法解释权或许很容易留给其他政府部门。国会在颁布法规时可以对其合宪性作出判断，就像《司法法》一样，而法院将该判断视为最终决定，这并不明显违背宪法框架。</p><p class="noindent">Thus Marshall neatly concludes the syllogism. The Constitution is law. Courts interpret law. Therefore courts interpret the Constitution. But what was obvious to Marshall was not obvious to others. The law that the courts traditionally interpret and the law embodied in the Constitution may be two entirely different things. If the Constitution is fundamental law, perhaps it should not be treated the same as ordinary statutes and cases. Precisely because it is fundamental, constitutional interpretation might just as easily be left to the other branches of government. Congress can make a judgment about the constitutionality of a statute when it enacts one, as with the Judiciary Act, and it would not be obviously inconsistent with the constitutional scheme for the courts to consider that judgment to be definitive.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">尽管马伯里诉麦迪逊案</em>缺乏逻辑严谨，但它却是首次有力地宣告司法审查原则。尽管在<em class="calibre8">马伯里案之后的几十年里，最高法院谨慎地行使了宣布国会法令违宪的权力——直到1857年的</em><em class="calibre8">德雷德·斯科特</em>案才宣布另一项联邦法规无效——但这项权力一直被其他部门主张，并且最初也得到了默许。或许正是<em class="calibre8">因为</em>这项权力行使得如此谨慎，它才得以扎根，因为最高法院在19世纪初经常受到攻击。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Despite the lack of logical rigor in <em class="calibre8">Marbury v. Madison</em>, it was the first strong pronouncement of the principle of judicial review. Although the Court exercised sparingly its power to declare congressional enactments unconstitutional in the decades after <em class="calibre8">Marbury</em>—it didn’t invalidate another federal statute until the <em class="calibre8">Dred Scott</em> case in 1857—the power had been asserted and initially acquiesced to by the other branches. Or perhaps it was <em class="calibre8">because</em> the power was exercised sparingly that it took root, since the Court was frequently under attack in the early years of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最高法院通过对州法律行使类似的权力，巩固了其司法审查权。1810年，最高法院在<em class="calibre8">“弗莱彻诉佩克</em>案”中首次裁定一项州法令无效，理由是该法令试图撤销以欺诈手段转让的土地所有权，违反了合同条款。随后，在1816年的另一起涉及土地纠纷的案件<em class="calibre8">“马丁诉亨特承租人案”</em>中，弗吉尼亚州最高法院裁定<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_30" class="calibre4"></a>对一方来说，但美国最高法院在上诉中做出了不同的裁决。弗吉尼亚州法院拒绝服从最高法院的命令，声称它可以自行决定这个问题，并认为授予法院上诉管辖权的联邦司法法案违宪。当案件返回最高法院时，最高法院在大法官约瑟夫·斯托里 (Joseph Story) 的意见中重申了其宪法权威。在制定宪法时，各州已将其部分主权割让给联邦政府。联邦司法权涵盖所有涉及宪法解释的案件，而至上条款使联邦法律具有至高无上的权威。最后，在<em class="calibre8">科恩斯诉弗吉尼亚州</em>(1821) 案中，法院将其权力扩大到包括对州刑事诉讼的审查。除非州诉讼程序接受联邦法院的审查，否则各州可以通过惩罚主张有效宪法权利的个人来阻挠联邦法律和政策。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Court consolidated its power of judicial review by asserting a similar authority over state law. In 1810 the Court first invalidated a state statute in <em class="calibre8">Fletcher v. Peck</em> on the grounds that the statute, an attempt to rescind title to land that had been fraudulently conveyed, violated the contract clause. Then in <em class="calibre8">Martin v. Hunter’s Lessee</em> in 1816, another case involving a land dispute, the highest court in Virginia ruled <a class="calibre4"></a>for one party but the U.S. Supreme Court, on appeal, ruled differently. The Virginia court refused to obey the Supreme Court’s mandate, asserting that it could decide the issue for itself and that the federal Judiciary Act, which granted appellate jurisdiction to the Court, was unconstitutional. When the case returned to the Supreme Court, the Court, in an opinion by Justice Joseph Story, reasserted its constitutional authority. In adopting the Constitution the states had ceded some of their sovereignty to the federal government. The federal judicial power included all cases involving constitutional interpretation, and the supremacy clause made the federal law preeminent. Finally, in <em class="calibre8">Cohens v. Virginia</em> (1821) the Court extended its power to encompass the review of state criminal proceedings. Unless state proceedings were subject to review in the federal courts, the states could thwart federal law and policy by punishing individuals who asserted valid constitutional rights.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>因此，到1834年约翰·马歇尔首席大法官任期结束时，最高法院审查州和联邦立法机构以及行政官员行为的合宪性的基础已经奠定。从那时起，人们认识到法院解释宪法的巨大权力。然而，这种权力既不是唯一的，也不是无限的。每一位主要公职人员都宣誓维护宪法，因此必须在履行职责时解释宪法。参议员在决定是否投票支持一项法案时会权衡其合宪性，总统决定下令对敌方战斗人员实施酷刑是否在他作为总司令的宪法权力范围内，甚至巡逻的警察也会决定对嫌疑人进行搜身是否合宪。从这个意义上讲，真正的问题不是谁来解释宪法，而是谁的解释最重要。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus by the end of John Marshall’s tenure as chief justice in 1834, the foundation had been laid for Supreme Court review of the constitutionality of the acts of state and federal legislative bodies and executive officials. Since then it has been recognized that the Court’s power to interpret the Constitution is immense. That power is, however, neither unique nor unlimited. Every major public official takes an oath of office pledging to uphold the Constitution and therefore is required to interpret it in the performance of his or her duties. A senator weighs the constitutionality of a bill in deciding whether to vote for it, the president decides whether ordering the torture of enemy combatants is within his constitutional authority as commander-in-chief, and even a police officer on the beat decides whether frisking a suspect is constitutional. To that extent, the real question is not who interprets the Constitution but whose interpretation counts the most.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>纵观美国历史，总统和其他官员一直主张其独立权力，有权决定宪法要求什么，并根据这些决定采取行动。托马斯·杰斐逊认为“法官是所有宪法问题的最终仲裁者”这一理念“确实是一种非常危险的理论，会将我们置于寡头专制之下”；由于他认为1798年的《煽动叛乱法》违宪，他行使了宪法赋予总统的一项权力，赦免了根据该法被定罪的被告，即使该法已被法院适用并维持。亚伯拉罕·林肯曾公开谴责<em class="calibre8">德雷德·斯科特案的</em>判决，该判决认定黑人不是公民，并宣称该判决不会约束他作为国会议员或总统。乔治·W·布什在签署挑战……的法案时发表了许多<em class="calibre8">签署声明。</em><a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_31" class="calibre4"></a>法案条款的合宪性，并声称他无意执行这些条款。如今，一些学者主张复兴<em class="calibre8">民粹宪政主义</em>，认为政府的政治部门在解释宪法方面拥有更大的权力。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Throughout American history, presidents and other officials have asserted their independent authority to determine what the Constitution requires and to act on those determinations. Thomas Jefferson regarded the idea of “judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions” to be “a very dangerous doctrine indeed, and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy”; because he considered the Sedition Act of 1798 to be unconstitutional, he exercised one of the powers granted to the president by the Constitution and pardoned defendants convicted under it, even though the act had been applied and upheld by the court. Abraham Lincoln famously denounced the <em class="calibre8">Dred Scott</em> decision, which held that blacks were not citizens, declaring that it would not bind him as member of Congress or president. George W. Bush issued many <em class="calibre8">signing statements</em> when he signed bills into law that challenged the <a class="calibre4"></a>constitutionality of provisions of the bills and asserted his intention not to enforce them. Today some scholars argue for a revival of <em class="calibre8">popular constitutionalism</em>, in which the political branches of government have more of a role in interpreting the Constitution.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，当最高法院与其他部门在解释宪法时发生冲突时，最高法院通常会获胜。让我们来看看两个试图和潜在的抵抗及其最终徒劳的例子。在“<em class="calibre8">布朗诉教育委员会”案中，最高法院关于废除公立学校种族隔离的</em>裁决在许多南方州遭到了官方和非官方的抵制。例如，一些南方立法机构颁布决议“废除”该裁决，并试图通过拒绝资助废除种族隔离的学校等手段来避免其影响。在1958年的<em class="calibre8">“库珀诉亚伦”案中，最高法院驳回了所有这些努力，并重申了</em><em class="calibre8">马伯里</em>原则，即“联邦司法机构在解释宪法法律方面拥有最高权力，自那以后，这一原则一直受到最高法院和国家的尊重，是我们宪法体系中永久且不可或缺的特征。”南方各州对最高法院权力的蔑视对宪法秩序构成了巨大的挑战，以至于所有九位大法官都采取了非同寻常的举措，分别在意见书上署名。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When the Court and other branches come into conflict in interpreting the Constitution, however, the Court generally triumphs. Consider two illustrations of attempted and potential resistance and its ultimate futility. The Court’s decision desegregating public schools in <em class="calibre8">Brown v. Board of Education</em> was met in many southern states by official and unofficial resistance. Some southern legislatures, for example, enacted resolutions “nullifying” the decision and tried to avoid its effects by schemes such as refusing to fund desegregated schools. In <em class="calibre8">Cooper v. Aaron</em> (1958), the Court rejected all of these efforts and reasserted the principle of <em class="calibre8">Marbury</em>, that “the federal judiciary is supreme in the exposition of the law of the Constitution, and that principle has ever since been respected by this Court and the Country as a permanent and indispensable feature of our constitutional system.” The southern states’ defiance of the Court’s power was so challenging to the constitutional order that all nine justices took the extraordinary step of attaching their names to the opinion individually.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>水门事件时期，法院面临着一系列源于对尼克松总统及其亲信非法活动的调查的案件。例如，在1974年的<em class="calibre8">“美国诉尼克松案</em>”中，法院裁定，法院而非总统有权决定水门事件特别检察官寻求的证据是否有效受制于总统所主张的行政特权。审查此类证据是宪法第三条赋予法院的司法职能，总统必须接受法院对此问题的裁决。比法院的裁决更引人注目的是尼克松总统接受了这一裁决。即使一系列事件最终导致他耻辱辞职，总统也无法挑战既定的司法审查惯例。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the Watergate era, the courts were faced with a number of cases arising from the investigations into the illegal activities of President Nixon and his cronies. In <em class="calibre8">United States v. Nixon</em> (1974), for example, the Court held that the courts, not the president, could determine whether evidence sought by the Watergate special prosecutor was validly subject to the president’s claim of executive privilege. Review of evidence like this was a judicial function that Article III had committed to the courts, and the president was subject to their judgment on the issue. More remarkable than the Court’s pronouncement was President Nixon’s acceptance of it. Even though the chain of events would lead to his resignation in disgrace, the president could not challenge the established practice of judicial review.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>由于宪法涵盖了政府事务的方方面面，司法审查可以涵盖政府的各个方面，而<em class="calibre8">马伯里诉麦迪逊案</em>的逻辑表明，最高法院应该对任何案件进行合宪性审查。然而，最高法院认为，出于宪法要求或司法审慎的考量，有些问题可以提交国会或总统处理，而无需进行司法审查。最高法院作为司法机构，在实际操作方面能力有限，在评估其相对于其他部门的职责方面，在政治层面也受到限制，因此它不会裁决<em class="calibre8">政治问题</em>。<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_32" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Since the Constitution covers the entire scope of government affairs, judicial review could conceivably encompass every aspect of government, and the logic of <em class="calibre8">Marbury v. Madison</em> suggests that the Court should engage in constitutional review of any case. Nevertheless, the Court has concluded that as a matter of constitutional requirement or judicial prudence, there are some issues that are committed to Congress or the president without judicial review. The Court is limited in what it can do as a practical matter as a judicial body and as a political matter in assessing its responsibilities relative to the other branches, so it refrains from deciding <em class="calibre8">political questions</em>.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>举例来说，越南战争期间曾发生过一系列诉讼，试图宣布越南战争非法，因为国会从未正式宣战，或试图阻止政府对战争的某些部分（例如轰炸柬埔寨）提起诉讼。这些诉讼是否因为涉及政治问题而无法得到法院的审理？按照<em class="calibre8">马伯里的</em>观点，人们可能会认为这是一个简单的宪法解释问题。宪法是否要求国会在总统派遣军队之前宣战，或者总统可以进行未经宣布的战争而国会可以为其提供资金？但是，决定这个问题是否会让法院参与那些只能或最好留给其他政府部门的政策制定？如果是这样，那么这是一个法院无法决定的无法得到法院审理的政治问题。虽然这些案件都没有上诉到最高法院，但下级法院在这些案件中——以及随后涉及里根总统在萨尔瓦多的军事行动和第一次海湾战争的案件中——裁定，关于战争与和平的决定权属于总统和国会。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To take an example, there was a spate of litigation during the Vietnam War that sought to declare the war illegal because Congress had never formally declared war, or to prevent the government from prosecuting some parts of the war such as the bombing of Cambodia. Were these nonjusticiable because they involved political questions? Following <em class="calibre8">Marbury</em>, one might consider this a straightforward issue of constitutional interpretation. Does the Constitution require Congress to declare war before the president commits troops, or may the president conduct and Congress fund an undeclared war? But would deciding that question engage the Court in policymaking of the kind that is only or best left to the other branches of government? If so, it is a nonjusticiable political question that the courts cannot decide. Although none of the cases reached the Supreme Court, the lower courts held in these cases—and in subsequent cases involving President Reagan’s military engagement in El Salvador and the first Persian Gulf war—that decisions about war and peace were committed to the president and the Congress.</p>

<p class="noindent">最高法院有权审查州和联邦立法，以确定这些法律是否符合宪法。联邦法院系统还对许多非宪法案件拥有管辖权，包括根据联邦法规引起的或涉及不同州公民的普通民事案件，以及银行抢劫、毒品犯罪和其他违反联邦法律的刑事案件。宪法对联邦政府其他部门——立法部门（国会）和行政部门（以总统为首）——的权力有何规定？</p><p class="noindent">The Supreme Court has the power to review state and federal legislation to determine if the laws are constitutional.

<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>回想一下宪法所面临的基本问题：我们如何赋予政府权力去做我们自身无法做到的事情，同时又确保政府不会变得过于强大以至于威胁到我们的自由？宪法的答案源于特定的历史境遇。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Recall the basic question with which constitutional law struggles. How do we empower a government to do what we cannot do for ourselves, while making sure that it does not become so strong that it threatens our liberties? The Constitution’s answer grew out of a particular historical situation.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>宪法的制定者回应了人们普遍认为《邦联条例》所建立的政府过于软弱的看法。根据《邦联条例》，国会无权征税、发行单一国家货币或控制贸易。当时既没有强有力的行政机构——总统是国会议员，权力有限——也没有联邦法院系统。各州之间冲突频发，一个州对从另一个州进口的商品征收关税，而联邦政府无力偿还巨额债务。<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_33" class="calibre4"></a>独立战争债务引发了一场金融危机。因此，《条例》下的国民政府被普遍认为是失败的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The framers of the Constitution responded to the widespread perception that the government created under the Articles of Confederation was too weak. Under the Articles, Congress had no power to tax, to issue a single national currency, or to control trade. There was neither a strong executive—at that time the president was a member of Congress with limited powers—nor a federal court system. Conflict between the states was widespread, with one state imposing tariffs on goods imported from another, and the national government’s inability to repay the huge <a class="calibre4"></a>Revolutionary War debt precipitated a financial crisis. Accordingly, the national government under the Articles was widely perceived to be a failure.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>问题在于联邦政府无力应对这种情况，因此应对措施显而易见，并被1787年的制宪会议采纳：赋予国家政府更大的权力，使其足以控制各州之间的冲突、管理国家财政、征兵和支付军饷以及开展外交关系。但这只回答了基本问题的一部分。制宪者们也深切担忧，新的国家政府可能会侵犯州政府的职权范围，或威胁人民的基本权利。因此，联邦政府被设想为一个权力扩大但有限的政府，其权力仅限于宪法本身“列举”的那些。列举权力的概念隐含在宪法结构中，并在第十修正案中明确规定，该概念指出：“宪法未授予合众国、也未禁止各州行使的权力，分别保留给各州或人民行使。”新政府只能通过我们所知的<em class="calibre8">制衡</em>或<em class="calibre8">权力分立</em>制度来行使权力。多数人无法践踏各州的利益或人民的权利，因为立法必须由两院制立法机构制定，并经总统批准。为了进一步保护国家政府免受权力过大的影响，第一届国会起草了《权利法案》，并于1791年通过了该法案的具体保障。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The problem was the inadequacy of the federal government to deal with the situation, so the response was obvious and was adopted by the constitutional convention of 1787: Give greater powers to the national government, powers that would be sufficient for it to control conflicts among the states, order the nation’s financial affairs, raise and pay an army, and conduct foreign relations. But that only answered part of the basic question. The framers also were deeply concerned that the new national government might invade the proper province of state governments or threaten the basic rights of the people. Therefore, the federal government was conceived as a government of expanded but limited authority, having only the powers “enumerated” in the Constitution itself. Implicit in the constitutional structure and made explicit in the Tenth Amendment, the concept of enumerated powers stated that “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” And the new government could exercise its powers only through a system we know as <em class="calibre8">checks and balances</em> or <em class="calibre8">separation of powers</em>. A majority could not run roughshod over the interests of the states or the rights of the people because legislation had to come out of a bicameral legislature and be acceded to by the president. To add a final degree of protection against an overly powerful national government, the specific guarantees of the Bill of Rights were drafted by the First Congress and adopted in 1791.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在宪法生效后的最初几年里，美国政府不负众望。新政府着手解决当时最紧迫的问题和国家最根本的需求。第一届国会设立了重要的政府部门——国务院、陆军部、财政部、邮政局、总检察长办公室以及联邦法院系统——并处理了重要的经济事务，包括征税、设立国家银行、进行人口普查、建立货币体系以及制定专利法和版权法。然而，直到内战爆发之前，美国政府的规模仍然很小。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The government lived up to these expectations in the first years under the Constitution. The new government addressed the most pressing issues of the time and the most fundamental requirements of a nation. The First Congress created the essential government departments—State, War, Treasury, the Post Office, the office of Attorney General, and a system of federal courts—and dealt with important economic issues, including imposing taxes, chartering a national bank, taking a census, establishing a monetary system, and creating patent and copyright laws. Up until the Civil War, though, the size of the government was still minuscule.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>但看看这个权力有限、<em class="calibre8">被列举的</em>政府都发生了什么。如今问人们“政府”是什么，他们很可能首先想到的是国家政府。总统经常被媒体描述为“世界上最有权力的人”。国会几乎在所有事情上都立法，从保护濒危物种到进口商品征税。四百万联邦官僚机构负责征税、审查大公司的合并，<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_34" class="calibre4"></a>联邦负责向电视台发放执照，管理超过五亿英亩的联邦土地，每年支出高达三万五千亿美元。与此同时，各州也承担着运营公立学校和维护道路等重要事务，但与联邦政府相比，它们的活动显得微不足道。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But look at what has happened to this government of limited, <em class="calibre8">enumerated</em> powers. Ask someone today what “the government” is and they are likely to think first of the national government. The president is often described in the media as “the most powerful person in the world.” Congress legislates on nearly everything, from the protection of endangered species to taxes on imported goods. The federal bureaucracy, four million strong, collects taxes, reviews the merger of large corporations, <a class="calibre4"></a>assigns licenses to television stations, manages more than half a billion acres of federal lands, and spends three and a half trillion dollars each year. The states, meanwhile, do important things such as operate public schools and maintain the roads, but their activities seem dwarfed by the presence of the federal government.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这种权力列举式政府的转变——从范围狭小、影响力有限，到如今几乎渗透到现代生活方方面面——的每一步都受到了宪法解释的认可。这种转变方式体现了宪法是如何被解释和应用的。模糊的宪法文本涵盖了起草时无法预见的情况，最高法院在考虑政府权力的适当范围时，既要考虑文本本身，也要考虑不断变化的政治、经济和社会价值观。当然，这一故事的基本要素是联邦政府权力的大幅扩张，依赖于对宪法文本中权力列举的广泛解释，并平衡行政和立法部门以及联邦政府和各州之间的权力，最终导致权力共享而非分权。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Every step of the transformation of this government of enumerated powers—from one of tiny scope and limited influence to one that penetrates virtually every aspect of modern life—has been sanctioned through interpretations of the Constitution. The ways in which it did so illustrate how the Constitution is interpreted and applied. The vague constitutional text covers situations unforeseen at the time of its drafting, and the Supreme Court has to respond both to the text itself and to changing political, economic, and social values in considering the appropriate scope of government power. The basic elements of the story are, of course, a tremendous expansion of the power of the federal government, relying on broad interpretations of the enumeration of powers in the constitutional text and balancing of the authority of the executive and legislative branches, and the federal government and the states, resulting in more a sharing of powers than a separation of powers.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>美国宪法第一条第八款赋予国会政府基本权力，共包含十七个具体条款和一个一般条款。然而，“具体”并不等同于“有限”。第八款赋予政府的权力包括“征税”、“借款”、“宣战”和“征募和支持军队”的权力，以及剩余权力条款第十八条赋予政府的“制定一切必要和适当的法律，以行使上述权力以及本宪法赋予美国政府的所有其他权力”。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The fundamental grants of government authority are given to Congress in Article I, section 8, in seventeen specific clauses and one general clause. “Specific” is not the same as “limited,” however. The government’s powers under section 8 include the powers to “lay and collect taxes,” “borrow money,” “declare War,” and “raise and support Armies”—and, in the residual authority clause 18, “[t]‌o make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>作为联邦权力扩张和各部门之间权力分享的一个例子，考虑立法部门或行政部门如何试图根据商业条款行使权力，以及最高法院如何通过权衡行使权力的合宪性来作出反应。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Consider as an example of the expansion of federal power and the sharing of power among the branches the ways in which the legislative or executive branches have attempted to exercise power under the commerce clause and how the Supreme Court has responded by weighing the constitutionality of the exercise.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第一条第八款第三项赋予国会“规范与外国、各州之间以及与印第安部落之间的贸易”的权力。根据《邦联条例》，联邦政府几乎没有权力规范州际或国际贸易，也无法阻止各州干涉。商务条款旨在纠正这种情况，使联邦政府能够对国民经济进行内外管控。这项权力的广度取决于对“各州之间的贸易”一词的解释。<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_35" class="calibre4"></a>这可以简单地理解为是为了防止类似《联邦条款》下盛行的州际冲突，例如，一个州对从另一个州进口的货物征税。然而，国会却利用商业条款授权联邦将监管权扩展到整个经济领域，并对州权力施加相应的限制。最高法院通常默许这种授权，但偶尔也有明显的例外。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Article I, section 8, clause 3, gives Congress the power “[t]‌o regulate Commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.” Under the Articles of Confederation the federal government had little power either to regulate interstate or international commerce or to prevent individual states from interfering with it. The commerce clause was designed to correct this situation, enabling the federal government to exercise authority over the national economy internally and externally. The breadth of this power depends on the interpretation of the term “Commerce...among the several States.” <a class="calibre4"></a>This could be read simply to prevent interstate conflicts of the kind that prevailed under the Articles where, for example, one state taxed goods brought in from another. Instead, Congress has used the commerce clause as an authorization to extend federal regulatory power throughout the economy and to place a corresponding limitation on state power. The Supreme Court has usually acquiesced in this assertion of authority, with occasional notable exceptions.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>与许多其他宪法原则一样，商业条款的范围最初是由首席大法官约翰·马歇尔在一份意见书中广泛界定的。在<em class="calibre8">吉本斯诉奥格登案</em>（1824年）中，纽约州立法机关授予罗伯特·富尔顿（蒸汽船发明者）及其合伙人在纽约水域运营蒸汽船的专有权，富尔顿将部分垄断权特许经营给了奥格登。吉本斯开始根据联邦法规在新泽西州和纽约州之间运营一条竞争性的蒸汽船航线，奥格登提起诉讼，要求禁止吉本斯侵犯其特许经营权。最高法院裁定，纽约州授予的垄断权与国会关于船舶许可的法案相冲突，因此根据最高条款，该法案无效。尽管如此，马歇尔还是借此机会阐述了国家政府在商业条款下的权力。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Like so many other constitutional principles, the scope of the commerce clause was first broadly defined in an opinion by Chief Justice John Marshall. In <em class="calibre8">Gibbons v. Ogden</em> (1824), the New York legislature had granted Robert Fulton (the inventor of the steamboat) and a partner the exclusive right to operate steamboats on New York waters, and Fulton had franchised a portion of this monopoly to Ogden. Gibbons began to operate a competing steamboat line between New Jersey and New York under a federal statute, and Ogden sued to enjoin Gibbons from infringing on his franchise. The Supreme Court held that New York’s grant of a monopoly conflicted with an act of Congress concerning the licensing of ships, and therefore it was void because of the supremacy clause. Nevertheless, Marshall took the occasion to expound on the power of the national government under the commerce clause.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>马歇尔指出了国会对州际贸易的三个权力要素，并对每个要素进行了广泛的定义。首先是商业。奥格登的律师辩称，“商业”仅指交通运输，即货物从一个州运到另一个州，不包括航运。对马歇尔来说，交通运输只是商业的一部分：“商业无疑是交通运输，但它的意义远不止于此，它是一种交往。它涵盖了国家之间以及国家不同部分之间所有领域的商业往来。”</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Marshall identified three elements of Congress’s power over interstate commerce and broadly defined each of them. First was commerce. Ogden’s counsel argued that “commerce” meant only traffic, or things moving from one state to another, which would exclude navigation. For Marshall, traffic was only a part of commerce: “Commerce, undoubtedly is traffic, but it is something more, it is intercourse. It describes the commercial intercourse between nations, and parts of nations, in all its branches.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>下一个需要定义的术语是“在各州之间”。根据马歇尔的说法，“在……之间”的含义不仅仅是“介于……之间”。“‘在……之间’的事物与其他事物相互交织；因此，各州之间的贸易不能止于各州的外部边界，而可以延伸到内陆。” 国会无权监管完全在州内发生的贸易，但一项活动是否完全在州内进行，取决于其影响，而非其实际存在。即使一项活动完全在一州境内进行，如果它影响到该州境外的贸易，则属于州际贸易。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The next term to be defined was “among the several states.” “Among” did not mean merely “between,” according to Marshall. “A thing which is ‘among’ others is intermingled with them; therefore commerce among the states cannot stop at the external boundary line of each state but may be introduced into the interior.” Congress had no power to regulate commerce that occurred wholly within a state, but whether an activity was wholly within a state was measured by its effects, not its physical presence. Even if an activity was carried on entirely within the borders of a single state, if it affected commerce beyond the borders of the state, it was interstate commerce.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最后一步是对“监管”进行定义。马歇尔认定：“这项权力，与国会拥有的所有其他权力一样，本身是完整的，可以在最大限度内行使，除宪法本身规定外，不受任何限制。”<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_36" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The final step was to define “regulate.” Marshall determined that “This power, like all others vested in Congress, is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed in the constitution itself.”<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>因此，法院得出结论，国会拥有宪法权力，可以监管那些影响超越一州边界的商业活动。但最高法院对这一权力的定义，只能回应国会对该权力的主张及其挑战。在<em class="calibre8">吉本斯诉奥格登案</em>之后的半个世纪里，最高法院几乎没有机会进一步思考这一定义。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus the Court concluded that Congress had constitutional authority to regulate commercial activities that had effects beyond the borders of a single state. But the definition of this authority by the Supreme Court could come only in response to congressional assertion of the authority and challenges to it, and for a half century after <em class="calibre8">Gibbons v. Ogden</em>, the Court had little occasion to further consider the definition.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在接下来的半个世纪里——从1887年到1937年——即使国会试图更有力地行使商业权力，最高法院也采取了更为狭隘的策略。这是一个“大”的时代，美国钢铁公司、标准石油公司以及其他新的财富和经济实力集中地崛起。国会和州立法机构采取行动控制这些新的经济权力，但随着最高法院变得更加保守，它越来越不愿意承认立法机构对商业的管辖权。在界定商业条款的范围时，最高法院放弃了马歇尔对商业影响的关注，转而采取了一种正式的定义式方法。马歇尔在<em class="calibre8">吉本斯诉奥格登</em>案中裁定，商业不仅仅是交通运输，但在1895年的一起案件中，最高法院几乎断言商业仅仅是交通运输。国会颁布了《谢尔曼反托拉斯法》，以控制主要行业的新垄断。在<em class="calibre8">美国诉EC·奈特案</em>中，最高法院通过对国会根据商业条款所拥有的权力范围进行狭隘解释，限制了《谢尔曼法》。美国制糖公司已取得制糖业的垄断地位，控制着美国90%以上的糖产量。但法院表示，联邦政府不能违宪地监管这一垄断，因为它是对制造业而非商业的垄断：“商业继承制造业，但并非制造业的一部分……即使某件物品是为了出口到另一个州而制造，其本身也并不构成商业物品。”</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the following half century—from 1887 to 1937—the Court took a narrower tack even as Congress attempted to exercise the commerce power more vigorously. This was the era of bigness, with the rise of U.S. Steel, Standard Oil, and other new concentrations of wealth and economic power. Congress and state legislatures acted to control the new economic powers, but as the Court became more conservative, it became less willing to acknowledge legislative authority over commerce. In defining the scope of the commerce clause, it abandoned Marshall’s focus on the effects of commerce and adopted a formal, definitional approach. Marshall had decided in <em class="calibre8">Gibbons v. Ogden</em> that commerce was more than traffic, but in an 1895 case the Court came close to saying that commerce was only traffic. Congress had enacted the Sherman Antitrust Act to control the new monopolies of major industries. In <em class="calibre8">United States v. E. C. Knight</em> the Court limited the Sherman Act by a narrow interpretation of the scope of Congress’s power under the commerce clause. The American Sugar Refining Company had acquired a monopoly of the sugar industry, controlling more than 90 percent of the country’s sugar production. But, the Court said, the federal government could not constitutionally regulate this monopoly because it was a monopoly of manufacturing, not commerce: “Commerce succeeds to manufacture, and is not part of it....The fact that an article is manufactured for export to another State does not itself make it an article of commerce.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最高法院对商业条款的保守解读达到了极致，它推翻了旨在使美国摆脱大萧条的一些关键的新政立法。例如，在<em class="calibre8">谢克特家禽公司诉美国案</em>（1935年）（“病鸡”案）中，法院推翻了经济复苏计划的核心要素——《国家工业复兴法》。除其他外，该法案授权总统执行经地方贸易协会批准的竞争法。<em class="calibre8">谢克特家禽公司案</em>涉及纽约市家禽业的竞争法。毫无疑问，家禽是大批量生产的，在州际贸易中运输，并对国家经济产生重要影响。然而，该法案试图规范家禽的销售，而这超出了商业条款的范围。法院用令人联想起<em class="calibre8">EC Knight的措辞，将商业定义为</em><a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_37" class="calibre4"></a>狭义上来说：“就本案涉及的家禽而言，州际贸易已经停止。这些家禽已在本州永久停产。”</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Supreme Court’s conservative interpretations of the commerce clause reached their most extreme when the Court struck down some key pieces of New Deal legislation designed to bring the country out of the Great Depression. In <em class="calibre8">Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States</em> (1935), for example (the “sick chicken” case), the Court struck down the central element of the plan for economic recovery, the National Industrial Recovery Act. Among other things, the act empowered the president to enforce codes of competition approved by local trade associations. <em class="calibre8">Schechter Poultry Corp</em>. concerned the code of competition for the poultry industry in New York City. Poultry undoubtedly was produced in mass quantities, shipped in interstate commerce, and had important national economic effects. The act attempted to regulate the sale of poultry, however, and this was beyond the scope of the commerce clause. In language reminiscent of <em class="calibre8">E.C. Knight</em>, the Court defined commerce <a class="calibre4"></a>narrowly: “So far as the poultry here in question is concerned, the flow in interstate commerce had ceased. The poultry had come to a permanent rest within the State.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最高法院裁定新政立法无效，对政府其他部门构成挑战。1936年，富兰克林·罗斯福总统以压倒性优势赢得连任后，他接受了这一挑战。罗斯福总统提出了著名的“填塞法院”计划，根据该计划，他将有权为每位年满七十岁且在最高法院任职十年的现任大法官任命一位新法官。如果该计划获得通过，他将能够任命六名新大法官，从而形成一个稳固的自由派多数，以支持新政立法。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Court’s invalidation of the New Deal legislation presented a challenge to the other branches of government, and, after President Franklin Roosevelt’s resounding reelection victory in 1936, he took up the challenge. FDR proposed his famous court-packing plan, under which he would have been authorized to appoint one new justice to the court for each current justice who was seventy years old and had served on the court for ten years. Adoption of the plan would have enabled him to appoint six new justices to create a solid liberal majority that would uphold New Deal legislation.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>围绕法院填塞计划的争论异常激烈，清晰地展现了最高法院宪法角色的模糊性。进步人士对最高法院能够阻挠压倒性多数民众的意愿感到愤怒，并将该计划视为遏制不民主机构的一种手段。但最高法院也拥有众多拥护者，即使在那些不认同其裁决的人中也是如此；如果宪法不仅仅是简单的政治，那么最高法院的裁决就必须免受这种直接的政治干预。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The debate over the court-packing plan was fierce, and it clearly demonstrated the ambiguities of the Court’s constitutional role. Progressives were outraged by the Court’s ability to thwart the will of an overwhelming popular majority and saw the plan as a means of reining in an undemocratic institution. But the Court had many defenders, even among those who did not agree with its decisions; if there was more to constitutional law than simple politics, the Court had to be immune from this kind of direct political intervention in its decisions.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最终，填塞法院计划在国会失败，但仍然影响了最高法院。到1937年中期，持中间立场的大法官欧文·罗伯茨（Owen Roberts）成为监管立法的更坚定的支持者，而在接下来的几年里，臭名昭著的保守派“四骑士”（詹姆斯·麦克雷诺兹、威利斯·范·德凡特、皮尔斯·巴特勒和乔治·萨瑟兰）相继退休，由罗斯福任命、对其立法方案更为认同的大法官接任。结果，对商业条款的解释转向了几乎完全尊重国会权力的水平，这让人想起马歇尔对效果的强调，这种强调一直延续到最近。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the end the court-packing plan failed in Congress but still influenced the Supreme Court. By the middle of 1937 middle-of-the-road Justice Owen Roberts became a more consistent upholder of regulatory legislation, and over the next few years the notoriously conservative “Four Horsemen” (James McReynolds, Willis Van Devanter, Pierce Butler, and George Sutherland) retired, to be replaced by justices appointed by Roosevelt and more sympathetic to his legislative program. The result was a shift in interpretation of the commerce clause to a standard of near-total deference to congressional power, evocative of Marshall’s emphasis on effects, which remained in place until very recently.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>例如，在 1942 年的<em class="calibre8">威卡德诉菲尔伯恩</em>案中，法院特别提到了马歇尔在<em class="calibre8">吉本斯诉奥格登案</em>中对商业权力的分析。农业部长对小农菲尔伯恩处以 117.11 美元的罚款，因为他在自己的分配地上种植了 239 蒲式耳的小麦，尽管他打算只在自己的农场使用小麦，而不是在州际或其他商业活动中出售。该活动是生产或制造，还是营销和分销，并不重要；对法院来说，问题在于对商业的影响，而不是活动的性质。确定国会根据商业条款所拥有的权力范围的关键在于，受监管的活动是否会对州际贸易产生影响，即使它本身并不是州际贸易。如果菲尔伯恩<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_38" class="calibre4"></a>如果一位小农户自己种植并消费小麦，他就不会在市场上购买。如果许多小农户也这样做，他们的累积决策将对全国小麦市场产生重大影响，进而影响州际贸易，因此，这成为国会采取行动的适当议题。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In <em class="calibre8">Wickard v. Filburn</em> (1942), for example, the Court specifically referred to Marshall’s analysis of the commerce power in <em class="calibre8">Gibbons v. Ogden</em>. The secretary of agriculture fined Filburn, a small farmer, $117.11 for growing 239 bushels of wheat over his allotment, even though he intended to use the wheat exclusively on his own farm and not sell it in commerce, interstate or otherwise. Whether the activity was production or manufacturing on the one hand, or marketing and distribution on the other, was irrelevant; the issue for the Court was the effect on commerce, not the character of the activity. The key to determining the scope of Congress’s power under the commerce clause was whether the regulated activity would have an effect on interstate commerce, even if it was not interstate commerce itself. If Filburn <a class="calibre4"></a>grew and consumed his own wheat, he would not buy wheat on the market. If many small farmers did the same, their cumulative decisions would have a substantial effect on the national market in wheat, so it would affect interstate commerce and therefore was a proper subject for congressional action.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在罗斯福新政转型后的半个世纪里，最高法院几乎默许了国会所有关于商业权力的运用，包括立法规定最低工资和最高工作时间、禁止商业场所的种族歧视、监管食品销售以及将高利贷定为刑事犯罪等等。在<em class="calibre8">霍德尔诉弗吉尼亚州露天采矿和复垦协会案</em>（1981年）中，伦奎斯特大法官总结了这段历史，并指出“我们联邦制度最大的‘虚构’之一就是国会只行使授予它的权力”，并且“本法院对商业条款的解释方式充分说明了这种虚构的程度”。尽管他同意法院关于规范州内露天采矿的法规合宪的裁决，但他警告说：“断定国会根据商业条款的监管权力是无限的，这是错误的。有些活动可能本质上是私人的或地方性的，以至于它们根本不属于商业范畴。”随着新任命改变了最高法院的多数派，伦奎斯特的警告成为了<em class="calibre8">新联邦主义</em>的基础，新联邦主义自新政以来首次限制了国会根据商业条款所拥有的权力。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For a half century following the New Deal transformation, the Supreme Court acquiesced in nearly every application of the commerce power by the Congress, including legislation setting minimum wages and maximum hours of work, prohibiting racial discrimination in places of commerce, regulating the sale of food, and criminalizing loan sharking, among many others. In <em class="calibre8">Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining and Reclamation Association</em> (1981), Justice Rehnquist summarized this history and suggested that “one of the greatest ‘fictions’ of our federal system is that the Congress exercises only those powers delegated to it” and “the manner in which this Court has construed the Commerce Clause amply illustrates the extent of this fiction.” Although he concurred in the Court’s decision that a statute regulating intrastate strip mining was constitutional, he warned that “it would be a mistake to conclude that Congress’ power to regulate pursuant to the Commerce Clause is unlimited. Some activities may be so private or local in nature that they simply may not be in commerce.” As new appointments shifted the majority on the Court, Rehnquist’s warning emerged as the basis for a <em class="calibre8">new federalism</em> that limited Congress’s power under the commerce clause for the first time since the New Deal.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>1990 年，国会颁布了一项法令，规定在学校 1,000 英尺范围内持有枪支属于联邦犯罪。阿方索·洛佩兹因携带手枪进入高中而被控违反该法令，他以颁布该法令超出了国会任何列举的权力为由驳回起诉。政府辩称该法令是行使商业权力；在校区持有枪支可能导致暴力犯罪，暴力犯罪的成本很高，而且学校里有枪支会威胁学习环境，导致公民生产力下降，因此在校区持有枪支可能严重影响州际贸易。最高法院在首席大法官伦奎斯特的意见中驳回了政府的立场，裁定在校区持有枪支不是经济活动，不像在<em class="calibre8">威卡德诉菲尔伯恩案</em>中种植小麦，所以它不在商业条款的范围内。特别是在国会没有发现携带枪支对州际贸易造成特殊负担的情况下，如果这项法规被认定有效，那么几乎任何其他法规也都是合宪的，包括那些侵犯传统上在州内领土内的公民权利的法规。<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_39" class="calibre4"></a>各州的权限，例如犯罪、教育和儿童养育（<em class="calibre8">美国诉洛佩兹案</em>，1995 年）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In 1990 Congress enacted a statute making it a federal crime to possess a gun within 1,000 feet of a school. Alfonso Lopez was charged under the statute for carrying a handgun into his high school, and he moved to dismiss the indictment on the basis that enactment of the statute was beyond any of the enumerated powers of Congress. The government defended the statute as an exercise of the commerce power; possession of a gun in a school zone may result in violent crime, the costs of violent crime are substantial, and the presence of guns in schools threatens the learning environment, which results in a less productive citizenry, so possession of a gun in a school zone may substantially affect interstate commerce. The Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, rejected the government’s position, holding that the possession of a gun in a school zone was not economic activity, unlike the growing of wheat in <em class="calibre8">Wickard v. Filburn</em>, and so it was not within the scope of the commerce clause. Particularly in the absence of congressional findings about the burden that carrying guns imposed a special burden on interstate commerce, if this statute was held valid almost any other statute would be constitutional too, including those that invaded subjects traditionally within <a class="calibre4"></a>the province of the states, such as crime, education, and childrearing (<em class="calibre8">United States v. Lopez</em>, 1995).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>2013年，最高法院审议奥巴马政府标志性医疗保险改革法案《平价医疗法案》（ACA）的合宪性时，新联邦主义的力量凸显出来（<em class="calibre8">全国独立企业联合会诉西贝利厄斯案</em>，2012年）。该法案最具争议的条款是“个人强制参保”，该条款要求个人要么维持医疗保险覆盖，要么在未维持医疗保险覆盖的情况下缴纳所得税罚款。最高法院的立场不同寻常：四名保守派大法官与首席大法官约翰·罗伯茨一致认为，该强制参保超出了国会商业条款的权力范围；四名自由派大法官与罗伯茨一致认为，根据国会的征税权，该强制参保符合宪法。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The strength of the new federalism became clear in 2013 when the Court considered the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the signature health insurance reform of the Obama administration (<em class="calibre8">National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius</em>, 2012). The most controversial provision of the act was the “individual mandate,” which required individuals either to maintain health insurance coverage or to pay a penalty on their income taxes for failing to do so. In an unusual lineup for the Court, four conservative justices joined Chief Justice John Roberts in holding that the mandate was outside Congress’s commerce clause power, and four liberal justices joined Roberts in holding that the mandate was constitutional under Congress’s power to tax.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>个人强制参保旨在解决医疗保险市场的一些经济问题。例如，医院有时无论患者是否有保险都必须提供治疗；为了支付治疗费用，医院有时会通过提高保费来转嫁成本，而支付这些保费的保险公司则会将成本转嫁给客户。此外，《平价医疗法案》还禁止保险公司拒绝为已有疾病的患者提供保险，这可能会鼓励人们等到生病才购买保险，从而再次增加每个人的保险成本。因此，个人是否继续参保会对医疗保险市场以及整个医疗保健系统的成本产生影响，而每个人都会时不时地使用这个系统。政府认为，由于这种影响，《平价医疗法案》与“<em class="calibre8">威卡德诉菲尔伯恩案”</em>中对小麦种植的监管非常相似，并且符合宪法，因为它规范了对州际贸易产生重大影响的活动。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The individual mandate was designed to address some of the economic problems of the health insurance market. For example, hospitals sometimes are required to provide treatment whether their patients have insurance or not; to pay for that treatment, the hospitals pass on the costs through higher rates in other cases, and insurers who pay those rates pass on the costs to their customers. Also, the ACA prevented insurers from denying coverage to people with preexisting conditions, which could encourage people to wait until they are sick to buy insurance, again increasing the cost of insurance to everyone. Therefore an individual’s decision to maintain coverage had an effect on the market for health insurance and the cost of the health care system overall, a system that everyone will use at one time or another. Because of this effect, the government argued, the ACA was much like the regulation of wheat growing in <em class="calibre8">Wickard v. Filburn</em> and was constitutional because it regulated activity that had a substantial effect on interstate commerce.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>首席大法官罗伯茨不同意这种观点。宪法赋予联邦政府“监管商业”的权力，但这预设了商业活动需要监管。个人强制令并不监管商业活动。“相反，它迫使个人<em class="calibre8">积极</em>购买某种产品，理由是他们不这样做会影响州际贸易。”<em class="calibre8">威卡德的</em>情况有所不同，因为他提到的农民参与了小麦种植——这是一种活动，而不是一种不作为——这影响了小麦市场。该案辩论中经常使用的类比是，国会可以监管蔬菜销售，但不能强迫每个人都购买蔬菜，因为这样做会增加蔬菜消费，从而增进健康，减少肥胖，最终降低医疗成本。罗伯茨在其意见中也提到了这一点。<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_40" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Chief Justice Roberts disagreed. The Constitution grants the federal government the power to “regulate commerce,” but that presupposes that there is commerce to be regulated. The individual mandate does not regulate commercial activity. “It instead compels individuals to <em class="calibre8">become</em> active in purchasing a product, on the ground that their failure to do so effects interstate commerce.” <em class="calibre8">Wickard</em> was different because the farmer was involved in growing wheat—an activity, not an inactivity—which had an effect on the market for wheat. The analogy that often was used in debate about the case, to which Roberts alluded in his opinion, was that Congress can regulate the sale of vegetables but it cannot compel everyone to purchase vegetables because doing so would increase vegetable consumption, which would increase heath and decrease obesity, thereby lowering health care costs.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>尽管个人强制保险超出了商业权力的范围，但罗伯茨确实坚持认为它属于政府的征税权。《平价医疗法案》将无保险个人必须支付的款项指定为“罚款”，而非“税款”，但这笔款项将由美国国税局通过所得税制度征收。在征税权下，商业条款中关于“活动/不活动”的区分并不重要，它类似于其他税收激励措施，例如鼓励购房的抵押贷款抵扣。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Although the individual mandate was beyond the commerce power, Roberts did uphold it as within the government’s taxing power. The ACA designated the payment uninsured individuals must make as a “penalty,” not a “tax,” but it is to be collected by the IRS through the income tax system. Under the taxing power, the activity/inactivity distinction of the commerce clause was irrelevant, and it resembled other tax incentives, such as the mortgage deduction that encourages the purchase of a home.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>除了宪法分析之外，评论家们对首席大法官罗伯茨的意见也有很多评论。一贯保守的罗伯茨进一步限制了商业条款的范围，但另辟蹊径，维护了这项具有里程碑意义的立法。一些人认为，这是司法界整体克制的表现，划定了界限，并狭隘地解读了先例。另一些人则反思了早期新政法院的争议，怀疑该意见是否部分出于对法院角色的担忧；该意见限制了商业权力，但避免了推翻一项重大且具有政治争议的立法。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Commentators had much to say about Chief Justice Roberts’ opinion beyond its constitutional analysis. The normally conservative Roberts further limited the scope of the commerce clause but used another route to uphold this landmark piece of legislation. Some viewed it as an exercise in overall judicial restraint, drawing fine lines and narrowly construing precedents. Others, reflecting on the controversies about the early New Deal Court, wondered if the opinion was partially motivated by a concern for the Court’s role; the opinion limited the commerce power but avoided striking down a major and politically controversial piece of legislation.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>宪法赋予总统的具体权力包括：担任武装部队总司令；在参议院的建议和同意下任命大使、法官和行政官员；以及推荐和否决立法。然而，在国会仅拥有“本法授予的立法权”的情况下，宪法规定“行政权属于总统”，这意味着，总统拥有通常由行政长官行使的所有权力，即使这些权力未在宪法中明确规定。最高法院也裁定，总统拥有这些权力。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The president’s specific powers under the Constitution include acting as commander-in-chief of the armed forces; appointing ambassadors, judges, and executive officials with the advice and consent of the senate; and recommending and vetoing legislation. Where the Congress possesses only the “legislative Powers herein granted,” however, the Constitution states that “The executive Power shall be vested in a President,” which suggests, and the Supreme Court has held, that the president has all powers normally exercised by a chief executive even if those powers are not specifically enumerated in the Constitution.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>总统的列举行政权力和一般行政权力虽然巨大，但并非无限，也并非独立于国会的权力。关于联邦权力范围和总统行政权力范围的争论在危机时期最为激烈。政府保卫国家的权力范围以及总统作为总司令的角色长期以来一直存在争议，而自2001年9月11日恐怖袭击以来，争议愈演愈烈。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The president’s enumerated and general executive powers are great but neither unlimited nor independent of the powers of Congress. Debates about the scope of federal power and of the president’s executive authority are most intense in times of crisis. The extent of the government’s power to defend the nation and the president’s role as commander-in-chief have long been controversial, and the controversy has intensified since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>宪法赋予国会“宣战”以及为武装部队提供资金和管理的权力，并指定总统为“总司令”。因此，国会和总统可以共同行动，国会宣战后，总统负责执行。美国历史上，国会仅宣战六次，第一次是1812年战争，最近一次是在第二次世界大战期间；南北战争和朝鲜战争是众多未宣战的战争中的两场。更常见的情况是，国会没有正式宣战，而是以其他方式授权总统派遣军队。<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_41" class="calibre4"></a>投入战斗。9·11袭击事件后，国会通过了《授权使用军事力量》决议，引发了伊拉克战争和阿富汗战争。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Constitution grants to Congress the powers “to declare war” and to finance and regulate the armed forces, and it designates the president as “Commander in Chief.” Congress and the president therefore can act together, when Congress declares war, which the president then carries out. Congress has declared war only six times in the nation’s history, beginning with the War of 1812 and most recently during World War II; the Civil War and Korean War were among the many undeclared wars. More often Congress fails to formally declare war but in some other way authorizes the president to send troops <a class="calibre4"></a>into combat. Following the September 11 attacks, Congress passed an Authorization for the Use of Military Force resolution that led to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>总统也经常未经国会批准就采取军事行动，或在采取行动后寻求批准；据统计，这种情况发生过130多次，最早是亚当斯总统动用海军捕获袭击美国商船的法国船只，至少延续到克林顿总统下令发动空袭以制止科索沃的种族清洗。总统们认为这些行动是正当的，理由包括他们拥有保卫国家免遭袭击的固有权力，需要保护身陷海外冲突的美国人，以及对联合国和北约等国际组织的义务。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The president also often takes military action without congressional approval or seeks approval after action is taken; by one account, that has happened more than 130 times, beginning with President Adams’s use of the navy to capture French ships that had attacked American merchant vessels and extending at least through President Clinton’s ordering an air campaign to stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. Presidents have justified actions like these by their inherent power to defend the nation against attacks, by the need to protect Americans caught in conflicts abroad, and by obligations to international organizations such as the United Nations and NATO.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在未经国会授权的情况下采取行动时，总统作为总司令的权力能延伸到多远一直是最具争议的问题。朝鲜战争期间的钢铁扣押案提出了一种方法。面对罢工威胁，杜鲁门总统下令联邦政府扣押全国钢铁厂以维持生产。最高法院裁定，在没有国会授权的情况下（事实上，面对国会拒绝授权扣押以解决劳资纠纷），杜鲁门没有总司令的权力或在他的一般行政权力下。大法官罗伯特·杰克逊同意这一结果，建议采用一种灵活的、实用的测试来分析总统权力，这种测试经常被引用。当总统根据国会授权行事时，他的权力最大；当他的行为违背国会明示或暗示的意愿时，他的权力最小；当他依靠总统的独立权力对国会尚未解决的问题采取行动时，他的行动就处于“模糊地带”，其权力范围取决于“事件的必然性和当代不可估量的因素”（<em class="calibre8">扬斯敦板材和管材公司诉索耶</em>，1952 年）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>How far the president’s power as commander-in-chief extends when he acts without Congressional authorization has been the most controversial issue. One approach was suggested in the Steel Seizure Cases during the Korean War. President Truman ordered the seizure by the federal government of the nation’s steel mills to maintain production in the face of a threatened strike. The Supreme Court held that in the absence of Congressional authorization (indeed, in the face of Congress’s refusal to authorize seizure to settle labor disputes), Truman had no such authority as commander-in-chief or under his general executive power. Concurring in the result, Justice Robert Jackson suggested a flexible, functional test for analyzing presidential power that has been frequently cited. When the president acts pursuant to congressional authorization, his power is greatest; when he acts contrary to the express or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest; when he acts on an issue Congress has not addressed, relying on his independent powers as president, he operates in “a zone of twilight,” where the scope of his power depends “on the imperatives of events and contemporary imponderables” (<em class="calibre8">Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer</em>, 1952).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>国会还试图通过1973年《战争权力决议》来限制总统的权力。该决议是在尼克松总统否决越南战争争议后颁布的。该决议要求总统在派遣军队参战时必须与国会协商，并在未经国会批准的情况下于60天后撤军。该决议是否违宪地限制了总统的权力，从未得到过检验，而且可能永远不会得到检验，因为它引发了最高法院不愿受理的政治问题。与此同时，总统们有时尊重该决议，有时则不尊重；克林顿总统在派遣军队援救海地总统让-贝特朗·阿里斯蒂德时就使用了该决议。<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_42" class="calibre4"></a>1994 年政变后，他下令对苏丹和阿富汗的基地组织基地进行空袭，但未能成功。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Congress also has tried to rein in the president’s power through the War Powers Resolution of 1973, enacted over President Nixon’s veto as a response to the controversy over the Vietnam War. The resolution requires the president to consult with Congress when sending troops into combat situations and to withdraw forces after sixty days unless Congress has approved. Whether the resolution unconstitutionally restricts the president’s power has never been tested, and probably never will be, because it raises political questions the Supreme Court has been reluctant to take up. In the meantime, presidents have sometimes respected the resolution and sometimes not; President Clinton used it when he sent troops to restore Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide <a class="calibre4"></a>after a coup in 1994 but failed to do so when he ordered air strikes against Al Qaeda bases in Sudan and Afghanistan in 1998.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>发动战争的权力也可能与受宪法保护的公民自由相冲突。在南北战争期间，林肯总统暂停了人身保护令，以便无限期拘留那些妨碍战争的人。当最高法院法官罗杰·坦尼签发人身保护令，要求将一名名叫约翰·梅里曼的南方邦联同情者送上法庭或释放时，林肯指示扣押梅里曼的军官无视该命令，声称宪法赋予他们在国会休会期间采取行动的权力。坦尼没有继续追究此事，随后国会根据宪法允许的程序批准暂停执行该令。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The power to make war also can conflict with constitutionally protected civil liberties. During the Civil War, President Lincoln suspended habeas corpus to enable the indefinite detention of those hindering the war. When Supreme Court Justice Roger Taney issued a writ of habeas corpus ordering that a Confederate sympathizer named John Merryman be brought to court or released, Lincoln directed the military officers holding Merryman to ignore the order, claiming the constitutional authority to act when Congress was not in session. Taney did not pursue the matter, and subsequently Congress endorsed the suspension of the writ, as the Constitution permits it to do.</p>

As a consequence, American forces seized combatants and others believed to be tied to Al Qaeda (including American citizens) and detained them both in the United States and at the naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The administration of President George W. Bush claimed that the resolution authorizing military force and, perhaps more importantly, the president’s inherent powers as chief executive and commander-in-chief authorized a broad series of actions beyond the control of peacetime law and beyond the review of the courts. His Justice Department issued a legal opinion that stated: “In wartime, it is for the President alone to decide what methods to use to best prevail against the enemy.” Accordingly, he initially claimed the constitutional power to order the torture of prisoners to obtain intelligence even though Congress had prohibited such action in its adoption of the United Nations Convention against Torture; after extended publicity, the Justice Department withdrew its opinion and the president disavowed that claim. The administration also claimed that prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay and even U.S. citizens designated as “enemy combatants” were beyond the reach of the courts. (After September 11, the government also expanded its use of wiretapping, interception of email, and other electronic surveillance; those measures presented issues under the Fourth Amendment and are discussed in <a href="#text/part0015_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-9" class="calibre4">Chapter 9</a>.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在2004年的两起案件中，最高法院驳回了这些主张，声称即使在反恐战争期间，总统的权力也受到限制，法院有权决定这些权力的范围。尤其考虑到美国对关塔那摩湾的控制范围，联邦法院有权“裁定行政部门可能无限期的”<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_43" class="calibre4"></a>拘留声称自己完全无辜的人”（<em class="calibre8">拉苏尔诉布什案</em>，2004年）。亚西尔·哈姆迪是一名因参加塔利班战斗而在阿富汗被捕的美国公民，同样有权获悉将其列为敌方战斗人员的依据，并在中立的决策者面前对这些指控提出异议。根据国会决议，总统可以指定一名公民为敌方战斗人员并下令拘留，但即使是敌方战斗人员也不一定是无限期地被拘留，而且必须经过正当程序（<em class="calibre8">哈姆迪诉拉姆斯菲尔德案</em>，2004年）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In a pair of cases in 2004, the Supreme Court rejected those claims, asserting that the president’s powers were limited even during the war on terror and that the courts had the authority to determine the scope of those powers. Particularly because of the extent of control of Guantanamo Bay by the United States, the federal courts had jurisdiction “to determine the legality of the Executive’s potentially indefinite <a class="calibre4"></a>detention of individuals who claim to be wholly innocent of wrongdoing” (<em class="calibre8">Rasul v. Bush</em>, 2004). Yaser Hamdi, an American citizen seized in Afghanistan for having fought with the Taliban, likewise was entitled to receive notice of the basis for classifying him as an enemy combatant and to contest the claims before a neutral decision maker. The president, pursuant to the congressional resolution, could designate a citizen as an enemy combatant and order his detention, but even an enemy combatant could not necessarily be held indefinitely, and not without being given due process (<em class="calibre8">Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</em>, 2004).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>为了回应<em class="calibre8">拉苏尔</em>和<em class="calibre8">哈姆迪一</em>案，国会颁布了2005年《被拘留者待遇法》和2006年《军事委员会法》，规定了审查被拘留者身份的程序，并限制法院对军方关于被拘留者的决定的审查，特别是排除了人身保护令行动。在2008年<em class="calibre8">布迈丁诉布什</em>案中，最高法院宣布这些程序和限制违宪。宪法规定，国会只能在“发生叛乱或入侵事件，公共安全可能需要”时中止人身保护令，而这两项法规既没有满足中止条款的要求，也没有提供足以替代人身保护令的程序。一名被拘留者的命运由军事委员会决定，他可以有一个既不是律师也不是被拘留者辩护人的“代表”，政府提供的证据将被推定为有效，被拘留者只能获得非机密部分的证据，并且他只能提供有限的、“合理可用的”证据。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In response to <em class="calibre8">Rasul</em> and <em class="calibre8">Hamdi</em>, Congress enacted the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 and the Military Commissions Act of 2006 to prescribe procedures for the review of detainees’ status and to restrict review by the courts of the military’s decisions on detainees, specifically excluding habeas corpus actions. In <em class="calibre8">Boumedienne v. Bush</em> (2008), the Supreme Court declared that the procedures and restrictions were unconstitutional. The Constitution provides that habeas corpus may be suspended by Congress only “when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it,” and the statutes neither hewed to the requirements of the suspension clause nor provided procedures that were an adequate substitute for habeas corpus. A detainee whose fate was being determined by a military commission could have a “representative” who was neither a lawyer nor even the detainee’s advocate, the evidence presented by the government would be presumed valid, the detainee could have access only to unclassified portions of the evidence, and he could present only limited, “reasonably available” evidence of his own.</p>

<p class="noindent">到目前为止，故事讲述了一个足够强大的国家政府的建立，它能够纠正《邦联条例》下政府的弱点，通过列举权力原则限制该政府的权力，以及随后通过对商业条款等具体授权的广泛解释来扩大其权力。但是，各州的情况如何呢？各州在国家政府成立之前就已经存在，并且由各州代表起草和批准了宪法。随着联邦政府权力的扩大，各州如何融入宪法体系？</p><p class="noindent">The story so far has been the creation of a national government strong enough to correct the weaknesses of the government under the Articles of Confederation, the limitation of the powers of that government by the doctrine of enumerated powers, and the subsequent expansion of its powers through broad interpretation of specific grants of authority such as the commerce clause. But what about the states? The states existed before the national government was created, and state delegates drafted and ratified the Constitution. As the power of the federal government has expanded, how do the states fit into the constitutional scheme?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>与宪法中的其他问题一样，这个问题的答案并不简单。宪法文本对州权力的论述很少，明确赋予州政府的权力很少，对联邦相对于各州的权力也几乎没有做出明确的限制。正如<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_44" class="calibre4"></a>随着时代变迁，联邦政府和州政府以不同的方式行使权力，最高法院一直在努力界定各自可以适当运作的领域。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As with every other issue of constitutional law, the answer to this question is not simple. The text of the Constitution says little about state authority, explicitly granting few powers to state governments and explicitly placing few limits on federal authority vis-à-vis the states. As <a class="calibre4"></a>times have changed and the federal and state governments have asserted their authority in different ways, the Supreme Court has struggled to define the areas in which each may properly operate.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>尽管宪法并未明文规定，但联邦制——即政府权力由州政府和国家政府共享的理念——是我们宪法体系的基本假设。联邦政府拥有列举权力，仅行使宪法明确赋予的权力——尽管我们已经看到，鉴于最高法院默许联邦权力的扩张，这种限制往往更多地停留在理论层面而非实际层面。另一方面，各州则被假定行使一般治安权，即所有政府通常行事的权力。法院已经就联邦政府列举权力（例如商业权力）的含义制定了大量法律，但关于州政府的权力却没有类似的法律体系，因为它们的权力是一般性的，而非列举性的。宪法没有明确规定州政府的一般权力，因为没有必要——在起草宪法时，每个人都理解这些概念，就像我们今天从当前的政治形势和宪法结构的必然含义中理解的那样。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Even though the Constitution doesn’t say so, federalism—the idea that governmental power is shared by state and national governments—is a basic postulate of our constitutional system. The federal government is a government of enumerated powers, exercising only those powers specifically granted to it in the Constitution—though we have seen that that limitation is often more theoretical than real, given the Supreme Court’s acquiescence in the expansion of federal authority. The states, on the other hand, are assumed to exercise the general police power, or the power to do all of the usual things that governments do. The courts have developed a substantial body of law on the meaning of the enumerated powers of the federal government (such as the commerce power), but there is no comparable body of law on the authority of state governments, because their powers are general rather than enumerated. The Constitution does not specify the general authority of state governments because it doesn’t have to—everyone understood the concepts at the time of the drafting, as we do today from current political situations and the necessary implication of the constitutional structure.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>调和州和联邦的权力应该很容易。各州拥有普遍权力，而国家政府拥有宪法中明确规定的有限权力。第十修正案明确规定，各州的权力超越国家政府：“宪法未授予合众国、也未禁止各州行使的权力，分别属于各州或人民保留。” 但宪法第六条第二款也包含一项最高条款：“本宪法和依本宪法制定的合众国法律……为国家最高法律；各州法官均应受其约束，即使任何州的宪法或法律中有任何与之相反的规定。” 因此，各州拥有普遍权力，而联邦政府拥有有限权力，但在其权力范围内，联邦政府拥有最高权力。那么，法院该如何划分联邦权力和州权力之间的界限呢？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It should be easy to reconcile state and federal powers. The states have general authority, while the national government has limited authority specifically enumerated in the Constitution. The Tenth Amendment makes clear that the authority of the states extends beyond that of the national government: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” But the Constitution also contains a supremacy clause, in Article VI, section 2: “This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof...shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.” Thus the states have general authority, and the federal government has limited authority, but within its authority the federal government is supreme. So how are the courts to draw the line between federal and state authority?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>从内战后到新政初期，最高法院长期以来倾向于限制联邦权力，而支持州权力。这种做法是最高法院保守主义（前文已讨论）的必然结果，该主义限制了联邦在商业条款和其他条款下的权力范围。这一概念被称为<em class="calibre8">双重主权</em>。联邦和州政府都有其适当的权力范围，并且双方都<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_45" class="calibre4"></a>可以侵犯对方的权力。法院经常会裁定国会制定的法令无效，理由是相关法规超出了联邦政府的法定权力范围，或者侵犯了各州的权力。例如，在<em class="calibre8">哈姆纳诉达根哈特案</em>（1918年）中，法院裁定，禁止在州际贸易中运输童工生产的商品的联邦法律超出了州的贸易权力；在<em class="calibre8">凯勒诉美国案</em>（1909年）中，法院裁定，联邦禁止开设卖淫场所的法令侵犯了各州的警察权力。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For a long time, from the post–Civil War years to the beginning of the New Deal, the Supreme Court tended to limit federal authority in favor of state authority. This approach was a corollary of the Court’s conservative approach (discussed earlier), which limited the scope of federal powers under the commerce clause and other provisions. The concept was called <em class="calibre8">dual sovereignty</em>. Both the national and state governments had their proper sphere of authority, and neither <a class="calibre4"></a>could invade the other’s sphere. Frequently the Court would invalidate congressional enactments by finding that the statute in question was beyond the federal government’s enumerated powers or that it invaded the powers of the states. In <em class="calibre8">Hamner v. Dagenhart</em> (1918), for example, the Court held that a federal law prohibiting the shipment in interstate commerce of goods produced with child labor exceeded the commerce power, and in <em class="calibre8">Keller v. United States</em> (1909) it ruled that a federal prohibition on houses of prostitution invaded the states’ police power.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>双重主权的概念及其所蕴含的广泛的州权力范围已经逐渐消失。与二十世纪和二十一世纪的法律思想家相比，明确区分主权领域的可能性更符合十九世纪人的观念。而且，在罗斯福新政、大萧条和新政之后，法院更愿意默许联邦权力的扩张。如今，国家和州政府之间的权力分配受<em class="calibre8">优先权原则的制约，包括</em><em class="calibre8">休眠</em>联邦权力令人费解的影响。当联邦政府采取行动时，它会优先于与联邦法律实际或潜在冲突的州法律。有时，当联邦政府没有采取行动但可以采取行动时——即其权力处于休眠状态时——州立法也会受到禁止。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The concept of dual sovereignty and the broad scope for state authority it entailed has faded. The possibility of clearly distinguishing between areas of sovereignty was more congenial to the nineteenth-century mind than to legal thinkers of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and, after FDR, the Great Depression, and the New Deal, the Court was more willing to acquiesce in the expansion of federal authority. Today the allocation of authority between the national and state governments is controlled by the doctrine of <em class="calibre8">preemption</em>, including the puzzling effect of <em class="calibre8">dormant</em> federal powers. Where the federal government acts, it preempts state law that actually or potentially conflicts with the federal law. And sometimes where the federal government has not acted but could act—where its power is dormant—state legislation also is barred.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>与联邦法律不一致的州法律的优先权很容易理解为最高条款的运作。如果《联邦仲裁法》规定，合同双方可以同意将争议提交仲裁，而不考虑州法律的任何相反规定，那么试图使此类协议无效的加州法规将被优先适用（<em class="calibre8">Southland Corp. v. Keating</em>，1984年）。难题在于，在多大程度上，州法律和联邦法律之间并没有明显冲突，仍然冲突到必须以州法律为准。有时，最高法院会尊重联邦制的考虑，对法规进行解释以避免冲突；有时，法院会更加关注国家利益，尤其是在它认为需要全国统一的情况下。在<em class="calibre8">Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc.</em>（1992年）一案中，法院裁定，关于香烟标签的联邦法律优先于州因未警告吸烟危害而承担的侵权责任。但在<em class="calibre8">奥驰亚集团诉古德案</em>（2008年）中，法院得出结论，联邦法规并不优先于州政府针对烟草制造商提出的欺诈性广告，即“淡味”香烟危害较小而提起的诉讼。在这两起案件中，法院都关注国会颁布法律的明示和默示意图；在<em class="calibre8">西波隆案</em>中，州法律与联邦政府要求在香烟上印制健康警示相冲突，但在<em class="calibre8">奥驰亚集团案</em>中，州法律针对的是欺诈性广告，而非吸烟的健康影响。除非<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_46" class="calibre4"></a>国会已经表现出“明确的目的”来优先于州法律，但该州的警察权仍然完好无损。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The preemption of state law that is inconsistent with federal law is easy to understand as an operation of the supremacy clause. Where the Federal Arbitration Act says that parties to a contract can agree to submit a dispute to arbitration notwithstanding any contrary provision of state law, a California statute that attempted to invalidate such an agreement is preempted (<em class="calibre8">Southland Corp. v. Keating</em>, 1984). The difficult question is to what extent state and federal laws that are not obviously inconsistent still conflict to such an extent that the state law must fall. Sometimes the Supreme Court will be deferential to the concerns of federalism and interpret the statutes to avoid a conflict; at other times the Court will be more sensitive to national interests, particularly where it perceives a need for national uniformity. In <em class="calibre8">Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc</em>. (1992), the Court held that federal law on cigarette labeling preempted state tort liability for failure to warn of the dangers of smoking. But in <em class="calibre8">Altria Group, Inc. v. Good</em> (2008), it concluded that a federal statute did not preempt a state fraud claim against cigarette manufacturers for deceptively advertising that “light” cigarettes were less harmful. In both cases, the Court focused on Congress’s express and implied intent in enacting the law; in <em class="calibre8">Cipollone</em> the state law conflicted with the federally required health warning on cigarettes, but in <em class="calibre8">Altria Group</em> the state law was aimed at deceptive advertising, not the health effects of smoking. Unless <a class="calibre4"></a>Congress has demonstrated “a clear and manifest purpose” to preempt state law, the state’s police power remains intact.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>即使没有实际冲突，只要国会已经介入受监管的领域，联邦法律也可以优先于州法律。这关乎国会最初意图的解读。如果涉及国家利​​益或需要全国统一的议题——例如，印第安部落事务、移民或全国范围内鸟类迁徙的监管——法院很可能会将联邦法规解读为优先于该领域。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Federal law can preempt state law even in the absence of an actual conflict where Congress has occupied the field subject to regulation. This is a matter of interpretation of how far Congress originally intended to go. Where the issues are of national interest or require national uniformity—as with the regulation of Indian tribal affairs, immigration, or the migration of birds throughout the country—the Court is likely to read federal statutes as preempting the field.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>优先权原则中最模糊的领域或许涉及国会权力范围内尚未立法的案件。尚未行使的休眠权力是否会阻止各州在此期间采取行动？早期倡导强大国家政府的人认为，各州就其边界以外的事务进行立法的能力是《邦联条例》下政府的一大弱点，而商业条款和至上条款旨在弥补这一缺陷。因此，各州不能在联邦商业权管辖的范围内采取行动，尽管它们可以在其他可能对商业产生附带影响的领域进行立法。另一些人则对联邦权力持狭隘的看法，认为只有在州立法与联邦法律实际冲突的情况下，州立法才会被优先适用。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Perhaps the fuzziest area of preemption doctrine concerns cases within the powers of Congress in areas within which Congress has not yet legislated. Does the dormant power not yet exercised prevent the states from acting in the meantime? Early advocates of a strong national government argued that the ability of states to legislate on matters having effects beyond their borders was a major weakness of the government under the Articles of Confederation, which the commerce clause and supremacy clause were intended to cure. Accordingly, states could not act within areas covered by the federal commerce power, although they might legislate in other areas that would have some incidental effect on commerce. Others took a narrow view of the federal power, arguing that state legislation was preempted only where it actually conflicted with federal enactments.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这个问题的解决始于19世纪50年代，并在罗斯福新政之后的一系列案件中最终得以明确。这一标准对联邦制的担忧十分敏感。各州应该被允许根据当地需求立法，但不应被允许干预州际贸易。法院在州执行立法的当地利益与其对州际贸易造成的负担和歧视之间进行权衡。因此，一个州可以通过制定道路上卡车的最大高度和重量限制来保护其在公路安全方面的利益，即使很少有卡车能够达到这些限制，因为该禁令对州内使用和途经该州的卡车同样适用（例如， 1938年<em class="calibre8">的南卡罗来纳州公路局诉巴恩韦尔兄弟案</em>），但它不能禁止超长牵引拖车，因为禁令条款豁免了许多州内卡车司机（例如，1981年的<em class="calibre8">卡塞尔诉联合货运公司案</em>）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The resolution of this issue began in the 1850s and was definitively formulated in a series of cases from the New Deal forward. The test is sensitive to concerns of federalism. States ought to be permitted to legislate in response to local needs, but they should not be permitted to interfere with the flow of commerce among the states. The Court balances the state’s local interests in enforcing its legislation against the burden and discrimination imposed by it on interstate commerce. Thus a state may protect its interest in safe highways by enacting maximum height and weight limits for trucks on its roads, even if few trucks can meet the limits, because the ban was imposed equally on trucks used within the state and going through the state (for example, <em class="calibre8">South Carolina State Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros</em>., 1938), but it may not ban extra-long tractor-trailers where the terms of the ban exempted many in-state truckers (as in <em class="calibre8">Kassel v. Consolidated Freightways Corp</em>., 1981).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>关于国家政府与各州之间宪法权力分配的另一个方面值得一提。各州拥有独立的宪法地位和一般警察权，而联邦政府只拥有列举的权力，因此有些事情联邦政府无法指示各州去做。例如，联邦政府无法指示一个州的首府设在何处。<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_47" class="calibre4"></a>正如俄克拉荷马州加入联邦时国会试图做的那样（<em class="calibre8">Coyle v. Smith</em>，1911）。但随着联邦政府和联邦预算的增长，国会设计了一种机制，让各州按照国会的意愿行事，而不是直接命令它们。国会制定了由各州管理的联邦支出计划，但要求各州必须遵守特定条件才能参与。例如，第二十一修正案结束了禁酒令，并赋予各州对酒精饮料销售的几乎完全的权力。由于各州的权力，可以说该修正案禁止国会颁布国家最低饮酒年龄。然而，1988 年，国会颁布了一项法令，除非该州的最低饮酒年龄为 21 岁，否则国会将扣留部分联邦公路资金。实际上，这相当于一项国家要求，因为每个州都依靠联邦资金来修建和维护其道路。国会能否间接地做其在宪法上不能直接做的事情？是的，首席大法官威廉·伦奎斯特代表多数法官表示，因为控制公路资金属于国会的支出能力范围，而且饮酒年龄与州际公路上的安全通行有关。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One other aspect of the constitutional allocation of authority between the national government and the states deserves mention. The states have independent constitutional status and general police power, while the federal government has only enumerated powers, so there are things the federal government cannot direct the states to do. The federal government could not, for example, tell a state where to locate its capital, <a class="calibre4"></a>as it tried to do when Oklahoma was admitted to the Union (<em class="calibre8">Coyle v. Smith</em>, 1911). But as the federal government and the federal budget have grown, Congress has devised a mechanism for getting the states to do what it wants without directly commanding them. Congress establishes federal spending programs administered through the states but conditions a state’s participation on its compliance with specified conditions. For example, the Twenty-first Amendment ended prohibition and gave the states near-total authority over the sale of alcoholic beverages. Because of the states’ authority, arguably the amendment bars Congress from enacting a national minimum drinking age. In 1988, however, Congress enacted a statute that withheld a portion of federal highway funds from a state unless the state had a minimum drinking age of twenty-one. As a practical matter, this was equivalent to a national requirement because every state depended on federal funds to build and maintain its roads. Could Congress do indirectly what it could not constitutionally do directly? Yes, Chief Justice William Rehnquist said for a majority of the Court, because controlling highway funds was within the Congress’s spending power and the drinking age was related to safe travel on interstate highways.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>与国会的商业条款权力一样，<em class="calibre8">NFIB诉Sebelius案</em>（2013年）限制了国会对各州行使此类权力——这是法院首次裁定国会支出条件违宪。《平价医疗法案》（ACA）扩展了医疗补助（Medicaid）体系，要求各州覆盖收入在贫困线133%以内的居民，从而为低收入美国人提供医疗保健；联邦政府将在2016年之前全额支付这些费用，此后将支付比例降至90%。首席大法官罗伯茨的意见认为，这项措施已经越界，从鼓励各州参与医疗补助变成了强迫它们参与。他将因不遵守新计划而切断所有医疗补助资金的威胁描述为对各州“用枪指着脑袋”，因为医疗补助根深蒂固，构成了各州预算的很大一部分，以至于它们无法承受失去这些资金。<a id="text/part0008_split_001.html.page_48" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As with Congress’s commerce clause power, <em class="calibre8">NFIB v. Sebelius</em> (2013) drew limits on this use of congressional action in relation to the states—the first time the Court had held a Congressional spending condition unconstitutional. The ACA extended the Medicaid system for providing health care to low-income Americans by requiring states to cover residents within 133 percent of the poverty line; the federal government would pay 100 percent of these costs until 2016 and would decrease its payments to 90 percent thereafter. Chief Justice Roberts’ opinion concluded that this measure crossed the line from encouraging the states to participate in Medicaid to coercing them to do so. He characterized the threat of cutting off all Medicaid funds for failing to comply with the new program as “a gun to the head” of the states, because Medicaid was so well entrenched and constituted such a large portion of the budget of the states that they could not bear to lose the funds.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>

<p class="subtitle1">宪法权利</p><p class="subtitle1">Constitutional Rights</p>
<p class="noindent">宪法的基本议题是如何创建一个足够强大的政府，使其能够做我们想让它做的事，同时又能限制其权力，使其不做我们不想做的事。我们最不希望政府做的事情之一就是侵犯我们的“权利”。当然，“权利”的含义会随着时间而改变，但我们已经习惯了政府不能对我们做某些事情的观念。</p><p class="noindent">The basic issue of constitutional law is how to create a government strong enough to do what we want it to and yet limit the power of that government so that it doesn’t do what we don’t want. One of the main things we don’t want the government to do is to invade our “rights.” What is meant by “rights” changes over time, of course, but we have become used to the idea that there are certain things the government can’t do to us.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在我们宪法史的头一个半世纪里，宪法主要关注的是上一章讨论的政府结构问题：宪法赋予联邦法院、国会和总统哪些权力，以及联邦权力如何限制州政府的权力。自第二次世界大战以来，宪法更多地关注的是界定个人权利，我们现在要探讨的正是这个领域。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For the first century and a half of our constitutional history, the primary concern of constitutional law was with the issues of government structure discussed in the last chapter: what powers the Constitution gives to the federal courts, Congress, and the president and how the federal powers limit the authority of state governments. Since the Second World War, more of the action in constitutional law has been concerned with defining individual rights, and it is to that area that we now turn.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0009_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-3-div1-2"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0010" class="calibre1">宪法保护哪些权利？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0010" class="calibre1">What Rights Does Constitutional Law Protect?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">每一项宪法权利都植根于宪法文本中的一项或多项条款。了解这些权利的方法之一是逐一查阅这些条款——例如第一修正案保障的言论自由、第二修正案赋予的持枪权等等——并思考由此衍生的权利。但如果我们将这些权利分为两类，会更容易理解。</p><p class="noindent">Every constitutional right is grounded in one or more provisions of the text of the Constitution. One way of learning about these rights is to refer to the provisions one by one—the First Amendment guarantee of free speech, the Second Amendment right to bear arms, and so on—and consider the rights that emanate from them. But it is easier to understand the rights if we separate them into two groups.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第一组权利是<em class="calibre8">程序性权利</em>。这些权利关乎政府必须遵循的程序——政府在针对个人或有时针对群体采取行动时必须如何行事。第二组权利是<em class="calibre8">实质性权利</em>。这些权利界定了政府无论遵循何种程序都不能侵犯的个人自由领域。尽管程序性权利与实质性权利之间的界限<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_50" class="calibre4"></a>权利和实质性权利之间的区别并不是特别明显，但这种区别是有帮助的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The first group of rights is <em class="calibre8">process rights</em>. These rights are about the procedures the government must follow—how the government must behave when it acts with respect to an individual or, sometimes, a group. The second group of rights is <em class="calibre8">substantive rights</em>. These rights define the areas of individual freedom that the government cannot invade regardless of the procedures it follows. Although the line between process <a class="calibre4"></a>rights and substantive rights isn’t a particularly sharp one, the distinction is helpful.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>几个例子可以说明程序权利和实质性权利之间的区别。如果您正在领取社会保障福利，政府不能仅仅因为某些官僚认为您不再有资格领取就将其取消。在您的福利被取消之前，您享有的宪法正当程序权利保证您必须收到政府索赔的通知，并且必须有机会在听证会上陈述您对该问题的论点。这是一项程序权利。另一方面，如果政府想强迫您参加天主教弥撒，那么宪法问题就在于实质性权利，而非程序权利。即使政府发出通知并举行听证会，也不能侵犯您选择自己宗教信仰的宪法实质性权利。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A couple of examples suggest the difference between process and substantive rights. If you are receiving Social Security benefits, the government can’t just take them away because some bureaucrat believes you are no longer entitled to them. Before your benefits can be cut off, your constitutional right to due process guarantees that you must receive notice of the government’s claim and must have the opportunity to present your arguments about the issue at a hearing. This is a process right. On the other hand, if the government wants to force you to attend a Catholic Mass, the constitutional issue is one of substance, not process. Even if the government gives you notice and a hearing, it cannot infringe on your substantive constitutional right to choose your own religion.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>程序权包括第五修正案和第十四修正案赋予的“正当法律程序”权利，以及第十四修正案赋予的“法律平等保护”权利。正当程序意味着政府在对个人采取行动时必须遵循公正的程序。难题在于，在特定案件中，如何确定应适用何种程序。如果某人被指控犯有可处决的罪行，此事显然比威胁终止社会保障福利更为严重，因此，在这种情况下，宪法会施加更多程序要求。然而，确定某人何时有权获得正当程序以及需要哪些程序，通常是一个更为复杂的问题。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Process rights include the right to “due process of law,” found in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and the right to “equal protection of the laws,” from the Fourteenth Amendment. Due process means that the government must follow fair procedures in taking action with respect to an individual. The difficult question is figuring out what process is due in a particular case. If someone is charged with a crime for which he or she could be executed, the matter is obviously more serious than the threatened termination of Social Security benefits, so the Constitution in that instance would impose more procedural requirements. Often, though, determining when someone is entitled to due process and what procedures are required is a more complex issue.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>自二十世纪中叶以来，平等保护的宪法性法律得到了极大的扩展，首先是民权运动的结果，其次是因为少数族裔以外的群体成员（例如妇女、少数族裔群体和同性恋者）要求平等对待。平等保护要求政府平等对待处境相似的人；例如，正如最高法院在<em class="calibre8">“布朗诉教育委员会案”</em>中所裁定的，一个州不能通过将黑人儿童与白人儿童送往不同的学校来对他们进行不平等对待。这在我们看来似乎是显而易见的，但大多数平等保护主张都更具争议性。谁有权获得平等保护：西班牙裔？同性恋？超重者？愚蠢的人？平等对待不同的人和不同的群体意味着什么？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The constitutional law of equal protection has expanded greatly since the middle of the twentieth century, first as a result of the civil rights movement and then because of claims for equal treatment from members of groups other than racial minorities, such as women, ethnic groups, and gays. Equal protection requires that the government treat similarly situated people the same; for example, as the Supreme Court held in <em class="calibre8">Brown v. Board of Education</em>, a state can’t treat black children unequally by sending them to separate schools from white children. That seems obvious to us now, but most equal protection claims are more controversial. Who is entitled to equal protection: Hispanics? Gays? Overweight people? Stupid people? And what does it mean to treat different people and different groups equally?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>实体权利比程序权利更加多样化，但从非常普遍的层面来看，它们可以被描述为服务于一两个目的。一个目的是允许人们充分参与社会事务，包括政治进程。例如，言论自由和新闻自由有助于开放的政治话语和民主政府。另一个目的是允许人们保护<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_51" class="calibre4"></a>他们的福祉和人格尊严，以及发展和表达他们的个性。言论自由也允许个人表达，例如，选择和信奉自己宗教的权利可以促进个人成长。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Substantive rights are more varied than process rights, but at a very general level, they can be described as serving one or two purposes. One purpose is allowing people to participate fully in the affairs of society, including the political process. For example, freedom of speech and freedom of the press contribute to open political discourse and democratic government. The other purpose is allowing people to protect <a class="calibre4"></a>their well-being and personal integrity and to develop and express their individuality. Freedom of speech also permits personal expression, for example, and the right to choose and practice one’s own religion furthers personal growth.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在讨论具体权利的细节之前，关于宪法权利的一般性还有一点需要注意：《权利法案》（前十条修正案）在宪法通过后不久就被添加到宪法中，作为进一步保护个人免受新近强大的联邦政府威胁的一种手段。根据其条款和当时的普遍理解，《权利法案》仅保护人们免受联邦政府而非各州行为的侵害。内战后，第十三、第十四和第十五修正案被添加到宪法中；这些修正案废除了奴隶制，保障了投票权，保障了平等保护，并将正当程序要求扩展至各州。尽管这些修正案本身并未明确其条款与《权利法案》中所表达的自由之间的关系，但最终最高法院采取了一种被称为<em class="calibre8">“选择性纳入”</em>的方法。第十四修正案并非将《权利法案》中的所有保护条款全部应用于各州；相反，法院会审查每一项条款，并选择性地将最重要的条款纳入第十四修正案。法院达成的标准是采用“根植于我们人民的传统和良知之中，并被视为根本原则的正义原则……[并且]隐含在有序自由的概念之中”。根据这一标准，法院最终将《权利法案》的几乎所有条款都纳入了《第十四修正案》，从而使其对各州具有约束力。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One other note about constitutional rights in general before turning to the details of particular rights: The Bill of Rights—the first ten amendments—was added to the Constitution shortly after its adoption as a means of further protecting individuals against the threat of the newly powerful federal government. By its terms and under the common understanding of the time, the Bill of Rights protected people only against actions of the federal government, not the states. After the Civil War the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments were added to the Constitution; these abolished slavery, ensured voting rights, guaranteed equal protection, and extended due process requirements to the states. Although the amendments did not themselves state the relationship between their provisions and the freedoms expressed in the Bill of Rights, eventually the Supreme Court adopted an approach known as <em class="calibre8">selective incorporation</em>. The Fourteenth Amendment does not apply all of the Bill of Rights protections to the states wholesale; instead, the Court examines each provision and selectively incorporates the most important ones into the Fourteenth Amendment. The standard the Court arrived at was to adopt “principle[s]‌ of justice so rooted in the tradition and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental...[and] implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” Applying this standard, the Court eventually brought nearly all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights into the Fourteenth Amendment and so rendered them binding on the states.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0009_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-3-div1-3"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0011" class="calibre1">什么是正当程序？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0011" class="calibre1">What Is Due Process?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">适用于联邦政府的第五修正案规定：“未经正当法律程序，任何人不得被剥夺生命、自由或财产。” 第十四修正案则补充道：“任何州也不得未经正当法律程序，剥夺任何人的生命、自由或财产。” 这两个条款中的大多数关键术语——“自由”、“财产”和“正当法律程序”——都比较模糊。我们需要了解历史、文化和司法权威，并广泛探讨我们社会的价值观，才能理解其含义。但通过阅读文本本身，我们可以开始理解正当法律程序条款。</p><p class="noindent">The Fifth Amendment, which applies to the federal government, states that “No person shall...be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” The Fourteenth Amendment adds “nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.” Most of the key terms in these two clauses—“liberty,” “property,” and “due process”—are vague. A knowledge of history, culture, and judicial authority, and extensive debate about the values of our society, are needed to get us close to a meaning. But by reading the text itself we can begin to understand the due process clauses.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>正当程序条款表明，每个人都享有“生命、自由或财产”的权利。除非遵守“正当法律程序”，否则政府不得剥夺任何这些权利。这<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_52" class="calibre4"></a>这一概念既包含对政府行为的禁止，也暗含着对政府行为的授权。这些条款虽然含糊不清，却明确规定了政府不得做什么——未经正当程序剥夺他人的生命、自由或财产。它们也暗示了政府可以做什么——在经过正当程序的情况下剥夺他人的生命、自由或财产。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The due process clauses suggest that all persons have rights to something known as “life, liberty, or property.” The government cannot take away any of those rights unless it observes “due process of law.” This <a class="calibre4"></a>concept contains both a prohibition on government action and by implication an authorization of government action. The clauses explicitly, if vaguely, state what the government cannot do—deprive someone of life, liberty, or property without due process. They also imply what the government can do—deprive someone of life, liberty, or property if it does so with due process.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这一点显而易见，却又至关重要。我们知道，政府可以剥夺某人的生命、自由和财产。一个州可以监禁罪犯，没收其枪支和逃跑车辆，甚至处决他。政府拥有巨大的权力——甚至可以左右其人民的生死。但这种权力受到正当程序条款的限制。例如，在监禁某人之前，政府必须允许被告进行公正审判、享有上诉权，并在需要时为其提供律师。正当程序旨在确保政府政策和法治得到公正、一致的执行。（刑事诉讼中的正当程序要求将在<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.n0115" href="#text/part0015_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-9" class="calibre4">第九章</a>讨论。）</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This is obvious but important. We know that the government can deprive someone of life, liberty, and property. A state can imprison a criminal, confiscate his gun and his getaway car, and even execute him. The government has tremendous power—even over the life and death of its people. But the power is limited by the due process clauses. Before it imprisons someone, for example, the government must allow a fair trial, a right of appeal, and an attorney for the accused if he needs one. Due process is designed to ensure that government policies and rules of law are carried out fairly and consistently. (Due process requirements in criminal proceedings are discussed in <a href="#text/part0015_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-9" class="calibre4">Chapter 9</a>.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>正如我们对这些条款的初步解读所示，在主张正当程序权利时，会出现两个问题。首先，所主张的权益是否属于第五修正案或第十四修正案保护范围内的生命权、自由权或财产权？其次，如果该权利值得保护，那么它能获得多少保护——也就是说，它应该获得多少正当程序？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As our initial reading of the clauses indicates, there are two issues that arise when a right of due process is asserted. First, is the interest asserted a right to life, liberty, or property that is within the protection of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment? Second, if the right is worthy of protection, how much protection does it get—that is, how much process is due?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>虽然生命权在正当程序条款的解释中并未占据重要地位，但自由权和财产权却占据了更大的比重。生命权<em class="calibre8">最常</em>出现在死刑案件中。堕胎案件中也隐含着生命权。例如，在<em class="calibre8">罗诉韦德</em>案中，最高法院裁定，胎儿不属于正当程序条款所定义的“人”，因为宪法中使用的“人”一词并不指胎儿。因此，胎儿不享有正当程序权利。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>While life has not figured much in interpretations of the due process clauses, liberty and property have to a much greater degree. The right to <em class="calibre8">life</em> arises most often in death penalty cases. It also figures by implication in abortion cases. In <em class="calibre8">Roe v. Wade</em>, for example, the Supreme Court held that a fetus is not a person within the meaning of the due process clauses because as used in the Constitution the term “person” does not refer to a fetus. Thus a fetus does not have due process rights.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">宪法意义上的自由</em>显然包括人身自由，因此它限制了政府因犯罪而监禁他人的能力。除了监禁之外，自由还包括人身约束。当国家试图将儿童从其父母的监护中移除并宣布为国家监护人，或将精神病患者送入精神病院时，它就试图限制他们的自由，而正当程序条款要求其在这样做时遵守公平的程序。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">Liberty</em> in the constitutional sense obviously includes physical freedom, so it limits the ability of the government to imprison people for crimes. Liberty also includes physical restraints besides incarceration in prison. When the state seeks to have a child removed from the custody of its parents and declared a ward of the state or to commit a mentally ill person to a psychiatric institution, it is attempting to restrain their liberty, and the due process clauses require that it observe fair procedures in doing so.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>宪法自由还包括从事身体活动以外的活动的自由。最高法院表示，就正当程序而言，自由不仅指免受身体束缚的自由，还指个人签订契约、从事任何常见职业、获取有用知识、<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_53" class="calibre4"></a>结婚、建立家庭、养育孩子，按照自己良心的指引敬拜上帝，并且普遍享受那些长期以来被认可的……对自由人有序追求幸福至关重要的特权”（载于1972 年的<em class="calibre8">Board of Regents 诉 Roth 案</em>，引自1923 年的<em class="calibre8">Meyer v. Nebraska</em>案）。因此，如果一个州希望将孩子从其父母身边带走，那么该孩子就有自由权益，因为他或她将被安置在寄养家庭或州立家庭中，而父母也有自由权益，即对家庭自主权的权益。同样，如果一个州想要吊销医生、律师甚至汽车驾驶员的执照，它必须遵循正当程序。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Constitutional liberty also includes the freedom to engage in activities besides physical movement. The Supreme Court has said that liberty, for due process purposes, denotes “not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to <a class="calibre4"></a>marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized...as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men” (in <em class="calibre8">Board of Regents v. Roth</em>, 1972, quoting <em class="calibre8">Meyer v. Nebraska</em>, 1923). Thus if a state wishes to take a child away from its parents, the child has a liberty interest because he or she will be placed in foster care or a state home, and the parents also have a liberty interest, the interest in the autonomy of their family. Similarly, if a state wants to revoke the license of a doctor, a lawyer, or even an automobile driver, it must follow due process.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">财产</em>显然包括有形财产。政府未经公平程序不得使用或扣押您的财产。财产权也受到第五修正案的保护，该修正案规定政府不得在未获得<em class="calibre8">公正补偿的情况下征用您的财产。政府在</em><em class="calibre8">行使征用</em>权时，可以征用您的财产并将其用于公共目的，例如在您的土地上修建高速公路，但必须举行听证会并支付土地费用。（征用权将在<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.n0116" href="#text/part0013_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-7" class="calibre4">第七章</a>讨论。）</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">Property</em> obviously includes tangible property. The government cannot use or seize your property without a fair procedure. Property rights also are protected by the Fifth Amendment’s mandate that the government may not take property without <em class="calibre8">just compensation</em>. In the exercise of its power of <em class="calibre8">eminent domain</em>, the government can condemn your property and take it for a public purpose, such as when building a highway through your land, but it must provide a hearing and it must pay for the land. (Eminent domain is discussed in <a href="#text/part0013_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-7" class="calibre4">Chapter 7</a>.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>财产通常指那些值得拥有的重要事物，包括无形财产。例如，州政府雇员是否因其工作而拥有财产权益，或者社会保障残疾救济金的领取者是否因其福利而拥有财产权益，从而产生正当程序权利？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Property ordinarily means things that are important to own, including intangible property. Does a state employee have a property interest in her job, for example, or a recipient of Social Security disability payments a property interest in his benefits, that give rise to due process rights?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在20世纪60年代和70年代，人们越来越清楚地认识到，社会中许多最重要的事物不再以物质形式存在，而是政府创造的无形利益：执照、福利计划、公共合同、政府工作等等。在1970年的<em class="calibre8">戈德堡诉凯利案（Goldberg v. Kelly）</em>中，最高法院裁定，纽约州不能在未事先为福利领取者提供证据听证的情况下终止其福利。在其他案件中，法院裁定，囚犯在特定条件下获得假释的利益、州立大学教授继续就业的利益以及客户对公用事业公司持续服务的期望，均构成足以触发正当程序保护的财产利益。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the 1960s and 1970s it became more apparent that many of the most important things in society no longer took a physical form but were intangible interests created by the government: licenses, entitlement programs, public contracts, government jobs, and so on. In a 1970 case, <em class="calibre8">Goldberg v. Kelly</em>, the Supreme Court held that New York could not terminate a welfare recipient’s benefits without first providing him an evidentiary hearing. In other cases the Court held that a prisoner’s interest in being granted parole on specified conditions, a state college professor’s interest in continued employment, and customers’ expectation of continued service by a public utility were all sufficient property interests to trigger due process protections.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，在20世纪70年代中期开始的一系列案件中，法院限制了这种分析的扩展可能性。只有在某人拥有权利的情况下才需要正当程序，而权利的定义是已经拥有的事物，与对未来利益的期望不同。因此，囚犯在决定其是否有资格获得假释时，没有正当程序权利，尽管如果州政府试图撤销已授予的假释，他可能拥有正当程序权利。为了确定某事是权利还是期望，<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_54" class="calibre4"></a>法院会首先考虑最初产生该利益的州法律。因此，学生有权在被停学前获得听证，因为根据州法律，学生应该上学；但如果州法律将政府雇员继续就业的权利定义为仅仅是期望，那么政府雇员在被解雇前可能没有正当程序的听证权。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In a series of cases beginning in the mid-1970s, however, the Court limited the expansive possibilities of this analysis. Due process is required only where someone has an entitlement, and an entitlement is defined as something already possessed, as distinguished from an expectation of future benefit. Thus a prisoner does not have a due process right in determining whether he is eligible for parole, although he may have a due process right if the state attempts to revoke a parole already granted. To decide whether something was an entitlement or an expectation, the <a class="calibre4"></a>Court would look to the state law that created the interest in the first place. Therefore, a student has a right to a hearing before being suspended from school because under state law students are expected to attend school, but a government employee may not have a due process right to a hearing before being fired if the state law defines his right of continued employment as a mere expectation.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>假设某人拥有生命、自由或财产权益，那么在正当程序分析中出现的第二个问题是，在政府侵犯该权益之前，应进行何种程序。按照英美传统，律师在正当程序方面首先想到的就是审判。因此，赋予某人正当程序的范例类似于审判，包括事项通知、提供证据和论据的机会、盘问证人或以其他方式质疑政府证据的机会、由律师代理的权利，以及由一位公正的决策者为其决策提供理由。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Assuming that someone has a life, liberty, or property interest, the second issue that arises in due process analysis is what process is due before the government can infringe that interest. In the Anglo American tradition, the first thing lawyers think of in terms of due process is a trial. The paradigm for giving someone due process is, therefore, something that looks like a trial, including notice of the issues, a chance to present evidence and arguments, the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses or otherwise dispute the government’s evidence, the right to be represented by an attorney, and an impartial decision maker who will give reasons for her decision.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>但宪法是否应该要求每次援引正当程序条款时都进行类似审判的程序？在撤销社会保障福利、停学或判处死罪时，正当程序的价值是否同样重要，以至于在每起案件中，受影响的人都有权获得全面审判、聘请律师和上诉？此外，还有效率方面的考虑；如果政府每次涉及自由或财产利益时都必须进行全面审判，那么整个体系就会陷入瘫痪。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But should a trial-like proceeding be constitutionally required every time the due process clauses are invoked? Are the due process values equally important in the revocation of Social Security benefits, a suspension from school, or a capital crime, so that in each case the person affected is entitled to a full trial, a lawyer, and an appeal? There is also a concern for efficiency; if the government had to provide a full trial every time it affected a liberty or property interest, the system would grind to a halt.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">在1976年的马修斯诉埃尔德里</em>奇案中，最高法院定义了一个三因素平衡测试，以确定在特定情况下需要多少程序。首先，受政府行动影响的人的利益是什么？利益越强烈，所需的程序就越多；一个可能被无限期强制送入精神病院的精神疾病患者比一个驾照被吊销三个月的司机有权享受更多的程序，而后者又比一个被停学三天的学生有权享受更多的程序。其次，做出错误决定的风险有多大？扩大程序范围能将这种风险降低多少？在没有事实需要裁定的情况下——例如，第三次定罪后自动吊销驾照——额外的程序不会有太大帮助，但如果许多事实和法律问题存在争议——例如，司机是否醉酒——更多的程序可以降低出错的风险。第三，政府在采取受质疑的行动中有多重要，包括使用更广泛程序所需的行政或财政负担？为……提供全面审判<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_55" class="calibre4"></a>社会保障福利状况的每一次变化都会给联邦政府带来巨大的成本。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In <em class="calibre8">Mathews v. Eldridge</em> (1976), the Supreme Court defined a three-factor balancing test to determine how much procedure is required in a given situation. First, what is the interest of the person who will be affected by the government action? The stronger the interest, the more process is required; a mentally ill person who may be involuntarily committed to a mental institution for an indefinite period is entitled to more procedure than a driver whose license is being suspended for three months—who is, in turn, entitled to more procedure than a student who is being suspended from school for three days. Second, how great is the risk of making an erroneous decision, and how much would that risk be reduced by expanding the procedures? In cases in which no facts are left to be decided—the automatic suspension of a driver’s license after a third conviction, for example—additional procedures would not be of much help, but where many facts and legal issues are in dispute—say, whether a driver was intoxicated—more procedures would reduce the risk of error. Third, how important is the government’s interest in taking the challenged action, including the administrative or financial burden required to use more extensive procedures? Providing a full trial for <a class="calibre4"></a>every change in Social Security benefits status would impose a huge cost on the federal government.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>考虑一下这项检验标准如何适用于学校处罚学生的情况。假设俄亥俄州哥伦布市一所高中的校长，因一名学生参与了校园食堂的斗殴并损坏了学校财产，决定对他停学十天。由于俄亥俄州实行义务免费公立教育制度，这涉及到受宪法保护的财产权益，因此需要经过正当程序。但需要经过多少正当程序？校长是否仅凭目击事件发生教师的报告就可以停学？校长是否还需要了解学生的陈述？或者学生是否有权获得包括律师代理在内的全面听证？该程序是否必须在学生被停学之前进行，还是在停学决定做出后进行复审就足够了？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Consider how this test applies in the case of schools punishing their students. Suppose the principal of a Columbus, Ohio, high school wants to suspend a student for ten days for being involved in a lunchroom fracas that damaged school property. Because Ohio has created a system of compulsory and free public education, a constitutionally protected property interest is involved, and therefore due process is required. But how much process is due? Is the principal allowed to suspend the student simply on the report of a teacher who witnessed the events, does the principal also have to get the student’s side of the story, or is the student entitled to a full hearing including being represented by a lawyer? Does the procedure have to come before the student is suspended, or is it enough that there is a review of the decision after it is made?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最高法院在<em class="calibre8">戈斯诉洛佩兹案</em>（1975年）中处理了这些问题。由于上学的重要性以及停学带来的耻辱感，学生在未经公正认定的正当理由的情况下被停学，对其利益至关重要。即使是出于善意行事的校长，如果只听取了学生的一面之词，而没有给予学生反驳指控或解释其行为的机会，也可能会犯错。校长在决定停学之前，先把学生叫来并要求解释，并不会造成太多的延误或费用；然而，要求进行全面听证会会给学校管理人员带来不必要的费用和负担。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Supreme Court addressed these issues in <em class="calibre8">Goss v. Lopez</em> (1975). Because of the importance of attending school and the stigma attached to suspension, the student has an important interest in not being suspended without a good reason that has been fairly determined. Even principals acting in good faith can make mistakes if they act after hearing only one side of the story and without giving the student an opportunity to rebut the charges or explain his conduct. It does not cause much delay or expense for the principal to call the student in and ask for an explanation before meting out a suspension; requiring a full hearing, however, would impose undue expense and burden on school administrators.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，在某些情况下，甚至连这么繁琐的程序都不需要。如果老师想因为学生在课堂上表现不好而对其进行留校处分，她是否必须先给他一个陈述意见的机会？当然不需要。有时，还需要更多程序。如果学校想让学生停学一整个学年，那么学生上学和防止错误判决的利益就更大，因此需要更全面的程序，甚至可能包括一场审判式的听证会，让学生有机会由律师代理，并出示和盘问证人。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In some cases, however, even this much process is not due. If a teacher wants to give a student detention for acting up in class, does she have to provide him with an opportunity to be heard first? Of course not. And sometimes more process is due. If the school wants to suspend the student for an entire school year, the student’s interest in attending school and in preventing an erroneous decision is much greater, so a fuller process is required, perhaps even including a trial-type hearing with the opportunity to be represented by counsel and to present and cross-examine witnesses.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0009_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-3-div1-4"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0012" class="calibre1">宪法是否要求人人受到平等对待？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0012" class="calibre1">Does Constitutional Law Require That Everyone Be Treated Equally?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">不，它没有。但它确实保障每个人“受到法律的平等保护”。这有什么区别呢？</p><p class="noindent">No, it doesn’t. But it does guarantee everyone “equal protection of the laws.” What’s the difference?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第十四修正案最初是在重建时期通过的，目的是处理南方奴隶制的残余问题，该修正案禁止各州“拒绝给予其管辖范围内的任何人法律的平等保护”。（该修正案通过后，平等保护原则适用于<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_56" class="calibre4"></a>对国家政府的平等保护被纳入了第五修正案的正当程序条款。）自20世纪中叶以来，平等保护条款一直是权利大幅扩张的源泉。民权运动及其引发的其他反歧视斗争主要以平等保护条款为基础展开。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Fourteenth Amendment, originally adopted during Reconstruction to deal with the vestiges of slavery in the South, forbids a state to “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” (After the amendment’s adoption an equal protection principle applying <a class="calibre4"></a>to the national government was read into the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.) The equal protection clause has been the source of a tremendous expansion of rights since the middle of the twentieth century. The civil rights movement and the other antidiscrimination battles it spawned have been litigated primarily on the basis of the equal protection clause.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>平等保护条款在三个方面并不能保证每个人都受到绝对平等的对待。首先，与所有其他宪法条款一样，平等保护条款限制的是政府歧视，而不是私人歧视。宪法禁止州歧视黑人，但州政府无权管辖私人行为；白人至上主义团体并没有宪法义务接纳黑人成员。然而，平等保护条款确实间接地规范了私人行为。当私人行使政府赋予或执行的权利时，法院会将其视为州政府本身的行为。例如，在1948年的<em class="calibre8">雪莱诉克雷默</em>案中，一位土地所有者起诉要求执行其邻居契约中的一项限制性契约，该契约禁止将邻居的房屋出售给黑人；由于任何执行该契约的法院判决都将构成违反平等保护条款的歧视性“州政府行为”，因此该房主实际上被禁止从事歧视性行为。此外，许多私人和企业的行为都受到州和联邦民权法的约束。为了进一步贯彻第十四修正案的平等原则，州立法机构和国会颁布了法律，禁止在招聘、提供餐厅等公共场所等方面基于种族、性别、国籍或其他原因的歧视。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In three respects, the equal protection clause does not guarantee that everyone be treated absolutely equally. First, like all other constitutional provisions, the equal protection clause limits government discrimination but not private discrimination. The Constitution prohibits a state from discriminating against black people, but it has no power over the actions of private individuals; a white supremacist group is not constitutionally required to admit black members. However, the equal protection clause does indirectly regulate private conduct. When a private person exercises a right created or enforced by the government, the Court will view it as if the state itself were acting. In <em class="calibre8">Shelley v. Kraemer</em> (1948), for example, a landowner sued to enforce a restrictive covenant in his neighbor’s deed that prohibited the sale of the neighbor’s home to a black person; the homeowner was effectively prevented from engaging in the discriminatory behavior because any court decision enforcing the covenant would constitute discriminatory “state action” in violation of the equal protection clause. Also, many actions of private individuals and businesses are controlled by state and federal civil rights laws. To further the equality principle of the Fourteenth Amendment, state legislatures and Congress have enacted laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, gender, national origin, or some other bases in hiring, in providing access to public accommodations such as restaurants, and so on.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">其次，“法律的</em>平等保护”意味着政府在通过法律、制定项目或开展活动时，必须根据相关法律平等对待民众。但政府无需费力地启动旨在纠正民众所遭受不平等待遇的项目。例如，政府不得基于种族进行歧视，但宪法并未要求政府制定立法来纠正私人歧视（尽管国会已经这样做了）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Second, “equal protection <em class="calibre8">of the laws</em>” means that when the government passes a law, creates a program, or engages in an activity, it must treat people equally under the relevant law. But the government does not have to go out of its way to initiate programs that would correct inequalities that people otherwise suffer. The government may not discriminate on the basis of race, for example, but it is not constitutionally required to enact legislation to cure private discrimination (although Congress has done so anyway).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第三，也是最重要的一点，如果政府有正当理由，它可以通过将人们分成不同的群体并区别对待来“歧视”他们。如果你在65岁退休，你可以领取社会保障福利，但如果你45岁退休，你就不能领取。州立大学对州内居民收取的学费比对州外居民收取的学费要低。州政府和联邦政府在其开展的每一项活动中都会做出类似的区分，对个人或群体区别对待。平等<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_57" class="calibre4"></a>保护条款并不要求政府平等对待所有人，但它确实要求政府<em class="calibre8">平等对待所有处境</em>相似的人。出于平等保护的目的，这意味着相关个人或群体在相关政府政策方面必须处于大致相同的地位。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Third, and most important, the government can “discriminate” by putting people into groups and treating the groups differently if it has a legitimate reason for doing so. If you retire at age sixty-five you collect Social Security benefits, but if you retire at age forty-five you don’t. A state university charges lower tuition to state residents than to out-of-staters. State and federal governments make these kinds of distinctions in every activity they perform, treating people or groups differently. The equal <a class="calibre4"></a>protection clause does not require that the government treat everybody the same, but it does require that the government treat everyone who is <em class="calibre8">similarly situated</em> the same. For equal protection purposes, this means that the people or groups in question must be in about the same position with respect to the relevant government policy.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>请记住，宪法的基本问题是赋予政府足够的权力，同时限制其行使。平等保护条款规定了一种特定的限制。我们希望政府能够促进公共利益，这就要求政府使用有利于某些人、不利于另一些人的分类方法。但我们不希望这些优缺点基于不利于公共利益或道德上令人反感的特征来分配。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Remember that the basic issue of constitutional law is giving the government enough power while setting limits on the exercise of that power. The equal protection clause prescribes a particular kind of limit. We want the government to be able to further the public interest, and that requires it to use classifications that advantage some people and disadvantage others. But we don’t want those advantages and disadvantages to be distributed on the basis of characteristics that do not advance the public interest or that are morally repugnant.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>当政府政策歧视少数群体时，对政府行为进行此类限制的必要性尤为明显。在我们的体制下，多数人统治，但不能过度；选举多数可以将自己的意愿强加于少数群体，但当其造成特别不利、剥夺权力或污名化的影响时，则不能这样做。例如，建立种族隔离学校，并不能促进为所有儿童提供良好公共教育的目标；它破坏了这一目标，因为黑人学校往往从白人多数群体那里获得较少的资源，而且种族隔离本身就带有污名化。种族隔离学校也违背了我们对公平和平等的理念；学术成绩甚至财富都会影响孩子就读哪种类型的学校，但种族不应该与此有任何关系。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The need for this kind of limit on government action is particularly apparent where government policy discriminates against a minority group. Under our system, the majority rules, but not too much; electoral majorities can impose their will on minorities, but not when it has a particularly disadvantageous, disempowering, or stigmatizing effect. Creating racially segregated schools, for example, didn’t advance the purpose of providing a good public education for all children; it undermined that purpose because of the tendency of the black schools to receive inferior resources from the white majority and because of the stigma attached to racial segregation. Segregated schools also offended our notions of fairness and equality; academic merit or even wealth can affect what kind of school a child attends, but race shouldn’t have anything to do with it.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>由于法院是被授权执行平等保护条款的政府机构，情况变得更加复杂。如果法院在基于平等保护的立法审查方面过于激进，它们可能会变得权力过大，因为它们会侵犯立法机构的权限，自行判断哪些分类最能满足公众需求。如果法院过于顺从立法机构的判断，它们就无法履行提供平等保护的宪法义务，反而会让其他部门权力过大。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The picture is further complicated because the courts are the government institution authorized to enforce the equal protection clause. If the courts are too aggressive in reviewing legislation on equal protection grounds, they can become too powerful, by invading the province of the legislature and making judgments about which classifications best serve public needs. If they are too deferential to legislative judgments, they fail in their constitutional duty to provide equal protection and they allow the other branches to become too powerful.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最高法院对这些担忧的回应是，根据歧视的对象或内容，对某些立法决定给予更多尊重，而对其他立法决定则减少尊重。（当然，这也取决于法官的意识形态倾向以及特定时期的政治氛围。）政府对经济事务的日常监管所产生的分类并不特别可疑，只要所使用的分类在促进政府利益方面看起来合理即可。在这些情况下，法院只会给出粗略的判断。<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_58" class="calibre4"></a>法院会通过寻找分类与政府利益之间的<em class="calibre8">合理关系</em>进行审查，并可能维持该项目。另一方面，有些分类被认为特别可疑——例如，那些基于种族、国籍或其他<em class="calibre8">可疑群体</em>进行歧视的分类，或者那些妨碍行使宪法基本权利（如言论自由）的分类。在这些情况下，法院将特别严格地审查立法上的区别（称为<em class="calibre8">严格审查</em>），并可能使其无效。如果案件介于两者之间，法院的审查也将如此，恰当地称为<em class="calibre8">中级审查</em>。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Supreme Court responds to these concerns by giving more deference to some legislative decisions and less to others, depending on who or what is being discriminated against. (And, of course, depending on the ideological orientations of the justices and the political atmosphere at a given time.) Classifications that arise out of ordinary government regulation of economic affairs are not particularly suspicious, as long as the classification used seems reasonable in light of the government interest to be advanced. In those cases the Court will give only a cursory <a class="calibre4"></a>review by looking for a <em class="calibre8">rational relationship</em> between the classification and the government interest and probably will uphold the program. On the other hand, some classifications have been regarded as especially suspicious—those that discriminate on the basis of race, national origin, or some other <em class="calibre8">suspect class</em>, for example, or that burden the exercise of a constitutionally fundamental right such as free speech. In those cases the Court will take an especially hard look at the legislative distinction (called <em class="calibre8">strict scrutiny</em>) and probably invalidate it. If the case lies somewhere in between, so will the Court’s review, called, appropriately, <em class="calibre8">intermediate review</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>理性关系测试适用于大多数普通的经济或监管立法。政府的职能之一是监管各种经济事务，从监管广告到提供退休福利。在制定这些法规时，立法机关（以及行政部门在执行立法时）必须对不同群体进行分类（例如，在65岁时划定退休福利的界限）。如果法院在每个案件中都对立法或行政判决进行事后审查，司法部门实际上将成为政府中最强大的部门。然而，最高法院的结论是，在根据平等保护条款审查此类普通立法时，其任务仅限于提出两个问题：该立法是否旨在实现合法的政府目标？它是否与实现该目标存在理性关联？如果这两个问题的答案都是“是”，则该立法符合平等保护条款。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The rational relationship test is applied to most ordinary economic or regulatory legislation. One of the functions of government is to regulate all sorts of economic affairs, from controlling advertising to providing retirement benefits. In making these regulations, the legislature (and the executive branch in carrying out legislation) must make classifications between groups (such as drawing a line at age sixty-five for retirement benefits). If the courts were to second-guess the legislative or executive judgments in each of those cases, the judicial branch would in effect become the most powerful branch of the government. Instead, the Supreme Court has concluded that in reviewing ordinary legislation like this under the equal protection clause, its task is limited to asking two questions: Is the legislation directed at a legitimate government objective? Is it rationally related to achieving that objective? If the answer to both questions is “yes,” the legislation complies with the equal protection clause.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>实际上，当法院应用合理关系测试时，通常会支持受质疑的政府行为。法院认为，立法机关有权享有极大的尊重，以决定在制定此类普通立法时，哪些分类是合适的。因此，法院通常会接受甚至推断立法的合法目的，并且只要求立法目的与所使用的分类之间具有最低限度的联系。少数例外情况涉及分类表现出“对受影响人群的敌意”的案件，正如法院在<em class="calibre8">罗默诉埃文斯案</em>（1996）中所述。例如，在该案中，法院裁定科罗拉多州宪法的一项修正案无效，该修正案禁止州或地方政府制定法律保护男女同性恋和双性恋免受歧视，因为该修正案“将同性恋者分类不是为了促进正当的立法目的，而是为了使他们与其他人不平等……一个州不能因此将某一类人视为其法律的局外人。”</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As a practical matter, when the Court applies the rational relationship test it usually upholds the challenged government action. In the Court’s view, the legislature is entitled to tremendous deference to decide what classifications are appropriate in enacting ordinary legislation of this sort. Accordingly, the Court typically accepts or even infers a legitimate end for legislation and requires only the most minimal connection between the end and the classification used. The few exceptions involve cases in which the classification demonstrates “animosity toward the class of persons affected,” as the Court said in <em class="calibre8">Romer v. Evans</em> (1996). In that case, for example, the Court invalidated an amendment to the Colorado constitution prohibiting state or local governments from enacting laws to protect gays, lesbians, and bisexuals from discrimination, because the amendment “classifies homosexuals not to further a proper legislative end but to make them unequal to everyone else....A State cannot so deem a class of persons a stranger to its laws.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>与理性关系测试相反的是<em class="calibre8">严格审查</em>。第十四修正案的平等原则有两个核心领域<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_59" class="calibre4"></a>适用范围：当政府行动针对<em class="calibre8">可疑群体</em>（例如该修正案原本旨在保护的非裔美国人）或政府行动以歧视性方式侵犯<em class="calibre8">基本权利</em>时，法院将进行<em class="calibre8">严格审查，</em>以审查该行动是否符合平等保护条款。法院不会将裁决权交给其他政府部门，而是自行决定该分类是否为促进政府实现其迫切目标所必需。大多数情况下，当法院采用严格审查时，受质疑的政府行动将被裁定无效。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The opposite of the rational relationship test is <em class="calibre8">strict scrutiny</em>. The equality principle of the Fourteenth Amendment has two core areas <a class="calibre4"></a>of application: When government action is directed against a <em class="calibre8">suspect class</em>, such as African Americans whom the amendment originally was intended to protect, or when government action invades a <em class="calibre8">fundamental right</em> in a discriminatory manner, the Court will engage in <em class="calibre8">strict scrutiny</em> in reviewing the action’s compliance with the equal protection clause. Instead of deferring to the other branches of government, the Court will determine for itself whether the classification is necessary to promote a compelling governmental objective. Most of the time, when the Court uses strict scrutiny the challenged government action is held invalid.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>历史最悠久的可疑分类当然是种族以及类似的类别，例如国籍。当政府的一项行动基于种族区分人们时，鉴于奴隶制和种族主义的历史，该行动本身就值得怀疑。因此，法院将仔细审查该行动，以确定种族分类是否真的有必要实现令人信服的政府目标，并且几乎总是会裁定这种分类无效。事实上，只有在臭名昭著的日裔美国人拘留案中，最高法院才支持对少数族裔的明确歧视，该案允许政府在二战期间将日裔美国人从太平洋沿岸各州驱逐出境，并将他们关押在拘留营中。（20世纪80年代，战争结束几十年后，那些因违反拘留令而被定罪的日裔美国人被撤销了定罪，国会也为此行动正式道歉。）</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The suspect classifications with the longest history are, of course, race and similar categories such as national origin. When a government action distinguishes people on the basis of their race, the action is inherently suspect in light of the history of slavery and racism. Accordingly, the Court will closely examine the action to see if the racial classification is really necessary to achieve a compelling government objective and will almost always invalidate such a classification. Indeed, only in the notorious Japanese internment cases did the Supreme Court uphold an explicit discrimination against minority races, where it permitted the government to remove Japanese Americans from the Pacific Coast states during World War II and imprison them in internment camps. (In the 1980s, several decades after the war had ended, the Japanese Americans who had been convicted of violating the internment orders had their convictions vacated, and Congress issued an official apology for the action.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>当政府分类歧视宪法基本利益时，也会进行严格审查。一些基本利益在宪法本身中有明确规定，例如言论自由权；法院发现其他基本利益隐含在宪法框架中，例如从一个州到另一个州的旅行权。当政府分类给某些人行使基本利益带来负担时，法院将严格审查该分类，以确定其是否为实现令人信服的政府利益所必需。如果不是——大多数情况下并非如此——该分类将被视为违反平等保护条款。例如，法院认为，投票（<em class="calibre8">Dunn v. Blumstein</em>，1972 年）和领取福利（<em class="calibre8">Shapiro v. Thompson</em>，1969 年）需要居住一年的要求对旅行权造成了不当负担，因此裁定其无效。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Strict scrutiny also is applied when a government classification discriminates against a constitutionally fundamental interest. Some fundamental interests are expressed in the Constitution itself, such as the right to free speech; others have been found by the Court to be implicit in the constitutional scheme, such as the right to travel from state to state. When a government classification burdens some people in the exercise of a fundamental interest, the Court will strictly scrutinize the classification to determine if it is necessary to achieve a compelling government interest. If it is not—and in most cases it is not—the classification is held to violate the equal protection clause. For example, the Court has invalidated, as undue burdens on the right to travel, one-year residency requirements for voting (<em class="calibre8">Dunn v. Blumstein</em>, 1972) and for receiving welfare benefits (<em class="calibre8">Shapiro v. Thompson</em>, 1969).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最后，有些分类不像可疑分类那样令人反感，但至少值得怀疑；还有些利益不具备基本利益的宪法地位，但仍然很重要。这些中间的分类和利益自然会引发中间级别的审查。在本案中，法院不审查政府与……之间的关系。<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_60" class="calibre4"></a>最高法院认为，性别歧视与受质疑的分类之间的界限不像对待可疑阶级或基本利益那样紧密，也不像对待普通的经济监管那样恭敬。基于性别的分类是中间阶级的典型例子；最高法院认为，性别歧视并不像种族歧视那样招致谴责或有压迫的历史，但它仍然值得怀疑，需要比普通的立法分类进行更仔细的审查。由于性别歧视属于这一中间类别，因此判决结果更难以预测。例如，最高法院推翻了犹他州的一项法律，该法律规定女性十八岁成年，男性二十一岁成年，因此父母必须抚养儿子的时间比女儿更长，理由是更长的时期是为了让男性接受教育，以便他们能够更好地养家糊口（<em class="calibre8">斯坦顿诉斯坦顿案</em>，1975年）。然而，它支持加利福尼亚州的一项法规，该法规规定男性与未成年女性发生性关系构成法定强奸，尽管没有相应的条款禁止女性与未成年男性发生性关系，因为该州的利益在于防止非婚生怀孕对女性造成的独特伤害（<em class="calibre8">Michael M. v. Superior Court</em>，1981）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Finally, there are classifications that are not as invidious as suspect classifications but are at least questionable, and there are interests that do not have the constitutional status of fundamental interests but are nonetheless important. These intermediate classifications and interests provoke, naturally enough, an intermediate level of review. Here the Court does not examine the relationship between the government <a class="calibre4"></a>interest and the challenged classification as closely as it does with a suspect class or fundamental interest, nor is it as deferential as with ordinary economic regulation. Classifications based on gender are the prime example of an intermediate class; in the Court’s view, sex discrimination does not bear the opprobrium or the history of oppression of racial discrimination, but it is sufficiently questionable that it demands closer examination than ordinary legislative classifications. Because sex discrimination falls in this intermediate category, the decisions are much less predictable. For example, the Court struck down a Utah law that provided that women reached the age of majority at eighteen but men at twenty-one, so that parents had to support their sons longer than their daughters, on the basis that the longer period was designed for males to receive an education so they could better support a family (<em class="calibre8">Stanton v. Stanton</em>, 1975). However, it upheld a California statute that made it statutory rape for a male to have sexual intercourse with a minor female, even though there was no corresponding prohibition of a female to have intercourse with a minor male, because of the state’s interest in preventing the unique harm to women that follows from illegitimate pregnancies (<em class="calibre8">Michael M. v. Superior Court</em>, 1981).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这种三层结构的平等保护分析体系为这一概念提供了一个有序的开端，但仍存在一些棘手的问题。不妨考虑一下平等保护原则下近期最重要的问题之一：支持者称之为“平权行动”，反对者称之为“逆向歧视”。这些问题说起来简单，解决起来却困难：第十四修正案所体现的平等原则是否要求形式上的平等，以便政府永远不会使用种族歧视？还是说，它允许政府考虑历史和背景，进行种族区分以纠正种族不平等？平等保护条款最初是为了保护少数群体的利益而制定的。平权行动的支持者认为，采取补救措施，使传统上遭受歧视且政治上权力较小的少数群体受益，这与该条款的初衷一致，事实上，对于消除歧视的影响是必要的。此外，例如，平权行动可以增加学校的多样性，从而为少数群体学生树立榜样，并丰富每个人的教育环境，从而使每个人受益。平权行动的反对者认为，平等保护条款的正确应用是禁止一切形式的歧视，例如种族和性别等可疑类别，无论这些歧视对特定群体有利还是不利。偏袒少数群体成员的平权行动，不公平地加重了其他拥有平等权利的人的负担。<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_61" class="calibre4"></a>并没有助长歧视，而自己却成为了不公平歧视的对象。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This three-tiered scheme of equal protection analysis provides an orderly start to the concept, but tough issues remain. Consider one of the most important recent issues under equal protection doctrine: “affirmative action,” as it is called by its proponents, or “reverse discrimination,” as it is called by opponents. The issues are simple to state but difficult to solve: Does the equality principle embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment demand formal equality, so that the government may never use racial distinctions? Or does it permit the government to consider history and context to make racial distinctions to correct racial inequality? The equal protection clause originally was adopted to protect minority interests. Proponents of affirmative action argue that taking remedial measures to benefit minorities who traditionally have been discriminated against and have been less powerful politically is consistent with the clause’s original purpose and, in fact, is necessary to erase the effects of discrimination. Moreover, affirmative action that, for example, increases diversity in schools benefits everyone by providing role models for minority students and enriching the educational environment for everyone. Opponents of affirmative action argue that the proper application of the equal protection clause is to prohibit all forms of discrimination using suspect classes such as race and gender, whether they advantage or disadvantage a particular group. Affirmative action that favors members of minority groups unfairly burdens others who have <a class="calibre4"></a>not contributed to discrimination and themselves become the objects of unfair discrimination.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>像往常一样，我们可以从一些相对简单的案例开始。在学校废除种族隔离的案例中，学区被发现故意基于种族歧视学生。为了弥补种族隔离学校的影响，或许有必要采取种族意识方面的行动，根据种族分配教师和学生。这种平权行动是补救性的；要补救已被证实的、故意的歧视，唯一的方法就是将种族作为一个类别。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As usual, we can begin with some relatively easy cases. In the school desegregation cases, school districts were found to have deliberately discriminated among students on the basis of race. To remedy the effects of segregated schools, it may be necessary to take race-conscious actions, by assigning teachers and students to schools on the basis of their race. This kind of affirmative action is remedial; the only way to remedy proven, intentional discrimination is to use race as a category.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，假设政府自愿采取平权行动，且没有可证实的歧视历史。在这种情况下，法院多数意见的变化以及案件产生的不同背景，导致了各种各样的处理方式。例如，1990年，5比4的多数法官裁定，联邦通信委员会偏袒广播电台或电视台少数族裔所有者的政策符合宪法（<em class="calibre8">《都市广播公司诉联邦通信委员会</em>》）。但1995年，1991年上任的托马斯大法官与四位反对<em class="calibre8">《都市广播公司》</em>的反对者一起，裁定联邦政府在公路项目中偏袒少数族裔承包商的政策不符合宪法（<em class="calibre8">《阿达兰德承包商公司诉佩纳》</em>）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Suppose, however, that the government voluntarily undertakes affirmative action without a proven history of discrimination. Here shifting majorities on the Court and the varied contexts from which the cases arise have produced a variety of approaches. In 1990, for example, a 5–4 majority of the justices held that the Federal Communications Commission policy favoring minority owners of radio or television stations was constitutional (<em class="calibre8">Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission</em>), but in 1995, Justice Thomas, who was appointed in 1991, joined the four <em class="calibre8">Metro Broadcasting</em> dissenters to hold that the federal government’s policy of favoring minority contractors on highway projects was not (<em class="calibre8">Adarand Contractors, Inc. v. Pena</em>).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>高等教育是平权行动备受争议的一个领域。在1978年<em class="calibre8">的加州大学董事会诉巴基</em>案中，法官们发表了六份独立意见，但没有任何一份意见占据了多数席位；鲍威尔大法官投下了决定性的一票，他的意见被视为具有决定性意义，尽管其他大法官中没有一个人完全赞同他的论证。他得出结论：公立大学不能在班级中专门为少数族裔预留席位，它可以在做出个性化招生决定时考虑申请者的种族因素，而任何这样做的平权行动项目都将受到严格审查。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>An area in which affirmative action has been hotly contested is higher education. In <em class="calibre8">Regents of the University of California v. Bakke</em> (1978) the justices issued six separate opinions, with no single opinion commanding a majority of the Court; Justice Powell cast the deciding vote and his opinion became regarded as controlling, even though no other justice entirely agreed with his reasoning. He concluded that a public university could not set aside seats in its class especially for members of a minority group, it could consider the race of applicants in making individualized admissions decisions, and an affirmative action program that did so would be subject to strict scrutiny.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">在巴基案</em>之后的几十年里，各大学采用了各种各样的平权行动计划。2003 年，法院在涉及密歇根大学法学院和本科学院招生的两起案件中重新审视了这个问题。在<em class="calibre8">格鲁特诉博林格案</em>中，法院维持了法学院平权行动计划的合宪性，而在<em class="calibre8">格拉茨诉博林格</em>案中，法院推翻了学院的计划。法院重申，种族分类必须受到严格审查，要求它们“严格地针对进一步的迫切政府利益”。在每起案件中，大学的迫切利益都是相同的，即“获得来自多元化学生群体的教育利益”，法院承认这一利益是有效的。为了促进这一迫切利益，法学院<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_62" class="calibre4"></a>对每位申请者对法学院社区多元化的潜在贡献进行广泛而个性化的评估，考量因素包括丰富的社区服务、商业或其他领域的经验以及种族因素。另一方面，该学院采用积分制招生，少数族裔申请者自动获得入学所需分数的五分之一，这实际上保证了符合最低要求的少数族裔申请者的入学资格。法院的不同多数意见认为，法学院的课程设置经过精心设计，以满足其目标，符合<em class="calibre8">巴基案</em>的要求，因此符合宪法，但学院的课程设置却不符合宪法。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the decades following <em class="calibre8">Bakke</em>, universities used a variety of affirmative action programs. In 2003 the Court revisited the issue in a pair of cases involving admissions to the University of Michigan’s law school and undergraduate college. In <em class="calibre8">Grutter v. Bollinger</em> the Court upheld the constitutionality of the law school’s affirmative action program, and in the companion case of <em class="calibre8">Gratz v. Bollinger</em> it struck down the college’s program. The Court repeated that racial classifications are subject to strict scrutiny requiring that they be “narrowly tailored to further compelling government interests.” The university’s compelling interest was the same in each case, “to obtain the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body,” an interest that the Court acknowledged to be valid. In furthering this compelling interest, the law school engaged <a class="calibre4"></a>in a wide-ranging, individualized review of every applicant’s potential contribution to the diversity of the law school community, considering factors such as extensive community service and experience in business or other fields as well as race. The college, on the other hand, used a point system for admissions under which minority applicants automatically received one-fifth of the points necessary for admission, which had the practical effect of guaranteeing admissions for minimally qualified minority applicants. Different majorities of the Court found that the law school program was narrowly tailored to meet its goal, consistent with the requirements of <em class="calibre8">Bakke</em> and therefore constitutional, but the college program was not.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>继<em class="calibre8">格鲁特</em>和<em class="calibre8">格拉茨之后，</em>德克萨斯大学为了应对学生群体多元化不足的问题，采取了一项招生计划：75%的新生来自德克萨斯州排名前10%的高中，25%的新生则根据将多元化作为一项因素的招生指标进行录取。白人学生阿比盖尔·费舍尔因这项计划被拒，并提起诉讼，声称将种族作为录取因素是不可接受的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After <em class="calibre8">Grutter</em> and <em class="calibre8">Gratz,</em> the University of Texas responded to the problem of an insufficiently diverse student body by adopting an admissions plan under which 75 percent of the entering class was taken from the top 10 percent of Texas high schools and 25 percent was taken according to an admissions index that used diversity as one factor. Abigail Fisher, a white student, was rejected under this plan and sued, claiming that the use of race as a factor was impermissible.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">在费舍尔诉德克萨斯大学</em>（2013）案中，肯尼迪大法官代表法院撰文重申，大学对多元化的学生群体有着迫切的利益。然而，由于种族分类受到严格审查，大学也必须证明使用种族分类对于实现多元化是必要的。法院将该案发回下级法院，并指示只有在“不存在可行的、能够产生多元化教育效益的种族中立替代方案”的情况下，才能维持该项目。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In <em class="calibre8">Fisher v. University of Texas</em> (2013), Justice Kennedy, writing for the Court, reaffirmed that colleges have a compelling interest in a diverse student body. Because racial classifications were subject to strict scrutiny, however, the university also must show that the use of race was necessary to achieve diversity. The Court remanded the case to the lower court with instructions that the program could be upheld only if there were “no workable race-neutral alternatives [that] would produce the educational benefits of diversity.”</p>

<p class="noindent">《权利法案》的通过明确表明，新成立的国家政府无权侵犯人民的权利。宪法第一修正案中包含了或许是这些权利中最基本的内容：“国会不得制定任何法律……剥夺言论自由或新闻出版自由。” 言论自由是其他权利的保障，允许公开的政治辩论和对政府权威的挑战。</p><p class="noindent">The Bill of Rights was adopted to make clear that the new national government lacked the power to infringe the rights of the people. Included in the First Amendment to the Constitution was what may be the most fundamental of those rights: “Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.” Freedom of speech acts as the guarantor of the other rights, permitting open political debate and challenges to government authority.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>令人惊讶的是，历史记载并不清楚《权利法案》的制定者通过第一修正案究竟想要实现什么。一些学者认为，他们的目的仅仅是阻止政​​府直接禁止人们表达意见，尽管政府事后可能会根据人们的言论内容对他们进行惩罚。另一些人则认为，制定者的目的是制定一项更为广泛的自由原则。<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_63" class="calibre4"></a>言论自由，即人们可以自由批评政府而不受制裁。无论其最初的含义是什么，言论自由条款在随后的一百多年里很少被使用，直到第一次世界大战期间政府的镇压引发了第一波言论自由案件的风潮。从那时起，最高法院才发展出一套第一修正案的法理，对言论进行有力的保护。在压力时期——20 世纪 50 年代的麦卡锡主义时代就是一个典型的例子——这种保护往往会减弱，但美国对言论自由的保护仍然比任何其他国家都更广泛。学者和法官们发展了几种言论自由理论来解释和指导法律的发展。这些理论很重要：我们为什么保护言论自由可能决定我们如何保护它。传统观点认为，言论自由允许一个“思想市场”，其中不同版本的真理和善争夺更多的支持者。这一观点在奥利弗·温德尔·霍姆斯大法官（Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.）在<em class="calibre8">艾布拉姆斯诉美国案</em>（1919年）中的异议中得到了最充分的体现。该案起诉无政府主义者，原因是他们散发传单，呼吁“全世界的工人”罢工，以反对美国在俄国革命期间对布尔什维克的干预。最高法院多数法官维持了对散发传单者的定罪（他们被判处最高20年监禁），但霍姆斯与路易斯·布兰代斯大法官持不同意见，他们认为：“最终的善意最好通过思想的自由交流来实现——检验真理的最佳标准是思想在市场竞争中被接受的力量。” 由于检验一种观点的唯一标准是它是否被公众接受，我们无法事先知道哪些观点是最好的；因此，政府必须允许所有观点自由竞争。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Surprisingly, the historical record is not clear as to what the framers of the Bill of Rights intended to accomplish by the First Amendment. Some scholars argue that they intended only to prevent the government from directly prohibiting people from expressing their opinions, although it could punish them afterward for the content of what they said. Others assert that the framers intended to enact a much broader principle of free <a class="calibre4"></a>speech, in which people would be free to criticize the government without sanction. Whatever its original meaning, the free speech clause was little used for more than a hundred years, until government repression at the time of World War I sparked the first flurry of free speech cases. Only since then has the Supreme Court developed a body of First Amendment jurisprudence that significantly protects speech. Often in times of stress—the era of McCarthyism in the 1950s is a prime example—that protection has waned, but protection of free speech in the United States is still broader than in any other country. Scholars and judges have developed several theories of free speech to explain and guide the legal developments. The theories are important: Why we protect free speech may determine how we protect it. The classic view is that freedom of speech permits a “marketplace of ideas” in which different versions of truth and good contend for the greater number of supporters. This view received its foremost expression in Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.’s dissent in <em class="calibre8">Abrams v. United States</em> (1919), a prosecution of anarchists for publishing leaflets calling on the “workers of the world” to strike in opposition to the United States’ intervention against the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution. A majority of the Supreme Court affirmed the convictions of the leafletters (who were sentenced to up to twenty years in prison), but Holmes, joined by Justice Louis Brandeis, dissented, arguing “that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas—that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market.” Because the only test of an opinion is its acceptance by the public, we cannot know in advance which opinions are the best; therefore, the government must allow all of them to compete freely.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>思想碰撞最重要的“市场”是政治领域。在民主国家，关于公共议题、政府政策和公职候选人的自由辩论对自治至关重要，因为它能够为公民提供信息，灌输公共价值观，并提供批评政府的论坛。因此，保护​​政治言论是第一修正案的核心，即使它并未明确第一修正案的全部范围。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The most important “marketplace” in which ideas are contested is the political realm. In a democracy, free debate about public issues, government policy, and candidates for office is essential to self-governance because it informs citizens, inculcates public values, and provides a forum for criticism of the government. Protection of political speech is, therefore, at the core of the First Amendment, even if it does not define its entire scope.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>思想市场理论可能过于局限，因为它只关注言论自由在促成更佳政治决策方面的工具性作用。因此，另一种理论认为，言论自由在维护个人尊严和促进个人发展方面具有独立的价值。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The marketplace of ideas approach may be too limited because it attends only to the instrumental effects of free speech in reaching better political decisions. Therefore, another theory argues that freedom of speech has an independent value in affirming the dignity and promoting the development of individuals.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>无论我们遵循哪种理论，还是两者兼而有之，我们都面临着一项艰巨的任务：定义第一修正案言论自由保障的内容。“言论”需要很多<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_64" class="calibre4"></a>形式：表达政治观点、使用种族歧视的绰号、在拥挤的剧院里高喊“着火了！”、在超市小报上刊登关于电影明星的粗俗报道，或在广告中做出虚假承诺，等等。就第一修正案而言，言论也包括一些非语言表达：焚烧征兵卡、美国国旗或十字架；抗议；静坐；或做出猥亵手势。这些“言论”形式中，哪些受到第一修正案的保护，免受政府干预？保护范围有多广？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Whether we follow one theory or the other, or some combination of the two, we face a difficult task in defining the content of the First Amendment’s free speech guarantee. “Speech” takes many <a class="calibre4"></a>forms: expressing a political opinion, using a racial epithet, shouting “Fire!” in a crowded theater, publishing a scurrilous story about a movie star in a supermarket tabloid, or making false promises in an advertisement, to name only a few. Speech, for First Amendment purposes, also has come to include some nonverbal expression: burning a draft card, an American flag, or a cross; picketing; sitting-in; or making an obscene gesture. Which of these forms of “speech” are protected by the First Amendment from government intrusion, and how far does the protection extend?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第一修正案保护言论自由，言论必须由发言者进行。根据第一修正案，谁算作发言者？通常，这是一个简单的问题。在街头演讲、举着抗议标语或发布网页的人当然算发言者。但如果这个人不是真人，而是公司呢？长期以来，公司、工会和类似协会的交流活动一直受到特殊限制。在备受争议的<em class="calibre8">“联合公民诉联邦选举委员会”</em>（2010年）案中，法院将第一修正案的保护范围广泛扩展到公司支出。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The First Amendment protects speech, and speech has to be carried on by a speaker. Who counts as a speaker for First Amendment purposes? Ordinarily this is an easy question. Someone orating from a soapbox, carrying a picket sign, or publishing a web page is surely a speaker. But what if that someone is not a real person but is a corporation? Corporations, labor unions, and similar associations long have been subject to special restrictions on their communicative activities. In the controversial case of <em class="calibre8">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</em> (2010), the Court broadly extended First Amendment protection to corporate expenditures.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>2008年，非营利组织“联合公民”（Citizens United）制作了一部批评当时民主党总统候选人希拉里·克林顿的电影，并制作了电视广告来宣传这部电影。联邦选举法限制企业在初选前三十天内为此类“竞选宣传”支出资金。最高法院裁定，“第一修正案保护的不仅仅是那些在街头演讲的个人和孤独的小册子作者”，正如首席大法官罗伯茨在附议中所说；它还保护企业，包括规模较小的非营利组织、夫妻店和埃克森美孚。政府辩称，企业支出可能产生过大的影响，并可能导致公职人员腐败，或至少是表面上腐败，但最高法院驳回了这些担忧，指出所有发言者的经济资源都来自经济市场，并有权参与思想市场。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In 2008 Citizens United, a nonprofit corporation, produced a film critical of Hillary Clinton, then a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, and also produced television ads promoting the film. Federal election laws limited the ability of corporations to spend funds for “electioneering communications” like these within thirty days of a primary election. The Court held that “The First Amendment protects more than just the individual on a soapbox and the lonely pamphleteer,” as Chief Justice Roberts said in concurrence; it also protects corporations, including modest nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses, and ExxonMobil. The government argued that corporate expenditures may have outsize influence and may lead to the corruption of public officials or at least the appearance of corruption, but the Court dismissed those concerns, noting that all speakers derive their financial resources from the economic marketplace and are entitled to participate in the marketplace of ideas.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>宪法中最重要的原则之一，竟然在最高法院一份意见书的脚注中被确立，这颇为蹊跷。首席大法官哈兰·斯通（Harlan Stone）在1938年<em class="calibre8">美国诉卡罗琳产品公司案</em>（United States v. Carolene Products Co.）中的意见书，包含了如今已成传奇的脚注4，主张某些权利具有特殊的宪法地位。脚注4指出，法院通常给予立法的合宪性推定，其适用范围可能较窄，“当立法表面上看起来属于宪法的特定禁令范围，例如<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_65" class="calibre4"></a>前十条修正案赋予的权利。”因此，《权利法案》中的宪法权利，包括言论自由，被赋予了高于其他权利的“优先地位”。这一优先地位将通过对政府试图控制言论的行为进行“更严格的司法审查”来实现，而这正是在言​​论保护领域已经发生的事情。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One of the most important principles of constitutional law was established, bizarrely enough, in a footnote of a Supreme Court opinion. Chief Justice Harlan Stone’s opinion in <em class="calibre8">United States v. Carolene Products Co</em>. (1938) included the now legendary footnote 4, asserting a special constitutional status for certain rights. Footnote 4 stated that the presumption of constitutionality that the Court ordinarily gives to legislation may have a narrower scope “when legislation appears on its face to be within a specific prohibition of the Constitution such as <a class="calibre4"></a>those of the first ten amendments.” Constitutional rights within the Bill of Rights, including freedom of speech, therefore, were given a “preferred position” over other rights. This preferred position is to be effectuated through “more exacting judicial scrutiny” of government attempts to control speech, and that is exactly what has occurred in the area of protected speech.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>言论自由的优先地位在多个方面限制了州和联邦政府禁止或限制受宪法保护言论的权力。首先，政府通常不得对言论施加事先限制；也就是说，即使宪法赋予政府事后惩罚言论者的权利，政府也不得事先禁止言论。其次，政府不得基于言论内容进行限制。第三，政府可以限制言论的时间、地点和方式，但仅限于政府有迫切需要这样做的情况下，采取限制性最小的手段，并通过既不太模糊也不太宽泛的法规来限制言论。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The preferred position of free speech restricts the power of state and federal governments to prohibit or limit constitutionally protected speech in a number of ways. First, the government generally may not impose prior restraints on speech; that is, it may not prohibit speech in advance, even where it constitutionally could punish the speaker after the fact. Second, it may not limit speech based on its content. Third, the government may limit the time, place, and manner of speech but only in cases in which it has a compelling interest in doing so, adopts the least restrictive means of limiting the speech, and does so by a regulation that is neither too vague nor overly broad.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>禁止事先限制言论自由可能是第一修正案中最严格的限制。假设在战争期间，一名前政府雇员意图通过泄露批评政府政策的信息来干扰战争的进行（例如，前国家安全局雇员丹尼尔·艾尔斯伯格在越南战争期间的五角大楼文件案中所做的那样）。如果这些信息可能会削弱对战争的支持，甚至可能帮助敌人，政府或许会希望获得禁令，以防止损害发生。此外，禁令仅要求在法官面前进行快速听证，如果雇员违反禁令，他可能会因藐视法庭而受到惩罚。因此，对于政府而言，禁令比因泄露信息而受到刑事处罚更为有效。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The prohibition on prior restraints of speech may be the strongest limitation in the First Amendment. Suppose during a time of war a former government employee intends to interfere with the conduct of the war by revealing information that is critical of government policy (as Daniel Ellsberg, a former national security employee, did during the Vietnam War in the Pentagon Papers case). If the information might undermine support for the war and conceivably even help the enemy, the government may want to obtain an injunction to prevent the harm before it occurs. Moreover, the injunction requires only an expedited hearing in front of a judge, and if the employee violates the injunction, he can be punished for contempt. The injunction, therefore, is a better remedy for the government than would be a criminal punishment for revealing the information.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>但言论自由条款的设计初衷是剥夺政府获得对其最有利信息的权利。英美法律中对言论自由的最早理解是禁止事前限制。政府可以因发表或印刷煽动性、亵渎性或其他违禁内容而惩罚他人，但不能审查该言论或事先禁止其发表。这一原则在禁止事前限制的原则下延续到了现代第一修正案的法理中。政府通常无法将言论排除在思想市场之外，即使它可以事后惩罚该言论。唯一的例外是，在五角大楼文件案中，法院承认了这一点，即披露战时军队调动之类的信息，或其他“必然、直接且立即”带来类似危险的言论。<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_66" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But the free speech clause was designed to deny the government what is best for it. The earliest understanding of free speech in English and American law was a prohibition on prior restraints. The government could punish a person for saying or printing something that was seditious, blasphemous, or otherwise prohibited, but it could not censor the statement or prohibit in advance its publication. That principle has been carried over into modern First Amendment jurisprudence under the doctrine prohibiting prior restraints. Government generally cannot keep speech out of the marketplace of ideas, even when it can punish the speech subsequently. The singular exception, which the Court recognized in the Pentagon Papers case, is the disclosure of something like troop movements in time of war or other speech that “must inevitably, directly, and immediately” present a similar peril.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，最高法院允许在两个领域实施事先限制：淫秽内容和商业广告。法院并未明确区分两者，但这可能是因为在这些领域，延迟发表的影响较小，且言论的地位较低。对政治辩论事项实施事先限制，可能会在关键时刻将重要的观点或事实排除在思想市场之外，但淫秽内容或广告的传播通常时间压力较小。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Supreme Court has allowed prior restraints in two areas, however: obscenity and commercial advertising. The Court has not been clear on the distinction here, but it may be based on the smaller significance of delay in publication and the lower status of the speech in these areas. Imposing a prior restraint on a matter of political debate could keep an important opinion or fact out of the marketplace of ideas at a crucial moment, but there usually is less time pressure on the distribution of obscene materials or on advertising.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第二种言论保护是禁止政府监管言论内容。除非在极少数情况下，政府对言论的监管必须保持<em class="calibre8">内容中立</em>。也就是说，政府不得偏袒或歧视某一观点的表达。正如瑟古德·马歇尔大法官所言：“但最重要的是，第一修正案意味着政府无权因言论的信息、观点、主题或内容而限制其表达。”</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The second kind of protection for speech is a prohibition on government regulation of the content of speech. Except in the most unusual circumstances, government regulation of speech must be <em class="calibre8">content-neutral</em>. That is, the government may not favor or disfavor the expression of one point of view over another. As Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote, “But, above all else, the First Amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在此背景下，不妨考虑一下焚烧国旗这个极具争议的问题。1984年共和党全国代表大会期间，格雷戈里·李·约翰逊为抗议里根政府的政策，展开一面美国国旗，淋上煤油，然后点燃。焚烧国旗时，约翰逊和其他抗议者高呼：“美国，红、白、蓝三色，我们向你吐口水。” 约翰逊根据德克萨斯州禁止故意亵渎国旗的法规被判处一年监禁和2000美元罚款。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Consider in this context the highly controversial issue of flag burning. While protesting the policies of the Reagan administration during the 1984 Republican National Convention, Gregory Lee Johnson unfurled an American flag, doused it with kerosene, and set it on fire. While the flag burned, Johnson and other protesters chanted, “America, the red, white, and blue, we spit on you.” Johnson was convicted under a Texas statute that prohibited the intentional desecration of the flag and was sentenced to one year in prison and a $2,000 fine.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>约翰逊不仅点燃了一面国旗，更引发了一场全国性的争议风暴。他的上诉（<em class="calibre8">德克萨斯州诉约翰逊案</em>）于1989年上诉至最高法院。最高法院以五比四的多数票裁定约翰逊的定罪无效，因为该法规的内容规定违反了第一修正案。正如德克萨斯州律师所承认的，约翰逊的行为旨在表达——传达一种思想——他因此被起诉。然而，州政府辩称，其利益在于防止可能因焚烧国旗而引发的破坏和平的行为，并“维护国旗作为国家和民族团结的象征”。第一个论点失败了，因为没有证据表明焚烧国旗可能导致迫在眉睫的违法行为；即使可能造成这种结果，以可能的暴力行为起诉约翰逊可能会产生违宪的“抗议者否决权”，即对受宪法保护的言论的预期反应可以作为压制言论的依据。第二个论点失败了，因为它直接限制了内容。正如多数人所写：“如果说第一修正案有一个基本原则，那就是政府不得禁止表达任何思想<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_67" class="calibre4"></a>仅仅因为社会认为这个想法本身令人反感或不快。即使涉及到我们的国旗，我们也没有承认这一原则的例外。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Johnson ignited not only a flag but a storm of national controversy. His appeal (<em class="calibre8">Texas v. Johnson</em>) came to the Supreme Court in 1989. By a five-to-four majority, the Court invalidated Johnson’s conviction because the statute was a content regulation in violation of the First Amendment. As the attorneys for the state admitted, Johnson’s conduct was meant to be expressive—to communicate an idea—and he was prosecuted for doing so. The state argued, however, that it had an interest in preventing breaches of the peace that might occur because people would be upset by the flag burning and in “preserving the flag as a symbol of nationhood and national unity.” The first argument failed because there was no evidence that the flag burning was likely to produce imminent lawlessness; even if that might have been the result, prosecution of Johnson for the probable violence might create an unconstitutional “heckler’s veto,” in which the anticipated reaction to constitutionally protected speech can be used as a basis for suppressing the speech. The second argument failed because it was a direct regulation of content. As the majority wrote, “If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea <a class="calibre4"></a>simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable. We have not recognized an exception to this principle even where our flag has been involved.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>政府对言论的监管必须内容中立，这一要求甚至限制了政府惩罚虚假言论的能力。“说谎是他的习惯，”法院在谈到泽维尔·阿尔瓦雷斯时说道。他曾谎称自己为底特律红翼队打冰球，并娶了一位墨西哥女星，但将他告上最高法院的谎言是他公开声称自己获得了荣誉勋章（<em class="calibre8">美国诉阿尔瓦雷斯案</em>，2012 年）。根据《盗窃英勇法案》，该谎言可受刑事处罚，阿尔瓦雷斯也因此被起诉。政府辩称虚假言论毫无价值，对思想市场和公共辩论毫无贡献。法院拒绝为虚假言论设定内容中立原则的例外。某些类型的虚假言论可以被禁止或惩罚，例如诽谤性言论或造成不利后果的言论，例如向公职人员作出虚假陈述。但基于内容的限制被推定为无效，因为“我们的宪法传统反对我们需要大洋国真理部的想法”，就像乔治·奥威尔的小说《<em class="calibre8">1984》</em>中所说的那样。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The requirement that government regulation of speech be content-neutral even restricts its ability to punish speech that is false. “Lying was his habit,” the Court said of Xavier Alvarez. He had lied about playing hockey for the Detroit Red Wings and having married a Mexican starlet, but the lie that brought his case to the Supreme Court was his public claim that he had received the Medal of Honor (<em class="calibre8">United States v. Alvarez</em>, 2012). Under the Stolen Valor Act, that lie was criminally punishable, and Alvarez was prosecuted under the act. The government argued that false speech was valueless, contributing nothing to the marketplace of ideas and public debate. The Court refused to create an exception to the principle of content neutrality for false speech. Certain kinds of false speech can be prohibited or punished, such as speech that is defamatory or that has adverse consequences, such as making false statements to a public official. But content-based restrictions are presumed to be invalid because “our constitutional tradition stands against the idea that we need Oceania’s Ministry of Truth,” as in George Orwell’s novel <em class="calibre8">1984</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>政府虽然无法监管言论内容，但可以监管言论的时间、地点和方式，以及其他表达行为。言论自由是否意味着，例如，某人可以在午夜时分在居民区用扩音器自由地阐述自己的观点，或者一群人可以在交通高峰期在街道中央游行抗议交通政策？当然不是。政府可以对言论的传播方式施加合理的限制，而无需审查其内容。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>While the government cannot regulate the content of speech, it can regulate the time, place, and manner of speech and other expressive conduct. Does freedom of speech mean, for example, that someone is free to expound their views over a loudspeaker at midnight in a residential neighborhood, or that a group can parade down the middle of a street during rush hour to protest traffic policies? Certainly not. The government can impose reasonable restrictions on the way speech is communicated without censoring its content.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，存在一个问题。时间、地点和方式监管可以成为内容监管的借口。如果市政法令要求任何希望使用扩音器的人都必须获得警察局长的许可，那么警察局长在决定允许谁以及何时何地使用扩音器时行使的自由裁量权，可能会被用来歧视某些类型的内容。为了避免这个问题，法院制定了时间、地点和方式监管的标准，这些标准遵循了言论自由权的优先地位。首先，正如法院在1968年<em class="calibre8">美国诉奥布莱恩案</em>中所说，“对所谓的第一修正案自由的附带限制[必须]不超过促进[政府]利益所必需的程度。”这通常被称为<em class="calibre8">限制性最小的替代</em>测试。在规范言论的时间、地点或方式时，政府必须使用限制性最小的替代手段来服务于其利益。<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_68" class="calibre4"></a>避免对言论自由造成不必要的限制。城市有责任防止乱扔垃圾，但禁止所有传单和宣传单的散发并不能真正促进这一目标的实现。一个限制性较小的替代方案是起诉那些在街上乱扔垃圾的人。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There is a problem, however. Time, place, and manner regulations can act as a subterfuge for content regulation. If a municipal ordinance requires that anyone wishing to use a loudspeaker get permission from the chief of police, the chief’s exercise of discretion in deciding who to permit to use a loudspeaker, as well as where and when, could be used to discriminate against some types of content. To avoid this problem, the Court has developed standards for time, place, and manner regulations that follow from the preferred position given the right of free speech. First, as the Court said in <em class="calibre8">United States v. O’Brien</em> (1968), “the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms [must be] no greater than is essential to the furtherance of [the government’s] interest.” This is often stated as the <em class="calibre8">least restrictive alternative</em> test. In regulating the time, place, or manner of expression, the government must use the least restrictive alternative means of serving its interest <a class="calibre4"></a>to avoid unnecessarily limiting free speech. A city has an interest in preventing littering, but it may not advance that interest by banning all distribution of handbills and leaflets, when a less restrictive alternative would be to prosecute people who actually throw papers on the streets.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>其次，法规不应过于宽泛。如果法规起草得过于宽泛，可能会禁止受保护的言论，或过度监管内容。在1987年的<em class="calibre8">休斯顿诉希尔</em>案中，最高法院裁定一项规定“干扰任何警察执行公务”为非法的法令无效。虽然政府可以阻止对警察的干扰，但不能通过同时惩罚某些受保护言论的禁令来做到这一点。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Second, the regulation must not be overly broad. If the regulation is drafted too broadly, it could prohibit protected speech or regulate content to too great an extent. In <em class="calibre8">Houston v. Hill</em> (1987) the Court invalidated an ordinance making it unlawful to “interrupt any policeman in the execution of his duty.” While the government could prevent interference with police officers, it could not do so through a prohibition that also would punish some protected speech.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第三，法规不能过于模糊。模糊的法规不会告知人们他们能做什么、不能做什么，因此他们可能会因为害怕被起诉而限制其根据第一修正案开展的活动。模糊的法规赋予政府官员过多的自由裁量权，使其有权根据该法规许可、限制或起诉，这增加了官员可能以违宪的方式行使自由裁量权的可能性。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Third, the regulation must not be overly vague. A vague statute does not put people on notice as to what they can and cannot do, so they might limit their First Amendment activities in fear of prosecution. And a vague statute puts too much discretion in the hands of government officials to license, limit, or prosecute under it, raising the possibility that officials might exercise their discretion in a constitutionally impermissible manner.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如果你只能在自家客厅里自由发言，言论自由就没什么用。要想有效地进入思想市场，言论必须在公共场合进行。但如果邻居不想让你在她家客厅里发言，你当然没有权利在她家客厅里行使言论自由。法院如何划分必须允许言论的公共场所和可能被禁止言论的私人场所之间的界限？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Freedom of speech doesn’t do much good if you are only free to speak in your living room. To be effective in entering the marketplace of ideas, speech must take place in public. But you surely don’t have the right to exercise free speech in your neighbor’s living room if she doesn’t want you there. How do courts draw the line between public spaces in which speech must be allowed and private spaces in which it may be prohibited?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>有些区域显然是公共场所，例如街道和公园，传统上是示威、纠察、演讲和其他行使第一修正案权利的场所。其他区域之所以成为公共场所，是因为政府开放了某些财产用于交流活动。例如，一旦州立大学向学生团体开放其会议室，其对这些会议室使用的任何限制都必须符合第一修正案的标准。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Some areas are obvious public forums, such as streets and parks, which have traditionally been the site of demonstrations, picketing, speeches, and other exercise of First Amendment rights. Other areas have become public forums because the government has opened certain property to communicative activity. Once a state university opens its meeting rooms to student groups, for example, any restrictions it imposes on use of the rooms must comply with First Amendment standards.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最近，最高法院认为，所有其他公共财产都是非公共场所，政府可以限制其用于言论活动，只要这些限制合理且不旨在压制特定观点。例如，购物中心日益成为郊区城镇广场，人们不仅来购物，还来聚会、娱乐和参与社区活动。在对大型和小型购物中心的公私混合性质进行了一些探讨后，法院最终得出结论，私人购物中心的功能与城镇广场并不等同，因此私人业主可以不考虑限制言论自由。<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_69" class="calibre4"></a>根据第一修正案。然而，一些法院根据州法律裁定，购物中心可以向公众开放，进行表达活动。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Recently the Supreme Court has taken the view that all other public property is a nonpublic forum, and the government may restrict the use of it for speech activities as long as the restrictions are reasonable and not intended to suppress a particular point of view. Shopping malls, for example, increasingly serve as suburban town squares, in which people come not only to shop but to gather, to be entertained, and to participate in community events. After some decisions exploring the mixed public–private nature of shopping centers large and small, the Court finally concluded that a private shopping center is not the functional equivalent of a town square, so the private owner can limit expression without regard <a class="calibre4"></a>to the First Amendment. Several courts, however, have held under state law that malls are open to public expressive activity.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>假设有人敲诈你，威胁你不付钱就揭露你过去的秘密。或者假设一个出版商想发行一本充斥着儿童色情内容的杂志。他能逍遥法外，并声称受到第一修正案的保护吗？大多数人都同意，有些言论应该受到宪法的全面保护，有些则不应该。问题在于如何界定这些界限。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Suppose someone blackmails you, threatening to reveal a dark secret from your past unless you pay her off. Or suppose a publisher wants to distribute a magazine filled with child pornography. Can he do so with impunity and claim the protection of the First Amendment? Most people agree that some speech should receive full constitutional protection and some should not. The problem is figuring out where to draw the lines.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>为了界定完全受保护、部分受保护和不受保护的言论，法院首先援引了第一修正案的理论。从思想市场的角度来看，言论或交流行为的价值主要在于它是公共辩论的一部分。对公共辩论无益的言论不值得与有助于公共辩论的言论享有同等程度的保护。例如，支持监管的人士认为，淫秽图片对公共话语没有任何贡献。其他类型的言论只会造成伤害，而不会促进辩论，或者其造成的伤害远远超过其贡献。勒索者的威胁对社会秩序的威胁远远大于其言论本身的价值。从自我表达的角度来看，情况也是如此；尽管许多形式的言论是自我表达的重要手段，但有些（例如勒索）并非如此，而在其他一些（例如儿童色情）中，言论的危害超过了允许其表达的价值。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To define fully protected, partially protected, and unprotected speech, the Court begins with the theories of the First Amendment. From the marketplace of ideas perspective, speech or communicative conduct has value primarily because it is part of a public debate. Speech that does not contribute to public debate does not deserve the same level of protection as speech that does contribute. Advocates of regulation argue that, for example, obscene pictures do not add anything to public discourse. Other kinds of speech simply cause harm without contributing to debate, or the harm they cause vastly outweighs any contribution they make. Threats by blackmailers pose a threat to the social order much greater than any value the statements have. The same may be said from the self-expression point of view; even though many forms of speech are important means of self-expression, some (such as blackmail) are not, and in others (child pornography) the harm of the speech outweighs the value of permitting the expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>有一种不受保护的言论显然不具备宪法地位，以至于在案件中很少出现，那就是法律传统上认为是犯罪行为的言论。当强盗说“要钱还是要命”或公司发布与股票发行相关的虚假招股说明书时，这些言论并非对公共重要事务发表意见，而只是相当于强盗把手伸进你的口袋，拿走你的钱包。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One form of unprotected speech that is so obviously not entitled to constitutional status that it rarely appears in the cases is speech that is part of an act the law traditionally would consider criminal. When a robber says “your money or your life” or a corporation issues a fraudulent prospectus in connection with a stock offering, the speech expresses no opinion on a matter of public importance but is merely the functional equivalent of the robber sticking his hand in your pocket and taking your wallet.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>构成犯罪行为的言论很容易处理。其他形式的不受保护或保护程度较低的言论，则存在更难的定义和界定问题。商业言论、可能引起诽谤或其他侵权行为责任的言论、淫秽言论以及煽动非法活动的言论，虽然受到第一修正案的一些保护，但不如其他更受传统保护的言论形式受到那么多的保护。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Speech that is part of criminal conduct is an easy case. Other forms of unprotected or less protected speech present more difficult definitional and line-drawing problems. Commercial speech, speech that may give rise to liability for defamation or other torts, obscenity, and incitement to illegal activity receive some First Amendment protection but not as much as other more traditionally protected forms of speech.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>商业言论包括广告、使用商标名称、律师招揽客户、在房屋上张贴“待售”标志、分发一般消费者信息，以及主要出于经济动机的类似活动。最高法院首次宣布商业言论享有第一修正案的保护。<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_70" class="calibre4"></a>1976年，弗吉尼亚州禁止药剂师宣传处方药价格的法令被推翻，从而为言论自由提供了保护（<em class="calibre8">弗吉尼亚州药房委员会诉弗吉尼亚州公民消费者委员会案</em>）。言论自由不会因为发言者的利益与经济相关而失去保护；卷入劳资纠纷的工会成员虽然有经济利益，但他们的言论早已受到保护。个人消费者寻求物美价廉的产品，而广大公众也受益于消费者的明智决策，因此，无论是在商业领域还是在政治领域，人们都对信息和思想的自由传播抱有浓厚的兴趣。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Commercial speech includes advertisements, use of trade names, solicitations of clients by lawyers, posting of “For Sale” signs on houses, distribution of general consumer information, and similar activities for which there primarily is an economic motivation. The Supreme Court first declared that commercial speech is entitled to First Amendment <a class="calibre4"></a>protection in 1976 when it struck down a Virginia statute that prohibited pharmacists from advertising the prices of prescription drugs (<em class="calibre8">Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc</em>.). Speech is not disqualified from protection because the speaker’s interest is economic; union members involved in a labor dispute have an economic interest, but their speech had long been protected. Individual consumers seek good products at low prices, and the public at large benefits from well-informed decisions by consumers, so there is a strong interest in the free dissemination of information and ideas in the commercial as well as the political realm.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这种利益足以赋予商业言论以《第一修正案》的保护，但不如对其他类型言论的利益那么强烈。某些类型的商业言论可以被完全禁止，包括虚假和欺骗性广告。这一类别表明商业言论受到的保护少得多。法院维持了德克萨斯州一项禁止验光师以商品名行医的法规；尽管没有证据表明验光师使用商品名欺骗消费者，但他们可能使用商品名的风险足以支持这项监管。非欺骗性商业言论有权获得更多保护，但由于政府对部分此类言论拥有合法权益（例如，通过监管啤酒广告来减少过度饮酒），因此保护程度并不总是明确的。法院推翻了各种对酒精饮料广告的限制，维持了对彩票和赌场赌博广告的禁令，使禁止烟草产品广告牌广告的禁令无效，并对限制律师和其他专业人士招揽客户方式的州法律进行了分裂。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That interest is strong enough to accord commercial speech First Amendment protection but not as strong as the interest in other types of speech. Some types of commercial speech can be prohibited altogether, including false and deceptive advertising. This category shows how much less protection commercial speech gets. The Court upheld a Texas statute that prohibited optometrists from practicing under trade names; although there was no proof that optometrists had used trade names to deceive consumers, the risk that they might was enough to support the regulation. Nondeceptive commercial speech is entitled to more protection, but because the government has a legitimate interest in regulating some of that speech—to reduce excessive drinking through the regulation of beer advertising, for example—how much is not always clear. The Court has struck down a variety of restrictions on advertising alcoholic beverages, upheld prohibitions on advertising lotteries and casino gambling, invalidated a ban on billboard advertising of tobacco products, and split on state laws that limit the ways in which lawyers and other professionals can solicit clients.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>诽谤是一种侵权行为，指因发表虚假和贬损性言论而损害他人名誉的行为，需承担法律责任。因此，如果有人错误地声称某位参议员受到某公司捐款的不当影响而支持某项立法，或者某家报纸刊登了与此相关的虚假文章，该参议员可以提起诉讼，要求赔偿其名誉损失。（为此，第一修正案赋予新闻自由与言论自由同等对待。）但这里存在一个问题。第一修正案鼓励对公共事务发表评论，包括对政府及其官员的批评。如果诽谤法在为公职人员提供救济方面过于宽容，公民在发表批评意见时就会更加谨慎，思想交流也会受到削弱。然而，保护个人名誉的利益依然存在。我们该如何平衡这两者？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Defamation is a tort that imposes liability for making false and derogatory statements that injure someone’s reputation. Therefore, if someone falsely states that a senator has been improperly influenced to support a piece of legislation by donations from a corporation, or if a newspaper publishes a false article to that effect, the senator may sue for damages to her reputation. (For these purposes, First Amendment freedom of the press is treated under the same standards as freedom of speech.) But there is a problem here. The First Amendment encourages commentary on public affairs, including criticism of the government and its officials. If the law of defamation is too generous in providing a remedy to public officials, citizens would be much more cautious in voicing their criticisms, and the marketplace of ideas would be diminished. Yet the interest in protecting one’s reputation is still valid. How do we balance the two?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最高法院在<em class="calibre8">《纽约时报公司诉沙利文案》</em>（1964 年）中解决了这一困境，该案源于民权运动。<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_71" class="calibre4"></a>阿拉巴马州蒙哥马利市警察局长就<em class="calibre8">《纽约时报》的</em>一则广告起诉该报，该广告指控蒙哥马利市警察暴力执法并寻求对民权运动的支持。虽然该广告只在几个小方面存在虚假，但根据阿拉巴马州法律，它构成诽谤，而《<em class="calibre8">纽约时报》</em>作为出版商也要承担责任，尽管它在发布广告时并不知情。然而，最高法院推翻了这项判决。代表最高法院的威廉·布伦南大法官写道，《第一修正案》的核心含义包括“一项深刻的国家主义原则，即对公共问题的辩论应该不受约束、激烈而开放，并且它很可能包括对政府和公职人员的激烈、尖刻、有时甚至是令人不快的尖锐攻击。”</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Supreme Court addressed this dilemma in <em class="calibre8">New York Times Co. v. Sullivan</em> (1964), a case arising out of the civil rights movement. The <a class="calibre4"></a>police commissioner of Montgomery, Alabama, sued the <em class="calibre8">New York Times</em> over an advertisement alleging police brutality in Montgomery and soliciting support for the civil rights movement. Although the advertisement was false only in a few minor respects, under Alabama law it was defamatory and the <em class="calibre8">Times</em>, as publisher, was liable even though it had published the ad without knowledge of the misstatements. The Supreme Court reversed the judgment, however. There is a “central meaning of the First Amendment,” wrote Justice William Brennan for the Court, that includes “a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>为了维护这一核心含义，最高法院赋予某些构成普通法诽谤的言论以宪法保护。否则，诽谤行为可能被用作压制意见表达的工具。持非主流观点的人会担心因陈述错误而受到惩罚，或担心不利于其观点的陪审团会做出不利于他们的判决，或仅仅担心诉讼费用，因此不愿表达自己的观点——最高法院称之为“自我审查”。关于公职人员的言论受宪法保护，除非该官员能够证明其言论为虚假且带有“实际恶意”（法院将其定义为“明知其为虚假或罔顾其真实性”）。根据这一标准，大多数公众评论和所有善意的新闻判断——包括《纽约<em class="calibre8">时报》</em>刊登的广告——都将享有宪法特权；只有恶意诽谤才不受宪法保护。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To protect this central meaning, the Court gave constitutional protection to some forms of speech that would constitute common law defamation. Otherwise, defamation actions could be used as a tool to chill the expression of opinions. Advocates of unpopular views would be afraid of being punished for getting the facts wrong, or that a jury unfavorable to their view would decide against them, or simply of the cost of litigation and therefore would be reluctant to express their opinions—what the Court referred to as “self-censorship.” A statement about a public official is constitutionally protected unless the official could prove that it was false and was made with “actual malice,” which the Court defined as “knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.” Under this standard, most public comment and all good-faith journalistic judgments—including the publication of the advertisement by the <em class="calibre8">Times</em>—would be constitutionally privileged; only defamation made with malice is constitutionally unprotected.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>同样的公共辩论利益也保护言论，否则这些言论可能会引发其他侵权行为的责任。威斯特博罗浸信会成员在下士马修·斯奈德的葬礼上进行抗议，斯奈德是一名在伊拉克执行任务时牺牲的海军陆战队员。教会成员认为，上帝憎恨美国容忍同性恋，尤其是在军队中，他们经常在军事葬礼和类似活动中举行抗议，举着写有“感谢上帝赐予阵亡士兵”、“上帝憎恨同性恋”和其他令人厌恶的言论的标语。斯奈德的父亲起诉教会成员，指控他们故意造成精神痛苦，声称他们的恶劣行为给他造成了极大的精神伤害，并侵犯了他的私人事务。最高法院承认抗议活动是有害的，但它是在公共街道上和平进行的，涉及“公共事务”，而保护这些事务“是第一修正案的核心”。即使是像本案中那样造成痛苦的言论也受到保护，不受法律的约束。<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_72" class="calibre4"></a>侵权责任“以确保我们不会扼杀公众辩论”（<em class="calibre8">Snyder v. Phelps</em>，2011）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The same interest in public debate protects speech that otherwise might give rise to liability for other torts. Members of the Westboro Baptist Church picketed the funeral of Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder, a Marine who had been killed in the line of duty in Iraq. The church members believed that God hates the United States for tolerating homosexuality, particularly in the military, and they frequently picketed military funerals and similar events with signs reading “Thank God for Dead Soldiers,” “God Hates Fags,” and other repulsive sentiments. Snyder’s father sued the church members for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress, claiming that their outrageous conduct caused him extreme emotional harm and intruded on a private affair. The Supreme Court recognized that the picketing was hurtful, but it was done peacefully on a public street and involved “matters of public concern,” the protection of which “is at the heart of the First Amendment’s protection.” Even speech that causes pain as in this case is protected from <a class="calibre4"></a>tort liability “to ensure that we do not stifle public debate” (<em class="calibre8">Snyder v. Phelps</em>, 2011).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>淫秽言论（包括文字、图片、电影和真人表演）不属于第一修正案的管辖范围，因此政府限制或禁止淫秽内容的行动不像受保护的言论形式那样受到同样严格的审查。最高法院通常认为淫秽内容不值得保护，而不是就此进行辩论。然而，在一个涉及限制成人影院的案件中，最高法院提出了一些理由：由于淫秽内容与犯罪之间可能存在某种联系，州政府可以监管前者，以期预防后者。此外，社区中淫秽内容的存在会污染公共环境，并侵犯非自愿接受者的权利，从而损害整个社区。就普遍支持保护言论自由的理论而言，真正淫秽的内容既不会促进重大议题的公开辩论，也不会（以中产阶级法官的情感）使个人成长或自我表达合法化。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Obscene speech (which includes writing, pictures, movies, and live actions) is outside the scope of the First Amendment, so government action to restrict or prohibit obscenity is not subject to the same heightened scrutiny as protected forms of speech. The Supreme Court most often has assumed that obscenity is unworthy of protection, rather than argued the point. In a case involving the restriction of adult theaters, however, it offered a few reasons: Because there may be some connection between obscene material and crime, the state may regulate the former in the hope of preventing the latter. Further, the presence of obscenity in the community injures the community as a whole by polluting the public environment and by intruding on unwilling recipients. In terms of the theories supporting the protection of free speech generally, material that is truly obscene contributes neither to public debate about significant issues nor (in the middle-class sensibilities of the justices) to legitimate personal growth or self-expression.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>虽然法院长期以来一直认为淫秽内容不受保护，但在划分不受保护的淫秽言论和受保护的非淫秽言论之间时却遇到了更大的困难。<em class="calibre8">《好色客》</em>杂志对某些人而言可能是尖锐的社会讽刺和无害娱乐的混合体，但对另一些人来说却是对兽欲的令人作呕的诉求。也许对任何法律概念最著名的定义都来自波特·斯图尔特大法官，他说他无法定义淫秽的含义，但“当我看到它时，我就知道它了”（<em class="calibre8">雅各贝利斯诉俄亥俄州</em>，1964 年）。但是，除了个人偏好之外，大法官们还制定了一系列测试来尝试确定什么是淫秽，大法官之间的巨大分歧表明赋予一般宪法主张具体含义是多么困难。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>While the Court has long held the view that obscenity is unprotected, it has had much more difficulty in drawing the line between unprotected obscene speech and protected nonobscene speech. <em class="calibre8">Hustler</em> magazine may be a mix of penetrating social satire and harmless entertainment to one person but a disgusting appeal to animal lust to another. Perhaps the most famous definition of any legal concept came from Justice Potter Stewart, who said he could not define what it means to be obscene but “I know it when I see it” (<em class="calibre8">Jacobellis v. Ohio</em>, 1964). But in addition to their private predilections, the justices have formulated a series of tests to try to determine what is obscene, and the substantial disagreement among the justices shows how hard it can be to give specific meaning to general constitutional propositions.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最高法院最近一次明确提出的标准是<em class="calibre8">米勒诉加利福尼亚州案</em>（1973年）。淫秽内容的判定标准包括三个部分：</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The most recent test articulated by the Court came in <em class="calibre8">Miller v. California</em> (1973). The test for obscenity has three parts:</p>
<p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>（a）普通人按照当代社会标准是否会发现该作品整体上符合淫秽兴趣；（b）该作品是否以明显冒犯的方式描绘或描述了适用州法律明确定义的性行为；（c）该作品整体上是否缺乏严肃的文学、艺术、政治或科学价值。</p><p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>(a) whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</p>
<p class="noindent">测试的第一部分区分了“可耻或病态的”性兴趣（即淫秽的兴趣）和“正常、健康的性欲望”，正如法院在后来的案件中所说的那样。在这里​​，宪法解释<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_73" class="calibre4"></a>脱离任何文本、历史或几乎任何其他事物的依据。然而，这一要素的作用是定义决策程序。各州拥有广泛的自由度来定义什么是不受保护的淫秽内容，方法是在法规或条例中定义“当代社区标准”，然后交由陪审团裁定某本书或某部成人电影是否违反了这些标准。各州还可以定义相关的社区；宪法并未要求使用全国性的社区，甚至没有要求事先为陪审团定义任何特定的社区。因此，电影制片人或书籍出版商可能会受到不同标准的约束，例如在好莱坞这个悠闲随和、为所欲为的社区，以及在圣经地带一个循规蹈矩的村庄。社区标准测试对于在互联网上发布并覆盖美国每个社区的材料尤其成问题。到目前为止，法官们还未能就这项技术发展是否需要修改测试达成一致。在审查《儿童在线保护法》试图阻止儿童在万维网上观看淫秽材料的努力时，只有多数法官支持该法规使用社区标准；正如布雷耶大法官在其同意意见中指出的那样，通过使用当地社区标准，“最清教徒式的社区”将能够有效地禁止在全国范围内传播此类材料（<em class="calibre8">阿什克罗夫特诉美国公民自由联盟</em>，2002 年）。</p><p class="noindent">The first part of the test distinguishes between a “shameful or morbid” interest in sex (a prurient interest) and “normal, healthy sexual desires,” as the Court said in a later case. Here constitutional interpretation has <a class="calibre4"></a>become unmoored from any basis in text, history, or almost anything else. What this element does, though, is define a decision-making procedure. States have wide latitude to define what constitutes unprotected obscenity by defining “contemporary community standards” in a statute or ordinance and then leaving it up to a jury to determine whether a particular book or adult movie, for example, violates the standards. The state also can define the relevant community; there is no constitutional requirement that a national community be used or even that any particular community be defined in advance for the jury. So the producer of a film or the publisher of a book might be subjected to different standards in, say, the laid-back, anything-goes community of Hollywood and a straight-laced village in the Bible Belt. The community standards test is particularly problematic for materials published on the Internet that reach every community in America. So far the justices have been unable to agree on whether this technological development requires a revision of the test. In reviewing the Child Online Protection Act’s attempt to prevent children from viewing obscene material on the World Wide Web, only a plurality of justices upheld the statute’s use of community standards; as Justice Breyer noted in his concurrence, by using local community standards, “the most puritan of communities” would be able to effectively prohibit the dissemination of material nationwide (<em class="calibre8">Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union</em>, 2002).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">第二个要件同样含糊不清，但米勒案</em>中的法庭提供了一些明显具有冒犯性的性行为的例子，很有启发：“（a）对最终性行为（正常或变态、真实或模拟）明显具有冒犯性的表述或描述，（b）对手淫、排泄功能和猥亵的生殖器展示明显具有冒犯性的表述或描述。”当然，这些例子充满了歧义：对手淫的深思熟虑且富有表现力的描述、适合低俗小说的手淫描述和明显具有冒犯性的手淫描述之间的界限在哪里？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The second element is similarly vague, but the Court in <em class="calibre8">Miller</em> helpfully provided a few examples of patently offensive sexual conduct: “(a) patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated, (b) patently offensive representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibitions of the genitals.” Of course, the examples are filled with ambiguity: Where is the line between a thoughtful and expressive description of masturbation, a description of masturbation fit for a trashy novel, and a patently offensive description of masturbation?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最后，第三个要素明确地考察了作品的价值。如果一本书具有严肃的文学、艺术、政治或科学价值，它就不属于淫秽作品。与前两个要素不同，这一判断并非参考当地社区的标准。例如，如果一群文学评论家认为一本书有价值，那么当地社区中没有人认同这一事实就无关紧要了。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Finally, the third element explicitly looks to the value of the work. If a book has serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific merit, it is not obscene. This judgment, unlike the first two, is not made with reference to a local community’s standards. If, for example, a group of literary critics find a book to have value, the fact that no one in a local community agrees is not relevant.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>一种相关的不受保护的言论是包含儿童图片的露骨色情材料，根据<em class="calibre8">米勒法，</em>这些材料可能不构成淫秽内容。由于各州对保护儿童免受性剥削有着异常强烈的关注，在1982年的<em class="calibre8">纽约诉费伯</em>案中，最高法院一致裁定，各州可以将传播此类材料的行为定为犯罪。<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_74" class="calibre4"></a>包含16岁以下儿童的性表演。禁止传播间接地实现了州政府的目标，因为它从一开始就极大地抑制了人们以此方式利用儿童的动机。然而，涉及儿童色情的虚拟作品，如果涉及露骨的、计算机生成的儿童色情图像，则受到保护，因为这些图像与对真实儿童造成的伤害之间的联系很小（<em class="calibre8">阿什克罗夫特诉言论自由联盟案</em>，2002年）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One related type of unprotected speech is sexually explicit material containing pictures of children that might not be obscene under <em class="calibre8">Miller</em>. Because the state has an unusually strong interest in protecting children from sexual exploitation, in <em class="calibre8">New York v. Ferber</em> (1982) the Court unanimously held that a state could criminalize the distribution of materials <a class="calibre4"></a>containing sexual performances by children under the age of sixteen. The prohibition on distribution accomplishes the state’s goal indirectly, by creating a tremendous disincentive to use children in this way in the first place. Virtual child pornography involving sexually explicit, computer-generated images of children is protected, however, because the connection between the images and harm to actual children is remote (<em class="calibre8">Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition</em>, 2002).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>另一种不受保护的言论是煽动暴力的言论。故事以福尔摩斯的一句话开篇：“即使最严格的言论自由保护，也无法保护一个在剧院里谎称着火并引起恐慌的人。”在这种情况下，言语“具有同等效力”。任何具体案件的关键在于，这些言语是否构成了“明显且现实的”伤害危险。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Another form of unprotected speech is speech that incites violence. The story begins with Holmes’s remark that “The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic.” Words, in such a case, “have all the effect of force.” The issue in any particular case is whether the words create “a clear and present danger” of harm.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>拥挤剧院的比喻很有力，但该原则最常用于演讲者鼓吹针对政府的暴力行为的案例。首先是在第一次世界大战和1919-1920年的红色恐慌时期，然后是20世纪50年代的麦卡锡主义时期，直至今日，各国政府都曾因此类潜在危险的言论起诉其对手。尽管霍姆斯将不受保护的言论限制于具有明显且现实危险的言论，但最高法院却非常乐意将各种形式的政治表达排除在第一修正案的保护之外。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The metaphor of a crowded theater is powerful, but the doctrine has been applied most often in cases in which a speaker advocates a violent act directed against the government. First during World War I and the Red Scare of 1919–1920, then during the McCarthyism of the 1950s, and up to the present governments have prosecuted their opponents for such potentially dangerous speech. Despite Holmes’s limitation of unprotected speech to speech that carries a clear and present danger, the Supreme Court was all too willing to exclude a variety of forms of political expression from the protection of the First Amendment.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第一次世界大战期间，政府起诉反对战争努力的人、同情俄国革命者的激进分子以及其他政治异见人士。当时盛行的“不良倾向”测试，霍姆斯在文中提到的“明显而现实的危险”可能指的就是这种测试。根据该测试，那些可能被视为倾向于产生不良结果的词语不受保护，即使在当时的语境下，这种不良结果极不可能发生。例如，在1919年的<em class="calibre8">艾布拉姆斯诉美国案</em>中，艾布拉姆斯及其同伙在纽约街头散发传单，谴责美国在反对俄国革命中所扮演的角色，并呼吁举行总罢工予以回应。他们根据一项惩罚抵抗战争努力的战时法案被判有罪，尽管他们散发传单可能导致大规模骚乱、抵抗或干扰战时生产，这很荒谬，但法院仍然维持了他们的有罪判决。霍姆斯持不同意见：</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>During the First World War era, the government prosecuted persons who opposed the war effort, radicals sympathetic to the Russian revolutionaries, and other political dissidents. The prevailing doctrine, to which Holmes was probably referring when he wrote of a clear and present danger, was the “bad tendency” test, under which words that could be seen as tending to produce a bad result were unprotected, even if in the context the bad result was extremely unlikely to come about. In <em class="calibre8">Abrams v. United States</em> (1919), for example, Abrams and his cohorts scattered leaflets on the streets of New York denouncing the U.S. role in opposition to the Russian Revolution and calling for a general strike in response. They were convicted under a wartime act that punished resistance to the war effort, and despite the absurdity of the prospect that their leafleting would lead to massive unrest, resistance, or interference with wartime production, the Court upheld their conviction. Holmes dissented:</p>
<p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>我们应该永远警惕那些试图阻止我们所厌恶的、认为充满死亡的观点表达的行为，除非这些观点迫在眉睫地威胁着立即进行干预。<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_75" class="calibre4"></a>出于法律的合法和紧迫目的，需要立即采取检查措施以拯救国家。</p><p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>[W]‌e should be eternally vigilant against attempts to check the expression of opinions that we loathe and believe to be fraught with death, unless they so imminently threaten immediate interference <a class="calibre4"></a>with the lawful and pressing purposes of the law that an immediate check is required to save the country.</p>
<p class="noindent">20 世纪 50 年代，法院采用了明显而现实的危险测试的平衡版本，该测试将威胁造成的损害的严重性与其发生的可能性进行权衡。在<em class="calibre8">丹尼斯诉美国案</em>（1951 年）中，被告被判密谋组织美国共产党，其目标是通过暴力推翻政府。因为威胁造成的损害（暴力推翻）很大，尽管被告远未实现这一目标，但他们的言论根据第一修正案属于不受保护的煽动。另一方面，在<em class="calibre8">耶茨诉美国案</em>（1957 年）中，共产党官员仅因提倡和教导暴力推翻政府的必要性而被定罪。与<em class="calibre8">丹尼斯案</em>不同，他们的行为旨在传授教义，而不是组织行动，因此不符合宪法。</p><p class="noindent">In the 1950s the Court employed a balancing version of the clear and present danger test that weighed the gravity of the harm threatened against the likelihood of its occurrence. In <em class="calibre8">Dennis v. United States</em> (1951) defendants were convicted of conspiring to organize the Communist Party of the United States, the goal of which was to overthrow the government by violence. Because the harm threatened (violent overthrow) was great, even though the defendants were improbably far from achieving it, their speech was unprotected incitement under the First Amendment. In <em class="calibre8">Yates v. United States</em> (1957), on the other hand, Communist Party officers were convicted only of advocating and teaching the need for the violent overthrow of the government. Unlike in <em class="calibre8">Dennis</em>, their conduct was directed at the teaching of doctrine, not the organizing of action, so they could not constitutionally be convicted.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">最后，在1969年的“勃兰登堡诉俄亥俄州”案</em>中，最高法院摒弃了不良倾向和权衡取舍的方法，转而支持将不受保护的言论限制于那些即将构成违法行为威胁的言论的标准。最高法院裁定，“禁止或禁止鼓吹使用武力或违法行为，除非此类鼓吹旨在煽动或引发即将发生的违法行为，并且很可能煽动或引发此类行为” ，否则将违宪。在一群戴着头巾、持枪的三K党成员集会期间发表的种族主义言论受到保护，因为它并没有“引导一群人采取暴力行动”。任何思想的倡导都是受保护的言论，任何行动的倡导也都受到保护，除非其意图是导致违法，并且很可能造成违法行为。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Finally, in 1969 in <em class="calibre8">Brandenburg v. Ohio</em> the Court rejected the bad tendency and balancing approaches in favor of a standard that limited unprotected speech to speech that imminently threatened unlawfulness. The Court held that it would be unconstitutional “to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such actions.” Racist speech made during a rally of hooded, gun-toting Ku Klux Klan members was protected because it was not “preparing a group for violent action.” Advocacy of any idea is protected speech, and advocacy of any action is protected unless it was made with the intent to cause a violation of the law and it is very likely to do so.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>与第一次世界大战、20世纪20年代的红色恐慌和50年代的麦卡锡主义一样，自2001年9月11日袭击事件以来，《第一修正案》一直面临压力。加强安全防范未来袭击的必要性，以及可能对美国境内外的暗影敌人发动无限期的反恐战争，对言论自由和其他公民自由构成了新的挑战。我们对宪法保护重要性的理解日趋成熟的一个标志是，即使在战时，政府的过度反应也比以往有所限制。正如法律学者杰弗里·斯通所指出的，尤金·德布斯在1912年作为社会党总统候选人获得了近百万张选票，却在第一次世界大战期间因妨碍军队征兵而被捕、受审并被定罪，但考虑对民主党总统候选人霍华德·迪恩因反对伊拉克战争而进行类似的起诉却是不切实际的。之后<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_76" class="calibre4"></a>2005年7月7日伦敦地铁爆炸案发生后，英国首相托尼·布莱尔提议制定新法律，将“纵容、美化或辩护”恐怖主义定为犯罪，并授权政府关闭用于“煽动恐怖主义”的清真寺。美国从未认真考虑过类似的措施，根据<em class="calibre8">勃兰登堡</em>检验标准，这些措施无疑违宪。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As during World War I, the Red Scare of the 1920s, and the McCarthyism of the 1950s, the First Amendment has been under stress since the attacks of September 11, 2001. The need to increase security against future attacks and the prospect of a war on terrorism of indefinite duration against shadowy enemies within and outside the United States pose new challenges for free speech and other civil liberties. One sign of the maturation of our understanding of the importance of constitutional protections even in wartime is that government overreaction has been limited, compared to earlier eras. As legal scholar Geoffrey Stone pointed out, Eugene Debs, who had received almost a million votes as the Socialist Party candidate for president in 1912, was arrested, tried, and convicted during World War I for obstructing army recruitment, but it was implausible to consider an analogous prosecution of Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean for opposing the Iraq War. After <a class="calibre4"></a>the July 7, 2005 subway bombings in London, British Prime Minister Tony Blair proposed new laws that would make “condoning, glorifying or justifying” terrorism a crime and that would enable the government to shut down mosques used “for fomenting terrorism.” No comparable measures were seriously considered in the United States, and they would surely be unconstitutional under the <em class="calibre8">Brandenburg</em> test.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，第一修正案的保护从来都不是完全稳固的，尤其是在危机时期。布什政府提出并由国会迅速颁布了《美国爱国者法案》，以扩大政府的调查权力；政府在战时主张新的行政权力（将在<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.n0117" href="#text/part0008_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-2" class="calibre4">第二章</a>中讨论）；并且在“9·11”事件后，政府立即拘留了数千名没有具体证据证明其与恐怖分子有联系的外国人。《爱国者法案》之后，其他法规也扩大了国家安全局秘密监控通信的权力；奥巴马政府积极行使这些权力。然而，这些措施在公众、国会和法院引发的争议，体现了公民自由传统的韧性。斯通教授恰当地引用了路易斯·布兰代斯大法官的话，他在1927年的<em class="calibre8">惠特尼诉加利福尼亚州</em>案中写道：“恐惧滋生压迫”，但“勇气是自由的秘诀”。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>First Amendment protections are never entirely secure, however, particularly in times of crisis. The Bush administration proposed and Congress quickly enacted the USA PATRIOT Act to expand the government’s investigative powers, the administration asserted new executive powers in wartime (discussed in <a href="#text/part0008_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-2" class="calibre4">Chapter 2</a>), and, immediately after 9/11, it detained thousands of noncitizens without specific evidence of their ties to the terrorists. The PATRIOT Act was followed by other statutes that expanded the powers of the National Security Agency to monitor communications in secret, and the Obama administration used those powers aggressively. Yet the resilience of the civil liberties tradition was demonstrated by the controversy these measures generated among the public, in Congress, and in the courts. Professor Stone aptly quoted Justice Louis Brandeis, who wrote in <em class="calibre8">Whitney v. California</em> (1927) “fear breeds repression” but “courage is the secret to liberty.”</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0009_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-3-div1-6"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0014" class="calibre1">宪法如何保护宗教自由？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0014" class="calibre1">How Does the Constitution Protect Freedom of Religion?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">美国人视宗教自由为最重要的自由之一，事实也的确如此。宪法包含三项关于宗教自由的规定。第六条规定：“任何宗教测试不得作为担任合众国任何公职或公职的资格要求。” 在其起草之时，这可谓一项非凡的创新；在英国和整个殖民地，要求公职人员宣誓信仰某一特定宗教作为担任公职的必要条件，这在当时十分常见。第一修正案的宗教保护包含两项条款，分别涉及宗教自由的不同组成部分：“国会不得制定关于下列事项的法律：确立国教或禁止信奉宗教的自由……” 这两项宗教条款分别被称为“<em class="calibre8">国教条款</em>”和“<em class="calibre8">信奉宗教的自由条款”。</em>（与言论自由条款一样，尽管宗教条款明确限制了国会的权力，但它们也适用于联邦政府和州政府的所有活动。）</p><p class="noindent">Americans think of freedom of religion as one of our most important liberties, and it is. The Constitution contains three provisions on religious liberty. Article VI provides that “no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.” At the time of its drafting this was an extraordinary innovation; it was common in England and throughout the colonies to require that office holders swear their belief in a particular religion as a requirement of public office. The religious protections of the First Amendment are contained in two clauses that speak to different components of freedom of religion: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof....” The two religion clauses are referred to as the <em class="calibre8">establishment clause</em> and the <em class="calibre8">free exercise clause.</em> (As with the free speech clause, although the religion clauses expressly limit the power of the Congress they have been applied to all activities of government, federal and state.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>从根本上讲，建立条款和自由行使条款被解读为以不同但互补的方式保护宗教自由。建立条款禁止政府设立国教或利用政府权力<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_77" class="calibre4"></a>支持特定宗教，而宗教自由条款则禁止政府干涉个人的宗教选择。通过禁止国家支持宗教，国教条款赋予个人更大的宗教选择自由；通过将宗教信仰和实践纳入个人选择的范围，宗教自由条款降低了宗教成为国家权力领域的可能性。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At a basic level, the establishment clause and the free exercise clause have been interpreted to protect religious liberty in different but complementary ways. The establishment clause prevents the government from establishing a state religion or using the powers of the government to <a class="calibre4"></a>support a particular religion, and the free exercise clause prohibits the government from intruding on individual religious choices. By forbidding state support of religion, the establishment clause gives greater latitude to an individual’s exercise of religious choice, and by committing religious belief and practice to the realm of individual choice, the free exercise clause reduces the possibility that religion will become an area of state power.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最高法院在<em class="calibre8">“和散那-塔博尔福音路德教会及学校诉平等就业机会委员会案”</em>（2012）中注意到了政教分离条款与自由行使条款之间的相互作用。谢丽尔·佩里奇（Cheryl Perich）是教会学校的一名教师，患上了嗜睡症，并因残疾请了病假。当她试图重返工作岗位时，学校告诉她已被替换。当她威胁要采取法律行动时，学校撤销了她的“任教资格”并解雇了她。平等就业机会委员会代表她提起诉讼，声称政府的报复行为违反了《美国残疾人法案》。法院承认该法案存在一项“牧师例外”，根据该例外，政府不能干预教会牧师的聘用和解雇，包括宗教学校的“受命”教师。此类干预将违反政教分离条款，因为它将政府卷入教会决策；也将违反自由行使条款，因为它将限制宗教团体通过任命神职人员来塑造其信仰的权利。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Supreme Court noted the interaction of the establishment clause and the free exercise clauses in <em class="calibre8">Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</em> (2012). Cheryl Perich, a teacher at a church school, developed narcolepsy and took a disability leave. When she tried to return to work the school told her that she had been replaced. When she threatened legal action the school revoked her “call” to teach and terminated her. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued on her behalf, claiming retaliation in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Court recognized a “ministerial exception” to the Act, under which the government could not intervene in the hiring and firing of a church’s ministers, including “called” teachers at a religious school. Such intervention would violate the establishment clause because it would involve the government in ecclesiastical decisions and would violate the free exercise clause because it would limit a religious group’s right to shape its faith through the appointment of its clergy.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>宗教自由对于我们理解美国生活方式至关重要，以至于最高法院直到20世纪中叶才处理了少数宗教案件，这或许令人惊讶。当然，到那时，政府的职能已大大扩展；各州和联邦政府都开始监管、干预并提供资金支持一系列此前完全由私营部门负责的活动。如此一来，建立宗教条款和宗教自由行使条款之间的潜在冲突便显而易见。如果一个州为宗教学校的学生提供特殊教育服务，这难道不是在支持宗教的建立吗？但如果不这样做，这是否剥夺了那些因信仰迫于无奈而将子女送入宗教学校的家长的宗教自由？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Freedom of religion is so fundamental to our understanding of the American way of life that it may be surprising that the Supreme Court dealt with few religion cases until the middle of the twentieth century. By then, of course, the role of government had vastly expanded; states as well as the federal government regulated, intervened in, and financially supported a host of activities that previously had been wholly committed to the private sector. In doing so, the potential conflict between the establishment clause and the free exercise clause became apparent. If a state provides special education services to students in a religious school, isn’t it supporting an establishment of religion? But if it does not, is it abridging the free exercise of religion by parents whose beliefs compel them to send their children to religious school?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>为了解决此类冲突，我们可以将宗教条款视为政府与宗教关系指导原则的产物。正如法律复杂领域常见的情况一样，这些原则并不一定前后一致，也不一定能为所有案件的裁决提供清晰的指导，但它们可以为我们指明方向。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To resolve conflicts like this we might think of the religion clauses as motivated by some guiding principles about the relationship between the government and religion. As usual in complex areas of the law, the principles won’t necessarily be consistent or provide clear guides to deciding all the cases, but they can get us started.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>首要原则是，宗教是自愿选择的领域。一个人可以选择自己想要信奉的信仰，也可以选择不信奉。<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_78" class="calibre4"></a>信奉任何信仰。国家不得强迫或阻碍这一选择。对宗教机构的支持必须是自愿的。如同言论自由领域的思想市场一样，也必须有一个信仰和实践的市场，在这个市场中，宗教的兴衰取决于其吸引支持者的能力，不受国家阻碍或支持。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A first principle is that religion is a realm of voluntary choice. A person can choose the faith she wishes to observe or can choose not to <a class="calibre4"></a>observe any faith at all. The state may neither compel nor encumber that choice. And support of religious institutions must be voluntary. Like the marketplace of ideas in the free speech area, there must be a marketplace of faith and practice, in which religions flourish or wither depending on their ability to attract supporters, free of state encumbrance or support.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第二个原则是，宗教与政府是两个独立的领域。这一原则比禁止设立国教的原则更为广泛。政府应完全避免介入或卷入宗教事务。这一原则最有力的应用是，国家不得动用税收资助宗教机构或宗教活动。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A second principle is that religion and government are two separate spheres. This principle is broader than the prohibition on the establishment of a state religion. The government should avoid involvement or entanglement in religious affairs entirely. The strongest application of this principle is that the state may not use tax dollars to fund religious institutions or religious activities.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第三项原则是政府应在宗教问题上保持中立。政府不应偏袒或排斥某一宗教，也不应偏袒宗教活动而非非宗教活动，反之亦然。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A third principle is that the government should be neutral as to religion. It should not favor or disfavor one religion over another, nor should it give preferences to religious activities over nonreligious activities, or vice versa.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>所有这些原则都贯穿于最高法院解释宗教条款的尝试之中。最高法院分别关注建立国教条款和自由行使条款，而评估政府根据每个条款采取的行动的标准也随着时间的推移而发生了变化。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>All of these principles have circulated through the Supreme Court’s attempts to interpret the religion clauses. The Court focuses separately on the establishment and free exercise clauses, and the standards used to evaluate government action under each clause have changed over time.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>建立宗教条款的核心含义毋庸置疑：政府不得设立官方宗教。在我们看来，这显然是一个正确的原则，但许多其他国家，甚至像英国这样的自由民主国家，都有官方宗教。该原则的一个必然结果是，政府不得通过提供财政援助、公共服务或官方认可等方式支持宗教机构。正如布莱克大法官在1947年<em class="calibre8">埃弗森诉尤因镇教育委员会</em>案中所解释的那样：“用杰斐逊的话来说，禁止通过法律确立宗教的条款旨在建立‘政教分离的墙’。” 近期，史蒂文斯大法官强调“宗教冲突对我们祖先移民到这片大陆的决定，以及巴尔干半岛、北爱尔兰和中东邻国相互不信任的决定的影响。每当我们从这堵旨在分离宗教和政府的墙上拆下一块砖，就会增加宗教冲突的风险，削弱我们民主的基础”（<em class="calibre8">泽尔曼诉西蒙斯-哈里斯案</em>，2002年，持不同意见）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The establishment clause has an indisputable core meaning: The government may not establish an official religion. This seems like an obviously correct principle to us, but many other countries have official religions, even liberal democracies such as the United Kingdom. A corollary to that principle is that government may not provide its support to religious institutions by providing financial aid, public services, or official endorsement. As Justice Black explained in <em class="calibre8">Everson v. Board of Education of Ewing Township</em> in 1947, “In the words of Jefferson, the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect ‘a wall of separation between church and State.’” More recently, Justice Stevens emphasized “the impact of religious strife on the decisions of our forebears to migrate to this continent, and on the decisions of neighbors in the Balkans, Northern Ireland, and the Middle East to mistrust one another. Whenever we remove a brick from the wall that was designed to separate religion and government, we increase the risk of religious strife and weaken the foundation of our democracy” (dissenting in <em class="calibre8">Zelman v. Simmons-Harris</em>, 2002).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>根据这一标准，有些案件很容易处理。州政府不能援助国教，所以如果浸信会教堂被烧毁，州政府不能拨款重建。但是，既然火势还在燃烧，市消防部门能灭火吗？或者说，这算不算动用税收和公职人员来援助宗教？答案显然是，消防部门可以为宗教机构提供同等水平的服务。<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_79" class="calibre4"></a>就像非宗教机构一样。火灾警报响起时，相关的法律类别不是“教堂”，而是“着火的建筑”，因此，即使税收被用于援助宗教活动，灭火并不会突破隔离墙。扑灭火灾不会使州政府卷入宗教事务，也不会违反州政府对宗教的中立立场。不过，许多案件更加棘手。超级风暴桑迪袭击美国东北部后，国会拨款用于重建沿海受损财产。这些资金是否可以用于重建礼拜堂以及住宅和商业地产？相关的法律类别是“风暴损坏的建筑”还是“礼拜堂”？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Under this standard, some cases are easy. The state cannot aid an established church, so if a Baptist church burns down, state funds cannot be appropriated to rebuild it. But as the fire is burning, can a municipal fire department put out the fire, or would that be using tax money and public employees to aid religion? The answer obviously is that the fire department can provide the same level of service to a religious institution <a class="calibre4"></a>as to a nonreligious institution. The relevant legal category when the fire alarm rings is not “church” but rather “building on fire,” so extinguishing the fire doesn’t breach the wall of separation, even though tax dollars are being used to aid a religious activity. Putting out a fire doesn’t entangle the state in religious matters or violate the state’s neutrality toward religion. Many cases are more difficult, though. After Superstorm Sandy struck the Northeast, Congress appropriated funds for rebuilding damaged property along the coast. Could those funds be used to rebuild houses of worship as well as homes and commercial properties? Is the relevant legal category “storm-damaged building” or “house of worship”?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最高法院表示，“分界线远非‘墙’，而是一道模糊、不明显且可变的屏障，取决于特定关系的所有情况”（<em class="calibre8">莱蒙诉库兹曼案，1971 年）。更棘手的案件涉及政府支持或以其他方式影响社会机构和社区生活的多种方式。最高法院在</em><em class="calibre8">莱蒙诉库兹曼案</em>中界定了允许的政府活动的界限，说明了影响宗教的政府活动何时不违反建国条款：“首先，法规必须具有世俗的立法目的；其次，其主要或基本效果不得促进或抑制宗教；最后，法规不得促进与宗教的过度纠缠。”目的-效果-纠缠检验提供了一些指导，但难以应用。（一些学者表示，<em class="calibre8">莱蒙</em>检验的名称很贴切。）现任最高法院的大多数法官都批评了<em class="calibre8">莱蒙</em>检验，但并未明确否定它。正如斯卡利亚大法官所言，“当我们希望废除一种被禁止的做法时，我们会援引它；当我们希望维护一种被禁止的做法时，我们会完全忽略它”（<em class="calibre8">Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School District</em>，1993 年）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Court has said that “the line of separation, far from being a ‘wall,’ is a blurred, indistinct, and variable barrier, depending on all the circumstances of a particular relationship” (<em class="calibre8">Lemon v. Kurtzman</em>, 1971). Harder cases involve the many ways that government supports or otherwise influences social institutions and community life. It defined the bounds of permissible government activities in <em class="calibre8">Lemon v. Kurtzman</em>, describing when government activity that affected religion did not violate the establishment clause: “First, the statute must have a secular legislative purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion; finally, the statute must not foster an excessive entanglement with religion.” The purpose-effect-entanglement test provides some guidance but has been difficult to apply. (Some scholars have said the <em class="calibre8">Lemon</em> test was appropriately named.) Most of the justices on the current Court have criticized the <em class="calibre8">Lemon</em> test without expressly repudiating it. As Justice Scalia noted, “When we wish to strike down a practice it forbids, we invoke it; when we wish to uphold a practice it forbids, we ignore it entirely” (<em class="calibre8">Lamb’s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School District</em>, 1993).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>自20世纪90年代末以来，法院多数法官强调中立原则，而非卷入的可能性或国家对宗教的认可。在政府福利和服务无处不在的今天，政府以与其他实体相同的方式向宗教实体提供财政支持或其他援助并不违反建国条款。如果州立大学使用学生活动费的收益来资助学生出版物，则建国条款禁止其歧视宗教出版物；资助这些出版物并非认可某种观点或资助宗教，而只是对宗教和非宗教团体一视同仁（<em class="calibre8">罗森伯格诉弗吉尼亚大学校长和访客案</em>，1995年）。<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_80" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Since the late 1990s, a majority of the Court has emphasized the neutrality principle rather than the possibility of entanglement or the perception of state endorsement of religion. In a world of pervasive government benefits and services, the government does not violate the establishment clause by providing financial support or other aid to religious entities on the same basis as it does to others. Where a state university used the proceeds of a student activities fee to fund student publications, it was prevented by the establishment clause from discriminating against religious publications; in funding those publications, it was not endorsing a viewpoint or aiding religion but only treating religious and nonreligious groups the same (<em class="calibre8">Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia</em>, 1995).<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>一个产生大量案件的领域是对非公立学校（主要是宗教学校）的公共援助。法院根据<em class="calibre8">莱蒙</em>检验标准，裁定州政府不能为宗教学校支付世俗科目的教科书费用，但可以向宗教学校学生提供世俗科目的教科书；州政府不能支付世俗科目教师的工资，但可以派遣公立学校的工作人员为非公立学校进行言语和听力测试，并在中立地点为宗教学校学生提供补习和指导服务。法院再次强调中立性，支持派遣公立学校教师到教区学校为弱势儿童进行补习，并支持向非公立学校借出图书馆书籍、电脑和其他教育材料的计划。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One area that has generated a large number of cases is public aid to nonpublic—principally religious—schools. Applying the <em class="calibre8">Lemon</em> test, the Court held the state could not pay for textbooks in secular subjects in religious schools but it could lend textbooks for secular subjects to religious school students, and it could not pay the salaries of teachers of secular subjects but it could provide public school personnel for speech and hearing tests at nonpublic schools and remedial and guidance services to religious school students at neutral sites. With its new emphasis on neutrality, the Court has upheld sending public school teachers to parochial schools for remedial instruction of disadvantaged children and a program that loaned library books, computers, and other educational materials to nonpublic schools.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最具争议的问题涉及学校代金券计划，该计划由州政府向学生提供经济援助，用于支付非公立学校的学费。俄亥俄州为克利夫兰市制定了一项代金券计划，根据该计划，家长可以根据经济需要为子女入读任何学校并获得学费援助。事实上，96%受益于该计划的学校都是教区学校。尽管如此，最高法院多数法官伦奎斯特在一份意见书中裁定，该计划并不违反建国条款（<em class="calibre8">泽尔曼诉西蒙斯-哈里斯案</em>，2002年）。伦奎斯特认为，纵观克利夫兰的整个公立教育体系，而不仅仅是代金券计划，该计划“在各个方面都对宗教持中立态度”。持不同意见的苏特大法官则认为，问题在于代金券计划，而不是整个教育体系，而且该计划并非中立，因为它允许使用税金“在犹太学校教授与以色列的契约和摩西律法，在天主教学校教授使徒彼得的首要地位和教皇制度，在新教学校教授改革基督教的真理，以及在穆斯林学校教授先知的启示”。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The most contentious issue has concerned school voucher programs, in which the state provides financial aid to students that can be used to pay tuition at nonpublic schools. Ohio enacted a voucher program for the city of Cleveland under which parents could enroll their children in any school and receive tuition aid according to financial need. In fact, 96 percent of the schools receiving benefits from the program were parochial schools. Nevertheless, the Court majority, in an opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, held that the program did not violate the establishment clause (<em class="calibre8">Zelman v. Simmons-Harris</em>, 2002). Looking at Cleveland’s entire system of public education, not just the voucher program, he regarded the program as “neutral in all respects toward religion.” Justice Souter in dissent argued that the issue was the voucher program, not the entire education system, and the program was not neutral, because it allowed the use of tax money “for teaching the covenant with Israel and Mosaic law in Jewish schools, the primacy of the Apostle Peter and the Papacy in Catholic schools, the truth of reformed Christianity in Protestant schools, and the revelation to the Prophet in Muslim schools.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>另一个持续存在争议的领域涉及具有宗教意义的公共展示，例如圣诞节展示。当然，建国条款的核心是政府不得赞助或支持宗教活动，因此城市不得设立基督诞生塑像或犹太烛台作为其宗教信仰的象征。但假设一个市政当局设立或允许一些不太明显地支持某一宗教的展示。在许多案件中，法院根据后来被称为“塑料驯鹿原则”的原则评估了在公共财产上进行节日展示的行为。在县法院台阶上放置耶稣诞生场景构成政府对宗教的认可，违反了建国条款，但包括圣诞树、犹太烛台和庆祝“向自由致敬”的标志的节日展示，或包括拉着圣诞老人雪橇的塑料驯鹿的圣诞节展示则不构成建国条款，因为它是<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_81" class="calibre4"></a>庆祝节日季节（<em class="calibre8">Lynch v. Donnelly</em>，1984 年；<em class="calibre8">Allegheny County v. ACLU</em>，1989 年）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Another area of continuing controversy has involved public displays of religious significance, such as Christmas displays. The core of the establishment clause, of course, is that the government may not sponsor or endorse religious activities, so a city could not erect a crèche or a menorah as a symbol of its religious observance. But suppose a municipality erects or allows displays that less obviously endorse one religion. In a number of cases the Court evaluated holiday displays on public property under what became known as the “plastic reindeer doctrine.” Placing a nativity scene on the steps of a county courthouse constituted a government endorsement of religion in violation of the establishment clause, but a holiday display including a Christmas tree, a menorah, and a sign celebrating a “Salute to Liberty” or a Christmas display including plastic reindeer pulling Santa’s sleigh did not because it was a <a class="calibre4"></a>celebration of the holiday season (<em class="calibre8">Lynch v. Donnelly</em>, 1984; <em class="calibre8">Allegheny County v. ACLU</em>, 1989).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>阿拉巴马州首席大法官罗伊·摩尔下令在州司法大楼的圆形大厅放置一块重达两吨半的花岗岩十诫雕刻品，以展示其作为我们法律体系基石的重要性。此后，十诫的展示成为最具争议的公共展示类型。联邦法院下令拆除这座纪念碑，但摩尔拒绝了，此举导致他被州司法伦理委员会免职。美国最高法院拒绝审理摩尔的案件，但在 2005 年，它通过两起案件解决了这一根本问题。在<em class="calibre8">肯塔基州麦克雷里县诉美国公民自由联盟案中，</em>法院得出结论，在县法院展示十诫，起初是单独展示，后来为了预防诉讼，还附有其他历史和宗教文本，这样做是出于宗教目的，而不是世俗目的。例如，在放置其中一件展品时，县官员指出，肯塔基州众议院曾以基督教的隆重仪式休会，以“纪念和尊敬伦理王子耶稣基督”，并表示“同意……罗伊·摩尔法官的观点”。尽管各县声称其世俗目的是强调十诫作为我国法律基础的历史意义，但鉴于展示的性质以及他们的言论和行动，法院认为这种说法是虚假的。另一方面，在<em class="calibre8">范奥登诉佩里案</em>中，法院的另一个多数派（布雷耶大法官在每起案件中都投了决定票）支持在德克萨斯州议会大厦内展示十诫纪念碑。这座纪念碑是代表该州政治和法律历史的十七座纪念碑和二十一座历史标记之一，它是由一个世俗组织在四十年前设立的，因此不在当前关于《十诫》的争议范围之内，因此不应将其解读为州政府对宗教的认可。并非所有宗教象征的展示都违反了政教分离条款；正如最高法院指出的那样，其法庭上就曾出现一幅摩西手持石板的画像，旁边还有一幅描绘其他立法者的雕带。《十诫》作为法律和道德的源泉，具有重要的历史意义，在评估其展示时，背景至关重要。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The display of the Ten Commandments became the most controversial type of public display after Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore ordered the placement of a two-and-a-half-ton granite carving of the Ten Commandments in the rotunda of the state’s judicial building to demonstrate its significance as the foundation of our legal system. A federal court ordered the monument’s removal but Moore refused, an act that led to his removal from the bench by the state judicial ethics panel. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear Moore’s case, but in 2005 it addressed the underlying issue in a pair of cases. In <em class="calibre8">McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky</em> the Court concluded that the display of the Ten Commandments in county courthouses, first by themselves and then, to forestall litigation, accompanied by other historical and religious texts, had a religious rather than a secular purpose. In placing one of the exhibits, for example, county officials noted that the Kentucky House of Representatives had once adjourned with a Christian flourish “in remembrance and honor of Jesus Christ, the Prince of Ethics” and they stated they “agree with...Judge [Roy] Moore.” Although the counties claimed a secular purpose of emphasizing the historical significance of the Ten Commandments as the basis of our laws, in light of the nature of the display and their statements and actions the Court regarded that claim as a sham. In <em class="calibre8">Van Orden v. Perry</em>, on the other hand, a different majority of the Court (with Justice Breyer providing the deciding vote in each case) upheld the display of a Ten Commandments monument on the Texas State Capitol grounds. The monument was one of seventeen monuments and twenty-one historical markers on the grounds representing the state’s political and legal history, and it had been placed by a secular organization forty years earlier and thus outside the scope of the current controversy over the Ten Commandments, so it need not be read as a state endorsement of religion. Not every display of a religious symbol violated the establishment clause; as the Court noted, its own courtroom included a depiction of Moses holding the tablets among a frieze depicting other lawgivers. The Ten Commandments have historical significance as a source of law and morality, and in evaluating their display, context is crucial.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>自由行使条款的基本原则与建国条款的基本原则一样清晰。正如罗伯特·杰克逊大法官在1943年<em class="calibre8">西弗吉尼亚州教育委员会诉巴内特</em>案中所说：</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The basic principle of the free exercise clause is as clear as the basic principle of the establishment clause. As Justice Robert Jackson said in <em class="calibre8">West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette</em> (1943):</p>
<p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如果说我们的宪法星座中有什么恒星，那就是没有任何官员，无论高低贵贱，能够规定什么是正统的。<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_82" class="calibre4"></a>政治、民族主义、宗教或其他观点问题，或强迫公民以言语或行为表达其信仰。</p><p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in <a class="calibre4"></a>politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em class="calibre8">巴内特案</em>涉及西弗吉尼亚州的一项法令，该法令要求所有学生向国旗宣誓效忠。巴内特家的孩子被学校开除，原因是他们是耶和华见证人，宗教信仰不允许他们向雕像致敬。法院在1943年6月14日国旗纪念日的判决中裁定，该法令违反了自由行使条款。州政府不能因为巴内特家的良心行为而惩罚他们。</p><p class="noindent"><em class="calibre8">Barnette</em> involved a West Virginia statute that required all schoolchildren to recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag. The Barnette children were expelled from school because, as Jehovah’s Witnesses, their religious convictions prevented them from paying homage to a graven image. In its decision—on Flag Day, June 14, 1943—the Court held the statute violated the free exercise clause. The state could not punish the Barnettes for acting in a manner required by their conscience.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>巴内特原则（ <em class="calibre8">Barnette</em> Principle）——政府不得强制良心行为——已得到广泛认可，并已应用于其他情况，例如禁止在学校强制祈祷（出声或默祷）或诵读圣经。但大多数关于宗教自由的争议都涉及宗教良心行为，这些行为违反了并非针对这些行为本身的法律，或使行为人无法获得政府福利。例如，假设某人的宗教信仰完全遵循圣经中“以眼还眼”的诫命，以至于他在一场车祸中部分失明后，戳瞎了对方司机的眼睛。他会因为遵循宗教教义而被起诉吗？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The <em class="calibre8">Barnette</em> principle, that government may not compel acts of conscience, is well established and has been applied in other situations, forbidding, for example, mandatory prayer (vocal or silent) or Bible reading in school. But most free exercise disputes involve acts of religious conscience that violate laws not directed at the acts themselves or that disadvantage the actor from receiving a government benefit. Suppose, for example, that a person’s religion takes literally the Biblical injunction of “an eye for an eye” so that, having been partially blinded in an automobile accident, he pokes out the eye of the other driver. Can he be prosecuted for following the dictates of his religion?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法官们对此类案件适用的标准一直存在分歧。在<em class="calibre8">谢伯特诉弗纳案</em>（1963年）中，法院设计了一项平衡测试。如果挑战者证明某项法律严重加重了其宗教信仰自由的负担，政府必须提供令人信服的利益来证明该法律的合理性。然后，法院将权衡自由信仰的负担与政府利益，以及豁免挑战者将对政府造成的损害程度。在<em class="calibre8">谢伯特案</em>中，法院推翻了一项拒绝向拒绝在周六工作的基督复临安息日会教友提供失业补偿金的规定。该规定给她的宗教信仰带来了沉重的负担，而州政府的利益——防止欺诈性索赔——可以通过其他方式得到满足。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The justices have disagreed about the standard to be applied to decide cases like this. In <em class="calibre8">Sherbert v. Verner</em> (1963) the Court devised a balancing test. If a challenger showed that a law substantially burdened the free exercise of her religion, the government must offer a compelling interest that justified the law. The Court would then balance the burden on free exercise against the government interest and the extent to which it would be harmed by exempting the challenger. In <em class="calibre8">Sherbert</em> the Court struck down a rule that denied unemployment compensation benefits to a Seventh-Day Adventist who refused to work on Saturday. The rule imposed a significant burden on her religious exercise, and the state’s interest—to prevent fraudulent claims—could be served in other ways.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">然而，在就业部门诉史密斯案</em>（1990）中，法院改变了判决，“普遍适用的、宗教中立的法律，如果对某一宗教习俗产生加重负担的效果，无需以令人信服的政府利益为依据”——即使该法律对某一宗教习俗产生附带影响。如果一项法律不是针对宗教习俗，而是平等地适用于所有人，那么它并不违反宗教自由条款。在<em class="calibre8">史密斯案</em>中，因在宗教仪式中使用佩奥特而被解雇的戒毒顾问无权获得国家失业救济金，因为他们违反了一项对宗教中立、对所有工人普遍适用的规定。<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_83" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In <em class="calibre8">Employment Division v. Smith</em> (1990), however, a changed Court held that “generally applicable, religion-neutral laws that have the effect of burdening a particular religious practice need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest”—even if the law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious practice. If a law is not directed at religious practice and applies to all persons equally, it does not violate the free exercise clause. In <em class="calibre8">Smith</em>, drug rehabilitation counselors who were fired because they used peyote in a religious ceremony were not entitled to state unemployment benefits because they violated a rule that was neutral as to religion and of general application to all workers.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">Sherbert诉Verner案</em>的平衡检验标准似乎比<em class="calibre8">Smith</em>检验标准更加包容宗教自由，但法院明显不愿根据任何一项检验标准宣布基于宗教自由的立法无效。例如，在<em class="calibre8">Sherbert</em>案中，法院支持阿米什人雇主参与社会保障体系的要求，尽管存在宗教反对意见；拒绝给予正统犹太军官空军穿着非制服服装（包括犹太小帽）的豁免权；并支持税法中拒绝给予基于种族歧视的学校免税资格的规定，即使这种歧视是出于宗教动机。事实上，法院仅在三起案件中裁定，宗教自由条款因其宗教信仰而使个人免受普遍适用法律的约束。一类案件涉及非自愿的信仰宣誓，例如<em class="calibre8">Barnette</em>案等向国旗敬礼的案件；这些案件既涉及言论自由，也涉及宗教主张。第二类案件涉及就业情况，例如<em class="calibre8">Sherbert</em>诉<em class="calibre8">Smith</em>案。继<em class="calibre8">谢伯特案</em>之后，法院裁定，如果人们因为宗教信仰而无法满足领取失业补偿金的条件，州政府有义务免除他们的至少部分条件。在“和<em class="calibre8">散那-塔博尔福音路德教会及学校诉平等</em>就业机会委员会案”中，法院运用宗教自由条款和国教条款，允许宗教机构在聘用和解雇神职人员时免受就业歧视法的约束。第三个例外是<em class="calibre8">威斯康星州诉约德</em>案（1972年）。在该案中，法院裁定威斯康星州不能要求阿米什人的父母违反他们的宗教信仰，将孩子送往八年级以上的学校。法院后来认为，这一判决不仅基于宗教自由条款，还基于扩大的隐私权，这将在下一节中讨论。州政府的迫切利益在于确保青少年成长为公民和社会成员，但将八年级的正规学校教育与阿米什儿童在家中和社区接受的培训相结合，被认为满足了州政府的利益。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The balancing test of <em class="calibre8">Sherbert v. Verner</em> seems much more accommodating to religious liberty than the <em class="calibre8">Smith</em> test, but the Court has been markedly unwilling to invalidate legislation on a free exercise basis under either test. Under <em class="calibre8">Sherbert</em>, for example, it upheld the requirement that an Amish employer participate in the Social Security system despite religious objections, refused to grant an orthodox Jewish officer an exemption to the Air Force’s ban on wearing nonuniform clothing, including a yarmulke, and upheld the provision of the tax laws that denies tax-exempt status to schools that discriminate on the basis of race, even if the discrimination is religiously motivated. In fact, the Court has held in only three situations that the free exercise clause exempts individuals from generally applicable laws because of their religious convictions. One type of case involves an involuntary profession of belief, as in the flag salute cases such as <em class="calibre8">Barnette</em>; those cases involve free speech claims as well as religion claims. The second type of case concerns employment situations, as in <em class="calibre8">Sherbert</em> and <em class="calibre8">Smith</em>. Following <em class="calibre8">Sherbert</em>, the Court held that a state is required to exempt persons from at least some of the conditions for receiving unemployment compensation benefits if they cannot satisfy the conditions because of religious convictions, and in <em class="calibre8">Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC</em> the Court used the free exercise clause and the establishment clause to grant religious institutions an exception from employment discrimination laws in the hiring and firing of their clergy. The third exception is the singular case of <em class="calibre8">Wisconsin v. Yoder</em> (1972). There the Court held that Wisconsin could not require Amish parents to send their children to school beyond the eighth grade in violation of their religious beliefs. The Court later characterized this decision as resting not only on the free exercise clause but also on the expanded right of privacy, which is discussed in the next section. The state’s compelling interest was in assuring the development of adolescents as citizens and members of society, but the combination of formal schooling through the eighth grade and the training Amish children received at home and in their community was deemed to satisfy the state’s interests.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0009_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-3-div1-7"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0015" class="calibre1">宪法还保护哪些其他权利？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0015" class="calibre1">What Other Rights Are Protected by the Constitution?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">宪法保护着许多其他重要权利。其中一些保护措施如今已过时。第三修正案禁止政府下令房主在和平时期或战时为士兵提供宿舍，除非法律另有规定，但政府已经很久没有尝试过。其他保护措施直到最近才被明确。直到2008年，<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_84" class="calibre4"></a>最高法院最终将第二修正案解释为保障个人拥有枪支的权利。第二修正案的独特结构引发了诸多争议，因为与其他宪法条款不同，它既包含序言条款（“训练有素的民兵，为自由州的安全所必需”），又包含执行条款（“人民持有和携带武器的权利，不得侵犯”）。序言条款是否修改了执行条款，以至于携带武器的权利仅适用于民兵？在2008年<em class="calibre8">哥伦比亚特区诉海勒案</em>中，法院裁定，这项权利是一项与民兵服役无关的个人权利，因此哥伦比亚特区禁止持有手枪的法律违宪。</p><p class="noindent">The Constitution protects many other important rights. Some of the protections are now archaic. The Third Amendment prevents the government from ordering that homeowners provide quarters for soldiers in peacetime, or in wartime except as provided by law, but it has been a very long time since the government has even tried. Other protections have only recently been defined. It was not until 2008 that the <a class="calibre4"></a>Supreme Court definitively interpreted the Second Amendment to guarantee an individual right to own guns. The Second Amendment’s unusual structure had generated much debate because, like few other constitutional provisions, it contained both a prefatory clause (“A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state”) and an operative clause (“the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed”). Did the prefatory clause modify the operative clause, so the right to bear arms applied only to those in the militia? In <em class="calibre8">District of Columbia v. Heller</em> (2008) the Court ruled that the right was an individual right unrelated to militia service, so the District of Columbia law banning the possession of handguns was unconstitutional.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>保护个人权利的宪法条款虽然模糊，但其所保护的行为通常与授权保护的具体宪法条款的文本合理关联。例如，第一修正案保护言论自由，不难看出其范围可以扩大到涵盖焚烧美国国旗等非言语交流行为。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The constitutional provisions that protect individual rights are vague, but the conduct they protect is usually reasonably related to the text of the particular constitutional provision that authorizes the protection. For example, where the First Amendment protects freedom of speech, it is not too hard to see how that can be expanded to encompass nonverbal communicative acts such as burning an American flag.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>但是，最高法院裁定受宪法保护的一些较为特殊且颇具争议的自由又如何呢？宪法在哪里保障了堕胎权、在家观看淫秽物品的权利、购买避孕药具的权利，以及跨州旅行的权利？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But what about some of the more unusual and controversial liberties that the Supreme Court has decided are protected by the Constitution? Where does the Constitution guarantee the right to obtain an abortion, to view obscene materials in your home, to purchase contraceptives, or to travel from state to state?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>答案是：无处不在，又无处不在。除了第一修正案和正当程序条款等条款的具体保护外，最高法院还明确了宪法对各种基本权利的保护，包括旅行权、投票权和诉诸法庭的权利。法院还承认隐私权是宪法和我们“有序自由”体系的固有权利；隐私权包括父母照顾子女的权利、控制个人性行为和生育的权利以及做出医疗决定的权利。这些权利保护一系列个人行为和亲密关系，而这些行为和关系在其他宪法条款中不受保护。其中最具争议的当然是女性选择堕胎的权利。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The answer is: everywhere and nowhere. Beyond the specific protections of provisions such as the First Amendment and the due process clause, the Supreme Court has defined constitutional protection for a variety of fundamental rights, including the right to travel, the right to vote, and the right of access to the courts. The Court also has recognized the right of privacy as inherent in the Constitution and in our system of “ordered liberty”; the right of privacy includes the right of parents to care for their children, the right to control one’s sexual activity and reproduction, and the right to make medical decisions. These rights protect a range of personal actions and intimate associations that are otherwise not protected by particular constitutional provisions. The most controversial of these, of course, is a woman’s right to choose to have an abortion.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>宪法没有提及隐私、旅行或性行为。最高法院法官从哪里找到这些权利的文本依据？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Constitution doesn’t mention privacy, travel, or sexual activity. Where do the Supreme Court justices find a textual basis for these rights?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在一系列案件中，最高法院得出结论，宪法中对自由的特定保障是“散发性权利”或“隐性权利”的来源，而这些权利并未在宪法文本中明确体现。不同的法官强调不同的来源，但最突出的包括以下几点：<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_85" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Over a series of cases, the Court has concluded that particular constitutional guarantees of liberties are sources of “emanations” or “penumbral rights” that are not found explicitly in the text. Different justices emphasize different sources, but the most prominent include the following:<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bullet">• 第一修正案保护言论自由。为了正确行使这项权利，人们需要能够自由地学习、研究和接触他们所选择的思想。</p><p class="bullet">•&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Amendment protects freedom of expression. To properly exercise that right, people need to be able to study, learn, and be exposed to ideas as they choose.</p>
<p class="bullet">• 第一修正案也保护为实现政治目标而结社的自由。只有当一个人有权保持其结社和活动的私密性时，结社自由才能有效。</p><p class="bullet">•&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Amendment also protects the freedom to associate to achieve political objectives. Freedom of association can be effective only if a person has a right to keep his or her associations and activities private.</p>
<p class="bullet">• 第四修正案限制了政府在刑事诉讼中的权力，例如，禁止警方在没有搜查令或紧急情况下搜查个人物品。这项规定旨在防止警方的侵扰行为，但这种行为之所以具有侵扰性，很大程度上是因为人们享有模糊的个人隐私权。</p><p class="bullet">•&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fourth Amendment limits the government’s powers in the criminal process by, for example, prohibiting the police from searching a person’s belongings without a warrant or an emergency. This rule is designed to prevent intrusive police behavior, but the behavior is intrusive in large part because people have a penumbral right to personal privacy.</p>
<p class="bullet">• 第九修正案规定：“宪法所列举的某些权利，不得解释为否定或贬低人民所保留的其他权利。”关于该修正案的含义，历史上存在相当大的争议，但一些法官将其解读为假定宪法其他部分未明确规定的基本权利的存在。</p><p class="bullet">•&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ninth Amendment states: “The enumeration, in the Constitution of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” There is considerable historical dispute about the meaning of the amendment, but some justices have interpreted it as assuming the existence of fundamental rights not specified elsewhere in the Constitution.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">当法院将所有这些个人权利整合在一起时，整体大于各部分之和。这些基于文本的权利的扩展创造了一种新的隐私权，其根基在于宪法整体理解时所理解的人格视角。正如宪法学者劳伦斯·特赖布所指出的，隐私权究竟是一个“单一概念”还是“一堆互不相关的好东西”，尚不明确。无论如何表述，它催生了法官们关于人类自由的一些最响亮的言论。引用这些言论正体现了宪法赋予隐私权的重要性。</p><p class="noindent">When the Court puts together all of these individual rights, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The extension of these textually based rights creates a new right of privacy, grounded in the vision of personhood read into the Constitution when it is understood as a whole. As constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe notes, it is not clear if the right of privacy is a “unitary concept” or a “bag of unrelated goodies.” However it is framed, it has generated some of the most ringing statements of human freedom ever made by the justices. To quote them indicates the importance of the constitutional right of privacy.</p>

<p class="noindent">早期确立隐私权的两个最重要的案例是<em class="calibre8">迈耶诉内布拉斯加州案</em>（1923年）和<em class="calibre8">皮尔斯诉姊妹协会案</em>（1925年）。在<em class="calibre8">迈耶</em>案中，内布拉斯加州在本土主义狂热的驱使下，禁止八年级之前教授外语。在<em class="calibre8">皮尔斯</em>案中，俄勒冈州要求所有学生都必须就读公立学校。在这两起案件中，法院均驳回了相关立法，认为其干涉了“现代语言教师的职业发展、学生获取知识的机会以及家长控制子女教育的权力”。在<em class="calibre8">皮尔斯</em>案的类似案件中，法院将其判决适用于非宗教私立学校，表明该判决的依据并非宗教自由，而是更广泛的个人决策不受国家控制的权利。</p><p class="noindent">The two most important early cases establishing the right of privacy are <em class="calibre8">Meyer v. Nebraska</em> (1923) and <em class="calibre8">Pierce v. Society of Sisters</em> (1925). In <em class="calibre8">Meyer</em> the state of Nebraska, in a burst of nativist fervor, had forbidden the teaching of foreign languages before the eighth grade. In <em class="calibre8">Pierce</em> the state of Oregon required all students to attend public schools. In both cases the Court struck down the legislation as interfering with “the calling of modern language teachers, with the opportunities of pupils to acquire knowledge, and with the power of parents to control the education of their own.” In a companion case to <em class="calibre8">Pierce</em> the Court applied its holding to nonreligious private schools, demonstrating that the basis of the decision was not freedom of religion but a broader right to be free of state control in making personal decisions.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">迈耶</em>和<em class="calibre8">皮尔斯</em>论证了父母关心子女教育的重要性。这是对家庭关系（包括婚姻）更广泛关注的一部分，也是隐私权的一部分。在<em class="calibre8">洛文诉弗吉尼亚州</em>（1967 年）案中，法院宣布弗吉尼亚州禁止黑人和白人通婚的法律无效；在<em class="calibre8">博迪诉康涅狄格州</em>（1971 年）案中，法院裁定康涅狄格州要求离婚申请人缴纳申请费的法律不适用于无力支付的穷人。这两个案例都体现了隐私权是如何发展的。在每一个案例中，法院都为判决找到了另一个理论依据（<em class="calibre8">洛文案</em>中的平等保护和<em class="calibre8">博迪案</em>中的正当程序），但每一个案例中的意见都承认婚姻是一项基本权利，因此国家不能过分限制一个人结婚或离婚的能力。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">Meyer</em> and <em class="calibre8">Pierce</em> demonstrated the importance of parental concern for their children’s education. This is a part of a broader interest in family relations, including marriage, that is part of the right to privacy. In <em class="calibre8">Loving v. Virginia</em> (1967) the Court invalidated a Virginia law that prohibited marriage between blacks and whites, and in <em class="calibre8">Boddie v. Connecticut</em> (1971) it held that a Connecticut law that required applicants for a divorce to pay a filing fee could not be applied to poor people who could not afford to pay. Both cases illustrate how the right of privacy has developed. In each case the Court identified another doctrinal ground for the decision (equal protection in <em class="calibre8">Loving</em> and due process in <em class="calibre8">Boddie</em>), but in each case the opinions also recognized that marriage is a fundamental right, so the state cannot unduly restrict a person’s ability to get into or out of a marriage.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最近的两起案件展现了最高法院如何发展隐私权，以及法官们的思维方式如何在相对较短的时间内发生转变。迈克尔·哈德威克（Michael Hardwick）被控违反佐治亚州鸡奸法，因为他在卧室与另一名男子发生性行为。在1986年的<em class="calibre8">鲍尔斯诉哈德威克案（Bowers v. Hardwick）</em>中，最高法院裁定：<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_87" class="calibre4"></a>该法律符合宪法。怀特大法官的多数意见将问题定义为是否存在从事同性恋鸡奸的基本宪法权利，认为禁止同性恋行为有着“古老的根源”，并拒绝将隐私权延伸到那么远。然而，2003年，法院的另一个多数派得出了不同的结论。在<em class="calibre8">劳伦斯诉德克萨斯州一案中，肯尼迪大法官的意见批评了</em><em class="calibre8">鲍尔斯案</em>的历史基础，指出公众对同性恋态度的变化和性自主的需要（包括有争议的对国际法来源的依赖），并认为<em class="calibre8">鲍尔斯案的</em>判决是错误的，应该被推翻。怀特大法官错误地将问题表述为从事同性恋行为的权利，而真正的问题在于“涉及最私密的人类行为、性行为，以及在最私密的场所，即家庭”的法规的合宪性。肯尼迪大法官认为：“自由保护个人免受政府对其住所或其他私人场所的不当侵犯。在我们的传统中，国家并非无所不在……自由预设了个人的自主权，包括思想、信仰、言论和某些亲密行为的自由。” 因此，根据德克萨斯州一项将同性恋行为定为犯罪的法规而被定罪的被告约翰·劳伦斯和泰伦·加纳“有权享有对其私生活的尊重。国家不能通过将其私人性行为定为犯罪来贬低他们的存在或控制他们的命运。”</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A more recent pair of cases demonstrates how the Court has developed the right of privacy and how the thinking of the justices can change in a relatively short period of time. Michael Hardwick was charged with violating Georgia’s sodomy law by committing a sexual act with another man in his bedroom. In <em class="calibre8">Bowers v. Hardwick</em> in 1986, the Court held that <a class="calibre4"></a>the law was constitutional. Justice White’s majority opinion defined the issue as whether there was a fundamental constitutional right to engage in homosexual sodomy, found that the proscription of homosexual acts had “ancient roots,” and declined to extend the right of privacy that far. In 2003, however, a different majority of the Court reached a different conclusion. In <em class="calibre8">Lawrence v. Texas</em>, Justice Kennedy’s opinion criticized the historical basis of <em class="calibre8">Bowers</em>, noted changing public attitudes toward homosexuality and the need for sexual autonomy (including a controversial reliance on sources of international law), and held that <em class="calibre8">Bowers</em> was wrongly decided and should be overruled. Justice White had incorrectly stated the issue as the right to engage in homosexual acts, where the real issue is the constitutionality of statutes that “touch upon the most private human conduct, sexual behavior, and in the most private of places, the home.” “Liberty,” according to Justice Kennedy, “protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places. In our tradition the State is not omnipresent in the home....Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought, belief, expression, and certain intimate conduct.” Accordingly, John Lawrence and Tyron Garner, the defendants who were convicted under a Texas statute criminalizing homosexual acts, were “entitled to respect for their private lives. The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>界定个人权利以及确定法院在适用这些权利时的适当作用的挑战在<em class="calibre8">美国诉温莎案</em>（2013）中尤为突出，此案宣布联邦《婚姻保护法》（DOMA）无效。1996年，正当一些州考虑将同性婚姻合法化时，国会颁布了《婚姻保护法》，其中一部分对“婚姻”进行了定义，以排除同性婚姻。该定义控制了包括税法在内的一千多项联邦法律的适用。伊迪丝·温莎和西娅·斯派尔在加拿大结婚，这段婚姻得到了她们居住州纽约州的承认。斯派尔去世后，将其全部遗产留给了温莎，但由于《婚姻保护法》，温莎无法享受婚姻豁免联邦遗产税，因此她缴纳了税款并提起诉讼要求退税。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The challenges of defining individual rights and determining the proper role of the courts in applying them were sharply posed in <em class="calibre8">United States v. Windsor</em> (2013), the case that invalidated the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). In 1996, as some states were considering legalizing same-sex marriage, Congress enacted DOMA, part of which defined “marriage” to exclude same-sex marriages. The definition controlled the application of more than a thousand federal laws, including the tax law. Edith Windsor and Thea Spyer were married in Canada, a marriage recognized by their state of residence, New York. Spyer died and left her entire estate to Windsor, who was unable to claim the marital exemption from the federal estate tax because of DOMA, so she paid the tax and sued for a refund.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>肯尼迪大法官代表多数派的意见首先指出，婚姻传统上是州法律而非联邦法律的范畴，纽约州承认同性婚姻，赋予了同性恋者“极其重要的尊严和地位”，并“增强了该群体在其社区中的认可、尊严和保护”。相比之下，《捍卫婚姻法案》“试图伤害纽约州试图保护的群体”。“该法律公开宣称的目的和实际效果……是给那些缔结同性婚姻的人施加不利条件、特殊地位，从而带来耻辱”。<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_88" class="calibre4"></a>同性婚姻。因此，该法令违宪，因为它“剥夺了受宪法第五修正案保护的人的自由”。而第十四修正案对平等保护的保障，使得这项自由更加具体，“也更加易于理解和维护”。这项自由“剥夺了政府像本法那样贬低或贬损公民的权力”。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Justice Kennedy’s opinion for the Court majority first noted that marriage has traditionally been a subject of state, not federal, law, and by recognizing same-sex marriage, New York conferred on gay people “a dignity and status of immense import” and “enhanced the recognition, dignity, and protection of the class in their own community.” DOMA, by contrast, “seeks to injure the very class New York seeks to protect.” “The avowed purpose and practical effect of the law...are to impose a disadvantage, a separate status, and so a stigma” on those who enter into <a class="calibre4"></a>same-sex marriages. Accordingly, the statute was unconstitutional as “a deprivation of the liberty of the person protected by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution,” a liberty that was made even more specific and “better understood and preserved” by the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection. That liberty “withdraws from Government the power to degrade or demean the way this law does.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>斯卡利亚大法官发表了严厉的反对意见，尖锐地提出了法院的角色问题：</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Justice Scalia issued a scathing dissent that posed sharply the issue of the Court’s role:</p>
<p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>此案在多个方面都关乎权力。它关乎我们人民的自治权，以及最高法院的宣告法律的权力。今天的判决夸大了后者，其后果可想而知，就是贬低了前者……最高法院在这两点上的错误都源于同一个病根：对这一机构在美国所扮演角色的过高认识。</p><p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This case is about power in several respects. It is about the power of our people to govern themselves, and the power of this Court to pronounce the law. Today’s opinion aggrandizes the latter with the predictable consequence of diminishing the former....The Court’s errors on both points spring forth from the same diseased root: an exalted conception of the role of this institution in America.</p>
<p class="noindent">他辩称，最高法院根本不应该审理此案，因为温莎在下级法院胜诉，而且政府在上诉中拒绝为《婚姻保护法》辩护。（诉讼得以继续进行，是因为众议院的一个团体介入，为该法规辩护。）就案情实质而言，斯卡利亚大法官批评了多数派的结论，即由国会制定并由总统签署的《婚姻保护法》的目的和效果可以被推定为对同性婚姻参与者进行污名化，而其他理由也证明了该法案的制定是合理的。随后，他严厉批评了多数派意见的宪法依据含糊不清。这是否关乎联邦制，暗示《婚姻保护法》侵犯了各州规范婚姻的传统权力？还是关乎平等保护，尽管多数派认为平等保护只是使其他一些自由赋予更加具体？又或者，这是否关乎通过正当程序条款获得的一项模糊权利，而多数派却避免援引这项权利？</p><p class="noindent">The Court should not even have heard the case, he argued, because Windsor won in the lower court and the government refused to defend DOMA on appeal. (The litigation went forward because a group from the House of Representatives intervened to defend the statute.) On the merits, Justice Scalia criticized the majority’s conclusion that the purpose and effect of DOMA, enacted by Congress and signed by the president, could be presumed to be to stigmatize participants in same-sex marriages, when other reasons justified its enactment. He then excoriated the vagueness of the constitutional support for the majority’s opinion. Was it about federalism, suggesting that DOMA had invaded the states’ traditional power to regulate marriage? Or was it about equal protection, although the majority suggests that equal protection only makes some other grant of liberty more specific? Or was it about a penumbral right through the due process clause, a right the majority refrained from invoking?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>隐私权扩张最为广泛、也引发最多争议的领域是生殖权。<em class="calibre8">迈耶</em>和<em class="calibre8">皮尔斯案</em>关注的是政府控制人们思想的权力；而像<em class="calibre8">鲍尔斯</em>和<em class="calibre8">劳伦斯案</em>这样的生殖权案件则关注的是政府控制人体的权力。最高法院对生殖权的关注始于1942年的<em class="calibre8">“斯金纳诉俄克拉荷马州</em>”案，该案推翻了俄克拉荷马州一项强制对犯有两项或多项重罪的人实施绝育的法令。大法官罗伯特·杰克逊也表示赞同，生殖权是“一项基本公民权利”，并且在纳粹优生学和医学实验盛行的时代，他表达了对……的担忧。<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_89" class="calibre4"></a>“立法代表的多数派可以在多大程度上以牺牲少数派的尊严、人格和自然力量为代价进行生物实验。”（后来，杰克逊大法官在纽伦堡战争罪法庭上担任纳粹领导人的检察官，再次有机会发言反对政府侵犯个人尊严和权利。）</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The area in which the broadest expansion of the right to privacy has come, and the area in which it has generated the most heat, is in reproductive rights. <em class="calibre8">Meyer</em> and <em class="calibre8">Pierce</em> concerned the government’s power to control people’s minds; the reproductive rights cases, like <em class="calibre8">Bowers</em> and <em class="calibre8">Lawrence</em>, concern the government’s power to control a person’s body. The Court’s concern for reproductive rights began in <em class="calibre8">Skinner v. Oklahoma</em> (1942), in which it struck down an Oklahoma statute that mandated the sterilization of someone convicted of two or more serious crimes. In concurrence, Justice Robert Jackson noted that the right to reproduce is “one of the basic civil rights,” and, at the height of the Nazi era of eugenics and medical experimentation, he expressed concern for <a class="calibre4"></a>“the extent to which a legislatively represented majority may conduct biological experiments at the expense of the dignity and personality and natural powers of a minority.” (Later Justice Jackson would have another opportunity to speak in opposition to government invasion of personal dignity and rights as prosecutor of Nazi leaders at the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>继<em class="calibre8">斯金纳</em>之后，20 世纪 60 年代和 70 年代的两起案件改变了隐私权的概念，使法院全力介入生殖权领域。在<em class="calibre8">格里斯沃尔德诉康涅狄格州案</em>(1965 年) 中，计划生育协会的代表因违反康涅狄格州法规而被判有罪，该法规禁止使用避孕药具或提供避孕建议。计划生育协会的执行董事和医疗主任因违反法规向已婚夫妇提供建议而被定罪。被告被允许以已婚人士使用避孕药具的权利进行辩护，法院认为这项权利并非存在于特定的宪法文本中，而是存在于“（权利法案具体保障的）阴影中，这些阴影是由那些有助于赋予他们生命的保障所形成的”。法院将婚姻中的隐私权描述为“比《权利法案》更古老——比我们的政党更古老，比我们的学校体系更古老。婚姻是一种无论好坏的结合，希望能够持久，并且亲密到神圣的程度……它是一种与我们先前决定中涉及的任何目的同样崇高的目标的结合。” 法院得出结论，这种权利在自由社会中是根本权利，不应受到如此广泛的政府监管的侵犯。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Following <em class="calibre8">Skinner</em>, two cases in the 1960s and 1970s transformed the right to privacy and brought the Court full force into the area of reproductive rights. In <em class="calibre8">Griswold v. Connecticut</em> (1965) representatives of Planned Parenthood were convicted under a Connecticut statute that forbade the use of contraceptives or the giving of advice on contraceptives. The executive director and the medical director of Planned Parenthood were convicted of giving advice to married couples in violation of the statute. The defendants were allowed to raise in defense the right of married persons to use contraceptives, a right that the Court found not in a particular constitutional text but in the “penumbras [of specific guarantees of the Bill of Rights], formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life.” The Court described the right to privacy in marriage as “older than the Bill of Rights—older than our political parties, older than our school system. Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred....[I]‌t is an association for as noble a purpose as any involved in our prior decisions.” Such a right, the Court concluded, was fundamental in a free society and could not be invaded by so broad a government regulation.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8"></em>继<em class="calibre8">格里斯沃尔德案之后，1972年的</em><em class="calibre8">艾森斯塔特诉贝尔德</em>案也明确指出，生育方面的隐私权并不仅限于已婚夫妇。<em class="calibre8">艾森斯塔特案</em>中的被告因向未婚女性提供避孕药具而被判违反州法律。法院在推翻该判决时指出：</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">Griswold</em> was followed by <em class="calibre8">Eisenstadt v. Baird</em> (1972), which made clear that the right to privacy in the area of reproduction was not limited to married couples. The defendant in <em class="calibre8">Eisenstadt</em> was convicted of violating state law by providing contraceptives to an unmarried woman. In overturning the conviction, the Court stated:</p>
<p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，婚姻伴侣并非拥有独立思想和情感的独立个体，而是两个拥有各自智力和情感构成个体的结合。如果说隐私权有任何意义，那就是<em class="calibre8">个人</em>（无论已婚或单身）的权利，即免受政府对诸如是否生育子女等对个人产生根本影响的事务进行不当干预的权利。</p><p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Yet the marital couple is not an independent entity with a mind and heart of its own, but an association of two individuals each with a separate intellectual and emotional makeup. If the right to privacy means anything, it is the right of the <em class="calibre8">individual</em>, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em class="calibre8">格里斯沃尔德案、艾森斯塔特案</em>以及其他避孕案件是对隐私原则的全新延伸，但其本身并无太大争议。1973年，最高法院就<em class="calibre8">罗诉韦德案</em>作出判决，并得出结论，这场风暴爆发了。<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_90" class="calibre4"></a>隐私权“广泛到足以涵盖女性是否终止妊娠的决定”。随后，最高法院面临数十起堕胎案件，下级法院面临数百起案件，各州和联邦政府在调解、规避、例外以及对法院裁决的直接挑战方面陷入了困境。当然，这场骚动蔓延到了法庭之外，涉及到选举政治、大规模示威活动、堕胎诊所前的抗议活动，甚至还发生了为患者提供堕胎服务的医生被谋杀的事件。</p><p class="noindent"><em class="calibre8">Griswold, Eisenstadt</em>, and other contraceptive cases were a novel extension of the privacy doctrine but not too controversial in themselves. The storm broke in 1973 when the Court decided <em class="calibre8">Roe v. Wade</em> and concluded <a class="calibre4"></a>that the right of privacy is “broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.” Subsequently the Supreme Court faced dozens of abortion cases, and the lower courts hundreds of cases, as states and the federal government struggled over accommodations, evasions, exceptions, and outright challenges to the Court’s decision. And, of course, the ferment spilled outside the courtrooms into electoral politics, large demonstrations, picketing of abortion clinics, and even the murder of physicians who provided abortions to their patients.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>让我们首先快速总结一下最高法院的堕胎权案件。大多数宪法权利问题都要求法院权衡受影响个人的利益与政府在试图规范个人行为时所声称的利益。在<em class="calibre8">罗伊案</em>中，法院确定了三种利益。妇女在决定是否终止妊娠方面的利益是个人自主权利益的一个方面，这种利益从<em class="calibre8">迈耶</em>和<em class="calibre8">皮尔斯案</em>一直延伸到<em class="calibre8">格里斯沃尔德</em>和<em class="calibre8">艾森斯塔特案</em>。州在影响该决定方面有两个利益：因为堕胎是一种医疗程序，所以州政府有责任确保该程序在确保患者安全的条件下进行。州政府还有权保护胎儿。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Let’s begin with a quick summary of the abortion rights cases in the Supreme Court. Most constitutional rights issues require the Court to weigh the interest of the affected individual against the interest that the government asserts in attempting to regulate the individual’s conduct. In <em class="calibre8">Roe</em> the Court identified three interests. The woman’s interest in deciding whether or not to terminate the pregnancy is an aspect of the interest in personal autonomy that extends from <em class="calibre8">Meyer</em> and <em class="calibre8">Pierce</em> through <em class="calibre8">Griswold</em> and <em class="calibre8">Eisenstadt</em>. The state has two interests in affecting that decision: Because abortion is a medical procedure, the state has an interest in seeing that the procedure is performed under conditions that ensure the patient’s safety. The state also has an interest in protecting the fetus.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>由于继续或终止妊娠的决定涉及对女性生命控制权的基本问题，法院认为这是一项宪法基本权利。因此，州政府只有在拥有迫切利益且其监管措施严格以达成该利益为目的的情况下，才能监管该权利。在妊娠前三个月，州政府保护母亲健康的利益并不迫切；在此之前，堕胎的风险低于正常分娩的风险。在妊娠前三个月之后，州政府可以采取合理措施规范堕胎，以保护母亲的健康，例如，要求堕胎手术由持有执照的机构的合格人员进行。由于法院认定，无论根据第十四修正案还是其他法律规则，胎儿都不是人，因此在妊娠早期，州政府保护胎儿的利益也不迫切。然而，当胎儿在妊娠后三个月达到可存活状态（即能够在母体子宫外生存）时，州政府就有“逻辑和生物学”理由保护胎儿。因此，在怀孕的最后三个月，国家的迫切利益允许其在宪法上禁止堕胎，除非继续怀孕会危及母亲的生命或健康。<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_91" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Because the decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy entails basic questions about control of a woman’s life, the Court considered it to be a constitutionally fundamental right. Therefore, the state could regulate that right only if it had a compelling interest in doing so and if its regulations were narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. The state’s interest in protecting the health of the mother is not compelling during the first trimester of pregnancy; until that point, the risks of abortion are less than the risk of normal childbirth. After the first trimester, the state may regulate abortions in a manner reasonably calculated to protect the mother’s health by, for example, requiring that the procedure be performed by a qualified person in a licensed facility. Because the Court concluded that a fetus is not a person either for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment or for other legal rules, the state’s interest in protecting the fetus also is not compelling at the early stages of the pregnancy. When it becomes viable (i.e., capable of living outside its mother’s womb) in the last trimester, however, the state has “logical and biological” justifications for protecting the fetus. Therefore, during the last trimester of the pregnancy, the state’s compelling interest allows it to constitutionally prohibit abortions unless the life or health of the mother is endangered by continuing the pregnancy.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">罗诉韦德</em>案判决后，许多州的立法机构仍试图限制或规制堕胎权。法院对此作出回应，在众多案件中运用利益分析。例如，州政府可以通过要求堕胎只能在符合特定安全标准的医院或诊所进行来增进其保护母亲健康的利益，但不能要求堕胎只能在提供全方位服务的医院进行；前者而非后者的要求是合理地旨在保护母亲健康的。虽然政府有义务尊重妇女的堕胎权，但并未被要求加强该权利的行使；例如，联邦政府根据宪法可以拒绝使用医疗补助资金支付堕胎费用。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After the <em class="calibre8">Roe</em> decision, the legislatures in many states still attempted to restrict or regulate the right to abortion. The Court responded by applying the interest analysis in numerous cases. For example, the state could advance its interest in protecting the mother’s health by requiring that abortions be performed only in hospitals or clinics that met specified safety standards, but it could not require that abortions be performed only in full-service hospitals; the former but not the latter requirement was reasonably designed to protect the mother’s health. Although the government was required to honor a woman’s right to an abortion, it was not required to enhance the exercise of the right; the federal government, for example, constitutionally could refuse to use Medicaid funds to pay for abortions.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在接下来的二十年里，尤其是随着法院组成的变化，<em class="calibre8">罗伊案</em>利益分析的结构发生了动摇。最终，在<em class="calibre8">计划生育诉凯西案</em>（1992）中，法院似乎至少在一段时间内解决了堕胎权的根本问题，因为法院的多数意见重申选择堕胎的权利是根本权利，但建议可以放弃<em class="calibre8">罗伊案</em>中导致三个月分析的强制性利益测试，转而采用一项测试，询问州法规是否对妇女的权利施加了“不当负担”。与<em class="calibre8">罗伊案</em>的三个月分析不同，不当负担测试高度依赖事实；该测试指示法院审查州对堕胎的限制是否对妇女行使选择堕胎权构成不当负担。以<em class="calibre8">凯西案</em>为例，该案规定，从妇女与医生讨论堕胎事宜到堕胎程序本身之间必须有 24 小时的等待期，这一规定被认为不会过度加重妇女的选择负担，因为下级法院只发现这对某些妇女来说尤其繁重，而不是对所有妇女都繁重。然而，要求妇女证明已通知丈夫她将要堕胎的规定却被裁定违宪，因为大量研究表明，丈夫实施家庭暴力或心理虐待的可能性会阻止许多妇女寻求堕胎。同样，在<em class="calibre8">斯滕伯格诉卡哈特案(2000) 中，法院应用</em><em class="calibre8">凯西案</em>的原则，裁定内布拉斯加州除在特定情况下禁止某些晚期堕胎程序（立法机构称之为“部分出生堕胎”）的规定违宪，因为它没有考虑到母亲的健康，并对妇女选择堕胎程序施加了不当负担。然而，在 2007 年的<em class="calibre8">Gonzalez 诉 Carhart</em>案中，法院维持了联邦部分出生堕胎禁令法案，以驳回对该法案禁止范围较窄的晚期堕胎程序的质疑。<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_92" class="calibre4"></a>由于不确定这些程序是否有必要保护母亲的健康，以及它们会对她的选择权造成多大负担，因此该法规表面上并不违宪；法院保留在特定案件中应用该法规违宪的可能性。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Over the next twenty years, especially as the composition of the Court changed, the structure of the <em class="calibre8">Roe</em> interest analysis wavered. Finally, in <em class="calibre8">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</em> (1992), the Court seemed to settle the fundamental issue of abortion rights, at least for a time, as a plurality of the Court reaffirmed that the right to choose an abortion was fundamental but suggested that the compelling interest test leading to a trimester analysis in <em class="calibre8">Roe</em> might be abandoned in favor of a test that asked whether the state regulation imposed an “undue burden” on the woman’s right. Unlike <em class="calibre8">Roe</em>’s trimester analysis, the undue burden test is heavily fact-intensive; the test directs courts to examine whether a state restriction on abortion constitutes an undue burden on the exercise of a woman’s right to choose an abortion. In <em class="calibre8">Casey</em> itself, for example, a mandatory twenty-four-hour waiting period between the time a woman discussed the abortion with a physician and the procedure itself was held to not unduly burden her choice because the lower court had found only that it was particularly burdensome on some women, not unduly burdensome on all women. However, a requirement that a woman certify that she had notified her husband that she was to undergo an abortion was held unconstitutional because of extensive findings that the possibility of domestic violence or psychological abuse by the husband would deter many women from seeking an abortion. Similarly, in <em class="calibre8">Stenberg v. Carhart</em> (2000) the Court applied the principles of <em class="calibre8">Casey</em> to hold that Nebraska’s ban, except in narrow circumstances, on certain late-term abortion procedures that the legislature described as “partial-birth abortion” was unconstitutional because it lacked an exception for the health of the mother and imposed an undue burden on the woman’s choice of an abortion procedure. In <em class="calibre8">Gonzalez v. Carhart</em> (2007), however, the Court upheld the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act against a challenge to the statute’s prohibition of a narrower set of late-term abortion procedures. <a class="calibre4"></a>Because of uncertainty about whether the procedures would ever be necessary to protect the health of the mother and how much they would burden her right to choose, the statute was not unconstitutional on its face; the Court left open the possibility that application of the statute in particular cases would be unconstitutional.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>堕胎问题引发了数百条司法意见和立法、政治争议、哲学辩论和愤怒的言论。审查所有相关的法律都是不可能的，更不用说审查该问题的其他方面了。但由于堕胎是一个极具争议的话题，因此总结本章和上一章中关于宪法的两个最重要的观点是一个很好的载体。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The abortion issue has generated hundreds of judicial opinions and pieces of legislation, political controversy, philosophical debate, and angry rhetoric. It would be impossible to review even all of the law on the topic, much less the other dimensions of the issue. But because abortion is such a controversial topic, it is a good vehicle to summarize two of the most important points about constitutional law covered in this and the previous chapter.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>首先，堕胎权从何而来？更概括地说，最高法院如何确定宪法的含义？对于那些主张“严格解释”或“司法克制”的人来说，这整个过程就像一场毫无原则的权力攫取。最高法院夸大宪法中某个词组的含义已经够糟糕了，但在这里，法官们似乎在草草地拼凑一系列互不相关的条款，以获得将他们对一个有争议问题的个人偏好宣布为宪法的权力，而不受任何特定宪法文本的约束。如此一来，这些未经选举的法官就阻碍了民主政府部门在保护未出生胎儿权利等问题上的意愿。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>First, where does the right to an abortion come from? More generally, how does the Court determine what the Constitution means? To those who argue for “strict construction” or “judicial restraint,” this whole process seems like an unprincipled power grab. It’s bad enough when the Court stretches the meaning of a single constitutional phrase, but here the justices seem to be slapping together a series of unrelated provisions to come up with the authority to declare as constitutional law their personal preferences about a controversial issue, unfettered by any particular constitutional text. In doing so, the unelected justices thwart the will of the democratic branches of government on issues such as protecting the rights of an unborn fetus.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这一论点颇具吸引力。宪法中确实没有任何内容明确规定隐私权，也没有任何内容明确规定隐私权对特定立法（例如堕胎法规）的后果。但这又将我们带回到宪法讨论之初的宪法解释方法的正确性问题。宪法中没有任何条款规定法院如何裁决案件。法院在确立隐私权方面所做的工作与其在其他领域所做的工作相同：它试图理解宪法体系，这不可避免地涉及对文本中具体条款的解释，权衡文本的不同部分，并将司法解释与宪法通过后的社会、政治和经济发展相结合进行考量。在这一领域，法院界定了它认为对我们这种政治共同体至关重要的共同自由核心。法官们对该核心内容的理解并非总是一致，但他们普遍认为，试图确立这一核心的过程是有效的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This argument has some appeal to it. Surely there is nothing in the Constitution that spells out the right of privacy or the consequences for particular legislation such as abortion regulations. But that brings us back to the issue of the proper method of constitutional interpretation with which our discussion of constitutional law began. There is nothing in any provision of the Constitution that tells the Court how to decide a case. What the Court has done in creating the right of privacy is the same thing it does in other areas: It tries to make sense of the constitutional scheme, which inevitably involves interpreting specific provisions of the text, weighing one portion of the text against another and considering judicial interpretations along with social, political, and economic developments subsequent to the adoption of the Constitution. In this area the Court has defined the common core of freedoms it sees as essential to our form of political community. The justices have not always agreed on the content of that core, but they generally have agreed that the process of attempting to establish it is a valid one.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">凯西案</em>的核心意见中，桑德拉·戴·奥康纳、安东尼·肯尼迪和大卫·苏特三位大法官参与了这一构建宪法理解的过程。他们试图理解<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_93" class="calibre4"></a>所有先前的隐私案件都基于什么一般原则，并得出结论</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Justices Sandra Day O’Connor, Anthony Kennedy, and David Souter, in the central opinion in <em class="calibre8">Casey</em>, engaged in this process of constructing an understanding of the Constitution. They tried to understand <a class="calibre4"></a>what general principle underlay all of the previous privacy cases and concluded that</p>
<p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>我们的先例“尊重国家无法介入的家庭生活私人领域”。这些事务涉及一个人一生中可能做出的最私密、最私人的选择，这些选择关乎个人尊严和自主，也是第十四修正案所保护的自由的核心。</p><p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Our precedents “have respected the private realm of family life which the state cannot enter.” These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p class="noindent">因此，堕胎决定是如此“私密和个人化”，以至于国家不能简单地将其选择观点强加给孕妇。</p><p class="noindent">Accordingly, the abortion decision is so “intimate and personal” that the state cannot simply impose its view of the choice on a pregnant woman.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>但这难道不是反民主的吗？从某种意义上说，的确如此。宪法的意义就在于此。暂时多数人的意愿、一时的想法、立法机关的投票，都不能推翻基本的宪法保障。然而，在确定这些保障的内容时，法院不能无视一时的想法；法院对哪些权利是基本权利的看法，会受到时代对哪些权利是基本权利的倾向的影响。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But this is antidemocratic, isn’t it? In a sense, it is. That’s what constitutional law is all about. The will of a temporary majority, the sentiments of the moment, a vote in the legislature, cannot upset basic constitutional guarantees. In determining the content of those guarantees, though, the Court is not free to ignore the sentiment of the moment; the Court’s view of what rights are fundamental can be shaped by the temperament of the times as to what rights are fundamental.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这就引出了第二点。宪法真的是法律吗？还是仅仅是法官们为了执行个人偏好而采取的一种政治手段？哈里·布莱克门大法官在<em class="calibre8">凯西案</em>中的意见尖锐地提出了这个问题。在指出多数派法官和反对派法官在是否应推翻<em class="calibre8">罗诉韦德案上的根本冲突之后，罗诉</em><em class="calibre8">韦德案</em>中最高法院意见的作者以一段不同寻常的个人陈述作为结尾：</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That leads to the second point. Is constitutional law really law, or is this just a form of politics in which the judges enact their personal preferences? The issue was posed sharply by Justice Harry Blackmun’s opinion in <em class="calibre8">Casey</em>. After pointing out the basic conflict between the majority and dissenting justices over whether <em class="calibre8">Roe</em> should be overruled, the author of the Court’s opinion in <em class="calibre8">Roe</em> closed with an unusual personal statement:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="prosequotea"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">从某种意义上说，最高法院的做法与首席大法官和斯卡利亚大法官（后者在凯西案</em>中持不同意见）的做法截然不同。然而，从另一种意义上说，这两种做法之间的差距却很小——只差一票之差。</p><p class="prosequotea"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In one sense, the Court’s approach is worlds apart from that of the Chief Justice and Justice Scalia [who dissented in <em class="calibre8">Casey</em>]. And yet, in another sense the distance between the two approaches is short—the distance is but a single vote.</p>
<p class="prosequote1"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>我已83岁高龄，无法永远留在最高法院。当我卸任后，继任者的确认程序很可能会聚焦于我们今天面临的问题。遗憾的是，这可能正是我们在两个世界之间做出选择的时刻。</p><p class="prosequote1"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I am 83 years old. I cannot remain on the Court forever, and when I do step down, the confirmation process for my successor well may focus on the issue before us today. That, I regret, may be exactly where the choice between the two worlds will be made.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">布莱克门正确地指出，法官的提名和确认的政治程序是宪法制定的重要组成部分。但他也指出了<em class="calibre8">凯西案的非凡之处：</em></p><p class="noindent">Blackmun was right in raising the political process of nomination and confirmation of justices as an essential element of the making of constitutional law. But he also pointed out what was remarkable about <em class="calibre8">Casey:</em></p>
<p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>毫无疑问，奥康纳、肯尼迪和苏特三位大法官的联合意见体现了个人勇气和宪法原则。与奥康纳和<a id="text/part0009_split_001.html.page_94" class="calibre4"></a>尽管肯尼迪推迟了对<em class="calibre8">“罗诉韦德案”</em>的重新审议，但今天联合意见的作者与史蒂文斯大法官和我一起得出结论：“<em class="calibre8">罗诉韦德案</em>的基本判决应该保留并再次重申。”</p><p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Make no mistake, the joint opinion of Justices O’Connor, Kennedy, and Souter is an act of personal courage and constitutional principle. In contrast to previous decisions in which Justices O’Connor and <a class="calibre4"></a>Kennedy postponed reconsideration of <em class="calibre8">Roe v. Wade</em>, the authors of the joint opinion today join Justice Stevens and me in concluding that “the essential holding of <em class="calibre8">Roe v. Wade</em> should be retained and once again reaffirmed.”</p>
<p class="noindent">为什么这被认为是个人勇气的体现？这三人均由保守派共和党总统任命（奥康纳和肯尼迪由里根任命，苏特由老布什任命）。保守派人士称赞奥康纳和肯尼迪的任命预示着从自由主义激进主义向更保守主义的转变。（苏特被任命时，温和派人士认为他的司法政治素养尚不为人所知。）肯尼迪是一位虔诚的天主教徒。然而，这三人最终都支持堕胎权，这并非出于个人偏好，而是如布莱克门所说，“出于宪法原则”。</p><p class="noindent">Why was this considered an act of personal courage? All three were appointed by conservative Republican presidents (O’Connor and Kennedy by Reagan and Souter by George H. W. Bush). The O’Connor and Kennedy appointments were hailed by conservatives as presaging a shift away from liberal activism toward greater conservatism. (Souter’s judicial politics were perceived as unknown to moderate at the time of his appointment.) And Kennedy was a devout Catholic. Yet all three ended up supporting abortion rights, not as a matter of personal preference but, as Blackmun said, “of constitutional principle.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>我们该如何理解这一点？显然，宪法决策并非完全取决于个人偏好和政治选择。但这肯定也是其中的一部分；尽管这三位大法官都支持堕胎权，但在其他问题上，他们明显比沃伦时代的自由派前辈更为保守。这三位大法官并不受宪法文本或法院先前判决的约束；他们本可以像伦奎斯特和斯卡利亚一样，对文本进行不同的解读，并得出结论认为<em class="calibre8">罗案</em>判决是错误的。但他们认为自己受制于他们认为的对宪法的正确解读以及法院先前判决。他们在先前的隐私判决中发现了广泛的个人自由原则，并得出结论，遵循<em class="calibre8">先例——即应遵循法律权威的原则——支持继续适用</em><em class="calibre8">罗案</em>中所表达的妇女选择权。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>What are we to make of this? Obviously, constitutional decision making is not all a matter of personal preference and political choice. But surely it is part of that as well; even though these three justices favored abortion rights, on other issues they were noticeably more conservative than their liberal predecessors of the Warren Court era. The three justices were not bound by the constitutional text or the prior decisions of the Court; they could have read the text differently and concluded that <em class="calibre8">Roe</em> was wrongly decided, as Rehnquist and Scalia did. But they felt themselves to be bound by what they concluded was the correct interpretation of the Constitution and by the Court’s prior decisions. They found in the prior privacy decisions a broad principle of personal liberty, and they concluded that <em class="calibre8">stare decisis</em>—the doctrine that legal authority should be followed—supported the continued application of a woman’s right to choose expressed in <em class="calibre8">Roe</em>.</p>

<p class="subtitle1">诉讼程序</p><p class="subtitle1">The Litigation Process</p>
<p class="noindent">诉讼是法律体系中人​​们首先想到的部分。<em class="calibre8">法庭上见。不要把它变成联邦案件。我会一直把这个问题带到最高法院</em>。这也是该体系中最令人费解的部分。在围绕华盛顿公共电力系统债券违约的诉讼中，大批律师在十三年间累计支付了3亿美元的律师费——而这些案件实际上从未开庭审理。律师怎么能把看似如此简单的事情变得如此复杂？一定要这样吗？答案就在法学院学生最不熟悉的学科——民事诉讼程序中。</p><p class="noindent">Litigation is the part of the legal system that people think of first. <em class="calibre8">See you in court. Don’t make a federal case out of it. I’ll take this all the way to the Supreme Court</em>. It is also the most puzzling part of the system. In the litigation surrounding the Washington Public Power System’s default on its bonds, armies of lawyers ran up legal fees of $300 million over a period of thirteen years—and the cases never actually came to trial. How can lawyers take something that seems so simple and make it so complicated? Does it have to be that way? The answers lie in the subject that law students find to be the most alien to their experience—civil procedure.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0010_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-4-div1-2"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0017" class="calibre1">什么是民事诉讼程序？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0017" class="calibre1">What Is Civil Procedure?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">诉讼是法律体系解决私人之间纠纷的机制；<em class="calibre8">民事诉讼程序</em>是构建该机制的法律主体。</p><p class="noindent">Litigation is the legal system’s mechanism for resolving disputes between private parties; <em class="calibre8">civil procedure</em> is the body of law that structures the mechanism.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>诉讼始于两个或两个以上个人、公司或机构之间的纠纷。任何类型的纠纷都可能引发诉讼：车祸、违约、员工性骚扰索赔、针对政府的民权索赔。如果纠纷双方无法自行解决问题，他们可以聘请律师进行谈判、威胁或以其他方式尝试解决纠纷。如果这些方法也行不通，那就诉诸法庭。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Litigation begins with a dispute between two or more people, companies, or institutions. Any kind of dispute can get the process going: an automobile accident, a broken contract, a sexual harassment claim by an employee, a civil rights claim against the government. If the disputants cannot settle their problem themselves, they can hire lawyers to negotiate, threaten, or otherwise try to resolve the dispute. If that doesn’t work either, then it’s off to court.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在古代，英国国王会坐着“开庭”；也就是说，他会坐在公共广场、庭院或其他开放空间，除了履行其他王室职责外，还会主持公道。国王的臣民之一约翰·多伊会来抱怨邻居理查德·罗伊弄伤了他的牛，导致它跛脚。国王会传唤罗伊，听取他们各自的陈述，并决定罗伊是否需要赔偿。<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_96" class="calibre4"></a>赔偿牛的损失。（Doe 和 Roe 是传统上指代虚构或匿名诉讼当事人的名称。著名堕胎案“<em class="calibre8">罗伊诉韦德</em>案”的原告也遵循了这一惯例，自称简·罗伊，以掩盖其真实身份。）随着时间的推移，由于国王必须发布王室公告、约束野心勃勃的贵族、发动战争以及做其他国王该做的事情，他变得无暇顾及所有臣民的个人纠纷，于是他将处理这些纠纷的权力委托给了一些王室官员。随着时间的推移，这些官员的职能制度化，成为在法庭上进行诉讼的法官。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the olden days, the king of England would sit and “hold court”; that is, he would sit in a public square, courtyard, or other open space and, among his other royal duties, dispense justice. John Doe, one of the king’s subjects, would come complaining that Richard Roe, a neighbor, had injured Doe’s ox, causing it to go lame. The king would summon Roe, hear what they each had to say, and decide whether Roe had to pay <a class="calibre4"></a>for the damage to the ox. (Doe and Roe are the traditional names for fictitious or anonymous litigants. The plaintiff in the famous abortion case <em class="calibre8">Roe v. Wade</em> followed this convention in styling herself Jane Roe, to conceal her true identity.) Over time, because the king had to issue royal proclamations, keep ambitious noblemen in line, fight wars, and do the other things kings do, he became too busy to hear all of his subjects’ individual disputes, so he delegated the authority to do so to some of his royal officials. Over even more time, those officials institutionalized their function and became judges conducting litigation in courts.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这个小故事告诉我们很多关于诉讼需要了解的知识。诉讼是政府权威解决纠纷的程序。遇到问题的人向政府授权的官员陈述他们的论点，官员们听取他们的意见并解决纠纷。通过了解这个故事的一些细节和含义，我们可以更全面地理解民事诉讼程序和诉讼过程。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This little story tells us much of what we need to know about litigation. Litigation is a process of authoritative dispute resolution by the government. People with problems present their arguments to officials empowered by the government to hear their arguments and resolve the dispute. By playing out some of the details and implications of the story, we can get a more complete understanding of civil procedure and the litigation process.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>首先，多伊不必上法庭，而且大多数情况下，像多伊这样的人都不会上法庭。也许那头牛伤得没那么重，多伊也不想被人认为是个好辩的人，所以他决定把这事儿忘掉。或者他和罗伊谈过，双方达成了友好的谅解，罗伊会在多伊需要的时候借他的牛给他。也许他想起诉，但他又没时间放下农活去朝廷。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>First, Doe doesn’t have to go to court, and most of the time, people like Doe won’t go to court. Maybe the ox isn’t that badly injured and Doe doesn’t want to be thought of as a disputatious person, so he decides to forget the whole thing. Or he talks to Roe and they reach an amicable understanding that Roe will let Doe borrow his ox when he needs it. Perhaps he wants to sue but he can’t take time away from farming to travel to the king’s court.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>即使在今天，诉讼也依然罕见。人们在日常生活中遭受各种伤害和侮辱，但最终诉诸诉讼的却相对较少。诉讼是一个昂贵、耗时且耗心的过程，通常只用于处理真正重要的案件，这些案件的尺度既包括社会重要性，也包括金钱。本章以及本书其他章节讨论的诉讼，只是诉讼程序能够解决的社会问题的冰山一角。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Even today, litigation is a rare event. People suffer many harms and indignities in everyday life, but relatively few of them end up in litigation. Litigation is an expensive, time-consuming, and emotionally draining process that is reserved for cases of real significance, measured in both social importance and money. The lawsuits discussed in this chapter and elsewhere in the book are only the tip of the iceberg of the social problems that the litigation process could address.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>其次，在受英国法影响的国家（包括美国），诉讼是一种对抗制程序。诉讼程序由双方当事人掌控。多伊决定是否将案件提交国王审理，以及到庭后该如何陈述。罗伊有机会陈述自己的事实和论点。国王的职责是倾听双方的意见，然后做出裁决。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Second, litigation in countries under the influence of English law, including the United States, is an adversary process. The contending parties are in control of the process. Doe decides whether to bring his case before the king in court and what to say when he gets there. Roe has the opportunity to present his own facts and argument. The king’s job is to listen to both and then decide.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如今，法律体系远比现在复杂得多，但本质上仍然是对抗性的。民事诉讼是当事人之间的较量，当事人的律师在塑造诉讼过程中起着主要作用。律师决定起诉对象、起诉地点和时间，提出哪些法律问题，如何调查事实，以及出示哪些证人和其他证据。法官是裁判，确保律师遵守……<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_97" class="calibre4"></a>游戏规则最终决定案件或监督陪审团对案件的裁决。然而，纯粹的对抗制模式在实践中从未完全实行。尤其是近年来，随着案件数量的增加和法院的拥挤，法官们更倾向于通过缩小争议范围、鼓励和解以及总体上推动案件进展来管理案件。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Today the system is much more complicated, but it still is essentially adversarial. Civil litigation is a contest between the parties, and the lawyers for the parties have the primary role in shaping the litigation. The lawyers decide whom, where, and when to sue, what legal issues to raise, how to investigate the facts, and what witnesses and other evidence to present. The judge is the referee who makes sure that the lawyers follow <a class="calibre4"></a>the rules of the game and ultimately decides the case or supervises a jury in its decision of the case. The pure model of the adversary system is never entirely observed in practice, however. Especially in recent years, as the volume of cases has mounted and courts have become more crowded, judges have become more inclined to manage the cases in front of them by trying to narrow the issues, encourage settlement, and generally move things along.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第三，诉讼总是涉及查明事实以及制定或应用法律政策。当国王听到多伊说罗伊弄伤了牛时，故事并没有结束。罗伊回应说，他从多伊那里借了牛，但借牛时牛看起来有点跛，尽管牛在罗伊田里踩到一个洞时伤势可能加重了。国王必须裁定牛是何时跛的，如果是罗伊造成的，那么借牛的人是否应该对借来的牛的意外伤害负责。今天的每个案件都是如此。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Third, litigation always involves both finding facts and making or applying legal policies. When the king hears Doe say that Roe injured the ox, that’s not the end of the story. Roe responds that he borrowed the ox from Doe but the ox appeared to be slightly lame when he borrowed it, even though the injury may have worsened when the ox stepped into a hole in Roe’s field. The king has to decide when the ox was lamed and, if Roe did it, whether one who borrows an ox is responsible for an accidental injury to the borrowed animal. The same is true in every case today.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第四，民事诉讼并非政府解决纠纷的唯一形式。如果罗借了多伊的牛却一直不归还，多伊可以要求国王责令罗伊归还或赔偿；我们认为这属于民事诉讼。但国王听到这个故事后，也可能会自行处理，将罗伊送进监狱；这属于刑事诉讼。如果政府的唯一职责是提供纠纷解决机制（法院），那么两个人之间的纠纷就属于民事诉讼；民事案件中典型的救济措施是金钱赔偿判决或命令采取某些行动（例如归还牛）。如果政府采取行动，且可能面临的制裁包括罚款、监禁甚至死刑，那么这属于刑事诉讼。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Fourth, civil litigation is not the only form of governmental dispute resolution. If Roe borrows Doe’s ox and never returns it, Doe could ask the king to make Roe return it or pay for it; we would think of that as a civil action. But when the king hears the story, he might also take matters into his own hands and send Roe to jail; that would be a criminal action. A dispute between two people, when the government’s only role is to provide the system for dispute resolution (the courts), is civil litigation; typical remedies in civil cases are judgments for money damages or an order to do something (such as return the ox). When the government pursues the action and the potential sanction includes a fine, imprisonment, or even capital punishment, it is criminal litigation.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最后，当英国国王亲自主持法庭，裁决臣民的纠纷时，几乎不需要制定规则来规定谁可以提起诉讼，或者他们必须遵守哪些程序。国王是正义的源泉，也是王国的主要权威人物，因此，如果臣民遇到问题，他们可以直接去找他，陈述他们的故事。随着法院制度化，事情变得更加复杂。如今，如果人们只是走进法庭表达他们的诉求，法院就会不堪重负。为了应对这种情况，立法机关和法院制定了规则来规范诉讼程序。这些规则的主体被称为民事诉讼法，它规范了民事诉讼程序从始至终的每个步骤。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Finally, when the English king held court individually and decided his subjects’ disputes himself, there was little need for rules about who could bring a complaint or what process they had to observe. The king was the fountainhead of justice and the principal authority figure in the realm, so if subjects had problems, they could simply go to him and present their stories. As courts became institutionalized, matters became more complicated. Today, courts would be overwhelmed if people simply walked in and voiced their complaints. To cope with this situation, legislatures and courts have devised rules to govern the litigation process. The main body of those rules is known as the law of civil procedure, which regulates every step of the civil litigation process from beginning to end.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>民事诉讼程序通常是法学院学生最难学的科目，因为它对他们来说太陌生了。每个人都对承诺、意外事故和所有权略知一二，所以他们可以开始理解合同法、侵权法和财产法的基础知识。但民事诉讼程序<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_98" class="calibre4"></a>是律师独有的法律。本章试图在阐述程序规则和诉讼制度的目标和价值的背景下，解释这一与民事诉讼程序格格不入的体系。这其中蕴含着一个宏大的图景，涉及我们希望这些制度服务的基本价值观。如果你牢记这个宏大的图景——从关于多伊案和罗伊案的简单假设开始——那么细节就更容易理解。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Civil procedure is often the most difficult subject for law students to learn because it is so foreign to them. Everyone knows a little about promises, accidents, and ownership, so they can begin to understand the basics of contract law, tort law, and property law. But civil procedure <a class="calibre4"></a>is uniquely lawyers’ law. This chapter tries to explain this alien body of civil procedure in the context of an account of the goals and values of procedural rules and litigation systems. There is a big picture here, involving basic values that we want the systems to serve. If you keep the big picture in mind—beginning with the simple hypothetical about Doe and Roe—the details are easier to digest.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0010_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-4-div1-3"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0018" class="calibre1">为什么需要民事诉讼和民事程序？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0018" class="calibre1">Why Do We Need Civil Litigation and Civil Procedure?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">报纸、广播脱口秀和政治竞选中充斥着抱怨：诉讼太多，律师太多，每个人都因为各种事情被起诉。无论胜败，都会损失一大笔钱。</p><p class="noindent">The complaints are voiced in the newspapers, on radio talk shows, and in political campaigns: Too much litigation. Too many lawyers. Everyone is getting sued for everything. No matter if you win or lose, it will cost you a fortune.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>很多抱怨都针对实体法，而非民事诉讼程序或诉讼制度。例如，评论员担心侵权法已经失控。但很多批评都针对程序法以及执行程序法的律师和法官。程序法太繁琐、成本太高、耗时太长。难道非得这样吗？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Much of the complaining is about the substantive law and not civil procedure or the litigation system. Commentators are concerned that tort law has gotten out of hand, for example. But a lot of the criticism is directed at procedural law and the lawyers and judges who implement it. Too cumbersome, too expensive, and too time-consuming. Does it have to be this way?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>回到最初的话题：人与人之间会产生问题；很多问题会自行解决，其他问题则可以通过谈判、经济压力或其他非正式途径解决。但仍有一些争议是双方无法自行解决的。诉讼程序提供了一种解决这些争议的机制。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Go back to the beginning: Problems arise between people; many of the problems go away by themselves, and others are solved through negotiation, economic pressure, or other informal means. But there remains a residuum of disputes that the parties cannot solve for themselves. The litigation process provides a mechanism for resolving those disputes.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>想想在无法进行诉讼的亚文化中会发生什么。例如，在毒贩之间，纠纷和权利主张很可能通过驾车枪击来解决。但即使抛开暴力威胁，未解决的不满情绪也会侵蚀公众的社会秩序感和幸福感。在一个公平、秩序良好、运转顺畅的社会中，问题会得到解决，不公正也会得到纠正。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Consider what happens in subcultures in which litigation is unavailable. Among drug dealers, for example, disputes and claims of right are likely to be settled with drive-by shootings. But even aside from the threat of violence, the presence of unresolved grievances corrodes the public’s sense of social order and well-being. In a fair, well-ordered, smoothly functioning society, problems get solved and injustices get corrected.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，我们不需要复杂的对抗性诉讼制度来解决这些纠纷。我们可以采用一种更经济、更简单的程序——法官只需抛硬币即可决定胜诉方。或者，法官可以判决向其行贿金额最高的一方胜诉。然后，法院和警察只需执行判决即可。这种制度可以以更低的成本解决更多问题。但基于偶然性或腐败的司法制度违背了我们关于公平的两个基本信念：法院应基于公正的实体法规则作出判决，并且应在遵守公平程序的基础上作出判决。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We don’t need a complex, adversarial litigation system to resolve these disputes, however. We could adopt a much cheaper, simpler procedure—a judge could simply flip a coin to decide who wins. Or the judge could decide in favor of the party who slipped him the largest bribe. The courts and police would then simply enforce the decisions. That system could resolve many more problems at a much lower cost. But a judicial system based on chance or corruption violates two of our fundamental beliefs about fairness: The courts should render decisions based on rules of substantive law that are fair, and they should do so after observing a fair process.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>因此，民事诉讼的首要任务是实施实体法规则以及其所依据的价值观和政策。<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_99" class="calibre4"></a>当立法机关或法院宣布一项法治时，该规则仅凭其法律属性便获得权威。人们尊重法律，通常也遵守法律，即使不遵守也不会受到制裁。但诉讼既为人们的行为不符合法律要求的案件提供了一种后备机制，也提供了一个平台，使法律所蕴含的价值观和政策能够在新的形势下得到阐释、强化和完善。虽然没有任何程序制度能够完美地做到这一点，但一个公平的制度能够通过消除阻碍决策过程集中化的障碍来降低出错的可能性。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The first task of civil procedure, then, is to implement substantive rules of law and the values and policies on which they are based. <a class="calibre4"></a>When a legislature or court announces a rule of law, the rule acquires authority simply by virtue of being the law. People respect the law and usually obey it without the threat of sanctions for failing to do so. But litigation provides both a backup mechanism for those cases in which people do not conform their conduct to the requirements of the law and a forum in which the values and policies underlying the law can be articulated, reinforced, and worked out in new situations. Although no procedural system does this perfectly, a fair system will reduce the possibility of error by removing the barriers to a focused decision-making process.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>民事诉讼程序还有第二项任务。我们之所以对基于偶然性或腐败的争议解决制度感到不满，是因为它违背了我们对公平程序的理解，而且不太可能产生符合实体法公正原则的结果。民事诉讼程序在创建符合我们公平观念的诉讼程序方面具有独立的价值。公平的程序制度公开肯定了我们对法律之下正义的信念。它也维护了个体诉讼当事人以及其他类似当事人的尊严。诉讼，如同选举政治，是个人可以维护自身价值观和自身利益重要性的舞台。“在法庭上享有你的一天”是美国的宝贵传统。民事诉讼程序的作用是确保法庭上的每一天都有意义。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Civil procedure has a second task, too. We are offended by a dispute resolution system based on chance or corruption because it violates our understanding of fair process, in addition to being unlikely to produce results in accordance with just principles of substantive law. Civil procedure has an independent value in creating a litigation process that conforms to our concepts of fairness. A fair procedural system provides a public affirmation of our belief in justice under law. It also affirms the dignity of the individual litigants and of others like them. Litigation, like electoral politics, is an arena in which individuals can assert their values and the significance of their own interests. “Having your day in court” is a cherished American tradition. The role of civil procedure is to make sure that the day in court is a meaningful one.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在美国发展起来的对抗制下，公平程序包含几个基本要素。诉讼当事人必须有机会充分阐述支持其案件的事实和法律，并向决策者陈述相关事实和法律论据。在典型情况下，当事人必须有权要求陪审团裁定案件事实。陪审团和法官必须对双方保持中立，必须听取双方的证据和论据，并且必须仅根据其提供的证据和论据作出裁决。当事人必须能够要求上诉法院对裁决进行复审，以查明是否存在错误，并纠正重大错误。复审后的裁决必须具有终局性，以确保当事人不会就同一问题无休止地重复诉讼。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Under an adversary system as developed in the United States, fair process has several essential components. Parties to litigation must have an opportunity to adequately develop the facts and law in support of their cases and to present the relevant facts and legal arguments to the decision maker. In the typical case, the parties must have a right to have a jury determine the facts of the case. The jury and judge must be neutral to both parties, must listen to their evidence and arguments, and must decide the matter solely on the basis of the evidence and arguments presented. The parties must be able to have the adjudication reviewed for error by an appellate court and to have serious errors corrected. After review, the decision must have finality, so the parties cannot be subjected to endless relitigation of the same issues.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最后，民事诉讼程序还有第三项任务。为了实现公正，民事诉讼程序必须高效。如同任何其他好东西过犹不及，过多的公正程序也会适得其反。如果诉讼当事人拥有无限的陈述案件的机会，诉讼将变得繁琐得令人难以忍受，耗时耗力。此外，诉讼制度是政府提供给公民个人的社会资源。公正有效的诉讼程序无疑能为个人乃至整个社会带来益处，但我们究竟能实现多少正义？<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_100" class="calibre4"></a>负担得起吗？因此，程序规则必须在更好的流程带来的好处与费用和延误的负担之间取得平衡。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Finally, civil procedure has a third task. In order to be fair, civil procedure must be efficient. Too much fair process, like too much of any other good thing, is counterproductive. If litigants had unlimited opportunities to present their cases, litigation would become unbearably cumbersome, time-consuming, and expensive. Moreover, the litigation system is a social resource that the government provides to individual citizens. There is undeniable benefit to individuals and the society as a whole from fair and effective litigation process, but how much justice can we <a class="calibre4"></a>afford? Accordingly, procedural rules have to balance the benefits of better process against the burdens of expense and delay.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0010_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-4-div1-4"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0019" class="calibre1">法院案件从何而来？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0019" class="calibre1">Where Do Court Cases Come From?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">让我们以一个案例为例，回顾一下它的诉讼过程。诉讼形式千差万别，没有哪个案例是典型的，但这个案例的情况却相当普通。（然而，结果却并非如此；正如我们稍后会看到的，这个案例最终诉诸美国最高法院。）</p><p class="noindent">Let’s take a case and follow it through the litigation process. Litigation is so diverse that no case is typical, but the facts of this one are pretty ordinary. (The result was not, however; as we will see later, this case ended up in the U.S. Supreme Court.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>哈里和凯·罗宾逊夫妇带着他们的两个孩子伊娃和乔治，正从纽约搬到亚利桑那州的新家。当他们驾驶着那辆开了一年的奥迪100 LS，沿着俄克拉荷马州44号州际公路前往亚利桑那州时，一辆福特都灵轿车从后面撞了上来，司机是醉酒的，时速大约在90到100英里之间。撞击力压碎了奥迪的尾部，撞上了车门，还刺破了油箱。罗宾逊夫妇的车起火了，凯·罗宾逊和两个孩子被严重烧伤。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Harry and Kay Robinson and their two children, Eva and George, were moving from New York to a new home in Arizona. As they were driving their year-old Audi 100 LS along Interstate 44 in Oklahoma en route to Arizona, their car was struck from behind by a Ford Torino driven by a drunk driver going around 90 to 100 mph. The impact of the collision crushed the rear end of the Audi, jammed the doors shut, and punctured the car’s gas tank. The Robinsons’ car burst into flames, and Kay Robinson and the two children were severely burned.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>罗宾逊夫妇没有起诉撞到他们车的醉酒司机，这或许有点令人惊讶。相反，他们起诉了制造这辆车的德国公司奥迪股份公司 (Audi AG)、进口奥迪汽车的美国公司大众汽车美国公司 (Volkswagen of America, Inc.)、他们从其处购买了这辆车的纽约经销商 Seaway 大众汽车公司 (Seaway Volkswagen, Inc.)，以及将这辆车卖给 Seaway 的地区经销商环球大众汽车公司 (World-Wide Volkswagen Corp.)。这一事件的转变有助于我们思考纠纷是如何进入司法系统的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It may be a little surprising that the Robinsons did not sue the drunk driver who struck their car. Instead, they sued Audi AG, the German company that manufactured the car; Volkswagen of America, Inc., the U.S. company that imported Audis; Seaway Volkswagen, Inc., the dealer in New York from whom they bought the car; and World-Wide Volkswagen Corp., the regional distributor that had sold the car to Seaway. This turn of events helps us think about how disputes make their way into the court system.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>提起诉讼的第一步是认识到问题的存在，并且该问题可能通过法律途径解决。在罗宾逊夫妇可能起诉醉酒司机的案例中，采取这些步骤很容易。罗宾逊夫妇受了重伤。他们和我们一样，知道如果因粗心驾驶而伤害他人，可以寻求法律救济。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The first steps in initiating litigation are to recognize that there is a problem and that the problem is potentially subject to legal resolution. In the case of the Robinsons’ potential suit against the drunk driver, it’s easy to take those steps. The Robinsons suffered a severe injury. They knew, as we all do, that there is a legal remedy for injuring someone else by driving carelessly.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>罗宾逊夫妇对奥迪被告的诉讼则不那么明显。需要对法律和情况有更多了解才能意识到，他们可能因为产品缺陷加重了他们的伤势而起诉汽车制造商和销售商。或许，这些问题是他们咨询了一位在汽车事故诉讼方面经验丰富的律师后才出现的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Robinsons’ suit against the Audi defendants is less obvious. It requires a little more knowledge of the law and the situation to recognize that they might have a suit against the manufacturer and sellers of the car for a product defect that exacerbated their injuries. Perhaps those issues arose only when they consulted a lawyer who was experienced in auto accident litigation.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这里有一个非常普遍的观点。正如诉讼程序领域最有思想的学者之一马克·加兰特教授所说，世界上“充满了各种各样的事件、遭遇、冲突、竞争、失望、不适和伤害”，但只有当受害者<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_101" class="calibre4"></a>承认法律解决的可能性，否则该事件将演变为一场潜在的诉讼。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There is a very general point here. As Professor Marc Galanter, one of the most thoughtful scholars of the litigation process, has said, there is “a vast sea of events, encounters, collisions, rivalries, disappointments, discomforts and injuries” in the world, but only when the victim <a class="calibre4"></a>recognizes the possibility of legal resolution does the event become a potential lawsuit.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>受害者意识到潜在的法律纠纷只是第一步。与其使用其他争议解决方式或将事情抛诸脑后，不如承担法律程序的费用，这绝对是值得的。在罗宾逊一家的案例中，对醉酒司机提起的诉讼可能并不那么有吸引力，因为司机几乎没有保险或资产来支付判决赔偿金。人们很少仅仅为了确立原则而提起诉讼；除非能有所收获，否则他们不会花时间，也找不到律师来投入诉讼。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A victim’s recognition that a potential legal dispute exists is only the first step. It must be worthwhile to incur the costs of the legal process rather than using alternative means of dispute resolution or forgetting the whole thing. In the Robinsons’ case, the obvious suit against the drunk driver probably was unattractive because the driver had little or no insurance or assets to pay a judgment. People seldom litigate just to establish a principle; unless there is something to be gained, they will not spend the time and they will be unable to find a lawyer to invest in the litigation.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>即使有可能获得赔偿，其他解决问题的方法也可能更好。尤其是在车祸相对较轻的情况下，受害人通常会与自己的保险公司或对方司机的保险公司达成和解，而不是起诉。即使有可行的诉讼理由，并且很有可能获得赔偿，房主通常也不会起诉邻居，企业也不会起诉供应商；由此产生的负面情绪不值得追回的金钱。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Even if there is a potential recovery, alternative means of dealing with the problem may be better. Especially if an auto accident is relatively minor, the injured party will settle with her own or the other driver’s insurance company rather than sue. Even when they have a viable cause of action and a good chance to get a money judgment, homeowners often do not litigate against their neighbors and businesses do not litigate against their suppliers; the bad feelings generated are not worth the dollars recovered.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>受害者是否提起诉讼的一个重要因素是能否聘请律师来处理此事。无论如何，律师费都必须由当事人支付。在像罗宾逊一家这样的严重人身伤害案件中，即使是中等收入的受害者也能聘请到最好的律师，因为律师通常会按胜诉酬金的原则接手案件，即律师费按最终赔偿金的一定比例支付。然而，在其他案件中，许多原本有理有据的索赔最终无法提起，因为律师的潜在赔偿金额太小，委托人无力直接支付律师费。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>An important element of the decision to pursue litigation is the victim’s ability to obtain a lawyer to pursue the matter. One way or another, lawyers have to be paid by the parties. In serious personal injury cases like the Robinsons’, even victims of moderate means can get the best lawyers, because the lawyers commonly will take the case on a contingent fee basis, under which they are paid a percentage of the eventual recovery. In other cases, though, many otherwise meritorious claims will never be brought because the potential recovery for the lawyer is too small and the client can’t pay the lawyer directly.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>一项关于民事诉讼的大规模研究试图为这种筛选潜在案件的过程提供一些数据。这些数字因案件类型和涉案人员而异，但大致结果如下。首先，假设有10000起各种各样的不良经历——在邻居家结冰的人行道上滑倒、新烤面包机坏了、房东未能向房客提供足够的热水。在这些事件中，1000起的受害人会认为自己是他人（邻居、烤面包机制造商、房东）造成的不法行为的受害者。在这些人中，700人会向不法行为人投诉问题；其余300人会置之不理。在450起案件中，不法行为人会拒绝索赔；在大约100起案件中，受害者会去找律师。在50起案件中，律师会向法院提起诉讼。双方会和解其中的25到35起，法院会处理……<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_102" class="calibre4"></a>其余大多数案件无需审判，可能有 2 或 3 个案件会进行审判，其中只有一半会进行陪审团审判。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One massive study of civil litigation tried to attach some numbers to this process of filtering out potential cases. The figures vary widely depending on the type of case and the people involved, but here are the rough results. First take a roundup of, say, 10,000 bad experiences of all kinds—a slip on a neighbor’s icy sidewalk, a new toaster that breaks, a landlord’s failure to provide enough hot water to a tenant. The injured party in 1,000 of these incidents will see herself as the victim of a wrong caused by some other person (the neighbor, the manufacturer of the toaster, the landlord). Of these people, 700 will complain to the wrongdoer about the problem; the other 300 will let it go. The wrongdoer will reject the claim in 450 of the cases, and the victim will go see a lawyer in about 100 of those cases. The lawyer will file a case in court in 50 cases. The parties will settle 25 to 35 of those cases, the court will dispose of <a class="calibre4"></a>most of the rest without a trial, and perhaps 2 or 3 cases will go to trial, and only half of those will be jury trials.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>罗宾逊夫妇通过了这些筛选。他们找到了一位愿意接手他们案件的律师，律师评估了潜在的法律理论，确定了可能承担责任的被告，以及如果被追究责任，谁有能力支付赔偿金。律师很可能发现撞到他们的司机没有保险或资产，或者资产太少，无法支付他们的伤害赔偿金，于是他联系了奥迪公司，但奥迪拒绝以足够的金额和解，所以他决定是时候提起诉讼了。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Robinsons made it through these filters. They found a lawyer willing to take their case, and the lawyer assessed the potential legal theories and identified defendants who might be held liable and who would be able to pay if they were. Probably the lawyer found that the driver who hit them had no insurance or assets or too little to pay for their injuries, and he contacted Audi, who refused to settle the case for an adequate amount, so he decided it was time to sue.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0010_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-4-div1-5"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0020" class="calibre1">可以在哪里提起诉讼？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0020" class="calibre1">Where Can a Lawsuit Be Brought?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">律师在决定起诉地点时，需要考虑两方面因素。第一点是法律问题：哪些法院有权审理案件？第二点是策略问题：在哪个法院提起诉讼最有利？我们将在接下来的几节中讨论这些问题。</p><p class="noindent">Two kinds of considerations are involved when a lawyer decides where to bring a suit. The first is a legal issue: Which courts have the authority to hear the case? The second is a tactical issue: In which court is it most advantageous to litigate? We deal with those issues in the next few sections.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>民事诉讼法将第一个问题定义为<em class="calibre8">管辖权</em>。“管辖权”一词源于拉丁语，意为“宣讲法律”。任何人都可以宣讲法律，但只有拥有管辖权的法院才能权威地宣讲法律。如果法院对当事人和案件没有管辖权或法律权威，就无法合法审理案件，其作出的任何裁决对当事人均无效或不具有约束力。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The law of civil procedure frames the first issue as involving <em class="calibre8">jurisdiction</em>. Jurisdiction, translated from the Latin, means “to speak the law.” Anyone can speak the law, but only a court with jurisdiction can speak the law authoritatively. If a court does not have jurisdiction, or legal authority over the parties and the case, it cannot lawfully hear the case, and any decision it reaches is not valid or binding on the parties.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>为了合法地审理案件，法院必须同时拥有<em class="calibre8">标的物管辖权</em>和<em class="calibre8">对人管辖权</em>。标的物管辖权赋予法院审理相关案件的权力，而对人管辖权则允许法院对争议各方行使权力。因此，法院要审理罗宾逊一家的案件，必须拥有审理因车祸引起的侵权索赔的权力（标的物管辖权），以及强制被告在法庭上进行诉讼的权力，并且如果罗宾逊一家胜诉，则必须拥有支付判决金的权力（对人管辖权）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To lawfully adjudicate a case, a court must have both <em class="calibre8">subject matter jurisdiction</em> and <em class="calibre8">personal jurisdiction</em>. Subject matter jurisdiction empowers a court to hear the kind of case at issue, and personal jurisdiction permits the court to exercise authority over the parties to the dispute. For a court to hear the Robinsons’ case, therefore, it must have power over tort claims arising out of automobile accidents (subject matter jurisdiction) and power to compel the defendants to litigate before the court, and, if the Robinsons win, to pay a judgment (personal jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>三个州与事故及相关当事人之间存在逻辑关联，因此显而易见，它们都是提起诉讼的地点。事故发生在俄克拉荷马州。罗宾逊夫妇在纽约从被告之一的Seaway Volkswagen公司购买了他们的奥迪车，事故发生时他们仍然是纽约州的合法居民。而且他们当时正前往亚利桑那州建立新的合法住所。因此，他们完全可以合乎逻辑地在俄克拉荷马州、纽约州或亚利桑那州的法院提起诉讼。（我们将分析范围限制在美国法院；他们有可能在奥迪的发源地德国提起诉讼，但可能性不大。）<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_103" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Three states have a logical relationship to the accident and the parties that makes them obvious places to bring suit. The accident occurred in Oklahoma. The Robinsons had purchased their Audi in New York from Seaway Volkswagen, one of the defendants, and they were still legal residents of New York at the time of the accident. And they were on their way to establish a new legal residence in Arizona. Therefore, they might logically have brought suit in the courts of Oklahoma, New York, or Arizona. (We restrict our analysis to American courts; it is possible but unlikely that they would have sued in Germany, the home of Audi.)<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>每个州都有一组称为<em class="calibre8">普通管辖权法院的</em>法院，这些法院有权审理大多数类型的民事案件，包括侵权、合同和财产索赔。这些是基层审判法院，负责审理该州的大部分司法事务。通常，普通管辖权法院的管辖权不受限制；赋予其权力的州宪法条款或法规以宽泛的措辞表述，赋予其“对所有民事、遗嘱认证和刑事案件的初审管辖权，除非本法另有规定”，正如科罗拉多州宪法所规定的那样。按照传统，不同州的普通管辖权法院有不同的名称。在亚利桑那州，高等法院是普通管辖权法院；在俄克拉荷马州，它是地区法院；奇怪的是，在纽约州，普通管辖权法院被称为最高法院。 （在纽约，该州的最高法院，在其他地方几乎都被称为州最高法院，被称为上诉法院。）每个州也都有有限管辖权的法院，例如家庭法院，其管辖权仅限于离婚和子女监护权问题，遗嘱认证法院，其管辖权仅限于继承事宜，以及小额索赔法院，其仅对涉及相对小额金额的案件具有管辖权。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Every state has a set of courts called <em class="calibre8">courts of general jurisdiction</em> that are empowered to hear most kinds of civil cases, including tort, contract, and property claims. These are the basic-level trial courts that hear the bulk of the state’s judicial business. Usually the subject matter jurisdiction of courts of general jurisdiction is unrestricted; the state constitutional provision or statute that gives them authority is expressed in broad language, giving them “original jurisdiction in all civil, probate, and criminal cases, except as otherwise provided herein,” as the Colorado constitution provides. By tradition, the general jurisdiction courts of different states have different names. In Arizona, the Superior Court is the court of general jurisdiction; in Oklahoma, it’s the District Court; and, strangely enough, in New York the general jurisdiction court is known as the Supreme Court. (In New York, the highest court in the state, which is known practically everywhere else as the state’s supreme court, is called the Court of Appeals.) Every state also has courts of limited jurisdiction, such as a family court, whose subject matter jurisdiction is limited to divorce and child custody issues, a probate court, with jurisdiction limited to inheritance matters, and a small claims court, which has jurisdiction only over cases involving relatively small dollar amounts.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法院的另一个传统划分是<em class="calibre8">法律法院</em>和<em class="calibre8">衡平法院</em>。随着十三世纪皇家法院变得更加僵化和官僚化，沮丧的诉讼当事人转而将国王视为正义的源泉。国王指派他的得力助手——大法官，在法院无法处理的案件中提供更灵活的司法服务。随着时间的推移，大法官行使自由裁量权本身在<em class="calibre8">衡平法院</em>（或因其目标是公平，即<em class="calibre8">衡平法院）</em>中制度化。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Another traditional division of courts is into <em class="calibre8">law</em> and <em class="calibre8">equity</em>. As the royal courts became more rigid and bureaucratic in the thirteenth century, frustrated litigants turned to the king as the fount of justice. The king assigned his right-hand man, the chancellor, to provide more flexible justice in cases in which the law courts would not. Over time the chancellor’s exercise of discretion itself became institutionalized in a <em class="calibre8">court of chancery</em> or, because its goal was fairness, of <em class="calibre8">equity</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>两种相互竞争的司法体系的存在，成为王室与议会之间，以及后来王室与美洲殖民者之间斗争的焦点。对殖民者而言，衡平法院是帝国权威的象征。从19世纪开始，随着法律与衡平法合并为一个体系，这种冲突逐渐消退。如今，衡平法作为一套独特的救济和程序，仍然具有重要意义。例如，当诉讼当事人寻求<em class="calibre8">禁令</em>（法院命令强制某人做或不做某事）而不是金钱赔偿时，这属于衡平法范畴。在某些私人案件中，当法律规定的损害赔偿不足以弥补损失时，例如当一家企业试图禁止另一家企业非法使用其商标时，禁令是可行的。禁令也用于民权案件和类似的公共诉讼；20世纪50年代和60年代，南方学校的种族隔离就是由联邦法院行使其衡平法权力下令取消的。最后，一个重要的案例<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_104" class="calibre4"></a>这种区别的结果是，按照公平原则，法官无需陪审团即可裁决案件。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The existence of two competing judicial systems became a point of conflict in the struggles between the crown and Parliament and, later, between the crown and American colonists, for whom the equity courts were a symbol of imperial authority. Beginning in the nineteenth century, the conflict faded as law and equity merged into a single system. Today, equity remains important as a distinctive set of remedies and procedures. When a litigant seeks an <em class="calibre8">injunction</em> (a court order compelling someone to do or not do something) rather than money damages, for example, it is an equitable matter. Injunctions are available in some private cases when the legal remedy of damages is inadequate, as when one business seeks to enjoin another from illegally using its trademark. They also are used in civil rights cases and similar public litigation; the desegregation of schools in the South through the 1950s and 1960s was ordered by federal courts exercising their equitable powers. One final, important <a class="calibre4"></a>consequence of the distinction is that, in equity, the judge decides the case without a jury.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>罗宾逊夫妇还必须在对潜在被告拥有属人管辖权的法院提起诉讼。在大多数情况下，属人管辖权很容易适用。首先假设他们想起诉撞到他们车的福特汽车司机。他们当然可以在事故发生的俄克拉荷马州提起诉讼，因为在某个州实施侵权行为提供了管辖权的依据。如果福特汽车司机住在德克萨斯州，罗宾逊夫妇可以在那里起诉他，因为一个人总是可以在其合法居住的州被起诉。但是，当被告与提起诉讼的州的关系不那么明显，并且他们是公司而不是个人时，属人管辖权问题就变得更加棘手，因为很难确定他们在哪里以及在哪里活动。那么，哪些法院对奥迪、大众、环球公司和Seaway公司拥有属人管辖权呢？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Robinsons also have to sue in a court that has personal jurisdiction over the potential defendants. In most cases personal jurisdiction is easy. Suppose first that they want to sue the driver of the Ford that hit their car. They certainly can do so in Oklahoma, the state in which the accident occurred, because committing a tort in a state provides a basis for jurisdiction. If the Ford driver lives in Texas, the Robinsons can sue him there, because a person always can be sued in the state in which he or she has legal residence. But the personal jurisdiction issue is trickier when the defendants have a less obvious relationship to the state in which the suit is brought and when they are corporations, not people, for whom it is harder to pin down where they are and where they act. Which courts, then, have personal jurisdiction over Audi, Volkswagen, World-Wide, and Seaway?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这个问题在一个多世纪前的一系列令人困惑的美国最高法院案件中得到解决，其中最著名的是<em class="calibre8">世界大众汽车公司诉伍德森</em>案，这是罗宾逊一家在 1980 年上诉到最高法院时所称的案件。简单来说，想想为什么如果罗宾逊一家在俄克拉荷马州或福特司机的家乡德克萨斯州起诉我们会感到安心。在这两种情况下，司机都不能抱怨法院对他行使管辖权是不公平的。在每种情况下，司机与法院所在州（提起诉讼的州）之间都有足够的联系，因此让他为在法院所在州的法院提起的诉讼进行辩护似乎是公平的。要求某人在他发生事故的州提起诉讼似乎并不公平，要求他在他的家乡州提起诉讼当然也并不公平。而且，在每种情况下，法院所在州都有裁决争议的合法利益。俄克拉荷马州应该有权审理涉及其高速公路事故的案件，而德克萨斯州应该有权决定对其居民采取行动。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This issue has been addressed in a series of confusing U.S. Supreme Court cases dating back more than a century and featuring <em class="calibre8">World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson</em>, as the Robinsons’ case was called when it reached the Supreme Court in 1980. To make it simple, think about why we feel comfortable if the Robinsons sue the Ford driver in Oklahoma or in his home state of Texas. In either of those cases, the driver can’t really complain that it is unfair for the court to exercise jurisdiction over him. In each case, there is a sufficient connection between the driver and the forum state (the state in which suit is brought) so that it seems fair to make him defend an action brought in the forum state’s court. It doesn’t seem unfair to require someone to litigate in a state in which he is involved in an accident, and it certainly isn’t unfair to require him to litigate in his home state. And, in each case, the forum state has a legitimate interest in adjudicating the dispute. Oklahoma ought to be able to try cases involving accidents on its highways, and Texas should have the power to decide actions against its residents.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">在1945年的“国际鞋业公司诉华盛顿州</em>案”中，最高法院将这种公平感提炼为宪法要求。宪法中的正当程序条款限制了州行使属人管辖权的能力，要求被告与法院所在州保持“最低限度的联系”，以便要求被告在法院所在州进行辩护并不违反“公平竞争和实质正义的传统观念”。（这确实让法学院一年级学生抓狂；法院创造了一套极其复杂的法律体系，表面上却将其建立在“公平竞争”这样一个每个人都应该能够理解的概念之上。）<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_105" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Supreme Court distilled this sense of fairness into a constitutional requirement in the case of <em class="calibre8">International Shoe Company v. Washington</em> (1945). The due process clause of the Constitution limits the ability of a state to exercise personal jurisdiction by requiring that the defendant have “minimum contacts” with the forum state, so that requiring him to defend there does not offend “traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.” (This really makes first-year law students crazy; the court creates an intensely complicated body of law and ostensibly grounds it in a concept like “fair play” that everyone should be able to understand.)<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>罗宾逊夫妇试图在俄克拉荷马州起诉大众汽车公司的四名被告，但最高法院表示，俄克拉荷马州法院只能对制造商奥迪行使管辖权，而不能对分销商或经销商World-Wide和Seaway行使管辖权。奥迪在全国市场上销售汽车，因此它与每个州都有联系，并且理应预料到，如果它的汽车在任何一个州出现故障，它都会被起诉。它获得了在各地开展业务的好处，因此必须承担在任何地方被起诉的责任。然而，World-Wide和Seaway只在纽约地区销售汽车。尽管他们可以预见到他们的一些客户会开车去俄克拉荷马州，但在他们与该州之间没有任何其他联系的情况下，要求他们去那里应诉，在宪法上是不公平的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Robinsons attempted to sue the four Volkswagen defendants in Oklahoma, but the Supreme Court said that an Oklahoma court could properly assert jurisdiction only over the manufacturer, Audi, and not the distributor or dealer, World-Wide and Seaway. Audi sells its cars in a national market, so it has contacts with every state and should reasonably expect to be subject to a suit when one of its cars malfunctions in any state. It obtains the benefits of doing business everywhere, so it must accept the responsibility of being sued anywhere. World-Wide and Seaway, however, sell cars only in the New York area. Although they could foresee that some of their customers would drive to Oklahoma, it would be constitutionally unfair to require them to go there to defend suits in the absence of any other contacts between them and that state.</p>

<p class="noindent">罗宾逊夫妇将案件提交给了俄克拉荷马州克里克县的地方法院，该法院是俄克拉荷马州法院系统的一部分，但他们也可以通过向联邦法院提起诉讼“将此案变成联邦案件”。美国的法院系统与州法院系统平行。与大多数州系统一样，联邦司法系统设有初审法院（称为美国地方法院）、中级上诉法院（称为美国上诉法院，有时也称为巡回法院，源于最高法院法官“巡回”到不同地方开庭审理的时代）和最高法院（美国最高法院）。该系统按地理位置划分，例如，设有负责俄克拉荷马州北区的美国地方法院和负责审理来自俄克拉荷马州、科罗拉多州、堪萨斯州、新墨西哥州、犹他州和怀俄明州的案件的美国第十巡回上诉法院。</p><p class="noindent">The Robinsons brought their case in the District Court in Creek County, Oklahoma, part of the Oklahoma state court system, but they could have “made a federal case out of it” by bringing suit in the federal courts. The United States has a court system parallel to the state court systems. Like most state systems, the federal judicial system has trial courts (called the U.S. District Courts), intermediate appellate courts (called the U.S. Courts of Appeals, or sometimes the Circuit Courts, from the days when Supreme Court justices “rode circuit” to hold court in different places), and a highest court (the U.S. Supreme Court). The system is geographically organized, with, for example, a U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma and a U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, hearing cases from Oklahoma, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>尽管联邦法院系统与州法院系统非常相似，但在管辖权问题上，两套系统却有着根本的区别。在州法院，对案件类型的管辖权（标的管辖权）通常比较容易，因为初审法院对大多数案件拥有一般管辖权；但对被告的管辖权（属人管辖权）则受宪法限制，即与州法院的充分接触，使得对被告行使管辖权是公平的。在联邦法院，情况恰恰相反。属人管辖权不受宪法正当程序要求的限制；即使地区法院设在地方，它们也都是可以对被告行使管辖权的国家体系的一部分。（然而，根据法院规则，联邦地区法院对被告行使属人管辖权的程度，与其所在州法院的程度相同。）然而，属人管辖权要棘手得多，因为联邦法院<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_106" class="calibre4"></a>有限管辖法院；它们的权力仅限于宪法和国会授予的范围内。因此，与州法院不同，联邦法院只审理特定类别的案件。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Although the federal court system looks pretty much like the state systems, on the issue of jurisdiction the systems are fundamentally different. In the state courts, jurisdiction over the kind of case (subject matter jurisdiction) is usually easy because the trial courts have general jurisdiction over most kinds of cases, but jurisdiction over the defendant (personal jurisdiction) is subject to the constitutional limitation of sufficient contacts with the state such that it is fair to assert authority over the defendant. In the federal courts it is just the opposite. Personal jurisdiction is unrestrained by constitutional due process requirements; even though the district courts sit locally, they are all part of a national system that can assert jurisdiction over defendants. (By court rule, however, federal district courts assert personal jurisdiction over defendants only to the same extent as the courts of the states in which they sit.) Subject matter jurisdiction is much trickier, though, because the federal courts are <a class="calibre4"></a>courts of limited jurisdiction; they have authority only to the extent that the Constitution and the Congress have granted it to them. So unlike the state courts, the federal courts only hear cases in particular categories.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如果每个州都有自己的司法系统，那我们为什么还需要联邦法院呢？宪法的制定者和颁布授权立法的国会设立联邦法院有两个原因。首先，一些案件涉及重要的国家问题，应该由美国政府法官而不是任何特定州的法官裁决。其次，美国人历来比较狭隘，因此宪法制定者希望为比如必须在俄克拉荷马州提起诉讼的纽约人提供一个中立的平台。上述每个原因都赋予了联邦法院一种特殊的权力，分别称为<em class="calibre8">联邦问题管辖权</em>和<em class="calibre8">多元化管辖权</em>。（此外，还有一些其他类型的案件由联邦法院审理，例如涉及海事的<em class="calibre8">海事</em>案件，以及美国政府作为一方当事人的诉讼。）</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If each state has a judicial system, why do we need a set of federal courts at all? The framers of the Constitution and the Congresses that enacted enabling legislation had two reasons for establishing federal courts. First, some cases involve important national issues that should be decided by judges of the U.S. government rather than of any particular state. Second, Americans always have been a bit parochial, so the framers wanted to provide a neutral forum for, say, New Yorkers who had to litigate in Oklahoma. Each of those reasons resulted in a particular kind of authority for the federal courts, known respectively as <em class="calibre8">federal question jurisdiction</em> and <em class="calibre8">diversity jurisdiction</em>. (In addition, there are a few other classes of cases given to the federal courts, such as <em class="calibre8">admiralty</em> cases, which involve maritime affairs, and suits in which the U.S. government is a party.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第一类联邦管辖权是联邦问题管辖权。根据宪法和法律，联邦法院的权力延伸至根据宪法、联邦法律和联邦行政法规产生的案件。联邦法院审理涉及所有联邦法律的案件，包括环境法、社会保障法、食品药品监督管理局法规以及违反宪法权利的案件。有时，与民权一样，各州也对这些问题拥有管辖权；例如，有人声称购物中心阻止散发传单侵犯了言论自由，可以向州法院或联邦法院提起诉讼。在其他情况下，联邦法院拥有专属管辖权；例如，只有联邦法院才能审理破产案件或专利诉讼。人们认为，联邦法院比州法院更有能力发展专业知识，使法律更加统一，并在解释和适用联邦法律时考虑国家利益。此外，许多联邦法律在适用于地方争议时并不受欢迎，而赋予联邦法院管辖这些法律的权限，更有可能使其在不受地方偏见和政治干预的情况下得到执行。例如，在20世纪50年代和60年代，联邦法院主要负责在南方一些顽固的州执行民权法。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The first type of federal subject matter jurisdiction is federal question jurisdiction. Under the Constitution and statutes, the power of the federal courts extends to cases arising under the Constitution, federal statutes, and federal administrative rules. Federal courts hear cases involving the whole range of federal law, including the environmental laws, Social Security, Food and Drug Administration regulation, and violations of constitutional rights. Sometimes, as with civil rights, the states also have jurisdiction over these issues; a claim that a shopping mall is infringing on free speech by preventing leafleting can be brought in state or federal court. In other cases, the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction; only a federal court, for example, can hear a bankruptcy case or a patent claim. The federal courts are believed to be in a better position than the state courts to develop expertise, to make the law more uniform, and to consider national interests in the interpretation and application of federal law. In addition, many federal laws are unpopular when applied to local controversies, and vesting federal courts with jurisdiction over them makes it more likely that the laws will be enforced free of local prejudice and political interference. Through the 1950s and 1960s, for example, the federal courts were primarily responsible for enforcing civil rights laws in recalcitrant Southern states.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>多元化管辖权旨在防止对州外诉讼当事人的偏见。宪法制定者希望避免地方法官和陪审团对来自其他州的诉讼当事人产生偏见，或者至少减轻州外当事人对可能存在偏见的担忧。多元化管辖权也允许审理许多具有经济重要性的案件——那些涉及大量<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_107" class="calibre4"></a>例如，不同州的公司之间的商业交易可以在联邦法院审理。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Diversity jurisdiction is designed to prevent prejudice against out-of-state litigants. The framers wanted to avoid bias by local judges and juries against litigants coming from other states, or at least to allay the fears of out-of-staters about the possibility of bias. Diversity jurisdiction also permits many economically important cases—those involving large <a class="calibre4"></a>commercial transactions between companies from different states, for example—to be heard in the federal courts.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最初在何处提起诉讼由原告选择，但历史上，由于对多元化管辖权背后的地方偏见的担忧如此强烈，以至于被告通过一项名为“<em class="calibre8">移送”</em>的原则获得了类似的选择。如果原告在州法院提起诉讼，州外被告可以将其移送至联邦法院，只要联邦法院原本拥有管辖权。例如，这样一来，纽约州的被告就可以通过将案件移送至俄克拉荷马州的美国地方法院，避免在俄克拉荷马州法院被俄克拉荷马州居民起诉时可能产生的偏见。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Where to sue initially is the plaintiff’s choice, but the concern for local prejudice underlying diversity jurisdiction has historically been so great that defendants were given a similar choice through a doctrine known as <em class="calibre8">removal</em>. If the plaintiff brings the action in state court, an out-of-state defendant can remove it to federal court, as long as the federal court would have had jurisdiction in the first place. That way a New York defendant, for example, can avoid the prejudice that might result if sued by an Oklahoman in an Oklahoma state court, by removing the case to the U.S. District Court in Oklahoma.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>多元化管辖权的两个传统要求是案件涉案金额足够以及当事人的国籍多元化。争议金额要求很简单；原告的索赔金额必须超过国会规定的在联邦法院提起诉讼的最低金额。国籍多元化要求则更为引人关注。在大多数情况下，要确立联邦管辖权，必须完全多元化；也就是说，原告和被告必须来自不同的州；如果原告或被告不止一人，则所有原告都必须与所有被告来自不同的州。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The two traditional requirements for diversity jurisdiction are a sufficient amount of money at stake in the case and diversity of citizenship between the parties. The amount in controversy requirement is a simple one; the plaintiff’s claim has to be worth more than a minimum amount set by Congress to be brought in federal court. The diversity of citizenship requirement is more interesting. In most cases, to establish federal jurisdiction there must be complete diversity; that is, the plaintiff and the defendant must be from different states, and if there is more than one plaintiff or defendant, all of the plaintiffs must be from different states than all of the defendants.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这是罗宾逊夫妇案的关键。罗宾逊夫妇声称，他们奥迪车的油箱存在缺陷，导致起火并造成他们受伤，因此他们起诉了奥迪和大众美国公司，即该车的制造商和进口商。如果油箱存在缺陷，那么奥迪和大众公司就是责任方，而且他们当然拥有足够的资产来应对任何不利于他们的判决。那么，为什么罗宾逊夫妇还要起诉奥迪的区域经销商环球大众公司和他们购买车辆的经销商Seaway大众公司呢？答案是他们的律师根据多元化管辖权的法律做出的策略选择。罗宾逊夫妇尚未从纽约迁往亚利桑那州，因此出于多元化考虑，他们仍然是他们原籍纽约的公民。奥迪是一家德国公司，大众美国公司是一家新泽西州的公司，但环球大众公司和Seaway大众公司都是纽约州的公司。将他们纳入案件会破坏完全的多元化原则，这意味着该案无法在联邦法院审理。在所有可能的法院——纽约州、俄克拉荷马州，甚至可能还有亚利桑那州的州法院和联邦法院——罗宾逊夫妇的律师认为，最佳起诉地点是俄克拉荷马州克里克县的州法院，该县当时被认为是美国对人身伤害原告最宽容的司法管辖区之一。由于World-Wide和Seaway参与了此案，<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_108" class="calibre4"></a>被告不能将案件移交至塔尔萨的联邦法院，从罗宾逊夫妇的角度来看，这不太有吸引力。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This is the key to the Robinsons’ case. The Robinsons claimed that the gas tank on their Audi was defective and caused the fire that injured them, so they sued Audi and Volkswagen of America, the manufacturer and importer of the car. If the gas tank was defective, Audi and Volkswagen were the ones responsible, and they certainly had the assets to satisfy any judgment against them. So why did the Robinsons also sue World-Wide Volkswagen, the regional distributor of Audis, and Seaway Volkswagen, the dealer from whom they bought the car? The answer is a strategic choice made by their lawyer using the law of diversity jurisdiction. The Robinsons had not completed their move from New York to Arizona, so they were still citizens of their former home, New York, for diversity purposes. Audi was a German company and Volkswagen of America was a New Jersey corporation, but World-Wide and Seaway were both New York corporations. Bringing them into the case destroyed complete diversity, which meant that the case could not be heard in federal court. Of all the possible forums—state and federal courts in New York, Oklahoma, and possibly Arizona—the Robinsons’ lawyer decided the best place to sue was in state court in Creek County, Oklahoma, then considered one of the most sympathetic jurisdictions for personal injury plaintiffs in America. With World-Wide and Seaway in the case, the <a class="calibre4"></a>defendants could not remove the case to federal court in Tulsa, which was much less attractive from the Robinsons’ point of view.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>尽管罗宾逊夫妇的律师正确地估计了破坏多元化管辖权（一个事由管辖权问题）的可能性，但他却触犯了个人管辖权的法律。Seaway 和 World-Wide 质疑俄克拉荷马州法院对其行使管辖权的能力，美国最高法院也表示赞同，认为强迫纽约分销商和经销商在俄克拉荷马州提起诉讼是不公平的。由于纽约被告退出了案件，多元化问题已完全存在，因此奥迪和大众可以并且确实将案件移交至联邦法院。陪审团最终裁定，撞击罗宾逊夫妇奥迪车的车辆速度，而非油箱缺陷，才是火灾的原因。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Although the Robinsons’ lawyer made the correct calculation about destroying diversity jurisdiction—an issue of subject matter jurisdiction—he ran up against the law of personal jurisdiction. Seaway and World-Wide challenged the ability of the Oklahoma state court to assert jurisdiction over them, and the U.S. Supreme Court agreed, holding that it would be unfair to force the New York distributor and dealer to litigate in Oklahoma. With the New York defendants out of the case there was complete diversity, so Audi and Volkswagen could and did remove the case to federal court, where a jury found that the speed of the car that struck the Robinsons’ Audi, and not a defect in the gas tank, was the cause of the fire.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>像罗宾逊夫妇这样的案件引发了一些批评，他们质疑多元化管辖权是否仍然必要或有效。批评者认为，如今多元化更多地被用作律师的策略，而非对州外被告的保护。地方政府对外州居民的偏见已大幅减少，因此公平程序的价值不再需要一个中立的联邦法院。此外，联邦法院适用与州法院相同的实体法，其法官和陪审员也来自与州法院大致相同的地区，因此这两个法院之间的差异已经缩小。他们说，我们可以取消多元化管辖权，减少联邦法院的工作量——尽管这当然会增加州法院的负担。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Cases like the Robinsons’ cause some critics to question whether diversity jurisdiction is still necessary or useful. Today, the critics argue, diversity is more commonly used as a lawyer’s tactic than a protection for out-of-state defendants. Local prejudice against out-of-staters has declined to a considerable extent, so the value of fair process no longer requires a neutral federal forum. Moreover, federal courts apply the same substantive law as state courts and draw their judges and jurors from about the same locales as the state courts, so the differences between the two forums have diminished. We could, they say, eliminate diversity jurisdiction and reduce the workload of the federal courts—though this would, of course, increase the burden on the state courts.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>从罗宾逊案中我们可以看出，原告可以在哪里起诉和他或她应该在哪里起诉通常是两个不同的问题。根据管辖规则，原告可以选择法院：州法院或联邦法院，纽约州或俄克拉荷马州。在这些法院中进行选择对原告律师来说是一个策略问题。律师可以选择在原告居住地和律师执业地的司法管辖区内进行诉讼，唯一需要做出的决定是州法院还是联邦法院。一个法院系统可能比另一个法院更快捷；在某些城市地区，在州法院等待审判的时间可能是六年，在联邦法院等待审判的时间可能是两年，或者在邻近的州司法管辖区，这种差异可能同样巨大。与罗宾逊案一样，陪审团的可能组成可能因法院而异。民事诉讼规则可能由于这样或那样的原因更具吸引力；通常联邦证据开示规则比同类的州规则更广泛、更高效。法官的素质也可能有所不同；人们传统上认为，至少在某些方面，联邦法官的素质高于州法官，而且，一个司法管辖区的法官可能比河对岸或路那边的法官更受尊重。<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_109" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As we can see from the Robinsons’ case, where a plaintiff can sue and where he or she should sue often are two different questions. Under the jurisdictional rules, a plaintiff may have a choice of courts: state or federal, New York or Oklahoma. Choosing among those forums is a tactical issue for the plaintiff’s lawyer. A lawyer simply may choose to litigate at home, in the jurisdiction where the plaintiff lives and the lawyer practices, and the only decision to be made is state or federal court. One court system may be more expeditious than another; in some urban areas, the wait to go to trial may be six years in a state court and two years in a federal court, or the difference may be as great in neighboring state jurisdictions. As with the Robinsons, the probable composition of the jury may differ from one court to another. The rules of civil procedure may be more attractive for one reason or another; often the federal discovery rules are broader and more efficient than comparable state rules. The quality of the judges may differ as well; there is a traditional belief that federal judges are of higher quality, at least in some respects, than state judges, and, again, judges in one jurisdiction may be better regarded than those across the river or down the road.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0010_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-4-div1-7"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0022" class="calibre1">如果您可以在不同地方提起诉讼，那么每个地方适用什么法律？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0022" class="calibre1">If You Can Sue in Different Places, What Law Will Apply in Each Place?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">不同的州法院系统和平行的联邦法院系统造成的一个后果是，不同的法律体系可能适用于同一案件。罗宾逊夫妇在俄克拉荷马州法院提起了诉讼。如果他们选择联邦法院，联邦法院是否会适用不同的法律来裁定奥迪车的油箱是否存在缺陷？或者，如果他们在纽约州提起诉讼，纽约州的侵权法是否会适用于该案件，而不是俄克拉荷马州的法律？由于各地法律各不相同，这类问题往往决定了案件的结果，因此，民事诉讼程序必须有相应的解决方案。</p><p class="noindent">One consequence of having different state court systems and a parallel federal system is that different bodies of law potentially apply to a single case. The Robinsons brought their case in Oklahoma state court. If they had gone to federal court instead, would the federal court have applied different law to determine if the Audi’s gas tank was defective? Or if they sued in New York, would New York’s tort law have applied to the case instead of Oklahoma’s law? Because the law varies from place to place, issues like these often determine the outcome of the case, so it is essential that civil procedure have ways to resolve them.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>不同司法管辖区之间的两种法律冲突很容易解决。一般来说，无论案件适用何种实体法，法院都适用其自身的程序规则。此外，当州法院受理涉及联邦法律的案件时，该州法院将适用联邦法律，包括联邦法院解释该法律的判决，因为宪法规定联邦法律是“国家的最高法律”。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Two kinds of conflict between the law in different jurisdictions are easily resolved. Generally, a court applies its own rules of procedure, whatever substantive law applies to the case. Also, when a state court has a case involving federal law, it applies the federal law, including federal court decisions interpreting the law, because the Constitution makes federal law “the supreme law of the land.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>另外两种冲突则复杂得多。第一种冲突涉及联邦法院审理多元化案件，例如俄克拉荷马州美国地方法院审理罗宾逊夫妇诉奥迪案。联邦法院是否受俄克拉荷马州侵权法的约束，还是可以自行制定关于产品何时构成危险缺陷的规则？美国最高法院已宣布，联邦法院必须在所有实质性问题上遵守州法律。因此，在多元化案件中，联邦法院适用的侵权法、合同法等原则与州法院审理案件时适用的原则相同。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Two other kinds of conflict are much more complicated. The first involves a federal court hearing a diversity case, as when the U.S. District Court in Oklahoma hears the Robinsons’ suit against Audi. Is the federal court bound by Oklahoma tort law, or can it develop its own rule about when a product is dangerously defective? The U.S. Supreme Court has declared that federal courts must follow state law on all substantive issues. Therefore, a federal court in a diversity case applies the same principles of tort law, contract law, and so on as would be applied if the case were in state court.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第二种复杂的跨司法管辖区冲突发生在两个州法律体系之间。假设俄克拉荷马州要求制造商对其产品缺陷承担严格责任，而纽约州则仅在其产品制造过程中存在过失时才要求其承担责任。（更多关于产品责任的内容，请参阅<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.n0118" href="#text/part0011_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-5" class="calibre4">第五章。）罗宾逊夫妇能否通过在俄克拉荷马州提起诉讼来规避纽约州的规定？这个问题属于法律</a><em class="calibre8">冲突</em>的范畴，需要在相互竞争的司法管辖区的法律之间做出选择。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The second kind of complex interjurisdictional conflict is between two bodies of state law. Suppose Oklahoma holds manufacturers strictly liable for defects in their products but New York holds them liable only when they have been negligent in making their products. (For more on products liability, see <a href="#text/part0011_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-5" class="calibre4">Chapter 5</a>.) Can the Robinsons avoid the New York rule by suing in Oklahoma? This issue falls within the area of law known as <em class="calibre8">conflicts of law</em> and requires a choice between the law of competing jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>冲突法是整个法律体系中最混乱的领域之一。它的不确定性折磨着学生，它的复杂性也常常让法庭感到困惑。造成这种混乱的原因揭示了法律的一些基本原理。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The law of conflicts of law is among the messiest areas in the entire body of the law. Its uncertainty tortures students, and its complexity often baffles courts. The reasons for this confusion illustrates something very basic about law.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>直到二十世纪中叶，法律冲突法才由一些据称相对明确的规则组成<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_110" class="calibre4"></a>基于领土主权和正义的概念。例如，侵权案件受事故发生地法管辖；俄克拉荷马州发生的事故，无论案件是在俄克拉荷马州还是在纽约州审理，都受俄克拉荷马州侵权法管辖。同样，合同纠纷受合同签订地州的法律管辖。不幸的是，许多交易都具有跨州性质。罗宾逊一家在纽约购买了一辆德国制造的汽车，该汽车在俄克拉荷马州发生了事故，该诉讼应受哪条法律管辖？相关的不法行为发生在汽车制造、销售还是起火时？让奥迪公司受制于五十个不同州的侵权法，包括一些奥迪公司甚至可能不销售汽车的州，这公平吗？此外，法院对于适用与其自身规则相冲突的另一个州的法律感到不安。在法院努力解决这些问题的过程中，他们制定了反规则和例外情况，这引起了混乱，并最终招致了诸多批评。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Until about the middle of the twentieth century, the law of conflicts of law was composed of what purported to be relatively clear rules <a class="calibre4"></a>based on territorial notions of sovereignty and justice. For example, a tort case would be governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the accident occurred; an accident in Oklahoma would be controlled by Oklahoma tort law whether the case was tried there or in New York. Similarly, a contract dispute would be governed by the law of the state in which the contract was made. Unfortunately, many transactions have a multistate character. What law governs an action by the Robinsons, who purchased a car in New York that was made in Germany and that was involved in an accident in Oklahoma? Did the relevant wrongful act occur when the car was made, sold, or burst into flames? Is it fair to subject Audi to the tort rules of fifty different states, including some states in which it may not even sell cars? Moreover, courts became uneasy about applying the law of another state that conflicted with their own rules. As the courts grappled with these issues, they created counterrules and exceptions to the rules that generated confusion and ultimately much criticism.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法官和学者在批判旧规则方面非常成功，但在制定新规则方面却不那么成功。许多州的法院放弃了旧规则，转而采用灵活的标准，要求他们权衡和平衡多种因素，导致具体案件的结果变得难以预测。许多司法管辖区从未采纳旧规则，而是或明或暗地坚持旧规则。结果，情况有所不同，但并不一定更好。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Judges and scholars were very successful in criticizing the old rules but less successful in formulating new ones. The results in particular cases have become unpredictable in many states, as courts abandon the old rules in favor of flexible standards requiring them to weigh and balance a multiplicity of factors. And many jurisdictions never came on board, implicitly or explicitly clinging to the older rules. As a result, things are different but not necessarily better.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这一切的教训是，清晰僵化的法律规则往往并非表面所见。它们要么在应用于不同的事实情况时造成不公正，要么要求解释和例外——然而解释和例外又会导致复杂性和不确定性。另一方面，宽泛灵活的法律规则赋予法院极大的自由裁量权，而自由裁量权会导致相互冲突的裁决和不确定的规则，这又是复杂性和不公正的另一种表现形式。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The lesson from all this is that clear, rigid legal rules are often not what they appear to be. They either produce injustice as they are applied to varying fact situations or they demand interpretations and exceptions—yet interpretations and exceptions cause complexity and uncertainty. Broad, flexible legal rules, on the other hand, give the courts great discretion, and discretion produces conflicting decisions and uncertain rules, which is another form of complexity and injustice.</p>

<p class="noindent"><em class="calibre8">律师开始诉讼的第一步是准备一份文件，即诉状</em>，并向法院提交。顾名思义，诉状中<em class="calibre8">原告</em>（起诉人）指控<em class="calibre8">被告</em>（被起诉人）侵犯了他的合法权利，并请求法院给予救济。（法律并不要求律师提交诉状或以其他方式代表原告。任何人都可以自己代表自己——这种做法的拉丁语术语是<em class="calibre8">pro se</em>，意为“为自己”。但实际上，在小额索赔法庭之外，律师是必不可少的。）诉状中会附上<em class="calibre8">传票</em>，这是法院出具的文件。<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_111" class="calibre4"></a>传唤被告对指控作出回应。原告必须通过治安官、送达人或邮寄方式将起诉状和传票副本送达被告，以促使<em class="calibre8">其</em>向被告送达诉讼文书，具体方式取决于受理案件的法院规则。</p><p class="noindent">A lawyer begins a suit by preparing and filing with the court a document known as a <em class="calibre8">complaint</em> in which, as its name suggests, the <em class="calibre8">plaintiff</em> (the person who is suing) complains that the <em class="calibre8">defendant</em> (the person who is being sued) violated his legal rights and asks the court for a remedy. (The law doesn’t require that a lawyer file the complaint or otherwise represent the plaintiff. Anyone can represent himself—the term for this is <em class="calibre8">pro se</em>, Latin meaning “for oneself.” As a practical matter, though, outside of small claims court a lawyer is a necessity.) Attached to the complaint is a <em class="calibre8">summons</em>, a document from the court <a class="calibre4"></a>that summons the defendant to respond to the charges. The plaintiff must cause <em class="calibre8">service of process</em> on the defendant by having a copy of the complaint and summons delivered to the defendant by a sheriff, process server, or mail, depending on the rules of the court in which the case is filed.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>诉状开始界定诉讼的内容。例如，在罗宾逊一家的案件中，诉状会陈述</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The complaint begins to define what the litigation is about. In the Robinsons’ case, for example, the complaint would state</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bullet">• 罗宾逊夫妇和奥迪车的被告是谁？</p><p class="bullet">•&nbsp;&nbsp;who the Robinsons and the Audi defendants were,</p>
<p class="bullet">• 罗宾逊一家从 Seaway Volkswagen 购买了一辆奥迪，</p><p class="bullet">•&nbsp;&nbsp;that the Robinsons had purchased an Audi from Seaway Volkswagen,</p>
<p class="bullet">• 奥迪如何遭遇事故，</p><p class="bullet">•&nbsp;&nbsp;how the Audi had been involved in an accident,</p>
<p class="bullet">• 奥迪车存在哪些缺陷，</p><p class="bullet">•&nbsp;&nbsp;how the Audi was defective,</p>
<p class="bullet">• 该缺陷导致 Kay Robinson 和孩子们受伤，并且</p><p class="bullet">•&nbsp;&nbsp;that the defect caused injuries to Kay Robinson and the children, and</p>
<p class="bullet">• 出于这些原因，奥迪被告应该向罗宾逊夫妇支付赔偿金。</p><p class="bullet">•&nbsp;&nbsp;for those reasons, the Audi defendants ought to pay the Robinsons money.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">这些信息有多种用途。首先，它奠定了法院管辖权的基础。诉状指出本案涉及一起发生在俄克拉荷马州的车祸，明确指出该案可在俄克拉荷马州地方法院提起。其次，它告知被告他们被起诉以及被起诉的原因。充分通知被告，使他们能够聘请律师，并开始思考抗辩原告索赔的依据。第三，它界定了案件将涉及的事实和法律问题，以及（由此隐含地）不会涉及的问题。通过阐述诉讼原因的要素——原告为何声称他们因其指控被告的错误行为而有权获得救济——诉状告知当事人和法官哪些内容与案件的最终判决相关。例如，就事实而言，罗宾逊夫妇的车和另一辆涉事车辆的速度将至关重要，因为起火可能是奥迪车的故障而非超速造成的，因此双方可能都希望进行调查，并在庭审中提供关于车辆速度的证据。然而，被告是否通过宣传其车辆配备高保真音响系统（而实际上它配备的是一个廉价、低质量的音响系统）来欺骗罗宾逊夫妇并不重要，因为这种说法与事故无关。双方应该知道不要进行调查或提供证据。<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_112" class="calibre4"></a>关于音响系统；如果他们试图这样做，法官就会阻止他们。</p><p class="noindent">This information serves several purposes. First, it lays the basis for the jurisdiction of the court. By stating that this case involves an automobile accident that occurred in Oklahoma, the complaint makes clear that the case can be brought in Oklahoma District Court. Second, it notifies the defendants that they are being sued and why they are being sued. Adequate notice to the defendants enables them to hire lawyers and to begin to think about the basis on which they will contest the plaintiffs’ claims. Third, it frames the issues of fact and law that will be involved in the case and, by implication, the issues that will not be involved. By going through the elements of the cause of action—why the plaintiffs claim they are entitled to relief because of what they allege the defendants did wrong—the complaint tells the parties and the judge what will be relevant to the ultimate decision in the case. On the facts, for example, the speed of the Robinsons’ car and the other car involved in the accident will be relevant, because excessive speed rather than a defect in the Audi may have caused the fire, so both parties may want to investigate and, at trial, present proof about the speed of the cars. Whether the defendants defrauded the Robinsons by advertising the car as having a high-fidelity sound system when it actually had a cheap, tinny system is not relevant, though, because that claim has nothing to do with the accident. The parties should know not to investigate or present proof <a class="calibre4"></a>about the sound system; if they try to do so anyway, the judge will know to stop them.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>传统上，诉状和其他诉状是当事人和法院界定案件争议焦点的唯一途径。法官要求律师具体、准确地陈述索赔背后的事实。如果律师未能做到这一点——例如，罗宾逊夫妇的律师错误地陈述了奥迪的公司名称，或者未能具体说明缺陷是如何发生的——案件将被驳回。由于这种过度技术性与服务于实体法的价值和提供公平程序的目标相冲突，法官放宽了诉状要求，界定案件争议焦点的过程始于诉状，并贯穿案件的取证和审前阶段。罗宾逊夫妇的律师可以在诉状中陈述奥迪车辆存在缺陷，随后尝试明确缺陷的具体内容。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Traditionally, the complaint and other pleadings were the exclusive means of defining the issues in the case for the parties and the court. Judges required that a lawyer plead the facts underlying the claim specifically and precisely. If a lawyer failed to do so—if, for example, the Robinsons’ lawyer misstated Audi’s corporate name or failed to specify how exactly the defect occurred—the case would be thrown out of court. Because this hypertechnicality conflicts with the goals of serving the values of the substantive law and providing fair process, judges have relaxed the pleading requirements, and the process of defining the issues in the case begins with the complaint but continues through the discovery and pretrial stages of the case. The Robinsons’ lawyer can state in the complaint that the Audi was defective and subsequently try to pin down exactly what the defect was.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>为了体现这种灵活性，例如，如果律师在诉状中犯错，或发现新的信息表明诉状不完整或不正确，法院通常允许修改诉状以纠正错误或纳入新的信息。罗宾逊夫妇最初只起诉了大众汽车美国公司、Seaway 和 World-Wide，但后来他们修改了诉状，增加了他们认为是制造商的德国公司大众汽车股份公司；当他们通过正式调查得知，另一家德国公司奥迪股份公司才是真正的汽车制造商时，他们再次修改诉状，将大众汽车替换为奥迪。事实上，关于修改诉状的规则非常宽松，当事人通常可以在庭审时或庭审后进行修改，以使诉状与庭审中提供的证据相符。只要被告对案件的基本情况有充分的了解，那么关注案件的实质内容而不是律师对诉状规则的技术性遵守，就能实现正义。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As an illustration of this flexibility, if a lawyer makes a mistake in pleading or discovers new information that reveals a pleading to be incomplete or incorrect, the court usually allows the pleading to be amended to correct the error or account for the new information. The Robinsons originally sued only Volkswagen of America, Seaway, and World-Wide, but subsequently they amended their complaint to add Volkswagen AG, the German corporation who they thought was the manufacturer; when they learned through formal discovery that Audi AG, a different German company, was really the manufacturer of the car, they amended again to substitute Audi for Volkswagen. Indeed, the rules on amending pleadings are so liberal that a party usually can amend at or after trial, so that the pleadings match the proof presented at trial. As long as the defendant has fair notice of the basics of the case, justice is served by focusing on the substance rather than the lawyer’s technical compliance with pleading rules.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>但这并不意味着对诉状没有限制。诉状中的所有内容都必须基于事实并善意陈述，并且根据司法管辖区的不同，当事人必须宣誓其真实性，或者提交诉状的律师必须签署诉状。例如，《联邦规则》要求律师签署诉状，并证明其经过合理调查后得出结论，认为该诉状有充分依据，且其行为是善意的，提交诉状时没有不正当动机。如果诉状中的陈述是虚假或无意义的，法院可以对当事人或律师处以罚款。此类规则的严格应用极大地激励了律师在起草和调查诉状的准确性时保持谨慎。<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_113" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This does not mean that there are no limits on pleading, however. Everything in a pleading has to be grounded in fact and stated in good faith, and, depending on the jurisdiction, either the party must swear to its truthfulness or the attorney filing the pleading must sign it. The Federal Rules, for instance, require an attorney to sign a pleading and attest to the fact that she has concluded, after reasonable inquiry, that the pleading is well grounded and that she is acting in good faith and without improper motivations in filing the pleading. If a statement in a pleading is false or frivolous, the court can impose penalties on the party or on the attorney. The vigorous application of rules such as this creates a significant incentive for attorneys to be careful in drafting and investigating the accuracy of pleadings.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0010_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-4-div1-9"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0024" class="calibre1">被告可以采取什么措施来应对诉讼？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0024" class="calibre1">What Can the Defendant Do to Respond to a Lawsuit?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">一个人首先会收到原告的起诉状和法院的传票，正式得知自己被起诉。传票通常会指示现在的被告对起诉状作出答辩，但实际上，被告可以通过多种不同的方式应对被起诉。</p><p class="noindent">Someone first receives official notice that he is being sued by receiving the plaintiff’s complaint and an accompanying summons from the court. The summons typically directs the now-defendant to answer the complaint, but the defendant actually has a number of different ways of responding to being sued.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>首先，被告可以完全无视整个事件。如果刑事案件中的被告未回应传票或未出庭受审，警方可以出庭逮捕她。民事案件则不然。如果环球大众汽车公司收到了罗宾逊夫妇的投诉和邮寄传票，却没有采取任何行动，警方就不会上门将公司总裁告上法庭。但这并不意味着任何人都可以无视投诉。未回应投诉的处罚是，原告可以请求法院对被告进行缺席审判<em class="calibre8">。</em>缺席审判阻止被告随后就案件的实质提出任何抗辩，原告可以继续寻求<em class="calibre8">缺席判决</em>，以结束针对被告的案件，然后可以像其他判决一样尝试执行该判决。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>First, the defendant can simply ignore the whole thing. If the defendant in a criminal case fails to answer a summons or appear for trial, the police can go out and arrest her. Not so in a civil case. If World-Wide Volkswagen receives the Robinsons’ complaint and summons in the mail and doesn’t do anything in response, the police won’t come and drag the company’s president into court. But that doesn’t mean that anyone can just ignore a complaint. The sanction for failing to respond to the complaint is that the plaintiff can get the court to enter a <em class="calibre8">default</em> against the defendant. A default prevents the defendant from subsequently entering any defenses on the merits of the case, and the plaintiff can proceed to get a <em class="calibre8">default judgment</em> that concludes the case against the defendant and then can attempt to enforce it like any other judgment.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>有时，被告可能会冒险忽略投诉并做出缺席判决，因为被告认为原告不愿意或无法执行判决。假设奥迪车的缺陷并未造成严重伤害，只需进行 200 美元的小修。如果罗宾逊夫妇出于某种奇怪的原因就这么小的金额提起诉讼，World-Wide 公司可能会忽略该诉讼，因为他们认为，要么不值得在俄克拉荷马州聘请律师为这么小的金额进行辩护，要么罗宾逊夫妇懒得去纽约追讨。不过，通常情况下，如果原告值得起诉，那么被告也值得应诉，因此被告除了忽略投诉并冒着缺席的风险外，还会采取其他行动。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sometimes a defendant may take the chance of ignoring a complaint and having a default judgment entered against it because the defendant doesn’t think the plaintiff will be willing or able to enforce the judgment. Suppose the defect in the Audi had not caused serious injuries but had required only a minor repair costing $200. If the Robinsons had for some strange reason sued for this small amount, World-Wide might have ignored the suit, figuring that either it wouldn’t be worth the money to hire a lawyer in Oklahoma to defend a suit for such a small amount, or the Robinsons wouldn’t bother to go to New York to try to collect it. Ordinarily, though, if it is worthwhile for the plaintiff to sue, it is worthwhile for the defendant to respond, so the defendant will do something other than ignore the complaint and risk a default.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>被告可以采取的第二种策略是提出与案件实质无关的诉讼异议。异议的形式是<em class="calibre8">驳回动议</em>。动议是向法院提出的正式请求，旨在撤销案件，而无需触及案件的实质内容。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The second tack the defendant can take is to raise an objection to being sued that is unrelated to the merits of the case. The objection takes the form of a <em class="calibre8">motion to dismiss</em>. A motion is a formal request to the court, here to get rid of the case without ever reaching the substance of what happened.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>有些反对理由微不足道。被告可以声称传票的形式或送达方式存在技术缺陷，例如，在需要亲自送达的情况下，诉状和传票却通过邮寄方式寄送。如果原告能够弥补这一缺陷（在本案中是通过亲自送达被告），那么该反对理由可能会拖延案件审理，但并不能完全阻止案件的审理。如果原告<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_114" class="calibre4"></a>由于被告无法接受送达而无法弥补缺陷，那么被告的策略可能会完全阻止案件的进展。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Some of these objections are trivial. A defendant can say that there was a technical defect in the form of the summons or in the method of service of process, sending the complaint and summons by mail, for example, when personal service is required. If the plaintiff can cure the defect, in this case by personally serving the defendant, then the objection may delay the case but doesn’t halt it altogether. If the plaintiff <a class="calibre4"></a>cannot cure the defect because the defendant is unavailable to be served, then the defendant’s strategy may prevent the case from going forward at all.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>驳回动议的一个更重要的依据是法院对被告或案件缺乏管辖权。回想一下，只有在法院对案件标的和当事人拥有管辖权或权威的情况下，法院才能作出具有约束力的判决。如果被告证明法院缺乏管辖权，法院除了正式承认其缺乏管辖权并驳回案件外，别无他法。这实际上就是环球大众汽车公司和Seaway大众汽车公司在罗宾逊案中所寻求的。环球大众汽车公司和Seaway大众汽车公司辩称，俄克拉荷马州法院对他们没有属人管辖权，因为除了罗宾逊夫妇偶然驾车前往该州之外，他们与该州没有任何联系。环球大众汽车公司和Seaway大众汽车公司请求法院免除其对案件的实质辩护。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A more important basis for a motion to dismiss is that the court lacks jurisdiction over the defendant or the case. Recall that a court can render a binding judgment only in a case where it has jurisdiction, or authority over the subject matter of the case and over the parties. If the defendant demonstrates that the court lacks jurisdiction, the court has no power to do anything other than officially recognize its lack of jurisdiction by dismissing the case. This is effectively what World-Wide Volkswagen and Seaway Volkswagen sought in the Robinsons’ case. Arguing that the Oklahoma state court had no personal jurisdiction over them because they had no contact with the state other than the fortuity that the Robinsons’ drove their car there, World-Wide and Seaway asked to be let out of the case without having to defend on the merits.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>被告可能采取的第三个举措是质疑原告起诉的法律充分性。这一程序传统上被称为<em class="calibre8">抗辩</em>，如今更常被称为<em class="calibre8">因未陈述索赔</em>或未<em class="calibre8">陈述诉讼原因</em>而提出的驳回动议。在此类驳回动议中，被告辩称，即使原告指控的所有事实均属实，也没有法律依据要求被告对原告承担责任。因此，该动议旨在检验原告法律论据的力度，而无需深入探讨争议背后的事实。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The third move the defendant might make is to challenge the legal sufficiency of the plaintiff’s complaint. This procedure was classically known as a <em class="calibre8">demurrer</em> and is today more commonly referred to as a <em class="calibre8">motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim</em> or <em class="calibre8">failure to state a cause of action</em>. In such a motion to dismiss, the defendant argues that even if all of the facts that the plaintiff alleges are true, there is no legal basis for holding the defendant liable to the plaintiff. The motion therefore tests the strength of the plaintiff’s legal argument without getting into the facts underlying the dispute.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>例如，假设俄克拉荷马州的侵权法规定，缺陷产品的制造商对因产品受损的消费者负有严格责任，但并非该产品制造商的经销商不对消费者承担责任。Seaway Volkswagen 可以以未提出索赔为由，驳回罗宾逊夫妇对其提起的诉讼。即使奥迪车存在缺陷，并且该缺陷导致了他们的受伤，根据该法律，零售商 Seaway 也不对罗宾逊夫妇承担责任。Seaway 的处境与罗宾逊夫妇起诉福特、通用或 IBM 的情况相同；无论案件事实如何，法律都没有为该被告提供任何救济。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Suppose, for example, that Oklahoma tort law states that the manufacturer of a defective product is strictly liable to a consumer who is injured by the product, but the distributor of a product who did not manufacture it is not liable to the consumer. Seaway Volkswagen could move to dismiss the Robinsons’ action against it for failure to state a claim. Even if the Audi was defective and the defect contributed to their injuries, under the law Seaway, the retail dealer, is not liable to the Robinsons. Seaway is in the same position as if the Robinsons had sued Ford, GM, or IBM; whatever the facts of the case, the law provides no remedy against this defendant.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如果被告没有理由提出驳回起诉的动议，或者任何驳回动议均失败，则被告最终必须根据案件的实质内容对起诉进行答辩。被告通过提交一份称为答辩状的诉状来做到这一点<em class="calibre8">，</em>该诉状显然是对原告起诉书中提出的指控作出的回应。被告可以通过三种方式回应原告的指控：说“不”（否认指控属实）、“我不知道”（否认知道指控），<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_115" class="calibre4"></a>或“是的，但是”（承认指控，但陈述可以为原告的索赔提供辩护的事实）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If the defendant has no basis for making a motion to dismiss the complaint, or if any motions to dismiss fail, the defendant finally has to meet the complaint on the merits of the case. The defendant does this by filing a pleading called an <em class="calibre8">answer</em>, which, obviously, answers the allegations made in the plaintiff’s complaint. The defendant can meet the plaintiff’s allegations in three ways, by saying “no” (denying that the allegations are true), “I don’t know” (disclaiming knowledge about the allegations), <a class="calibre4"></a>or “yes, but” (admitting the allegations but stating facts that would provide a defense to the plaintiff’s claims).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>理想情况下，被告可能会否认原告在起诉状中所说的一切，从而隐藏被告掌握的所有案件信息，并让原告费尽心思提供其主张所需的每一条信息。在过去以及现在的一些司法管辖区，被告可以通过<em class="calibre8">一般否认</em>来实现这一目标，这种方法会对起诉状中的每一项指控提出异议。然而，大多数法院不再允许一般否认，因为在大多数情况下，这种做法违背了诉讼的目的和程序制度的目标。诉讼程序旨在帮助识别和缩小有争议的问题。如果被告通过一般否认来反驳其明知是真实的指控，那么一个可以排除的问题就会不必要地被提出。从制度的角度来看，这是低效的，并且表现出令人沮丧的缺乏坦诚。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Ideally, a defendant might like to deny everything the plaintiff said in its complaint, thereby hiding all the information the defendant has about the case and putting the plaintiff to the trouble of proving every piece of information it needed to establish its claim. In former times and in a few jurisdictions today, the defendant could accomplish that through a <em class="calibre8">general denial</em>, which places into contention every allegation in the complaint. Most courts no longer permit a general denial, though, because in most cases it subverts the purposes of the pleadings and the goals of the procedural system. The pleading process is designed to help identify and narrow the issues that are in dispute. If the defendant, through a general denial, controverts an allegation that it knows to be true, an issue that could be excluded is raised unnecessarily. From the system’s point of view this is inefficient and shows a discouraging lack of candor.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>有时，被告会承认原告诉状的基本要素可能属实，但被告会辩称诉状并未涵盖全部情况。如果是这样，原告可以在答辩中提出<em class="calibre8">积极抗辩</em>。抗辩会引入新的因素，即使原告索赔的所有要素均已成立，也能消除或减轻被告的责任。例如，如果罗宾逊夫妇的事故发生在十年前，奥迪可以提出诉讼时效作为积极抗辩，诉讼时效要求诉讼必须在规定的时间内提起。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sometimes the defendant will admit that the essential elements of the plaintiff’s complaint may be true, but the defendant will argue that the complaint doesn’t tell the whole story. If so, in its answer, the plaintiff can raise an <em class="calibre8">affirmative defense</em>. A defense introduces a new factor that eliminates or reduces the defendant’s liability even if all of the elements of the plaintiff’s claim are established. If, for example, the Robinsons’ accident had occurred ten years earlier, Audi could raise as an affirmative defense the statute of limitations, which requires that suits be brought within a prescribed time period.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>被告往往不知道原告的某些说法是否属实。当罗宾逊夫妇声称他们在车祸中受了重伤并花费了巨额医疗费时，奥迪既不能承认也不能否认这些说法，因为还没有看到他们的医疗记录。在这种情况下，民事诉讼规则允许被告实际上说“我不知道”。这使问题陷入争议，原告必须拿出证据。当然，为了促进坦诚并通过诉状来定义争议问题，被告实际上并不知道原告的指控是否属实，法院经常会扩大这一要求，迫使被告进行合理程度的调查以确定真相。例如，如果指控涉及被告自身所作所为的一些事实，被告就不能声称自己不知情；如果罗宾逊夫妇声称奥迪的宣传册将100 LS描述为“路上最安全的汽车”，奥迪不能否认自己了解宣传册的内容，因为只需简单查阅其文件就能发现真相。再次强调，该程序的目标是有效地界定双方真正争论的焦点以及他们可以达成一致的内容。<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_116" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Often the defendant doesn’t know whether some of the plaintiff’s claims are true. When the Robinsons allege that they suffered serious injuries in the crash and incurred large medical bills, Audi can neither admit nor deny the claims, because it has not yet seen their medical records. In that case, the rules of civil procedure permit the defendant to say, in effect, “I don’t know.” This puts the issue into dispute and the plaintiff has to come up with its proof. Of course, the desire to promote candor and to define the disputed issues through the pleadings requires that the defendant really not know if the plaintiff’s allegation is true, and courts often extend that requirement to force the defendant to engage in a reasonable degree of investigation to ascertain the truth. If, for example, the allegation concerns some facts about what the defendant itself did, the defendant cannot profess lack of knowledge; if the Robinsons allege that an Audi brochure described the 100 LS as “the safest car on the road,” Audi cannot disclaim knowledge of what was in its own brochure when a simple check of its files would turn up the truth. Once again, the goal of the process is to efficiently define what the parties are really disputing about and what they can agree on.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0010_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-4-div1-10"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0025" class="calibre1">如果诉讼涉及两个以上的当事人怎么办？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0025" class="calibre1">What If There Are More Than Two Parties to a Lawsuit?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">通常我们认为诉讼只涉及两个人：原告和被告。但正如我们从罗宾逊夫妇的诉讼中看到的那样，即使是普通的诉讼也可能涉及多方——在该案中，有四名原告（凯和哈里·罗宾逊及其两个孩子）和四名被告（奥迪、美国大众汽车、环球大众汽车和Seaway大众汽车）。从两方当事人就单一问题进行诉讼的双极诉讼模式，转变为涉及多方当事人和多个问题的更复杂诉讼，这对程序体系提出了挑战，但该体系处理更复杂案件的方式，却为我们揭示了许多关于现代民事诉讼程序的奥秘。</p><p class="noindent">Usually we think of a lawsuit as involving two people, the plaintiff and the defendant. But as we can see from the Robinsons’ suit, even an ordinary action may involve multiple parties—in that particular case, four plaintiffs (Kay and Harry Robinson and their two children) and four defendants (Audi, Volkswagen of America, World-Wide Volkswagen, and Seaway Volkswagen). Moving from the paradigm of a bipolar suit between two parties litigating a single issue to a more complex action involving several parties and several issues presents a challenge for the procedural system, but the way the system handles more complex cases tells us a lot about modern civil procedure.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法院审理涉及多方当事人和多项诉求的案件时，遵循一项模糊但有效的原则：法院拥有极大的自由裁量权，可以采取最符合实体正义、公平程序和效率的措施。通常，最佳做法是将多个相关争议集中到一个案件中解决，即使这需要引入其他当事人和不同的诉求。这样做，当事人无需重复劳动、浪费时间，也无需在不同的法庭就相同或相似的问题反复诉讼，从而避免出现结果不一致的风险。同时，如果引入其他当事人或诉求会使案件过于混乱或对当事人造成不当损害风险，法院可以单独处理相关问题或当事人。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A vague but effective principle governs courts’ ability to hear cases involving multiple parties and multiple claims: A court has great discretion to do what is most consistent with substantive justice, fair process, and efficiency. Often it is best to resolve a number of related disputes in a single case, even if it involves bringing in other parties and different claims. By doing so, the parties do not have to duplicate effort, waste time, and risk inconsistent results by litigating the same or similar issues over and over in different forums. At the same time, a court can separate out issues or parties if bringing in other parties or claims would make the case too confusing or create an undue risk of prejudice to someone.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如果原告的索赔源于同一事件，且涉及共同的法律或事实问题，他们通常可以一并起诉。哈里和凯·罗宾逊夫妇及其两个孩子在同一起事故中受伤，因此他们在同一起诉讼中提起诉讼，并由同一律师代理。要求他们各自分别起诉奥迪，效率极低，甚至可能不公平。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Plaintiffs usually can sue together if their claims arise out of the same events and involve common issues of law or fact. Harry and Kay Robinson and their two children were all injured in the same accident, so they brought suit in one action, represented by one lawyer. It would be grossly inefficient and possibly unfair to require each of them to sue Audi separately.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>合并案件的一个常见例子是大规模灾难。在纽约上诉法院的一个著名案例中，杰西·阿克利和其他 192 名投资者被允许对涉嫌欺诈他们的股票发起人提起单一诉讼（<em class="calibre8">阿克利诉金尼库特</em>，1924 年）。即使原告不合并诉讼，法院也可以根据被告的要求甚至主动选择合并诉讼。因抗精神病药物 Zyprexa 问题而对礼来公司提起的 18,000 起案件在布鲁克林的联邦法院合并审理；将所有原告集中在一个法院有利于案件的解决。即使这些案件是在不同的法院提起的，法院也有相当大的权力尝试制定适当的方式来处理这些案件。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A common example of combining cases occurs in mass disasters. In a venerable case in the New York Court of Appeals, Jesse Akely and 192 other investors were allowed to bring a single suit against the stock promoters who had allegedly defrauded them (<em class="calibre8">Akely v. Kinnicutt</em>, 1924). Even if the plaintiffs don’t bring their actions together, the court has the option of consolidating the actions on the defendant’s request, or even on its own initiative. Eighteen thousand cases against Eli Lilly &amp; Co. arising out of problems with the antipsychotic drug Zyprexa were consolidated in the federal court in Brooklyn; having all the plaintiffs in one court facilitated settlement of the case. The courts have considerable authority to try to work out an appropriate way of dealing with these cases, even if they are filed in different courts.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>现在想想被告在诉讼中的立场。罗宾逊夫妇起诉了制造商奥迪、进口商美国大众汽车公司；<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_117" class="calibre4"></a>经销商World-Wide Volkswagen和经销商Seaway Volkswagen。同样的原则也适用于原告。部分或所有被告都可能因同一事件承担责任：制造和销售一辆据称油箱存在缺陷的奥迪车，导致罗宾逊夫妇在事故中受伤。由于所有被告的庭审内容基本相同，因此最有效的方法是同时审理所有案件。事实上，如果罗宾逊夫妇想起诉撞到他们的那辆车的司机，他们完全可以而且很可能会在同一起诉讼中提起诉讼。然而，在这种情况下，不仅关于每位被告责任的证据和论据会有所不同，而且索赔也可能有所不同。如果事实与实际案件不同，罗宾逊夫妇提起诉讼可以声称是对方司机的疏忽造成了伤害，或者是他们的奥迪车的缺陷造成了伤害；他们可以将所有可能承担责任的被告告上法庭，并让证据自行决定。 （在实际案件中，他们辩称另一名司机疏忽大意，有缺陷的油箱使他们的伤势比原本更严重。）</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now think about the defendants’ side of the litigation. The Robinsons sued Audi, the manufacturer; Volkswagen of America, the importer; <a class="calibre4"></a>World-Wide Volkswagen, the distributor; and Seaway Volkswagen, the dealer. The same principle applies as with plaintiffs. Some or all of these defendants are potentially liable because of the same set of events: the manufacture and sale of an Audi with an allegedly defective gas tank that injured the Robinsons in an accident. Because the trial will be pretty much the same for all of the defendants, it is most efficient to have everything heard at once. In fact, if the Robinsons had wanted to sue the driver of the car that struck them, they could and probably would have brought that claim in the same suit. In that case, however, not only would there be different evidence and argument about each of the defendants’ liability, but the claims could vary as well. If the facts were different from those in the actual case, by bringing suit the Robinsons could be saying that either the negligence of the other driver caused the harm or a defect in their Audi caused the harm; they are permitted to bring all the potentially liable defendants into court and let the evidence fall where it may. (In the actual case they argued that the other driver was negligent and that the defective gas tank made their injuries more severe than they would have been otherwise.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如果原告选择不将所有潜在责任方都纳入诉讼，原告可以这样做。假设罗宾逊夫妇出于某种原因决定只起诉Seaway，也就是他们购买车辆的经销商。Seaway本可以<em class="calibre8">起诉</em>奥迪——将奥迪列为被告——理由是，无论是根据合同还是法律规定，制造商都必须赔偿经销商因产品缺陷而应承担的任何损失。Seaway也可以起诉另一辆车的司机，声称他的疏忽导致了罗宾逊夫妇的部分或全部受伤。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If a plaintiff chooses not to bring in all of the potentially liable parties, the initial defendant may do so. Suppose the Robinsons for some reason decided to sue only Seaway, the dealer from whom they brought the car. Seaway could have <em class="calibre8">impleaded</em> Audi—brought Audi in as a defendant—on the theory that either by contract or as a matter of law the manufacturer has to pay any damages for which the dealer is held liable due to a product defect. Seaway could also have brought in the driver of the other car, claiming that it was his negligence that was responsible for some or all of the Robinsons’ injuries.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>除了涉及多方当事人外，诉讼通常还涉及多项索赔。罗宾逊夫妇以产品责任理论起诉奥迪被告，并以疏忽罪起诉另一名司机，显然就是这种情况，但情况可能会更加复杂。一种索赔类型称为反诉<em class="calibre8">，</em>即被告向原告提起反诉。如果另一辆车的司机在事故中受伤，当罗宾逊夫妇起诉他时，被告会向原告提起反诉，声称原告的疏忽导致了他的受伤。这显然与原告对他的索赔有关，因此法院要求他在同一诉讼中提起反诉；如果他不这样做，他就不能随后就他的受伤提起另一起诉讼。在其他情况下，反诉与争议事件的联系并不那么紧密，因此必须同时审理，但被告可以提起反诉，因为双方都在法庭上进行诉讼。假设事故发生后，哈里·罗宾逊虽然没有受重伤，但他立即跳下车，大喊：“你……”<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_118" class="calibre4"></a>疯子，看看你干了什么”，然后一拳打在对方司机的脸上。无论是在罗宾逊夫妇的诉讼中，还是在单独的诉讼中，对方司机都可以就被殴打一事提起诉讼。即使他们对事故的指控和他对殴打的指控重叠的证据相对较少，也可以在原诉讼中提起反诉。但是，如果被告不得不将所有可能针对原告的指控都作为反诉提起，无论这些指控与主要事件的关联多么松散，都会使审判变得过于复杂，因此，司机可以将其殴打指控留到下次再提起。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In addition to involving multiple parties, lawsuits often involve multiple claims. This is obviously the case when the Robinsons sue the Audi defendants on a products liability theory and the other driver for negligence, but it can get even more complicated. One species of claim is called a <em class="calibre8">counterclaim</em>, in which the defendant sues the plaintiff back. If the driver of the other car was injured in the accident, when the Robinsons sue him he will respond with a counterclaim against them, alleging that their negligence was liable for his injuries. This is so obviously connected to their claim against him that the courts require him to bring it in the same action; if he doesn’t, he cannot subsequently bring a different suit for his injuries. In other cases the counterclaim is not so intimately connected to the events at issue that it must be considered at the same time, but the defendant may bring it because the parties are in court and litigating anyway. Suppose immediately after the accident Harry Robinson, not having been seriously injured, jumps out of his car and shouts, “You <a class="calibre4"></a>maniac, look what you’ve done,” and punches the other driver in the face. Either in the Robinsons’ suit or in a separate suit, the other driver can bring a claim for battery for being punched. Even though relatively little of the evidence overlaps their claim for the accident and his claim for the punch, the counterclaim can be brought in the original action. But because it would unduly complicate trials if defendants had to bring as counterclaims all claims they might have against the plaintiff, no matter how loosely related to the main event, the driver can save his battery claim for another time.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>另一种索赔类型是被告之间发生争斗。假设事故发生后，奥迪车起火，导致罗宾逊夫妇和另一辆车的司机受伤。罗宾逊夫妇将奥迪和另一辆车的司机列为被告，声称司机的疏忽导致了事故发生，而产品缺陷使情况恶化。司机可以对奥迪提起<em class="calibre8">反诉</em>，声称他自己的受伤是由于有缺陷的奥迪车起火造成的。反诉类似于新的诉讼，只不过它是在被告之间提起的，可以与主诉同时审理。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One other type of claim occurs when defendants begin fighting among themselves. Suppose that after the accident the Audi catches fire and injures the Robinsons and the driver of the other car. The Robinsons name Audi and the other driver as defendants in their action, saying that the driver’s negligence caused the action and the product defect made it worse. The driver may file a <em class="calibre8">cross-claim</em> against Audi, alleging that his own injuries occurred because the defective Audi caught fire. The cross-claim is just like a new action except it is between defendants and can be tried with the main action.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0010_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-4-div1-11"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0026" class="calibre1">如果诉讼涉及多方当事人怎么办？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0026" class="calibre1">What If There Are Many Parties to a Lawsuit?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">有时，由于同一诉讼涉及的当事人数量众多（通常是原告方，偶尔是被告方），法院会将他们视为一个整体而非个体。这类诉讼被称为<em class="calibre8">集体诉讼</em>，因为各个当事人代表着与他们类似的群体中的许多成员，根据法律规定，这些人“处境相似”。也就是说，其他群体成员面临着相同的不满。</p><p class="noindent">Sometimes there are so many parties—usually on the plaintiff side, occasionally on the defendant side—involved in a single lawsuit that the court treats them as a group rather than individually. This type of suit is known as a <em class="calibre8">class action</em>, because the individual parties represent many members of a class of people like them who are, as the law says, “similarly situated.” That is, the other class members share the same grievance.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>假设罗宾逊一家通过大众汽车的内部金融公司购买了汽车，他们认为金融公司错误计算了贷款利率，向他们多收了钱，而该金融公司的其他客户也认为他们也被多收了钱。如果这样的案件有一百起、一千起或一百万起，那么将案件作为集体诉讼进行审理可能更容易处理，因为集体诉讼可以一次性为所有原告确定多收钱的问题。在集体诉讼中，罗宾逊一家可以代表他们自己和其他客户提起集体诉讼；作为集体成员，其他客户实际上并不参与诉讼过程，甚至可能对此一无所知，但他们将受诉讼结果的约束。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Suppose that the Robinsons had financed the purchase of their car through Volkswagen’s in-house finance company, they believe that the finance company had overcharged them by miscalculating the interest rate on the loan, and other customers of the finance company believe they have been overcharged in the same way. If there are a hundred, a thousand, or a million such cases, it may be more manageable to have the case tried as a class action in which the issue of overcharging can be determined once for all the plaintiffs. In a class action, the Robinsons can bring a class action on behalf of themselves and the other customers; as class members, the other customers do not actually participate in the conduct of the litigation and probably do not even know about it, but they will be bound by its outcome.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>集体诉讼涉及的金额从大到惊人不等。一家涉嫌排放有害气味的养猪场被一家<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_119" class="calibre4"></a>450名附近业主组成的集体诉讼。壳牌石油炼油厂爆炸引发集体诉讼，涉及18,000名受伤原告。500万商户参与了起诉万事达卡和维萨卡违反反垄断法的集体诉讼。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The numbers involved in class actions range from the large to the spectacular. A hog farm alleged to emit noxious odors was sued by a <a class="calibre4"></a>class of 450 nearby property owners. An explosion at a Shell Oil refinery resulted in a class action involving 18,000 injured plaintiffs. Five million merchants were in the class that sued MasterCard and Visa for antitrust violations.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>通过允许原告提起集体诉讼，法院试图平衡民事诉讼程序中相互冲突的目标。当然，最终目标是落实实体法规则的政策和价值观。尤其当许多原告各自提出的索赔金额相对较小时，这只能通过集体诉讼来实现。如果金融公司错误计算利率，借款人可能会多支付几美元。由于索赔金额较小且诉讼费用高昂，任何单个借款人提起诉讼都是不值得的。然而，所有借款人的集体损失非常巨大。集体诉讼通过代表所有借款人提起一项诉讼，确保了禁止虚假陈述利率的法律得到实施，并使那些因不法行为而受到损害的人得到赔偿。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>By allowing plaintiffs to bring class actions, courts attempt to balance the conflicting goals of civil procedure. The ultimate goal, of course, is to carry out the policies and values of the substantive rules of law. Especially when many individual plaintiffs each have relatively small claims, this can be done only through a class action. A borrower may pay a few dollars more when the finance company miscalculates the interest rate. Because of the small size of the claim and the expense of litigation, it isn’t worthwhile for any one borrower to sue. The collective loss of all borrowers, though, is very large. By bringing one suit for all of the borrowers, a class action makes sure that the law against misrepresenting interest rates is carried out and the people who are injured by the wrongful conduct are compensated.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在集体诉讼中，如果不可能将所有索赔人全部集中起来，那么将索赔集中起来也有助于提高诉讼制度的运作效率。集体诉讼总是至少涉及一个所有索赔所共有的法律或事实问题，例如利率是否计算错误。一次性审查和裁定该问题比在不同案件中反复审查和裁定效率更高。但是，如果适用于每个索赔人的事实或法律差异过大，集体诉讼就无法提高效率。即使还有一千辆像罗宾逊一家这样的奥迪车卷入事故，据称油箱缺陷导致起火，这些案件也不太适合集体诉讼处理，因为关于事故具体事实和由此造成的伤害的证据差异很大。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Aggregating claims in a class action where it would be impracticable to join all the claimants also serves the value of operating the litigation system efficiently. A class action always involves at least one issue of law or fact that is common to all the claims, such as whether the interest rate was miscalculated. Examining and deciding that issue once is more efficient than doing it over and over in different cases. Where the facts or law applicable to each claimant differ too much, however, efficiency is not served by a class action. Even if a thousand other Audis like the Robinsons’ were involved in accidents in which a defective gas tank allegedly caused a fire, those cases would be less suitable for class-action treatment because the evidence about the specific facts of the accidents and the resulting injuries would be so different.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>由于大多数集体成员不参与诉讼，集体诉讼也涉及特殊的公平问题。所有集体成员都将受诉讼结果的约束，因此法院必须向缺席的集体成员充分告知诉讼进展，允许他们选择退出集体诉讼并自行提起诉讼，并确保集体代表及其律师公平地维护缺席成员的利益。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Because most class members do not participate in the litigation, class actions also implicate special fairness concerns. All members of the class will be bound by its result, so courts are required to give absent class members adequate notice of what is happening, allow them the opportunity to opt out of the class action and sue on their own, and make sure that the class representatives and their lawyers provide fair representation for the interests of the absent members.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>由于集体诉讼规模庞大，且不利判决对被告的潜在成本巨大，集体诉讼通常选择和解而非开庭审理。事实上，有时集体诉讼的提起就是为了和解；原告律师和被告会在案件立案前或立案后不久进行谈判并达成和解，而实际上并没有想到要开庭审理。在这些案件中，法院<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_120" class="calibre4"></a>有义务仔细审查案件是否适合集体诉讼以及拟议的解决方案是否公平。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Because of their massive scale and because the potential cost to the defendant of an adverse judgment is so great, class actions often are settled rather than tried. Indeed, sometimes class actions are brought with the purpose of being settled; the plaintiffs’ lawyers and the defendants will negotiate and arrive at a settlement before or shortly after the case is filed, without ever really expecting to go to trial. In these cases, the court <a class="calibre4"></a>has a heightened obligation to scrutinize whether the case is appropriate for a class action and whether the proposed settlement is fair.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>集体诉讼的法律非常复杂，争议也十分激烈。一些法院将集体诉讼视为一种以相对快速的方式处理大量索赔的有效手段；尽管集体诉讼可能复杂繁琐，但它仍然比处理成千上万的个案要好。其他法院则不太愿意在大型案件中使用该手段，他们认为，案件越偏离传统的裁决范式——即两个对立方之间定义明确的争议——法院就越无力处理此类问题。许多企业对集体诉讼持敌对态度，认为它是原告律师用来胁迫巨额和解并赚取巨额费用的利器。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The law on class actions is very complicated and hotly disputed. Some courts seize on class actions as an effective means of disposing of large numbers of claims in a relatively expeditious manner; even though a class action can be complicated and cumbersome, it is still better than thousands or tens of thousands of individual cases. Other courts are more reluctant to use the device in very large cases, believing that the farther away one goes from the traditional paradigm of adjudication—a well-defined dispute between two adverse parties—the less well equipped a court is to deal with the problem. And many businesses are hostile to class actions, viewing them as a bludgeon used by plaintiffs’ lawyers to coerce massive settlements and generate huge fees.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这场争议的产物之一是2005年颁布的《集体诉讼公平法案》。该法案是侵权法改革运动长期以来的诉求，旨在削减一些最困扰商业利益的集体诉讼的适用范围。该法案将许多集体诉讼转移到联邦法院，这可能会延迟甚至阻止集体诉讼的审理，因为联邦法院更加繁忙，人们认为联邦法官比州法官更难接受集体诉讼，而且当必须适用与州法律相冲突的条款时，他们很容易完全驳回集体诉讼。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One of the products of this controversy was the Class Action Fairness Act, enacted in 2005. Long sought by the tort reform movement, the act cuts back on some of the uses of class actions that most troubled business interests. The act shifts many class actions to federal court, which is likely to delay or even prevent the adjudication of class actions, because the federal courts are busier, federal judges are thought to be less receptive to class actions than state judges, and they are prone to dismiss the class actions altogether when conflicting bodies of state law must be applied.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>该法案还严厉打击律师费和“优惠券和解”。在优惠券和解中，集体诉讼成员不会获得现金赔偿，而是获得一张优惠券，可在未来与被告的交易中用作抵扣或折扣。例如，在针对任天堂的反垄断诉讼中，购买电子游戏机的用户获得了价值五美元的游戏优惠券。根据该法案，法院必须像以前一样仔细审查优惠券和解的公平性。法院现在还必须根​​据实际兑换的优惠券金额（而不仅仅是发放的优惠券金额）来确定律师费。通常情况下，许多收到优惠券的集体诉讼成员不会兑换优惠券；青少年电子游戏用户可能会忽略或忘记任天堂的优惠券。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The act also cracks down on attorneys’ fees and “coupon settlements.” In a coupon settlement, the members of the class do not receive cash damages; instead, they receive a coupon that can be used as a credit or discount in a future transaction with the defendant. For example, in an antitrust action against Nintendo, purchasers of a video game system were given five dollar coupons good toward a game. Under the act, as before, the court has to scrutinize carefully the fairness of coupon settlements. The court also now must base the attorneys’ fees on the amount of coupons actually redeemed, not just issued. Typically, many class members receiving coupons will not redeem them; teenage video game users might just ignore or forget about the Nintendo coupon.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0010_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-4-div1-12"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0027" class="calibre1">当事人如何发现有关其案件的事实？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0027" class="calibre1">How Do the Parties Discover the Facts About Their Case?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">这是通过一个自然而然地被称为<em class="calibre8">“发现”的</em>过程来处理的。</p><p class="noindent">This is handled through a process called, naturally enough, <em class="calibre8">discovery</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在诉讼过程中，很容易就能找到当事人需要了解的一些信息。例如，罗宾逊夫妇知道事故发生前的驾驶速度以及受伤程度。另一方面，奥迪知道油箱的设计和制造方式。但他们都想获得对方掌握的信息——罗宾逊夫妇想要<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_121" class="calibre4"></a>想知道油箱的情况，奥迪想知道事故和伤亡情况。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It’s easy to find out some of what a party needs to know during litigation. The Robinsons, for example, know the speed at which they were driving before the accident and how extensive their injuries were. Audi, on the other hand, knows how the fuel tank was designed and built. But each of them wants information that the other has—the Robinsons want <a class="calibre4"></a>to know about the fuel tank, and Audi wants to know about the accident and the injuries.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在双方当事人事先不知道对方知道什么的情况下进行审判是可能的。那是传统的普通法体系，其中事实仅通过诉状得到最低限度的展开，并且双方在审判前没有其他机会了解对方知道什么。但现代民事诉讼程序采用更加开放的制度，其中每一方都有广泛的机会在诉讼的审前阶段发掘与诉讼相关的所有事实。为了获得对手所掌握的信息，或者即使对手可能在其他地方可以获得但最容易获得的信息，一方可以宣誓采访另一方，称为<em class="calibre8">证词</em>；提交书面问题，称为<em class="calibre8">质询</em>；要求提供文件或其他物证；要求另一方接受体检；并要求另一方承认与诉讼相关的事实的真实性。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It would be possible to proceed to trial without each party finding out in advance what the other knows. That was the traditional common law system, in which the facts were only minimally developed through the pleadings and the parties had no other opportunity before trial to find out what the other knew. But modern civil procedure uses a more open system in which each party has an extensive opportunity to unearth all of the facts relevant to the litigation during the pretrial stage of the litigation. To obtain information that is in the adversary’s possession, or that can be most easily obtained from the adversary even though it may be available elsewhere, a party can interview the other party under oath, called a <em class="calibre8">deposition</em>; submit written questions, called <em class="calibre8">interrogatories</em>; demand that documents or other physical evidence be produced; require the other party to submit to a physical examination; and ask the other party to admit the truth of facts relevant to the litigation.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>证词是对另一方或其他知情人士进行的口头质询。证词类似于庭审中对证人的质询，由律师进行，逐字记录，证人宣誓；主要区别在于，证词质询并非在法官面前进行，也没有交叉质询。相反，法庭书记员会要求证人宣誓并记录证词。通过记录证人证词，律师可以灵活地了解其所知信息；一个问题的答案可能会开启新的调查方向。如果证人在庭审中可能作不利于证人作证，证词可以确定证词，使律师能够提出相反的证据，或利用证词与庭审中后续证词之间的矛盾之处。这也使双方律师有机会评估证人在庭审中的表现——不仅要看证人的证言，还要看其说服力和可信度。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A deposition is an oral examination of the other party or someone else with knowledge of the case. A deposition is like the examination of a witness at trial in that it is conducted by an attorney, a verbatim record is made, and the witness is under oath; the key differences are that the examination is not conducted in front of a judge and there is no cross-examination. Instead, a court reporter swears in the witness and records the testimony. By taking someone’s deposition, an attorney can find out what that person knows in a flexible way; the answer to one question may open up a new line of inquiry. If the witness might testify in an adverse way at trial, the deposition pins down the testimony, allowing the attorney to develop contrary evidence or to use inconsistencies between the deposition testimony and subsequent testimony at trial. It also gives both attorneys a chance to assess how good the witness will be at trial—not only what she says, but how persuasive or credible she is.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>取证的缺点是费用较高。在典型的取证过程中，双方律师都会出席，费用会不断增加，法庭书记员也必须获得报酬。降低成本的一种方法是提交书面问题（质询），并要求当事人宣誓作答。律师只需准备并提交质询，无需出席取证；因此，质询可以便宜得多，尤其是因为标准格式的质询通常用于案件的常规处理。毫无疑问，奥迪会向罗宾逊夫妇提交每一起人身伤害案件中使用的标准质询，要求他们详细说明自己的伤情和治疗情况。质询还会要求对方承担查明回答所提问题所需事实的责任。缺点<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_122" class="calibre4"></a>然而，质询的一大缺点是缺乏灵活性，缺乏自发性。答案通常由律师精心设计，以便答辩方能够积极回应，但不会特别坦诚、含糊其辞，并且只提供绝对必要的信息。律师也不能在一个问题的答案之后再提出另一个问题；律师必须预测所有可能被问到的问题，并将其纳入最初的质询中。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The disadvantage of taking depositions is the expense. In a typical deposition, the attorneys for both sides will be present, running up their fees, and the court reporter must be paid, too. One way of reducing this cost is to submit written questions (interrogatories), to be answered under oath. All the attorney has to do is prepare and submit the interrogatories, not be present at a deposition; therefore, interrogatories can be much cheaper, especially because standard form interrogatories are often used for routine aspects of cases. No doubt Audi would submit to the Robinsons standard interrogatories used in every personal injury case, asking them to detail their injuries and medical treatment. Interrogatories also place on the adversary the responsibility of ascertaining the facts needed to respond to the questions posed. The disadvantage <a class="calibre4"></a>of interrogatories, though, is that they are inflexible and not spontaneous. The answers often are crafted by the attorney for the responding party to be responsive but not particularly forthcoming, cryptic, and narrowly drawn to give no more information than is absolutely necessary. Nor can an attorney follow up on the answer to one question by asking another; the attorney has to anticipate all the questions that might be asked and include them in the original set of interrogatories.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在取证或质询中，或在单独的请求中，一方可以要求另一方提供文件或其他证据。罗宾逊夫妇可以要求提供奥迪油箱的所有工程报告和测试结果，而奥迪可以要求提供罗宾逊夫妇的医疗记录。如果案件涉及当事人的身体或精神状况，一方可以请求法院要求其接受医疗检查。此外，一方必须披露其是否已聘请专家在庭审中作证，以及专家将就哪些内容作证。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In connection with depositions or interrogatories, or in a separate request, one party can demand that the other produce documents or other evidence. The Robinsons can ask for all engineering reports and test results on the Audi’s fuel tank, and Audi can ask for the Robinsons’ medical records. Where someone’s physical or mental condition is at issue in the case, one party can ask the court to require them to submit to a medical examination. And a party must disclose whether it has retained an expert to testify at trial and what the expert will testify about.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最后，如果一方认为某些事实无可争议，该方可以要求另一方承认这些事实属实，从而缩小审理范围。如果奥迪相信或有证据表明哈里·罗宾逊驾驶速度过快，其律师可能会要求罗宾逊夫妇承认这一点；如果他们知道事实属实，就不能否认他超速行驶，必须承认这一点。这可能无法结束整个案件——即使他驾驶速度过快，但这辆车仍然可能不具备抗撞性——但至少可以在庭审中消除一个问题。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Finally, where one party believes that some facts are undisputed, that party can request the other to admit that they are true, narrowing down the issues to be tried. If Audi believes or has evidence to suggest that Harry Robinson was driving too fast, its attorney might request that the Robinsons admit that; if they know it to be true, they cannot deny that he was speeding and must enter the admission. That might not conclude the whole case—even though he was going too fast, the car still might not have been crashworthy—but at least it removes one issue at trial.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>与突击审判制度相比，审前证据开示在实现公正高效程序以及弘扬实体法基本价值方面具有显著优势。简单来说，它聚焦于证人早期的回忆，并保存了审判时可能无法获取的信息。由于民事案件通常需要数年时间才能开庭审理，证人可能会忘记事件细节，甚至可能身亡，文件或其他证据也可能丢失或被毁。证据开示通常在审判前进行，此时证人的回忆更为鲜活，证据更有可能仍然有效。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Pretrial discovery has significant advantages over a system of trial by surprise in achieving a fair and efficient process and in promoting the values of the underlying substantive law. Simply at a practical level, it focuses the recollection of witnesses at an early stage and preserves information that otherwise might not be available at the time of trial. Because it typically takes years for a civil case to come to trial, witnesses may forget details about events or may even die, and documents or other evidence may be lost or destroyed. Discovery comes well before trial, when recollections are fresher and evidence is more likely to still be available.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>更重要的是，通过证据开示，双方可以了解彼此案件的概况，并明确哪些问题存在争议。这有助于双方准备庭审并协商和解，因为它缩小了案件涉及的范围，并让他们了解各自立场的优劣。通过从罗宾逊夫妇那里得知事故发生在高速追尾事故中，奥迪被告可能会得出结论，他们无需投入资源来证明车辆在低速正面碰撞中的耐撞性。奥迪还可以了解到事故的严重性。<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_123" class="calibre4"></a>罗宾逊的损失在于，哈里驾驶无虞，而且他可以在庭审中成为一名优秀的证人；这些因素或许能让奥迪相信，在庭审中败诉的可能性很大，从而促使他们与对方达成和解。如果双方都有足够的机会提前评估所有相关信息，庭审可能会更加公平。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>More important, through discovery the parties learn the contours of each others’ cases and clarify which issues actually are in controversy. This helps the parties to prepare for trial and negotiate a settlement because it narrows down what is involved in a case and gives them a sense of the strength and weakness of each party’s position. By finding out from the Robinsons that the accident occurred in a high-speed, rear-end crash, the Audi defendants may conclude that they do not have to invest resources in demonstrating the crashworthiness of the car in a low-speed, head-on collision. Audi also may learn how serious the <a class="calibre4"></a>Robinsons’ injuries are, that Harry was not driving carelessly, and that he would make a good witness at trial; those factors may convince Audi that there is a good chance of losing a large judgment at trial, and this might encourage them to settle the case. If they go to trial, the trial likely will be fairer if both parties have an adequate opportunity to evaluate in advance all of the relevant information.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最后，证据开示程序进一步提升了法律的实质性价值，因为它使得在没有充分证据开示的情况下提起诉讼或主张抗辩成为可能，并且允许当事人提供所有可能与相关法律规则的适用相关的证据。除非罗宾逊夫妇能够获得奥迪工程师的设计笔记、测试和研究报告，否则他们永远不会知道或能够证明他们的汽车油箱存在缺陷；而奥迪公司也可能永远不会知道罗宾逊夫妇是否因为在后备箱中携带额外的汽油而导致了火灾。（证据开示程序的这一功能的一个最佳例子发生在医疗事故案件中。当病人因手术而受到伤害时，除非她能够通过证据开示程序获得医疗记录并获取手术室在场医生和护士的证词，否则她永远不会知道该伤害是否由医生的疏忽造成。）只有当当事人在庭审中发现并出示所有与案件相关的证据时，相关法律规则才能得到正确适用。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Finally, discovery furthers the law’s substantive values by making it possible to bring actions or assert defenses that could not be done in the absence of full discovery and by allowing the parties to bring out all of the evidence that might relate to the application of the relevant rules of law. The Robinsons would never know or be able to prove that their car’s gas tank was defective unless they had access to the design notes, tests, and studies of Audi’s engineers, and Audi might never know if the Robinsons contributed to the fire by carrying extra gas in cans in the trunk. (One of the best examples of this function of discovery occurs in medical malpractice cases. When a patient suffers harm as a result of an operation, she would never know if the harm was caused by the doctor’s negligence unless, through discovery, she could obtain the medical records and take the testimony of the doctors and nurses present in the operating room.) Only when the parties discover and present at trial all of the evidence that bears on the case can the relevant rules of law be correctly applied.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这些证据开示的功能表明，证据开示的范围——当事人可以开示哪些信息以及可以使用哪些工具来获取这些信息——应该非常广泛，而且在大多数法院系统中确实如此。然而，证据开示的范围受到一些抵消因素的限制，其中最重要的是它可能带来的时间负担、不便和费用。奥迪可以用关于事故各个方面、哈利的驾驶记录、他们的病史等等的详细质询来压垮罗宾逊夫妇，并迫使他们每人出庭进行为期数天的取证和体检。为了遵守规定，他们必须咨询律师，查阅他们的记录，请假，并前往奥迪律师的办公室接受取证。另一方面，罗宾逊夫妇可以对奥迪的记录进行“钓鱼式调查”。在最初对汽车问题几乎一无所知的情况下，他们可以要求查阅所有设计研究报告、测试、工程报告、投诉和其他可能相关的文件，而奥迪将被要求查阅其文件以做出全面回应。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These functions of discovery suggest that the scope of discovery—what information parties can discover and what tools they can use to obtain it—should be very broad, and in most court systems it is. The scope of discovery is limited by countervailing factors, however, the most important of which is the burden it can impose in time, inconvenience, and expense. Audi could overwhelm the Robinsons with detailed interrogatories about every aspect of the accident, Harry’s driving record, their medical history, and so on and could compel each of them to appear for several days of depositions and medical examinations. To comply, they would have to consult their attorney, search their records, take time off from work, and go to the office of Audi’s attorney to be deposed. The Robinsons, on the other hand, could conduct a fishing expedition in Audi’s records. With little initial idea of what was wrong with the car, they could ask for all design studies, tests, engineering reports, complaints, and other documents potentially relevant, and Audi would be required to search its files to respond fully.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在证据开示程序中过度使用确实存在风险，因为证据开示程序是由双方律师主导的对抗性程序的一部分。在大多数情况下，当事人无需法院许可即可提交质询、进行取证并请求提供文件。<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_124" class="calibre4"></a>然而，由于事情可能会失控，法院对这一过程施加了限制和检查。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Overdoing it in discovery is a real risk because discovery is part of an adversarial process directed by the attorneys for each side. For the most part, the parties can submit interrogatories, take depositions, and request the production of documents without the court’s permission. <a class="calibre4"></a>Because things can get out of hand, though, courts have imposed limits and checks on the process.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>首先，某些证据开示手段的使用受到法院规则的限制。例如，医疗检查侵犯了个人隐私，因此只有在当事人的医疗状况成为重大争议问题时才可以要求进行医疗检查。如果凯·罗宾逊的受伤程度存在争议，她可以被要求接受检查，但事故目击者不能被强迫接受眼科检查。其他规则还限制了未经法院特别许可，可以提交质询的数量或可以获取证词的数量。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>First, the use of some discovery devices is limited by court rules. Medical examinations, for example, intrude on a person’s privacy, so they can be required only when someone’s medical condition is a major issue in controversy. If the extent of Kay Robinson’s injuries are disputed, she can be required to submit to an examination, but an eyewitness to the accident could not be compelled to submit to an eye examination. Other rules limit the number of interrogatories that can be submitted or the number of depositions that can be taken without special permission from the court.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>其次（矛盾的是），一些联邦法院已经开放了证据开示程序。《联邦民事诉讼规则》现在要求当事人自动披露其掌握的大部分与诉讼相关的信息，包括掌握信息的人员姓名及其所知的问题、相关文件或财产的副本或描述、索赔金额和支持索赔的证据，以及任何涵盖潜在损害的保险单。要求当事人尽早披露其所知信息，旨在减少证据开示程序中存在的权宜之计和负担。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Second (and paradoxically), some courts under the lead of the federal system have opened up the discovery process. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure now require parties to automatically disclose much of the information they have that is relevant to the litigation, including the names of persons having information and the issues that they know about, a copy or description of relevant documents or property, the amount claimed for damages and the evidence supporting the claim, and any insurance policies covering the potential damages. Requiring the parties to tell what they know at an early stage is designed to reduce the gamesmanship and burden associated with the discovery process.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最后，尽管大部分证据开示程序是由律师自行推动的，但审判法官有权监督。某些手段，例如超过规定数量的证人证言，只有在法官许可的情况下才能使用。如果一方反对另一方的证据开示策略——例如证人证言中提出问题的性质、提出的出具请求的数量或所要求信息的专有性——该方可以向法官上诉，要求下达限制证据开示的命令。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Finally, even though most of the discovery process is driven by the attorneys themselves, the trial judge has the power to supervise it. Some devices, such as depositions above a stated number, may be used only with the judge’s permission. And if one side objects to the other’s discovery tactics—such as the nature of the questions asked in a deposition, the amount of requests for production made, or the proprietary nature of the information requested—that side can appeal to the judge for an order limiting the discovery.</p>

<p class="noindent">电影和电视剧通常聚焦于诉讼程序中的审判环节。事实上，在审判的案件中，审判只占了相对较少的比例，而且往往是在漫长程序的最后才会出现。证据开示占据了审前程序的很大一部分，但案件开庭前的这段时间也充满了法律和事实调查、当事人之间的谈判、就程序性或实质性问题向法院提出的动议，以及其他推动案件进展的程序。</p><p class="noindent">Movies and television usually focus on the trial part of the litigation process. In fact, trials, in the relatively small proportion of cases in which they occur at all, come only at the end of a long process. Discovery takes up a large portion of the pretrial process, but the period before a case comes to trial is also filled with legal and factual research, negotiations between the parties, motions to the court on procedural or substantive issues, and other proceedings to move the case along.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>有时，正如我们所见，案件可以在审判前通过驳回判决而终止——法院作出裁决，认为即使指控的事实属实，原告也没有法律认可的诉讼理由。<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_125" class="calibre4"></a>仅根据诉状即可作出该决定。在各方通过证据开示程序开始收集有关案件的证据后，相关事件称为<em class="calibre8">简易判决</em>。（“简易”在此意为无需完整审判。）当法院裁定没有真正存在争议的事实（通常称为<em class="calibre8">没有实质性事实问题</em>），并且无争议的事实清楚表明一方在法律上应该获胜时，一方可获得简易判决。法院可以根据简易判决对整个案件进行裁决，彻底结案，或仅结案部分，减少要审理的问题或将某些当事方退出案件。通过这种方式，法院可以剔除那些在审判中无法胜诉的案件和问题，从而消除大量费用、不便和延误；或者，在部分简易判决的情况下，法院可以缩小问题范围，从而简化审判。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sometimes, as we have seen, a case can be terminated before trial by a dismissal—a decision by the court that even if the facts alleged are true, the plaintiff does not have a legally recognized cause of action. <a class="calibre4"></a>That decision can be made on the pleadings alone. After the parties have begun to amass evidence about the case through the discovery process, a related event is known as <em class="calibre8">summary judgment</em>. (“Summary” in this sense means without a full trial.) One party can get summary judgment when the court determines that no facts are really in controversy (commonly referred to as <em class="calibre8">no genuine issues of material fact</em>), and when the undisputed facts indicate clearly that one party should win as a matter of law. The court can decide the whole case on summary judgment, ending the case altogether, or only part of it, reducing the issues to be tried or taking some party out of the case. In this way, the court can weed out cases and issues that would be unsuccessful at trial, eliminating much expense, inconvenience, and delay; or, in the case of partial summary judgment, it can narrow the issues and thereby simplify the trial.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在审判前阶段，与对抗制程序的其他阶段一样，当事人在引导诉讼方面发挥着主导作用。然而，随着司法系统中案件复杂程度的增加、证据开示的扩大以及诉讼数量的激增，法官为了提高效率，不得不更加积极地管理诉讼。审前程序的司法管理有多种形式。法院规则和惯例通常规定，律师必须参加一系列审前会议，这些会议旨在评估案件状态、决定初步事项并总体推进案件进展。在早期阶段，法官可能会召开一次证据开示会议，在会上，各方就案件证据开示的时间表和数量达成一致。临近审判时，许多法院要求律师、法官以及有时案件主要当事人之间举行审前会议。根据各司法辖区的规则和惯例以及法官的倾向，审前会议可能有助于最终为案件开庭做准备，鼓励当事人达成和解，或两者兼而有之。在会议上，律师将尝试就无争议的事实达成一致，缩小剩余问题的范围，提供他们计划传唤的证人名单，并就庭审时间表达成一致。如果双方无法达成一致，法官将对这些问题作出裁决，同时还将处理关于证据、证人和其他事项的未决动议。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>During the time before trial, as elsewhere throughout the adversary process, the parties play the dominant role in directing the litigation. But the increasing presence in the judicial system of more complex cases, expanded discovery, and the sheer bulk of litigation has caused judges to take a more active role in managing the litigation in the interest of promoting efficiency. Judicial management of the pretrial process takes several forms. Court rules and practices frequently specify that the attorneys must participate in a series of pretrial conferences designed to assess the status of the case, decide preliminary matters, and generally move the case along. At an early stage the judge might hold a discovery conference in which everyone agrees on a plan for the schedule and amount of discovery to be taken in the case. Closer to trial, many courts require a pretrial conference between the attorneys, the judges, and occasionally the principals in the case. Depending on the rules and customs of the jurisdiction and the proclivities of the judge, the pretrial conference may serve to finally prepare the case for trial, to encourage the parties to settle, or both. At the conference the attorneys will try to stipulate facts that are not in dispute, narrow down the issues remaining, present lists of the witnesses they intend to call, and agree on a schedule for the trial. If they cannot agree, the judge will decide those issues, and the judge also will resolve pending motions on evidence, witnesses, and other matters.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>审前程序的主要功能之一是鼓励当事人在开庭前达成和解。尤其是在繁忙的法院系统中，法官面临着尽可能多结案的巨大压力，法官可能会利用审前会议来劝说、劝诱和施压律师在开庭前达成和解。许多司法管辖区都设立了强制性的替代性争议解决机制。开庭前，所有案件或金额低于一定数额的案件都会被提交调解、仲裁或……<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_126" class="calibre4"></a>小型审判。这些程序通常由一名调解员、一组律师、一名地方法官或一名法官主持。例如，在仲裁中，律师提交案件的简要版本，仲裁员就谁应承担责任以及承担多少责任作出裁决。仲裁不具有约束力，因此一方仍然可以选择进行庭审，但这一程序在防止案件陷入僵局方面具有显著作用。仲裁使当事人及其律师能够独立评估其案件的优势和劣势。例如，罗宾逊一家可能认为他们的案子无懈可击，价值数百万美元，但如果仲裁员判决被告胜诉，或者只判罗宾逊一家赔偿金额较小，这可能会让他们意识到现实，并打消他们继续庭审的念头。即使双方都不接受仲裁裁决，它也可能为和解谈判提供参考。一鸟在手胜过双鸟在林；双方可能宁愿接受一个不太令人满意的仲裁员的裁决，也不愿等待数年去承担不确定的审判风险。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A major function of the pretrial process is to encourage the parties to settle the case before it gets to trial. Especially in busy court systems, where judges are under considerable pressure to conclude as many cases as possible, the judge may use the pretrial conference as an occasion to persuade, cajole, and pressure the attorneys to settle the case before trial. Many jurisdictions have instituted mandatory programs of alternative dispute resolution. Before going to trial, either all cases or cases below a certain dollar amount are referred for mediation, arbitration, or a <a class="calibre4"></a>mini-trial. These proceedings usually take place before a single mediator, a panel of attorneys, a magistrate, or a judge. In arbitration, for example, the attorneys present abbreviated versions of their cases and the arbitrators render a decision on who is liable and in what amount. The arbitration is not binding, and therefore a party can still opt to proceed to trial, but the process has a significant effect in keeping cases from going that far. The arbitration gives the parties and their lawyers an independent assessment of the strength and weaknesses of their cases. The Robinsons may think they have an airtight case worth millions, for example, but if the arbitrators find for the defendants, or give the Robinsons only a small award, it may serve as a reality check and deter them from proceeding to trial. Even if both parties don’t accept the arbitration award, it may provide a reference point for settlement negotiations. And a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush; the parties may prefer to take a somewhat unsatisfactory arbitrator’s decision rather than wait what may be years to take the uncertain risk of a trial.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>无论有没有司法干预或正式的替代性争议解决机制，大多数走到这一步的案件（根据司法管辖区和案件性质，大约一半到四分之三）都会在开庭前达成和解。在小额案件中，潜在的诉讼成本高于将案件追究到底的可能收益。如果罗宾逊一家只是发生了轻微碰撞，对方司机（或其保险公司）宁愿支付小额索赔，也不愿支付律师费来审理案件。在大额案件中，案件结果的不确定性、巨额损失的风险以及开庭审理的拖延和费用，往往更倾向于选择和解，而不是冒险开庭。然而，并非所有案件都会达成和解。律师们可能对案件持有截然不同的观点，以至于无法就和解金额达成一致。或者他们可能有其他目的；一方可能希望确立法律原则，或者希望树立其坚持诉讼到底的声誉；保险公司可能会积极为小额案件辩护，以推迟投保人将来提起索赔。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With or without judicial intervention or formal alternative dispute resolution, most cases that have made it this far—from half to three-quarters, depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the case—settle before trial. In small cases the potential litigation costs are greater than the likely return from pursuing the case to the end. If the Robinsons were involved in just a fender bender, the other driver (or his insurance company) would rather pay a small claim than pay their lawyers to try the case. In larger cases, the uncertainty about how the case might come out, the risk of losing big, and the delay and expense of going to trial often favor taking a settlement rather than taking a chance at trial. Not all cases settle, though. The lawyers may hold such differing views of the case that they can’t agree on a settlement value. Or they may have other objectives in mind; one party may want to establish a legal principle or may want to build its reputation for litigating to the bitter end; an insurance company may aggressively defend small cases to defer policyholders from bringing future claims.</p>

<p class="noindent">电视、电影和新闻报道理所当然地将审判作为诉讼过程中最激动人心、最重要的环节。尽管只有极少数民事案件最终进入审判程序，但审判却是诉讼的核心，对整个诉讼体系都至关重要。尽管现代审判的起源可以追溯到数个世纪前，甚至可追溯到英国国王坐庭主持正义的时代，但它仍然是美国独有的制度。<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_127" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="noindent">Television, movies, and news reports justifiably focus on trials as the most exciting and important part of the litigation process. Even though only a tiny fraction of civil cases ever go to trial, the trial is the central event in litigation, looming over the rest of the system. And even though its antecedents date back many centuries, to the time of the English king sitting in court dispensing justice, the modern trial is a unique American institution.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>两个关键特征掌控着审判过程。首先，审判是对抗制最有力的体现；当事人的律师左右着审判，双方都试图以最有利于自身立场的方式进行。其次，在大多数民事案件中，当事人可以选择将案件交由陪审团审理；陪审团的重要性对民事诉讼程序乃至实体法都至关重要。这两个特征都存在争议。审判本应是探寻真相的过程，而面对缺乏经验的陪审团进行对抗性辩论或许并非探寻真相的最佳途径。在思考审判过程中发生的事情时，一个重要的问题是，我们如何在探寻真相、追求效率与对抗制和陪审团的历史功能之间取得平衡。（本节将讨论作为对抗制程序的审判。关于陪审团的讨论将在后面的部分进行。）</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Two key features control the trial process. First, the trial is the most intense manifestation of the adversary system; the lawyers for the parties shape the trial, and each side tries to do so in the way most favorable to its position. Second, in most civil cases the parties can choose to have the case tried before a jury; the importance of the jury is crucial for civil procedure and even substantive law. Both of these features are controversial. A trial is supposed to be a search for truth, and an adversary battle before an untutored jury may not be the best way to find the truth. In thinking about what goes on at trial, an important issue is how we balance the search for truth and the desire for efficiency with the historic functions of the adversary system and the jury. (The trial as an adversary proceeding is discussed in this section. The discussion of the jury follows in a later section.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>任何审判都不是典型的。例如，滑倒事故引起的侵权索赔或银行贷款合同案的审判可能只需要几名证人，半天就能结束。像罗宾逊案或证券欺诈案这样更复杂的产品责任纠纷，可能需要包括专家在内的多名证人，并且持续数周。一些极其复杂的案件，例如反垄断索赔或集体诉讼，其审判可能会持续数月。然而，每场审判都有相同的基本结构，这种结构是由其对抗性质决定的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>No trial is typical. The trial of a tort claim arising out of a slip-and-fall case or a contract case about a bank loan may involve only a few witnesses and be over in half a day. A more complex products liability dispute like the Robinsons’ or a securities fraud case might require many witnesses, including experts, and last several weeks. The trial of some extremely complex matters like an antitrust claim or a class action may go on for months. Nevertheless, every trial has the same basic structure, a structure determined by its adversary nature.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>想象一下罗宾逊夫妇案的审判结果。如果当事人选择由陪审团审理，第一步就是选择陪审团。陪审员入座后，法官向他们介绍了接下来的流程，罗宾逊夫妇的律师将进行开场陈述，从他的角度解释案件：当事人是谁，事故是如何发生的，罗宾逊夫妇受伤的严重程度，以及奥迪被告为何要承担法律责任。然后，被告律师将轮流陈述他们对案件的看法。在涉及多方当事人的案件中，一方的所有当事人可能由一名律师代理，就像罗宾逊夫妇那样，或者每一方当事人可能都有自己的律师。如果Seaway Volkswagen认为其法律立场可能与奥迪不同，它可能需要自己的律师；如果发生这种情况，每位律师都将有机会进行开场陈述。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Consider what might have happened at the Robinsons’ trial. If the parties choose to have their case tried by a jury, the first step is to select the jury. Once the jurors are seated and the judge has given them an introduction to what will happen, the Robinsons’ attorney makes an opening statement, explaining the case as he sees it: who the parties are, how the accident happened, how seriously the Robinsons have been injured, and why the Audi defendants are legally responsible. Then the defendants’ lawyers will have their turn to lay out their view of the case. In a case with multiple parties, all parties on one side might be represented by one lawyer, as the Robinsons were, or each party on a side might have its own lawyer. If Seaway Volkswagen believes that its legal position may be different from that of Audi, it may want its own lawyer; if that happens, each lawyer will have an opportunity to open.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>开庭陈述后，原告开始提供证据，支持其对案件的观点。（通常情况下，我们会提及原告和被告，但实际上这一切都是由原告的律师完成的。）原告总是先发言，因为原告承担<em class="calibre8">举证责任</em>。举证责任体现了一项基本法律原则：在我们的制度下，除非有充分理由追究某人的责任，否则任何人都无需承担任何责任。假设在双方陈述后，<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_128" class="calibre4"></a>证据时，陪审团会判定证据在各个方向上都具有同等的说服力；油箱有缺陷的可能性与油箱没有缺陷的可能性相同。谁赢了？被告赢了，因为原告没有满足举证责任。原告必须通过<em class="calibre8">优势证据</em>来证明其案件，以便法官或陪审团相信原告的案件版本更有可能是真实的。要追究某人的法律责任，仅仅他们可能违反了法治是不够的；还必须是他们很可能——更有可能——违反了法治。（优势证据标准远低于刑事案件中使用的证明标准；因为国家施加刑事处​​罚是更为严重的事，所以刑事案件需要更高的排除合理怀疑的举证责任。参见<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.n0119" href="#text/part0015_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-9" class="calibre4">第 9 章</a>。）</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After the opening statements the plaintiffs begin presenting evidence that supports their view of the case. (It is customary to talk about the plaintiff and the defendant, but all of this is really done by their lawyers.) The plaintiff always goes first because the plaintiff bears the <em class="calibre8">burden of proof</em>. The burden of proof reflects a basic principle of law: Under our system, no one is liable for anything unless there is a good reason to hold that person liable. Suppose that after the parties present their <a class="calibre4"></a>evidence, the jury determines that the evidence is equally persuasive in each direction; it is just as likely that the gas tank was defective as it is that the tank was not defective. Who wins? The defendant wins because the plaintiff has not met its burden of proof. The plaintiff must prove its case by a <em class="calibre8">preponderance of the evidence</em>, so that the judge or jury is persuaded that it is more likely than not that the plaintiff’s version of the case is true. To impose legal liability on someone, it is not enough that they might have violated a rule of law; it must be probable—more likely than not—that they did so. (The preponderance of the evidence standard is much lower than the standard of proof used in criminal cases; because the imposition of a criminal penalty by the state is a more serious matter, criminal cases require the higher burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. See <a href="#text/part0015_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-9" class="calibre4">Chapter 9</a>.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>原告出示证据后，轮到被告出庭。与原告律师一样，辩护律师会传唤并讯问证人，以支持其辩护方的观点。被告陈述完毕后，原告可以出示反驳证人，以回应辩方提出的问题。当所有证人都陈述完毕后，双方都会向陪审团进行总结陈述，总结各自的案情。然后，法官会向陪审团说明法律条文，陪审团会私下商议并作出裁决。当然，在法官陪审团审判（法官在没有陪审团的情况下进行的审判）中，法官不需要法律条文说明，她可能需要一些时间，而不是立即作出裁决。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After the plaintiff presents its evidence, it is the defendant’s turn. Like the plaintiff’s lawyer, the defense lawyer calls and examines witnesses to support its side of the case. When the defendant has finished, the plaintiff may have a chance to present rebuttal witnesses, addressing issues raised by the defense. When everyone has finished, each side makes a closing statement to the jury, summing up its case. Then the judge instructs the jury on the law, and the jury deliberates in private and returns its verdict. In a bench trial (a trial to the judge without a jury), of course, the judge does not need instructions on the law, and she may take some time instead of rendering her decision immediately.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>审判的结构相对简单，但如上所述，相互冲突的价值观主导着审判过程。试想一下，审判的对抗性可能会与寻求真相和有效推进案件的愿望相冲突。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The structure of the trial is relatively simple, but, as noted, conflicting values govern the trial process. Consider how the adversary nature of the trial may conflict with the search for truth and the desire to efficiently move things along.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在对抗制审判中，双方律师所做的不仅仅是提供有利于其委托人的证据。每位律师——至少是一位优秀的律师——都试图利用整个庭审过程，从开庭陈述到证人讯问再到总结陈述，连贯地阐述其委托人基于事实和法律的诉求的正当性。罗宾逊一家的律师描绘了一幅画面：一个幸福的家庭搬进了新家，他们的生活却因为奥迪的工程师为了节省汽车生产成本的几美元而忽视了油箱设计的明显危险而支离破碎；正义要求肇事者赔偿受害者，尽管金钱赔偿对于受害者遭受的身心痛苦来说微不足道。奥迪的律师承认这起事故的悲剧性质（尽管他们可能将其后果描述得远不如罗宾逊一家所描述的严重），但他描述了工程师们如何尽最大努力确保汽车安全；让奥迪在无法做到的情况下付出代价。<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_129" class="calibre4"></a>更好的办法就是寻找一个有雄厚财力的人来弥补罗宾逊一家的损失。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In an adversary trial, the lawyers for each side do more than simply present evidence favorable to their client. Each lawyer—at least a good lawyer—tries to use the whole trial, from the opening statement through the examination of witnesses to the summation, to tell a coherent story about the justice of her client’s claim on the facts and on the law. The Robinsons’ lawyer paints a picture of a happy family moving to their new home whose life was shattered because Audi’s engineers ignored the obvious danger of the gas tank design to save a few dollars in the production cost of the car; justice demands that the wrongdoers compensate their victims, meager though monetary compensation would be for the physical and emotional pain they have suffered. Audi’s lawyer recognizes the tragic nature of the accident (though they may describe its consequences as much less severe than the Robinsons are making it out to be) but portrays how the engineers did the best that anyone could in making the car safe; making Audi pay when it could not have done <a class="calibre4"></a>anything better would just be looking for a deep pocket to pay for the Robinsons’ loss.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>由于律师们在讲述这两个关于案情和后续走向的矛盾故事时是对手，因此他们在庭审中所做的一切都是为了强化自己的故事，并抹黑对手的故事。规范律师行为的道德准则禁止律师撒谎或故意指示证人作伪证，但同样的准则也要求律师积极维护客户的立场。律师会以最有利的方式呈现所有证据，并试图质疑对手的证据。律师还可能采取其他形式的策略，例如穿着合适的服装给陪审团留下好印象，确保客户和证人表现得可怜、真诚、诚实，或扮演他们在故事中被赋予的其他角色，不时打断对手的提问以扰乱他的节奏，以及在法律允许的范围内做任何事来获取优势。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Because the lawyers are adversaries in telling these two inconsistent stories of what happened and what should follow from it, everything that each of them does at trial is directed toward enhancing his own story and discrediting the opponent’s story. The ethical rules that govern attorneys’ conduct prohibit a lawyer from lying or knowingly instructing a witness to testify falsely, but the same rules require that the attorney be a zealous advocate for the client’s position. The lawyer will present all of her evidence in the most favorable light, and she will attempt to cast doubt on her opponent’s evidence. The attorney may also engage in other forms of gamesmanship, such as wearing the right clothes to make a favorable impression on the jury, making sure her clients and witnesses act pathetic, sincere, honest, or whatever other role they have been assigned in the story, interrupting her adversary’s questioning from time to time just to disrupt his rhythm, and generally doing anything within the bounds of the law to seek an advantage.</p>

The witness is sworn to tell the truth, the lawyer who called the witness asks a series of questions that guide the witness through her testimony, and the other party’s lawyer can cross-examine, or ask other questions to test the witness’s story. If one party’s lawyer objects to a question that has been asked, she can ask the judge to prevent the witness from answering, or exclude the answer if it already has been given. Witnesses ordinarily testify from their own knowledge of the facts of the case, but <em class="calibre8">expert witnesses</em> go beyond their own knowledge and give opinions on the ultimate issues in the case—whether there was a reasonable alternative design for the Audi’s gas tank, for example. Because of their unusual role, expert witnesses have to be qualified and screened by the trial judge.

<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>电视上的证据呈现和现实法庭上的证据呈现，最大的区别在于戏剧性程度。由于证据开示的便利性、大多数案件的平凡性以及证据法的要求，证人很少会突然透露出“确凿证据”，或者失声痛哭，或者承认自己犯了<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_130" class="calibre4"></a>犯罪。大多数证人讯问都是有条不紊地、一步一步地复述详细事实。许多在电视或现场观看真实庭审的人很快就会感到厌倦，因为律师会用看似无休止的一系列问题来确定案件的所有细节。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The major difference between the presentation of evidence on television and in real courtrooms is the level of drama. Because of the availability of discovery, the mundane nature of most cases, and the requirements of the law of evidence, seldom does a witness suddenly reveal a “smoking gun” piece of crucial evidence, break down in tears, or confess to a <a class="calibre4"></a>crime. Most witness examinations are methodical, step-by-step recitations of detailed facts. Many people who watch real trials on television or in person quickly become bored, as the attorneys use a seemingly endless series of questions to establish all of the details of a case.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>除了证人证词外，庭审中的证据呈现可能包括文件和物证，例如罗宾逊家油箱的残骸。有时，律师或证人，尤其是专家证人，会使用图表、图纸、模型，甚至电脑动画和视频来使其证词更加生动，力求使其证词更加清晰、更具说服力，并保持陪审团的兴趣。当事人也可能同意某些证据是无可争议的，并对其进行约定，以便陪审团可以对其进行概括，而不必通过详细的证人证词来呈现。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In addition to witness testimony, the presentation of evidence at trial may include the presentation of documents and physical evidence, such as what is left of the Robinsons’ gas tank. Sometimes the attorneys or witnesses, particularly expert witnesses, will enliven their testimony with charts, drawings, models, or even computer animation and videos in an attempt to clarify their testimony, be more persuasive, and maintain the jury’s interest. The parties also may agree that some evidence is undisputed and stipulate to it, so it can be summarized for the jury instead of having to be presented by detailed witness testimony.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>证据法涉及一种平衡行为。法院需要允许当事人自行论证，纳入所有可能影响案件结果及判决的证据。但法院也希望高效运作，专注于真正重要的事情，有时它希望服务于除简单寻求真相之外的其他价值。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The law of evidence involves a balancing act. The court needs to allow the parties to develop their own cases, bringing in all of the evidence that might influence the judgment about what happened and how the case should come out. But the court also wants to operate efficiently, focusing on what is really important, and sometimes it wants to serve values other than simple truth-seeking.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>由于法院不愿将时间浪费在与现行法律规则下案件判决无关的事项上，证据法的基本主张是，只有有助于确立案件所涉及的法律主张的证据才会被考虑。这是最常见的反对引入证据的理由：当一位律师声称某事与案件无关时<em class="calibre8">。</em>如果罗宾逊夫妇试图让一位专家作证说，用喷灯照射奥迪的油箱就会爆炸，法官就会排除该证据。即使该证据涉及油箱的状况，也无助于确定油箱是否存在缺陷；任何油箱如果被点燃都会爆炸，但本案的问题是油箱在高速公路事故中是否过于危险。当然，奥迪的律师必须对该证据提出异议，法官才能将其排除；由于审判本质上是一个对抗性程序，法官只会根据律师提出的证据问题作出裁决。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Because the court does not want to waste its time on matters that don’t have anything to do with the decision of the case at hand under the prevailing legal rules, the basic proposition of evidence law is that only evidence that is helpful in establishing a legal proposition involved in the case may be considered. This is the basis for the most common objection to the introduction of evidence: when one attorney claims that something is <em class="calibre8">irrelevant</em>. If the Robinsons try to have an expert testify that an Audi gas tank will explode if you put a blowtorch to it, the judge will exclude the evidence. Even though that evidence addresses the condition of a gas tank, it does not help very much in determining whether the gas tank was defective; any gas tank will explode if you set fire to it, but the issue in the case is whether the gas tank was too dangerous in a highway crash. Of course, Audi’s lawyer must object to the evidence for the judge to exclude it; because the trial is essentially an adversary process, the judge only rules on evidentiary issues raised by the lawyers.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>类似的原则也促成了另一项许多人都听说过的证据法——<em class="calibre8">传闻证据</em>的不可采性。传闻证据是指二手证词，或为证明陈述内容真实性而提供的庭外陈述。如果罗宾逊夫妇能找到一位前奥迪工程师作证说，他曾警告过公司油箱不安全，那么这将成为具有证明力、可采纳的证据。但他们不能找其他人来作证说，她曾在公交车上坐在工程师后面，听到他说他……<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_131" class="calibre4"></a>警告过公司；这将是不可接受的传闻。她的证词不如工程师的证词可靠，部分原因是奥迪的律师没有有效的手段对她进行交叉质询。如果工程师出庭作证，奥迪的律师可以询问他告诉了公司里的谁以及他具体说了什么，以证明该警告并非发给任何可以采取行动的人，或者警告内容不明确。但偷听到工程师谈话的证人无法证明这些。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A similar principle motivates the other bit of evidence law many people have heard about—the inadmissibility of <em class="calibre8">hearsay</em>. Hearsay evidence is second-hand testimony, or the introduction of an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the content of the statement. If the Robinsons can find a former Audi engineer to testify that he warned the company that the gas tank was unsafe, that would be probative, admissible evidence. But they can’t bring in someone else to testify that she had sat behind the engineer on a bus and she heard him say that he had <a class="calibre4"></a>warned the company; that would be inadmissible hearsay. Her testimony is not as reliable as the engineer’s, in part because Audi’s lawyer would have no effective means of cross-examining her. If the engineer was on the witness stand, Audi’s lawyer could ask who he told in the company and what exactly he said, in order to prove that the warning was not given to anyone who could do anything about it or that it was unclear, but the witness who overheard the engineer cannot testify to any of that.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，在两种情况下，证据法会故意排除相关的、可能有用的证据。第一种情况涉及的证据在裁定案件时可能弊大于利。一个例子是<em class="calibre8">品格证据</em>，它被广泛定义为任何显示一个人一般倾向于以某种方式行事的证据。假设奥迪汽车除了 100 LS 的油箱之外，其他一些部件的设计也很糟糕。罗宾逊夫妇当然想引入这些其他缺陷的证据，以表明奥迪是一个马虎的制造商，而这种行为模式引发了这样的推论：这款车的油箱设计也很差。但陪审团不会被允许听取这一证据，因为他们认为奥迪在此犯了错误的风险超过了从其过去的行为中得出的推论的价值。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In two circumstances, however, the law of evidence deliberately excludes relevant, potentially useful evidence. The first instance concerns evidence that may be more harmful than helpful in deciding the case. An example is <em class="calibre8">character evidence</em>, which is defined broadly as any evidence showing a person’s general tendency to act in a certain way. Suppose some parts of Audi’s cars other than the gas tank on the 100 LS are known to be poorly designed. The Robinsons certainly would like to introduce evidence of these other failures to suggest that Audi is a sloppy manufacturer and that this pattern of conduct raises the inference that they designed the gas tank on this car poorly, too. But the jury will not be allowed to hear this evidence because the danger that they will assume that Audi made a mistake here outweighs the value of the inference that can be drawn from its past conduct.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>排除证据的第二个依据是，证据的使用与证据法之外的某些法律政策相冲突。在这种情况下，我们显然会牺牲庭审中对真相的探求，而选择其他价值。例如，<em class="calibre8">特权信息</em>就被排除在外。奥迪可能得知罗宾逊太太告诉她的丈夫和律师，她是在假装受伤，但他们不能传唤她的丈夫或律师来证明这一说法。尽管这可以作为诈病的有力证据，但我们认为，与在诉讼过程中将所有事实全部公开相比，更重要的是，人们应该能够向配偶和律师吐露心声，而不必担心这些秘密会被公开。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The second basis for excluding evidence is when the use of the evidence conflicts with some legal policy outside of evidence law. Here we clearly sacrifice the search for truth at trial to some other value. For example, <em class="calibre8">privileged information</em> is excluded. Audi may learn that Mrs. Robinson told her husband and her lawyer that she was faking her injuries, but they cannot call the husband or lawyer to testify to that statement. Even though that would be persuasive evidence of malingering, we think it is more important that people should be able to confide in their spouse and their lawyer without fear that the confidences will be made public than it is to get out all the facts in the course of litigation.</p>

<p class="noindent">除了对抗性之外，陪审团作为裁决者的角色是审判的第二个关键特征。美国宪法第七修正案和大多数州宪法都保留了民事案件由陪审团审判的权利。如果双方同意，案件可以由法官在没有陪审团的情况下进行裁决（称为<em class="calibre8">法官审判</em>）。但在大多数情况下，如果任何一方希望进行陪审团审判，他或她都有权获得陪审团审判。</p><p class="noindent">In addition to its adversary nature, the second key feature of the trial is the role of the jury as the decision maker. The Seventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and most state constitutions preserve the right to a jury trial in civil cases. If both parties agree, a case may be decided by the judge without a jury (called a <em class="calibre8">bench trial</em>), but in most cases, if either party wants a jury trial, he or she is entitled to it.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>每个人都承认陪审团在诉讼程序中的核心地位，但它也是整个诉讼制度中最具争议的元素。对一些人来说，陪审团是民主程序的胜利，是一道<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_132" class="calibre4"></a>对一些人来说，审判是人民自由的保障，也是在审判中确定真相的有效手段；而对另一些人来说，审判是一种过时、低效的制度，只会给系统带来任意性、不确定性和拖延。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Everyone recognizes that the jury is central to the litigation process, but it is also the most controversial element of the entire litigation system. For some people it is a triumph of the democratic process, a bulwark <a class="calibre4"></a>of the people’s liberty, and an effective device for determining the truth at trial; for others, it is an antiquated, inefficient institution that only introduces arbitrariness, uncertainty, and delay into the system.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>陪审团的独特之处在于它是由业余人员组成的。我们并非委托训练有素的专业法官来裁决罗宾逊案，而是将这一责任委托给一群对法律知之甚少、除了在法庭上听到的内容之外对案件事实一无所知的人。这群人必须仔细审查相互矛盾的证据，以判断案件的真相，理解法官对法律的解释（其中往往涉及一些让法学院学生感到困惑、并使法官产生分歧的微妙概念），并将事实与法律结合起来，得出既公正又符合法律规定的结果——所有这一切都需要一致或接近一致的同意。（在许多司法管辖区，传统的由十二名成员组成的陪审团必须达成一致裁决的要求已经降低，取而代之的是规模较小的陪审团（通常为六名成员），以及非一致裁决——通常需要三分之二或四分之三的绝对多数。）</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The unique attribute of the jury is that it is composed of amateurs. Rather than have a highly trained, professional judge decide the Robinsons’ case, we entrust that responsibility to a group of people who know little about the law and nothing about the facts of the case other than what they hear in the courtroom. This group must sift through the conflicting evidence to decide what really happened, understand the judge’s explanation of the law (which often involves subtle concepts that baffle law students and divide judges), and put the facts and the law together to reach a result that is both just and in accordance with the law—all by unanimous or near-unanimous agreement. (In many jurisdictions, the traditional requirement of a unanimous verdict by a twelve-member jury has been reduced in favor of smaller juries—often six—and nonunanimous verdicts—usually by a supermajority of two-thirds or three-fourths.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>陪审团的职责是听取证据，裁定案件进展，听取法官的法律指示，并将法律应用于事实。在此过程中，陪审员会运用自身的经验、信仰和价值观，使裁决过程在一定程度上成为社区情感的表达，而不仅仅是机械的事实调查过程。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The jury’s job is to hear the evidence, decide what happened in the case, listen to the judge’s instructions on the law, and apply the law to the facts. In doing so, jurors bring to bear their own experiences, beliefs, and values, making the decision process to a degree an expression of community sentiment and not just a mechanical fact-finding process.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>为了履行这些职能，陪审团应当具有代表性和公正性。为了确保陪审团具有代表性，法院会根据登记选民、持照驾驶员以及其他旨在覆盖广大社区的来源，制定潜在陪审员名单。潜在陪审员将从名单中随机抽取，履行陪审义务。过去，陪审员通常被传唤出庭一周或更长时间；如今，许多法院系统采用“一日一审”制度，即陪审员只需在陪审团候审席位中出庭一天，或者，如果被选中，只需出庭一次。即便如此，许多人仍然认为陪审义务与其说是公民责任，不如说是麻烦，并试图逃避，要么声称有法定理由（通常是警察、医生等），要么以某些困难为由请求免除（例如，照顾年幼的孩子或生病的亲属），要么干脆缺席。当然，在后一种情况下，法庭可能会通过再次传唤陪审员甚至发出逮捕令来阻止这种行为。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To serve these functions, juries should be representative and impartial. To ensure that they are representative, the court constructs the list of potential jurors from the rolls of registered voters, licensed drivers, and other sources designed to draw in a large segment of the community. Potential jurors are randomly summoned from this list to appear for jury duty. In the past jurors were often summoned for a week or more; these days, many court systems use a “one day–one trial” system, under which a juror only has to appear in the jury pool for one day, or, if selected, serve on the jury for only one trial. Even at that, many people view jury service to be more of an inconvenience than a civic responsibility and try to avoid serving, either by claiming a statutory excuse (often given to police officers, physicians, or the like), by asking to be excused because of some hardship (caring for small children or a sick relative, for example), or simply by not showing up. In the latter circumstance, of course, the court may discourage that kind of behavior by summoning the juror again or even issuing an arrest warrant.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>传唤的潜在陪审员人数超过了原定审判的人数，因为许多陪审员在陪审团入席前就被筛选出来了。这一过程被称为<em class="calibre8">“voir dire”</em>（法语法律术语，意为“说出真相”），旨在确保陪审团的公正性。法官或<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_133" class="calibre4"></a>律师会集体或个别地向陪审员提出一系列问题，以找出哪些潜在陪审员可能拥有可能影响其判断的知识或关联。在罗宾逊案中，一位认识罗宾逊夫妇或曾担任汽车工程师的潜在陪审员可能会受到其中一位律师的质疑，但法官会以正当理由予以免除<em class="calibre8">，</em>因为存在一个显而易见的理由，表明该陪审员在裁决案件时可能存在不公正。通常情况下，每位律师还会拥有一些<em class="calibre8">无理拒绝权</em>，允许他们在无需说明理由的情况下将潜在陪审员排除在外。许多律师的民间传说都规范着无理拒绝权的行使——例如，女性陪审员可能会嫉妒有吸引力的女性当事人，或者小企业主在人身伤害案件中不会给予大额赔偿——最近，至少在非常重要的案件中，该领域已经被陪审团顾问、心理学家或其他所谓的专家所接管，他们研究陪审员的背景、肢体语言和预审中的反应，以建议律师在特定案件中谁会成为有利或不利的陪审员。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>More potential jurors are called than can be used on scheduled trials, because many are winnowed out before the jury is seated. This process is known as <em class="calibre8">voir dire</em> (the French legal term meaning “to speak the truth”), and it is designed to make sure that the jury is impartial. The judge or <a class="calibre4"></a>the attorneys ask the jurors a series of questions, collectively and individually, to ferret out which potential jurors might have knowledge or associations that might bias their judgment. In the Robinsons’ case, a potential juror who knew the Robinsons or worked as an automotive engineer might be challenged by one of the attorneys and excused by the judge for <em class="calibre8">cause</em>, since there was an obvious reason why they might not be impartial in deciding the case. Typically the attorneys also each have some <em class="calibre8">peremptory challenges</em> that allow them to remove potential jurors without giving a reason. Much attorney folklore governs the exercise of peremptory challenges—the idea that women jurors may be jealous of an attractive female party, or that small business owners don’t give large damage awards in personal injury cases, for example—and recently the field has been taken over, at least in very important cases, by jury consultants, psychologists, or other supposed experts who study jurors’ backgrounds, body language, and responses in voir dire to advise the attorneys on who would make a favorable or unfavorable juror in a particular case.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>陪审团听取证据并接受法官的法律指导后，退庭秘密讨论案件（即<em class="calibre8">商议</em>）。陪审团达成裁决后，将返回法庭作出裁决。与法官不同，陪审团不会给出裁决的理由，但有时法官会要求陪审团做出<em class="calibre8">特别裁决</em>，或回答一系列关于案件的问题。（例如，油箱是否有缺陷？罗宾逊夫妇的车是否超速行驶？）</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After the jury has heard the evidence and been instructed on the law by the judge, it retires to discuss the case (to <em class="calibre8">deliberate</em>) in secret. When the jury reaches a decision, it returns to the courtroom to render a verdict. Unlike a judge, a jury does not give reasons for its verdict, although sometimes the judge requires a <em class="calibre8">special verdict</em>, or responses to a series of questions about the case. (Was the gas tank defective? Was the Robinsons’ car traveling at an excessive speed?)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>关于陪审制度，最大的问题是它运作得如何。陪审团是一个有效的事实认定和法律适用机构，能够以建设性的方式将社区情感融入到诉讼程序中吗？还是说，它只是一种武断、低效、不合时宜的制度，常常做出错误的判决？由于民事陪审权的宪法地位，这个问题实际上无法从彻底废除陪审团的角度进行讨论，但它在决定法律赋予法官多大权力来控制陪审团方面发挥着作用。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The great question about the jury system is how well it works. Is the jury an effective fact-finding and law-applying institution that brings community sentiment to the process in a constructive way, or is it an arbitrary, inefficient anachronism that too often makes bad decisions? Because of the constitutional status of the civil jury right, the issue cannot really be debated in terms of doing away with the jury altogether, but it is played out in deciding how much power the law gives to the judge to control the jury.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法官通过四种方式控制陪审团。首先，法官通过运用证据法（前面讨论过）来限制陪审团在审判期间可以听取的内容。其次，法官限制陪审团可以考虑的问题；通常的说法是，<em class="calibre8">法律问题</em>由法官决定，而<em class="calibre8">事实问题</em>则是陪审团的责任。第三，法官告诉陪审团在审理案件时应适用哪些法律规则以及这些规则的含义；业余陪审团无法了解法律是什么，因此应该遵循法官的指示。第四，法官可以在陪审团作出裁决之前将案件从陪审团手中收回，甚至在陪审团作出裁决之后，通过批准几项动议之一来推翻陪审团的裁决。<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_134" class="calibre4"></a>任何一方。（当然，实体法也约束陪审团。例如，如果司法管辖区对精神痛苦和苦难的损害赔偿金设定了上限，那么陪审团裁定的任何超过上限的赔偿金都将减少。）</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The judge controls the jury in four ways. First, the judge limits what the jury can hear during the trial by applying the law of evidence (discussed earlier). Second, the judge limits the issues that the jury can consider; the usual formulation is that <em class="calibre8">issues of law</em> are for the judge to decide and <em class="calibre8">issues of fact</em> are the jury’s responsibility. Third, the judge tells the jury what rules of law to apply in deciding the case and what those rules mean; the amateur jury has no way of knowing what the law is, so it is supposed to follow the judge’s instructions. Fourth, the judge can take the case away from the jury before it decides, or even upset the jury’s verdict after it is rendered, by granting one of several motions for <a class="calibre4"></a>either party. (The substantive law also controls the jury, of course. If the jurisdiction has enacted a cap on damages for pain and suffering, for example, any award by the jury in excess of the cap will be reduced.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法律与事实的区别看似简单：法官熟读法律书籍，最有资格确定适用哪些规则及其含义——即法律问题；而陪审团则能够理解案件的进展——即事实问题。实际情况远比这复杂得多。将某个问题标记为“法律”或“事实”仅仅是法官决定哪些问题愿意由陪审团裁决的一种方式。扩大事实范畴会扩展陪审团的作用，而扩大法律范畴则会缩小陪审团的作用。如果法官认为某个问题过于复杂、非常重要或可能被误解，他会倾向于将其从陪审团手中夺走并据为己有。只要法官不过分地篡夺陪审团的宪法职能，将问题视为法律问题就是一种有效的陪审团控制机制。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The law–fact distinction seems as if it ought to be simple: The judge has read the law books and is in the best position to determine what rules apply and what they mean—the issues of law—and the jury figures out what happened in the case—the issues of fact. The reality is more complex. Labeling an issue as “law” or “fact” is simply a way for the judge to determine which issues he is willing to allow the jury to decide. Broadening the fact category expands the jury’s role, while broadening the law category narrows it. If the judge thinks an issue is too complex, very important, or potentially subject to misinterpretation, he will be inclined to take it from the jury and preserve it for himself. As long as the judge doesn’t go too far in usurping the constitutional function of the jury, treating issues as matters of law is an effective jury control mechanism.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>例如，在罗宾逊案中，确定奥迪是否应承担责任涉及法律和事实问题。侵权法以这种方式界定这些问题：奥迪是否对原告负有义务，该义务的内容是什么，以及奥迪是否违反了该义务。前两个问题涉及重要的社会政策问题，因此法院将它们视为法律问题。奥迪是否对其汽车上的乘客负有义务以及义务的程度是侵权法的基本问题；裁定这些问题对整个社会有着巨大的影响。如果奥迪对乘客不负有义务，它生产安全汽车的动力就会小得多。相反，如果它有义务赔偿那些在电视新闻中听到事故而感到不安的人，它的责任将是巨大的。其义务的内容同样重要。侵权法中一个重大争论是产品制造商是否应对其产品缺陷造成的所有伤害负责（称为<em class="calibre8">严格责任</em>）还是仅对因制造产品时粗心大意而造成的伤害负责（称为过失<em class="calibre8">）</em>。这场争论的结果非常重要，以至于在本案产品责任案件中，法院不会让陪审团来裁决它。但第三个问题——汽车是否有缺陷，假设如果汽车有缺陷奥迪将承担责任——则有所不同。这绝不是一个简单的事实问题，因为它需要判断油箱设计的风险是否超过其好处，但对于其他案件的判决来说，这一点就没那么重要了。因此，法官将把违反义务的问题标记为事实问题，并留给陪审团来裁决。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the Robinsons’ case, for example, determining whether Audi is liable involves issues of law and fact. Tort law frames the issues in this way: whether Audi owed the plaintiffs a duty, what the content of that duty was, and whether Audi breached the duty. The first two questions involve important issues of social policy, so the court treats them as matters of law. Whether Audi owes a passenger in one of its cars a duty and how much of a duty are the basic issues of tort law; deciding these questions has immense consequences for society at large. If Audi did not owe a duty to passengers, it would have much less incentive to manufacture safe cars. Conversely, if it owed a duty to compensate people who were upset by hearing about the accident on the television news, its liability would be overwhelming. The content of its duty is equally important. One of the great debates in tort law has been whether the manufacturer of a product should be liable for all injuries caused by defects in its products (called <em class="calibre8">strict liability</em>) or only where it has been careless in manufacturing the product (where it has been <em class="calibre8">negligent</em>). The outcome of this debate is so important that the court in a products liability case like this one will not let the jury resolve it. But the third question—whether the car had a defect, assuming that Audi would be liable if the car was defective—is different. This is by no means a simple question of fact, because it requires the exercise of judgment about whether the risks of the gas tank’s design outweigh its benefits, but it is much less important for the decision of other cases. The judge therefore will label the breach of duty question as one of fact and leave it to the jury to decide.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如果陪审团的职能仅限于发现事实并将法律应用于事实，那么它必须有某种方式来了解法律是什么，并且<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_135" class="calibre4"></a>他们应该如何处理这些指示。在审判结束时，法官会通过发出<em class="calibre8">指示</em>或<em class="calibre8">指控</em>，告知陪审团需要裁决哪些问题以及应该适用哪些法律。例如，法官会解释法律要求汽车制造商在确保其产品安全方面遵守哪些行为标准，如何确定设计是否存在缺陷，奥迪可能承担哪些类型的损害赔偿责任，陪审员在做出裁决之前必须对其结论有多确定，以及他们应该如何进行审议。在大多数司法管辖区，法院会针对不同类型的案件颁布标准的陪审团指示，因此法官无需每次都制定指示。不过，通常情况下，每位律师还会提供一套拟议指示，根据具体案件修改标准指示，建议应纳入或排除的问题，并根据特定的法律观点对指示进行调整。这是对抗制程序的一部分，因为每位律师都试图获得最有利的指示，最终由法官决定哪些指示是合适的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If the jury’s function is limited to finding the facts and applying the law to the facts, it must have some way of knowing what the law is and <a class="calibre4"></a>what they are supposed to do with it. At the end of the trial, the judge tells the jury what issues it has to decide and what law it should apply by giving <em class="calibre8">instructions</em>, or a <em class="calibre8">charge</em>. The judge explains, for example, what standard of conduct the law requires of an automobile manufacturer in making its product safe, how to determine whether a design is defective, for what kinds of damages Audi can be liable, how certain of their conclusions the jurors must be before reaching a verdict, and how they should conduct their deliberations. In most jurisdictions the courts promulgate standard jury instructions for different types of cases, so the judge doesn’t have to make them up each time. Typically, though, each attorney also offers a set of proposed instructions, modifying the standard instructions to fit the individual case, suggesting issues that ought to be included or excluded, and shading the instructions to a particular view of the law. This is part of the adversary process, as each attorney tries to get the most advantageous instructions, and it is up to the judge to decide what is appropriate.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>陪审团指示是陪审团审判界限受到争议的另一个方面。即使是像罗宾逊案这样相对常规的案件，法官的指示也可能长达一小时或更长时间；在复杂的案件中，指示可能需要更长时间。这些指示必然很复杂，涉及复杂的法律问题和开放性问题。对于非专业陪审员来说，很难理解这些规则的复述，即使是律师和法官也可能会觉得它们很复杂或极具争议。因此，即使律师和法官可能花费数小时精心编写指示的每一句话，陪审员可能仍然会留下一些印象或一些基本概念，而这些印象或概念并不能准确反映他们应该适用的法律。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Jury instructions are another point at which the limits of jury trials become contested. Even in a relatively routine case such as the Robinsons’, the judge’s instructions can go on for an hour or more; in a complex case, the instructions can take even longer. And the instructions are necessarily complicated, dealing with sophisticated legal issues and open questions. It’s difficult for a nonprofessional juror to assimilate this recitation of rules that even lawyers and judges might find complex or consider highly debatable. Thus even though the lawyers and judge may have spent hours carefully crafting each sentence of the instructions, the jurors may be left with an impression or a few basic ideas that don’t accurately reflect the law they are supposed to apply.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>陪审团控制的最后一种方法，其核心在于法官与陪审团之间权力的分配。在审判前、审判中甚至审判后的关键时刻，一方当事人可以请求法官将案件的全部或部分内容从陪审团手中收回，由法官自行裁决。我们已经了解，法官可以通过批准驳回原告诉讼的动议（因为原告的诉讼没有提出法律上可支持的针对被告的主张）或批准简易判决动议（因为不存在重大事实争议，且法律已确定如何根据无争议的事实对案件进行裁决）来阻止案件进入审判阶段。审判开始后，法官还可以通过在审判期间批准定向<em class="calibre8">裁决动议或在陪审团作出裁决后</em><em class="calibre8">批准判决动议（尽管有裁决），</em>来限制陪审团的权力并支持其中一方当事人；这两项动议通常被统称为<em class="calibre8">法律上的判决动议</em>。或者，在审判结束时，法官可以撤销陪审团的裁决并命令重新审判。<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_136" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The final method of jury control is one that goes to the heart of the allocation of authority between judge and jury. At key points before, during, or even after the trial, a party can ask the judge to take all or part of the case away from the jury and decide it himself. We have already seen how the judge can prevent the case from going to trial by granting a motion to dismiss the plaintiff’s case because it doesn’t state a legally supportable claim against the defendant, or by granting a motion for summary judgment because there are no major factual disputes and the law determines how the case should be decided on the undisputed facts. Once the trial has begun, the judge can also limit the jury’s power and find for one of the parties by granting a <em class="calibre8">motion for directed verdict</em> during the trial or a <em class="calibre8">motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict</em> after the jury has decided; the two motions often are referred to together as <em class="calibre8">motions for judgment as a matter of law</em>. Or, at the end of the trial, the judge can set aside the jury’s verdict and order that there be a new trial.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如果法官认定事实不足以提交陪审团，或者根据事实只能合理得出一个结果，则法律上可批准判决动议。这两项动议的时机有所不同。一方当事人可以在对方提交所有证据后提出定向裁决动议。例如，在罗宾逊夫妇结束诉讼后，如果罗宾逊夫妇没有提供任何证据证明可以制造更安全的油箱（如果这是法律标准的一部分），或者他们提供的所有证据都表明油箱的设计尽可能安全，奥迪可以提出对其有利的定向裁决动议。同样，如果奥迪未能成功反驳罗宾逊夫妇关于油箱设计不当的证据，罗宾逊夫妇也可以在奥迪结束辩护后提出定向裁决动议。如果任何一项动议获得批准，法院将作出有利于胜诉方的判决。 （尽管这被称为定向裁决动议，但陪审团不必按照法官的指示真正做出裁决——法官会为他们做出裁决。）</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The motions for judgment as a matter of law may be granted if the judge determines that there are insufficient facts to go to the jury or that only one result reasonably could follow from the facts. The two motions differ in their timing. A party may move for directed verdict after its opponent has presented all of its evidence. After the Robinsons conclude their case, Audi may move for a directed verdict in its favor if, for example, the Robinsons have not presented any evidence that it was possible to make a safer gas tank (if that is part of the legal standard), or because all of the evidence they have presented indicates that the gas tank was as safely designed as possible. Similarly, the Robinsons may move for a directed verdict after Audi concludes its defense if Audi has not successfully refuted their evidence that the gas tank was improperly designed. If either motion is granted, the court will enter judgment for the successful party. (Even though it is called a motion for directed verdict, the jury doesn’t have to go through the formality of actually rendering the verdict that the judge directs them to—the judge does that for them.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>不顾判决结果的判决则更加引人注目。证据提交结束后，法官指示陪审团进行商议，陪审团最终作出裁决。但随后，法官得出结论，认为陪审团得出的答案在法律上是错误的，或在事实上是不合理的，因此尽管陪审团的裁决有利于另一方，他仍宣布一方胜诉。从程序上讲，这项动议被视为延迟的定向裁决动议，法官可能会利用它，因为延迟将案件从陪审团手中夺走具有战术优势。如果案件结果接近，法官做出定向裁决，一方可能会上诉，上诉法院可能会推翻初审法官的判决，要求重新审判。通过等待陪审团是否得出“正确”答案，法官可以避免进行二审；与批准动议相比，陪审团裁决更有可能被维持。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Judgment notwithstanding the verdict is even more remarkable. The presentation of evidence concludes, the judge instructs the jury and sends it out to deliberate, and the jury returns with a verdict. But then the judge concludes that the jury arrived at an answer that is wrong on the law or unreasonable on the facts, so he declares one party the winner notwithstanding the jury’s verdict in favor of the other party. Procedurally, this motion is treated as if it were a delayed motion for directed verdict, and the judge may use it because there is a tactical advantage to delaying his decision to take the case away from the jury. If it is a close question and the judge grants a directed verdict, one party will probably appeal and the appellate court might reverse the trial judge, requiring a new trial. By waiting to see if the jury arrives at the “right” answer, the judge may avoid the need for a second trial; a jury verdict is more likely to be upheld than his grant of a motion.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法律上的判决体现了陪审团在审判过程中的核心地位与法官控制陪审团的权力之间的显著冲突。由于在宪法起草时已有此类动议的先例，最高法院裁定，它们并不违反第七修正案赋予的陪审团审判权。然而，由于该机制威胁到陪审团职能的核心，法院不遗余力地试图界定此类动议的适用范围，而不同的法院对于审判法官可以介入陪审团管辖范围的程度也存在分歧。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Judgments as a matter of law present a striking conflict between the jury’s central place in the trial process and the judge’s power to control the jury. Because there were predecessors of these motions at the time of the drafting of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has held that they do not violate the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial. Nevertheless, because the device threatens the core of the jury’s function, courts have taken some pains to try to define when such a motion might be appropriate, and different courts disagree on how much a trial judge can intrude into the jury’s domain.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法官可以选择不作出有利于一方的判决，而是下令重新审理，以纠正一审中出现的错误。当然，上诉法院也可以下令重新审理。<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_137" class="calibre4"></a>但审判法官对案件的进展有第一手的了解，并且有机会评估整个审判过程，他可能会认定，某些个别错误或一系列较小错误的累积损害了败诉方获得公正审判的机会。与法律上的判决动议一样，准予重新审判可能会侵犯陪审团的管辖权，使其裁决无效。不过，重新审判的侵犯性较小，因为至少会有第二个陪审团来审理案件。然而，仅仅因为法官不同意陪审团的裁决，就不会准予重新审判。如果法官在审判过程中犯了重大法律错误——例如，不当采纳或排除重要证据，或错误地指示陪审团——他可以通过下令重新审判来纠正错误。准予重新审判的其他原因包括律师或陪审员的不当行为、新发现的证据，或裁决过重。在后一种情况下，法官可能会让胜诉方选择：接受不同的判决金额或再次开庭审理。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Instead of entering judgment for one of the parties, the judge has the option of ordering a new trial to correct errors that occurred in the first trial. Of course, an appeals court also can order a new trial, <a class="calibre4"></a>but the trial judge knows firsthand what happened and, having the opportunity to evaluate the trial, may decide that some individual error, or the accumulation of a number of smaller mistakes, prejudiced the opportunity of the losing party to have a fair trial. Like motions for judgment as a matter of law, granting a new trial can invade the jury’s province by making their verdict ineffective. The new trial is less invasive, though, because at least a second jury will get to hear the case. Nevertheless, new trials are not granted just because the judge disagrees with the jury’s verdict. If the judge has made a substantial legal error in conducting the trial—improperly admitting or excluding important evidence or incorrectly instructing the jury, for example—he may correct the mistake by ordering a new trial. Other reasons to grant a new trial include misconduct by an attorney or juror, newly discovered evidence, or because the verdict is excessive. In the latter case the judge may offer the winning party a choice: Accept a different amount or go to trial again.</p>

<p class="noindent">审判并不一定是故事的结束。败诉方，甚至只是部分胜诉的一方，都可以向更高一级的法院上诉。并非所有败诉方都会上诉。律师可能会认为上诉理由不足，或者败诉方无法或不愿在诉讼中投入更多资金。但在每个司法管辖区，败诉方至少都有权考虑将案件提交上诉法院复审。</p><p class="noindent">The trial isn’t necessarily the end of the story. The losing party, or even a party who wins only part of what it wanted, can appeal the case to a higher court. Not every loser does appeal. The lawyer might decide that there is not a good enough basis for appealing, or the party might be unable or unwilling to invest more money in the litigation. But in every jurisdiction, a losing party at least has the right to consider having the case reviewed by an appellate court.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>大型法院系统，例如联邦法院和大州法院，设有两级上诉法院。第一级是中级上诉法院，在联邦系统中称为上诉法院，在各州则有不同的名称。（较小的司法管辖区省略此层级。）第二级是管辖范围内的最高法院，例如美国最高法院或俄克拉荷马州最高法院。如果诉讼当事人对中级上诉法院的判决结果感到不满，可以请求最高法院审理此案。通常情况下，上诉至中级法院是强制性的（法院必须审理此案），而上诉至下一级法院则是自由裁量的（法院可以决定是否审理此案）。在美国最高法院，请求法院审理上诉的程序被称为申请<em class="calibre8">调卷令</em>（拉丁语，意为“被告知”）；通过发出调卷令，上级法院告知下级法院，它希望了解案件情况，以便下级法院能够做出裁决。终审法院只会受理对其而言重要的上诉，因为<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_138" class="calibre4"></a>案件提出了一个重要的法律问题，或者因为下级法院对所涉及的法律问题的正确解决方案存在困惑。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The larger court systems, like the federal courts and those of big states, have two layers of appellate courts. The first layer is the intermediate appellate court, called the Courts of Appeals in the federal system and various names in different states. (Smaller jurisdictions omit this layer.) The second layer is the highest court in the jurisdiction, such as the U.S. Supreme Court or the Oklahoma Supreme Court. If the disappointed litigant doesn’t like the result in the intermediate appellate court, she may ask the highest court to hear the case. Usually, though, while the appeal to the intermediate court is mandatory (the court must hear the case), the appeal to the next level is discretionary (the court can decide whether or not it wants to hear the case). In the U.S. Supreme Court, the procedure of asking the court to hear the appeal is called petitioning for a <em class="calibre8">writ of certiorari</em> (a Latin term meaning “to be informed”); by issuing the writ, the higher court tells the lower court that it wishes to be informed about the case so that it can decide it. A court of last resort will take only an appeal that seems important to it, either because the <a class="calibre4"></a>case raises an important legal issue or because there is confusion among the lower courts about the proper resolution of the legal issue involved.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>上诉程序并非旨在达成正确结果或保证案件流程完美。相反，它试图平衡诉讼程序的基本价值。上诉法院会纠正下级法院的错误，这些错误会严重影响程序的公正性或相关实体法价值的实现，但它会尽量以相对高效的方式做到这一点，避免过度干预、造成不当拖延或妨碍程序的最终完成。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The appeals process is not designed to achieve a correct result or to guarantee a perfect process in the case. Instead, it tries to balance the fundamental values of the litigation process. An appellate court will correct errors in the courts below that substantially impinge on the fairness of the process or the effectuation of the values of substantive law that are involved, but it tries to do this relatively efficiently, by not interfering too much, causing undue delay, or preventing finality in the process.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>以罗宾逊案的部分上诉为例。（请记住，该案还涉及复杂的程序问题，导致案件从俄克拉荷马州法院上诉至美国最高法院，然后在下级联邦法院反复审理。）陪审团在俄克拉荷马州北区联邦地区法院作出了有利于被告、不利于罗宾逊案的裁决。罗宾逊案上诉至美国上诉法院，部分理由是初审法官不当排除了大众母公司知晓油箱设计风险的证据。初审法官排除该证据的依据是，相关知识不能归属于奥迪——汽车制造商和大众的子公司。上诉法院同意该知识不能归属于奥迪，并维持了该判决的这一部分，但不同意初审法官关于该证据不能用于指控大众的裁决，因此将案件发回，对大众进行重新审判。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Take as an example part of the appeal in the Robinsons’ case. (Remember that there also were complex procedural issues in the case, resulting in the case moving through the Oklahoma courts to the U.S. Supreme Court and then up and down through the lower federal courts.) The jury returned a verdict for the defendants and against the Robinsons in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma. The Robinsons appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals, arguing in part that the trial judge had improperly excluded evidence that Volkswagen, the parent company, had known of the risks of the gas tank design. The trial judge had excluded the evidence under the theory that the knowledge could not be attributed to Audi, the manufacturer of the car and a subsidiary of Volkswagen. The court of appeals agreed that the knowledge could not be attributed to Audi and affirmed that part of the judgment but disagreed with the trial judge’s ruling that the evidence could not be used against Volkswagen, so it sent the case back for a new trial against Volkswagen.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>首先考虑何时可以对初审法院的判决提出上诉。法院对效率和终局性途径的看法各不相同。大多数法院遵循<em class="calibre8">终审判决规则</em>，顾名思义，该规则只允许审查下级法院的终审判决，即彻底解决案件的终审判决。根据这一规则，罗宾逊夫妇无法就初审法官裁决时排除大众汽车知晓缺陷的证据提出上诉；他们必须等到案件结束后败诉才能上诉。这被认为是高效的，因为它可以防止罗宾逊夫妇在上诉期间拖延审判，允许上诉法院一次性审查整个案件，包括该特定错误或任何其他被指控的错误，并且可能永远不需要审查裁决；如果罗宾逊夫妇胜诉，上诉法院将永远无需考虑该问题。其他法院允许在初审法官的裁决涉及实质性权利时随时提出上诉。在这种情况下，如果允许对证据问题提出上诉，就没有必要完成第一次审判，而当上诉法院推翻原判时，只需下令重新审判。<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_139" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>First consider when someone can appeal from the trial court. Here courts see the route to efficiency and finality in different ways. Most courts observe the <em class="calibre8">final judgment rule</em>, which, as its name indicates, permits the review only of actions of the lower court that are final, completely settling the matter before it. Under this approach, the Robinsons cannot appeal the exclusion of the evidence of Volkswagen’s knowledge of the defect at the time the trial judge makes his ruling; they have to wait for the end of the case, when they have lost. This is seen as efficient because it prevents the Robinsons from delaying the trial while they appeal, it allows the appellate court to look at the whole case at once, including that particular error or any others alleged, and review of the ruling might never be necessary; if the Robinsons win, the appellate court will never have to consider the issue. Other courts allow an appeal at any time when a substantial right is implicated in the trial judge’s decision. In this case, allowing an appeal of the evidentiary issue would have made it unnecessary to complete the first trial only to have a new trial ordered when the appellate court reversed.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>接下来考虑一下上诉法院没有做什么。由于上诉程序与整个司法系统一样，遵循相同的对抗制理念，上诉法院只会回答被提出的问题。上诉法院并非一时兴起，在初审法院审理结束后才决定审理罗宾逊夫妇的案件；它必须等待其中一方提出上诉。而且，一旦接到案件，它只能处理由当事人提请其注意并在下级法院提出的问题。例如，它没有考虑陪审团指示是否恰当，因为双方当事人都没有提出这个问题。法院也不会考虑败诉方在审判中未提出的问题。如果初审法官采纳了有争议的证据，奥迪就不能在上诉中首次对其可采性提出异议。出于​​公平和效率的考虑，上诉法院只考虑提请初审法官注意并在其掌握的有限记录中展开的事项。法院也不会考虑未提交下级法院的事实。而且，法院只会考虑那些对案件结果有影响的上诉问题。例如，奥迪不能仅仅因为想从上级法院获得关于该问题的法律判决就对法官的某些裁决提出上诉；奥迪胜诉了，因此法院不会浪费时间考虑那些与解决现场争议无关的问题。（不过，一旦罗宾逊夫妇上诉，奥迪就可以提出其他问题来支持判决。）</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Next consider what the court of appeals did not do. Because the appellate process follows the same adversary ideal as the rest of the system, an appellate court will only answer questions that it is asked. The court of appeals did not decide on its own whim that it wanted to look at the Robinsons’ case after the trial court had finished; it had to wait for one of the parties to appeal. And once it had the case, it only could address issues that were brought to its attention by the parties and that were raised in the court below. It did not, for example, consider whether the jury instructions were proper, because neither party raised that issue. Nor would the court consider an issue that the losing party had failed to raise at trial. If the trial judge had admitted the disputed evidence, Audi could not object to its admissibility for the first time on appeal. As a matter of fairness and efficiency, the appellate court only considers matters brought to the trial judge’s attention and developed in the limited record that it has in front of it. Nor does the court consider facts that were not brought before the lower court. And the court will only consider issues on appeal that make a difference in the outcome of the case. Audi, for example, could not appeal some ruling of the judge just because it wanted to get a pronouncement from the higher court on the law on that issue; Audi won, so the court won’t waste its time considering issues that are not important to the resolution of the live controversy. (Once the Robinsons appeal, however, Audi can raise other issues in support of the judgment.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最后，想想上诉法院如何审查下级法院的判决。如果提交给上诉法院的问题是法律问题，上诉法院通常会愿意自行判断正确的结果。大众汽车知情权证据的排除，触及了母公司与子公司之间关系的一项法律原则。上诉法院的法官和初审法官一样精通法律，因此他们会重新考量此事，不会尊重初审法官的裁决。（由于地位更高，上诉法院的法官常常认为自己更懂法律。正如关于最高法院法官的谚语所说，他们并非因为一贯正确而拥有最终裁决权，而是因为一贯正确而拥有最终裁决权。）然而，如果问题涉及事实，上诉法院会更加谨慎。他们只会看到下级法院诉讼记录的部分内容以及当事人律师的辩论。他们没有听取证人证词，也没有考虑所有证据，因此在评估油箱是否存在缺陷等方面处于弱势。因此，上诉法院会更加尊重事实认定，尤其是在陪审团作出且未被初审法官推翻的情况下。<a id="text/part0010_split_001.html.page_140" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Finally, think about how an appellate court reviews what happened in the lower court. If the issue brought before it is a question of law, the appeals court will usually be willing to use its own judgment as to the correct result. The exclusion of the evidence of Volkswagen’s knowledge turned on a principle of law about the relationship between parent and subsidiary corporations. The appeals judges know that law as well as the trial judge does, so they will consider the matter afresh and give no deference to the trial judge’s ruling. (Because of their loftier position, appeals court judges often think they know the law better. As the saying goes about the justices of the Supreme Court, they are not final because they are infallible, but they are infallible because they are final.) If the issue is one that involves the facts, however, the appellate court will be more circumspect. They see only a portion of the transcript of the proceedings in the lower court and the parties’ attorneys’ arguments. They have not heard the witnesses or considered all of the evidence, so they are in a weaker position to evaluate, say, whether the gas tank was defective. Accordingly, the appeals court will give more deference to a factual determination, especially if it is made by a jury and not overturned by the trial judge.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>当所有上诉请求都已用尽，案件就结束了。即使败诉方发现了新的证据或提出了新的理论，也不能再次向法院上诉。终局性是法律体系的一个重要要素，体现在拉丁语“<em class="calibre8">既判力”（res judicata）</em>中——“事情已经判决”。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When all the appeals have been exhausted, the case is over. Even though the losing party may discover new evidence or come up with a new theory, it cannot go back to court and try again. Finality is an important element of the legal system, incorporated in the Latin phrase <em class="calibre8">res judicata</em>—“the thing has been decided.”</p>

<p class="subtitle1">人身伤害和侵权法</p><p class="subtitle1">Personal Injuries and Tort Law</p>
<p class="noindent">七十九岁的斯特拉·利贝克（Stella Liebeck）坐在她侄子的车里，在新墨西哥州阿尔伯克基一家麦当劳的免下车窗口买了一杯咖啡。当她把杯子放在两腿之间准备打开杯盖加奶油和糖时，咖啡洒了出来，烫伤了自己。利贝克起诉麦当劳，声称咖啡太烫。陪审团最终判给她16万美元的伤害赔偿金，以及270万美元的罚款。</p><p class="noindent">Stella Liebeck, seventy-nine years old and a passenger in her nephew’s car, bought a cup of coffee at the drive-through window of a McDonald’s in Albuquerque, New Mexico. As she placed the cup between her legs to remove the lid to add cream and sugar, she spilled the coffee, burning herself. Liebeck sued McDonald’s, alleging that the coffee was too hot, and a jury awarded her $160,000 to compensate her for her injuries and $2.7 million to punish McDonald’s.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这是侵权法改革倡导者们指出的最著名的“诉讼滥用”案例，他们试图改革我们的民事责任制度，也就是侵权法。每个人都知道咖啡很烫，如果洒了，可能会烫伤自己。但侵权法改革者表示，没有人愿意承担日常事故的后果。相反，法官和陪审团却肆无忌惮地允许原告将自己的不幸转嫁给财力雄厚的人。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This is the most famous case of “lawsuit abuse” pointed to by advocates of tort reform as they seek to revamp our system of civil liability, which is known as tort law. Everyone knows that coffee is hot, and if you spill it, you can burn yourself. But no one is willing to accept the consequences of an everyday accident, say tort reformers. Instead, judges and juries have run amok in allowing plaintiffs to pass their misfortune on to someone with a deep pocket.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>与此同时，侵权法的捍卫者将利贝克的案件视为侵权法体系有效运作的证据。麦当劳已收到超过700起关于其咖啡温度的投诉，并已解决了其中许多投诉。该公司提供的咖啡温度比竞争对手高出20度，其管理人员承认，这个温度太烫，不适合立即饮用，而且足以导致烫伤。利贝克因三度烧伤住院一周，需要进行植皮手术。她最初愿意就医疗费用达成和解，但麦当劳拒绝了。陪审团计算出270万美元是麦当劳两天咖啡销售的收入，因此将该金额作为惩罚性赔偿金。陪审团还裁定，由于利贝克不小心，她对受伤负有部分责任，因此相应减少了判给她的赔偿金，而审判法官进一步减少了<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_142" class="calibre4"></a>惩罚性赔偿金额降至48万美元。直到此案及其引发的公众关注之后，麦当劳才降低了咖啡的温度。辩护律师表示，侵权法体系在这里发挥了作用；不法行为人被迫赔偿受伤的受害者，并纠正其危险行为。此案还影响了其他潜在的危险行为：温迪连锁店降低了其主要面向儿童的热巧克力的温度。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile, defenders of tort law view Liebeck’s case as evidence of how well the tort system works. McDonald’s had received over 700 complaints about the temperature of the coffee it served and had settled many of these complaints. The company served its coffee at a temperature twenty degrees hotter than its competitors, a temperature that its managers admitted was too hot to drink right away and hot enough to cause burns. Liebeck was in the hospital for a week with third-degree burns requiring skin grafts. She initially was willing to settle the case for her medical expenses, but McDonald’s refused. The jury figured that $2.7 million was the amount McDonald’s made from two days of coffee sales, so it used that amount as the punitive damage award. The jury also found that Liebeck was partially responsible for her injuries because she wasn’t careful, so it reduced the damages it awarded her accordingly, and the trial judge further reduced <a class="calibre4"></a>the punitive damage award to $480,000. Only after this case and the resulting publicity did McDonald’s reduce the temperature of its coffee. Here the tort system worked, its defenders say; a wrongdoer was forced to compensate an injured victim and to remedy its dangerous conduct. The case also influenced other potentially dangerous conduct: The Wendy’s chain reduced the temperature of its hot chocolate, served mostly to children.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>数百年来，法院和立法机构一直在制定侵权法原则，以确定某人何时应对他人的伤害负责。侵权法制度的支持者认为，像斯特拉·利贝克这样的案例表明该制度运作良好，任何变革都应该延续数百年来循序渐进的发展历程。侵权法改革者则认为，现状已经走得太远，将责任从个人身上转移，并将诉讼费用强加给无辜的被告，因此需要进行彻底的立法改革。然而，在我们决定是维持还是改革该制度之前，我们需要了解侵权法的真正含义。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For several hundred years, courts and legislatures have been working out tort principles that determine when someone is responsible for someone else’s injuries. Proponents of the tort system say that cases like Stella Liebeck’s show how well the system works and that any change ought to come through a continuation of the centuries-old process of step-by-step development. Tort reformers argue that things have gone too far, shifting responsibility away from individuals and imposing costs on blameless defendants, so that drastic legislative changes are needed. Before we can decide to either maintain or revamp the system, however, we need to understand what tort law is all about.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0011_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-5-div1-2"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0034" class="calibre1">什么是侵权法？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0034" class="calibre1">What Is Tort Law?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">侵权法在一般层面上易于描述，但更精确的定义却很困难。<em class="calibre8">侵权法</em>源于拉丁语，意为“扭曲”或“偏离”，因此，侵权行为是指偏离正当行为标准的行为——一种不法行为。如果你打了邻居的鼻子，开车不小心撞倒了行人，或者端上滚烫的咖啡伤了顾客，你就构成了侵权行为。（有些侵权行为，本文未讨论，仅涉及经济损失而非人身伤害，例如诬告某人是骗子或使用欺诈手段诱使其进行金融交易。）所有这些都是受害者可以获得金钱赔偿的不法行为。</p><p class="noindent">Tort law is easy to describe at a general level and hard to define more precisely. <em class="calibre8">Tort</em> comes from a Latin word meaning “twisted” or “turned aside,” so a tort is an act that is turned aside from the standard of proper conduct—a wrongful act. If you punch your neighbor in the nose, run over a pedestrian by driving carelessly, or injure a customer by serving burning hot coffee, you have committed a tort. (Some torts, not discussed here, involve only economic harm and not physical injury, such as falsely accusing someone of being a crook or using fraud to induce them to enter into a financial transaction.) All of these are wrongful acts for which the victim can receive an award of money damages.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>从这些典型案例中，我们可以很好地理解侵权法的含义。然而，请注意，这些描述基本上是空洞的，因为它们没有回答侵权法的基本问题：如果侵权法制裁不法行为，那么我们如何判断哪些行为是不法行为？当你的邻居打你鼻子时，他构成侵权吗？当麦当劳提供的咖啡热到足以烫伤顾客时，麦当劳构成侵权吗？如果司机在限速以下行驶但被认为在当时天气条件下行驶过快而导致事故，那又如何呢？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We can get a good sense of what tort law is about from these typical cases. Notice, however, that the descriptions are basically empty because they do not answer the fundamental question about tort law: If tort law sanctions wrongful conduct, how do we tell what conduct is wrongful? Does your neighbor commit a tort when he punches you in the nose? Does McDonald’s commit a tort when it serves coffee that is hot enough to scald a customer? How about a driver who causes an accident while going under the speed limit but arguably driving too fast for the weather conditions?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这些问题体现了侵权法的两个重要特征。首先，有些案件容易判决，有些案件则很难判决。法官、律师和侵权法学者利用简单的案例来制定政策和原则，<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_143" class="calibre4"></a>帮助他们分析疑难案件。（有时反过来也一样；思考疑难案件会激发我们的洞见，促使我们重新思考对简单案件的答案。）其次，侵权法既是一个过程，也是一套规则。侵权法的一个基本要素是将非常普遍的原则（例如“每个人都必须采取合理的谨慎措施，不伤害他人”）应用于具体案件，例如雨夜发生的车祸。在侵权法中，应用规则的制度结构（由法院和陪审团分担责任的诉讼制度）与规则本身的内容同样重要。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Questions like these suggest two important features of tort law. First, some cases are easy to decide and some cases are hard. Judges, lawyers, and tort scholars use the easy cases to develop policies and principles that <a class="calibre4"></a>help them analyze the hard cases. (Sometimes it works in reverse as well; thinking about the hard cases provokes insights that make us rethink our answers to the easy cases.) Second, tort law is as much a process as it is a body of rules. An essential element of tort law is the application of very general principles—such as “everyone must use reasonable care not to injure someone else”—to particular cases, like an auto accident that occurs on a rainy night. The institutional structure through which the rules are applied—the litigation system in which responsibility is shared by courts and juries—is as important in tort law as the content of the rules themselves.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>长期以来，侵权诉讼制度几乎清一色是单个原告针对单个被告因单一事件而提起的案件。最多时，小团体会站在诉讼的一方或另一方；一辆车的司机和三名乘客会起诉造成事故的另一辆车的司机，或者手术中受伤的病人会起诉外科医生、麻醉师和医院。这些类型的案件仍然在侵权诉讼中占主导地位，但近几十年来，涉及同一行为导致多人受伤的案件（称为<em class="calibre8">大规模侵权行为</em>）变得更加重要。一些大规模侵权行为涉及由单一事故（例如爆炸）或单一污染源（例如化工厂的污染）造成的多重伤害。其他大规模侵权行为涉及由同一类型行为在一段时间内重复造成的多重伤害，例如使用石棉或销售危险药物。不管怎样，其结果都是惊人的：9·11惨剧造成 6,000 名受害者、20,000 例隆胸病例以及 800,000 多例石棉病例。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For a long time, the tort litigation system almost uniformly involved cases brought by an individual plaintiff against an individual defendant arising out of a single event. At most, small groups would be on one side of the litigation or the other; the driver and three passengers in a car would sue the driver of the other car who caused the accident, or a patient injured during an operation would sue the surgeon, the anesthesiologist, and the hospital. Those types of cases still dominate tort litigation, but in recent decades, cases involving many people injured by the same conduct, known as <em class="calibre8">mass torts</em>, have become more important. Some mass torts involve multiple injuries produced by a single accident, such as an explosion, or a single source, such as pollution from a chemical plant. Others involve multiple injuries produced by the same kind of conduct repeated over time, such as the use of asbestos or the sale of a dangerous drug. The results, of either kind, are dramatic: 6,000 victims of the September 11 tragedy, 20,000 breast implant cases, and more than 800,000 asbestos cases.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>大规模侵权行为给该体系带来了诸多挑战。其中一项挑战是处理数量庞大的案件，这些案件在侵权体系中穿梭，就像猪穿过蟒蛇一样，造成诉讼激增，有可能压垮法院，并延误其他案件的裁决。另一个问题是，如何将正义分配给在不同时间提起诉讼、遭受不同伤害的受害者。许多大规模侵权案件的被告诉诸破产以逃避责任负担，法院必须确定谁能得到赔偿；如果早期原告获得全额赔偿，那么那些后来才出现伤害的原告可能就一无所获了。而毒性侵权行为——因接触危险化学品、药物或其他物质而引起的大规模侵权行为——则带来了不同寻常的因果关系问题，因为可能难以将风险与特定伤害联系起来，这些伤害可能起源复杂，并且可能在接触很久之后才出现。本章后面的部分将讨论其中一些问题。然而，在回答“什么是侵权法”这个问题时，大规模侵权行为的存在意味着答案既包括裁决程序，也包括<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_144" class="calibre4"></a>个人纠纷和处理大量伤害的系统。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mass torts present several challenges to the system. One challenge is dealing with the sheer number of cases, which can move through the tort system like a pig through a python, creating a bulge of litigation that threatens to overwhelm the courts and delay the adjudication of other cases. Another problem is parceling out justice to victims with different injuries who sue at different times. Many defendants in mass tort cases resort to bankruptcy to escape the burden of liability, and the courts must then determine who gets what; if early plaintiffs are fully compensated, there may be nothing left for those whose injuries manifest later. And toxic torts—mass torts arising from exposure to dangerous chemicals, drugs, or other substances—pose unusual causation problems, because it may be difficult to tie the risk posed to particular injuries, which may have complex origins and which may arise long after exposure. Some of these problems are discussed in later sections of this chapter. In responding to the question “what is tort law?”, however, the presence of mass torts means that the answer includes both a process for the adjudication <a class="calibre4"></a>of individual disputes and a system for addressing spectacularly large numbers of injuries as well.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0011_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-5-div1-3"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0035" class="calibre1">为什么我们需要侵权法？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0035" class="calibre1">Why Do We Need Tort Law?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">每天都会发生受伤事件。司机开车时睡着了，撞到了一棵树。有人从台阶上摔了下来。行动并不总是成功的。</p><p class="noindent">Injuries occur every day. A driver falls asleep at the wheel and crashes into a tree. Someone trips down the steps. Operations are not always successful.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，很多时候，人们受伤是别人的责任。比如，房主没有修补人行道上的裂缝，导致路人绊倒。医生误诊并虐待病人。乘客在一场看似轻微的车祸中丧生，因为油箱破裂爆炸。或者，举一个侵权法老师们最喜欢的离奇案例：一名火车乘务员推了一名乘客，导致他掉落一个包裹；包裹里的烟花爆炸，撞倒了秤，秤掉落在站台另一端等候的另一名乘客身上。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Very often, though, people are injured when someone else is responsible. A homeowner fails to repair cracks in his sidewalk and a passerby trips and falls. Physicians misdiagnose and mistreat patients. Passengers are killed in an apparently minor car crash because the gas tank ruptures and explodes. Or take one of the bizarre fact patterns that is a favorite of torts teachers: A train conductor pushes a passenger, causing him to drop a package; fireworks in the package explode, knocking over scales which fall on another passenger waiting at the other end of the platform.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如果我们没有法律体系来处理此类伤害，情况会怎样？首先，人们会缺乏避免伤害他人的动力。有时伤害是故意造成的；但更多时候，伤害是意外造成的，因为人们缺乏谨慎的动力。如果汽车制造商知道自己无需为缺陷汽车造成的伤害承担责任，他们就会有动力减少安全措施。司机可能会更不小心，业主也不太愿意维修人行道。相反，那些采取安全措施的企业和个人也会因其良好行为而受到惩罚，因为谨慎行事的成本往往更高，而责任却没有相应减少。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>What if we had no legal system to deal with injuries like these? First, people would have less incentive to avoid injuring other people. Sometimes injuries would occur intentionally; more often, the injuries would be accidental, because people would have less incentive to be careful. An auto manufacturer would have an incentive to cut back on safety measures if it knew it would not be liable for injuries that were caused by defective cars. Drivers might be less careful, and property owners might be less inclined to repair their sidewalks. Conversely, businesses and individuals who did act safely would be penalized for their good behavior because it is often more expensive to act carefully with no corresponding reduction in liability.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>其次，事故受害者将不得不自掏腰包支付医疗费、误工费、财产损失以及其他因受伤造成的后果。对于大多数受害者来说，损失将是巨大的；而对于少数不幸的人来说，损失将是灾难性的。例如，斯特拉·利贝克（Stella Liebeck）因喝热咖啡而遭遇的意外，将花费数万美元的住院费和医疗费。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Second, the victims of accidents would be left to their own resources to pay for medical expenses, lost wages, property damage, and other consequences of injuries they suffer. For most victims the cost would be significant; for the unlucky few, the cost would be catastrophic. Stella Liebeck’s misadventure with hot coffee, for example, would cost her tens of thousands of dollars in hospitalization and doctor bills.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第三，人们可以随意伤害他人，无论是有意还是无意，这似乎不公平。如果粗心的司机不必为自己的行为付出代价，他就可以逍遥法外，而无辜的受害者则必须承担后果。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Third, it just would not seem fair that people could freely inflict harm on other people, either intentionally or carelessly. The careless driver would get away with acting wrongfully if he did not have to pay for his actions, and the innocent victim would have to suffer the consequences.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>除了侵权法制度之外，我们还可以采取其他多种方式来解决这些问题。不法行为可以被刑事起诉。加强交通法规的执行可以确保人们谨慎驾驶。政府机构可以详细规范汽车和其他产品的生产方式，以及人们如何维护自己的财产。<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_145" class="calibre4"></a>快餐店的咖啡温度是多少等等。市场和公众声誉也会有所帮助；消费者可能只会购买他们知道安全的产品，而且人们不希望被认为粗心大意。事故受害者可以自行购买保险。如果他们无力购买，可以寻求政府援助或私人慈善机构的帮助。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We could take care of these problems in several ways other than a tort system. Wrongful behavior could be prosecuted criminally. Beefed-up enforcement of the traffic laws could make sure people drove carefully. Government bureaucracies could regulate in detail how cars and other products are manufactured, how people have to maintain their property, <a class="calibre4"></a>at what temperature coffee can be served in fast-food restaurants, and so on. The market and general reputation would help, too; consumers might only buy products that they knew to be safe, and people would not want to be thought of as careless. Victims of accidents could purchase their own insurance. If they could not afford to do so, they could be taken care of by government assistance or private charities.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>事实上，我们确实会使用侵权法以外的机制来处理伤害引发的问题。刑事起诉的威胁会阻止人们互相殴打，联邦政府要求汽车配备安全气囊、安全带和其他安全装置。交通事故中受伤的人可能有医疗保险来支付治疗费用，也有伤残保险来弥补收入损失；如果没有，医疗补助、社会保障和福利金可能会填补这一缺口。一些领域已经基本或完全脱离了侵权法体系。工伤赔偿是最大的领域；在每个州，在工作中受伤的工人不能起诉雇主（少数例外），而是由州政府的保险计划承保。儿童接种疫苗后出现不良反应的儿童可以从联邦信托基金寻求赔偿，而不是起诉制造商。9·11灾难发生后，国会建立了一项行政程序，作为起诉航空公司和机场的替代方案，为受害者及其家属提供赔偿，97%的潜在索赔人获得了赔偿。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In fact, we do use mechanisms other than tort law to take care of the problems that arise from injuries. The threat of criminal prosecution discourages people from punching each other, and the federal government requires that cars have air bags, seat belts, and other safety devices. Someone who is injured in a traffic accident may have medical insurance to pay for his treatment and disability insurance to make up for his lost income; if he doesn’t, Medicaid, Social Security, and welfare payments may fill the gap. Some areas have been removed from the tort system, substantially or altogether. Workers compensation is the largest; in every state, workers who are injured in the course of their employment cannot sue their employers (with limited exceptions) but are instead covered by a state-run insurance program. Children who suffer adverse reactions to childhood vaccines can seek compensation from a federal trust fund instead of suing the manufacturer. After the September 11 disaster, Congress established an administrative procedure to compensate victims and their families as an alternative to suing the airlines and airports, and 97 percent of the potential claimants were granted compensation.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，几百年来，我们也发展了一套侵权法体系来处理伤害和不法行为。侵权法激励良好行为，遏制不良行为，要求不法行为者赔偿受害者，并服务于我们的正义感。侵权法通常有三个目的：威慑或激励、赔偿和公平。作为一种服务于这些目标并处理伤害问题的体系，侵权法制度比其他机制有三个优势。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, over several hundred years we also have developed a system of tort law to address injuries and wrongdoing. Tort law provides incentives for good conduct and disincentives for bad conduct, requires that wrongdoers compensate their victims, and serves our sense of justice. These are the three commonly stated purposes of tort law: deterrence or incentives, compensation, and fairness. As a system for serving these objectives and dealing with the problem of injury, the tort system has three advantages over other mechanisms.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>首先，侵权法允许私人主导其政策的实施。所有侵权案件均由私人或企业提起，而非由作为检察官的政府提起。（有时政府是侵权案件的一方，但其地位与其他原告或被告相同。）联邦和州政府建立了法院系统来裁决纠纷，但私人当事人则通过其申诉和辩护来推动侵权体系。此外，该体系是自筹资金的。原告律师以<em class="calibre8">胜诉收费</em>制接案，即律师预付诉讼费用，客户无需预先支付任何费用，如果胜诉，律师将获得部分赔偿，如果败诉，则一无所获。因此，侵权体系不需要大量的<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_146" class="calibre4"></a>检察官办公室或行政机构制定规则、调查不法行为并处理投诉。相反，侵权法的公共目的的追求却掌握在私人手中。例如，斯特拉·利贝克和麦当劳，而不是食品药品监督管理局或消费者产品安全委员会，主导了关于咖啡温度过高到什么程度的争论。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>First, tort law permits private persons to take the lead in implementing its policies. All torts cases are brought by private individuals or businesses, not by the government acting as the prosecutor. (Sometimes the government is a party to tort cases, but then it is in the same position as any other plaintiff or defendant.) The federal and state governments establish court systems to referee disputes, but private parties drive the tort system by their complaints and defenses. Moreover, the system is self-financing. Plaintiffs’ lawyers take cases on a <em class="calibre8">contingent fee</em> basis, under which they advance the costs of the litigation, their clients pay no fees up front, and they take a portion of the recovery if they win and nothing if they lose. Thus the tort system does not require a large <a class="calibre4"></a>prosecutor’s office or administrative bureaucracy to formulate rules, investigate wrongdoing, and pursue complaints. Instead, pursuing the public purposes of tort law is left in the hands of private persons. Stella Liebeck and McDonald’s, for example, not the Food and Drug Administration or the Consumer Products Safety Commission, drive the debate about how hot is too hot for coffee.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>其次，侵权法大多由相对概括的规则构成，例如汽车制造商必须以不包含导致不合理危险的缺陷的方式制造汽车。这一规则的具体含义在个案中得到具体化，并且可能引发激烈争议，但这并不要求法律事先详细规定汽车必须如何制造以及必须包含哪些安全装置。像美国国家公路交通安全管理局这样的监管机构现在正在做一些这方面的工作，但如果没有侵权法，他们将不得不做更多的事情。事实上，由于事故发生的方式无穷无尽，我们不可能预先规划出一个人在每一种可能的情况下必须如何行动，而侵权法的普遍性使我们能够在不必这样做的情况下评估行为。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Second, most of tort law is made up of relatively general rules, such as a rule that an auto manufacturer has to make a car in such a way that it does not contain a defect rendering it unreasonably dangerous. What that means is fleshed out in the context of individual cases and can be hotly contested, but it does not require the law to specify in advance, in tedious detail, how a car must be built and what safety devices it must contain. Regulatory agencies like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration do some of this now, but without tort law they would have to do much more. Indeed, because of the infinite ways in which accidents can occur, it would be impossible to lay out prospectively how someone must behave in every conceivable circumstance, and the generality of tort law enables us to evaluate behavior without having to do so.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第三，侵权法将威慑和赔偿政策与公平目标联系起来，要求受害者的赔偿来自不法行为人。一旦伤害发生，不法行为人应受到惩罚，受害者应得到赔偿，这似乎是理所当然的。这种同时实现两个目标的机制具有巧妙的对称性。如果不法行为人被刑事起诉，受害者仍然需要承担损失；如果受害者的账单由保险公司支付，她的损失得到了赔偿，但不法行为人却逍遥法外，无需承担责任。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Third, tort law links the deterrence and compensation policies to the objective of fairness by requiring that the compensation to the victim come from the wrongdoer. Once an injury has occurred, it seems right that the wrongdoer should be punished and the victim should be compensated. There is a neat symmetry to the mechanism that accomplishes both objectives at the same time. If the wrongdoer is criminally prosecuted, the victim still bears her loss; if the victim has her bills paid by insurance, her loss is compensated but the wrongdoer gets away without taking responsibility.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>侵权法是否真正发挥作用，是目前法律领域最具争议的议题之一。企业、医生和保险公司认为侵权法存在缺陷，纷纷打着<em class="calibre8">侵权法改革</em>的旗号，试图废除一些基本的侵权法原则，并削减许多其他原则。消费者团体和出庭律师为该体系辩护，并主张其扩展。与此同时，来自政治光谱左右两边的侵权法学者也对该体系的有效性进行了分析和辩论。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Whether tort law works as it is supposed to is currently one of the most controversial issues in the law. Businesses, doctors, and insurance companies, arguing that tort law is out of whack, have joined under the banner of <em class="calibre8">tort reform</em> to do away with some basic tort doctrines and cut back on many others. Consumer groups and trial lawyers have defended the system and argued for its expansion. Meanwhile, tort scholars from the left and right sides of the political spectrum have analyzed and debated the effectiveness of the system.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>侵权法改革者认为，法院在执行侵权法的赔偿政策方面做得过头了，忽视了公平原则及其裁决的现实后果。他们断言，法院在制定侵权法规则和个案中安排陪审团时，越来越倾向于赔偿受害人。在追随这种冲动的过程中，他们忘记了在追究责任之前必须证明被告有过错。法官们制定了严格责任规则。<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_147" class="calibre4"></a>在将受害人的损失转移给被告之前，无需认定其过错。同样，当陪审团面对的是重伤人员，而被告是一家大公司或一位富有且拥有充足保险的医生时，他们往往不会听取被告对其行为合理性的解释，而是寻求财力雄厚的赔偿机构来承担受害人的损失。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Tort reformers argue that the courts have gone overboard in serving the compensation policy of tort law and have lost sight of fairness and of the real-world consequences of their rulings. Increasingly, they assert, the overwhelming impulse of courts in making tort rules and juries in individual cases is to compensate the injured victim. In following this impulse, they have forgotten the need to prove the defendant was at fault before imposing liability. Judges have created rules of strict liability <a class="calibre4"></a>that do not require a finding of fault before shifting the victim’s losses to the defendant. Similarly, juries faced with a seriously injured individual and a defendant who is a large corporation or a wealthy, well-insured doctor are not inclined to listen to explanations of the reasonableness of the defendant’s conduct in their search for a deep pocket to pay the victim’s losses.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这些行为的后果是，侵权责任制度过于繁重，而且侵权责任的威胁始终存在。这给产品和活动征收了“侵权税”，抬高了许多商品和服务的成本，并将其他商品和服务彻底从市场上剔除。汽车、电动工具和梯子的价格上涨，是因为制造商被迫添加不必要的安全装置或警示。医生必须采取防御性医疗措施，开具额外的检查，从而推高医疗成本，否则他们就会彻底放弃产科等高风险专业。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The consequence of these actions is a system of too much tort liability and the ever-present threat of even more. This imposes a “tort tax” on products and activities that raises the cost of many goods and services and removes others from the market altogether. A car, a power tool, and a ladder cost more because manufacturers are forced to include unnecessary safety devices or warnings. Physicians must practice defensive medicine by ordering additional tests that drive up the cost of health care, or they leave high-risk specialties such as obstetrics altogether.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>侵权法改革者还认为，侵权责任的扩张削弱了个人责任。由于法院拒绝执行限制或免除侵权责任的协议，消费者无法选择他们愿意支付的安全保障水平。更广泛地说，责任的增加导致了这样一个社会：人们不再认为自己应对自己的行为负责，而是为自己的行为寻找借口，并让别人为他们的损失买单。在这个“起诉他们”的社会里，没有人需要再承担自己行为的后果。为了应对这些问题，侵权法改革者已经成功地实施了一些改革，并提出了更多改革方案。他们表示，目标是通过增加伤害受害者诉诸法庭的难度、增加他们即使诉诸法庭也更难胜诉的难度以及增加他们即使胜诉也更难获得巨额赔偿的难度，来恢复体系的平衡。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Tort reformers also argue that the expansion of tort liability undermines personal responsibility. Because courts refuse to enforce agreements limiting or disclaiming tort liability, consumers are unable to exercise choice as to the level of safety they are willing to pay for. More broadly, the increase in liability has contributed to a society in which people do not feel responsible for their own actions and all look for an excuse for their behavior and someone else to pay for their losses. In the “sue ‘em” society, no one has to bear the consequences of his or her acts anymore. In response to these problems, tort reformers have succeeded in enacting some changes and have proposed even more. The goal, they say, is to restore balance to the system by making it harder for injury victims to get to court, harder to win if they get there, and harder to collect large damages if they do win.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>侵权法制度的捍卫者不同意侵权法改革的诊断和补救措施。他们指出，该制度在改善美国人民的安全方面取得了巨大成功。侵权法在从医疗事故到缺陷产品制造等领域，都对安全激励发挥了显著作用。例如，侵权责任的前景鼓励制造商研究其产品的潜在危险，并开发更安全的产品。许多危险产品要么被撤出市场，要么被限制使用，要么得到改进——例如达康盾牌宫内节育器、石棉、不阻燃的童装以及不耐撞的汽车。对于许多人身伤害的受害者来说，侵权法是唯一的赔偿来源。虽然侵权法改革者不断重复那些备受瞩目的恐怖故事（其中只有一部分是准确报道的），但侵权法成功的更广泛故事却很少被提及。<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_148" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Defenders of the tort system disagree with the tort reform diagnosis and remedy. They point out that the system has been a great success in improving the safety of the American people. Tort law has had a significant effect in providing incentives for safety, in areas from medical malpractice to the manufacture of defective products. The prospect of tort liability, for example, encourages manufacturers to research the potential dangers of their products and to develop safer products. Many dangerous products either have been taken off the market, restricted in use, or improved—examples include the Dalkon Shield IUD contraceptive device, asbestos, children’s clothing that is not flame-retardant, and cars that are not crashworthy. For many victims of personal injury, tort law provides the only source of compensation. While tort reformers repeat high-profile horror stories (only some of which are accurately reported), the broader story of the success of tort law has been less frequently told.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这一成功并非在陪审团失控的情况下取得的。在绝大多数案件中，普通陪审团都认同专业法官对案件结果的判断，而不会简单地寻求财力雄厚的法官来弥补原告的损失。而个人责任问题是一个复杂的问题；要让原告承担其行为的责任，通常只有通过让被告不承担其行为的责任才能实现。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This success has been accomplished without juries going wild. In the overwhelming majority of cases, lay juries agree with professional judges about the outcome of cases and do not simply hunt for a deep pocket to pay for the plaintiff’s loss. And the issue of personal responsibility is a complicated one; making the plaintiff assume liability for her conduct is often achieved only by letting the defendant not bear responsibility for his.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这些问题很难解决，本章将探讨侵权法的实体规则，并进行更深入的讨论。我们先来看两个故事，开启这一进程。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These are difficult issues to resolve, and they will be discussed more as the chapter explores the substantive rules of tort law. But let’s take a look at two stories to get started on the process.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>彼得·贝尔教授讲述了一则轶事，从侧面展现了侵权法如何影响企业。他讲述了自己在尼亚加拉大瀑布游览时，看到一堆木制台阶、平台和桥梁，游客可以直接步行到瀑布。当他的女儿问：“爸爸，下面安全吗？”时，他有两种矛盾的反应：一方面，这些结构似乎太脆弱了；另一方面，它肯定是安全的。他相信瀑布是安全的，并非基于某个政府机构可能已经检查过这些台阶，也不是基于他相信瀑布的所有者会仔细检查，因为这是正确的做法，或者符合他们的商业利益。相反，贝尔说：“我之所以认为瀑布是安全的，是因为我知道，旅游运营商知道，如果他们不确保瀑布安全，就会被起诉。”</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Professor Peter Bell relates an anecdote that gives a perspective on how businesses are affected by the presence of tort law. He tells of visiting Niagara Falls and coming upon a cluster of wooden steps, platforms, and bridges that allowed tourists to walk right down to the falls. When his daughter asked, “Daddy, is it safe down there?” he had two conflicting reactions: On the one hand, the structure seemed too fragile, but on the other hand, it had to be safe. His belief that it was safe did not rest on the likelihood that some government agency had inspected the steps, nor on the confidence that the owners would check them carefully because it was the right thing to do or would serve their business interests. Instead, Bell reports, “What made me think the structure was safe was my knowledge that the operators of the tour were aware that if they did not make damn sure the thing was safe, they would get their pants sued off.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>其次，想想药品安全问题。制药商通常试图生产安全的药品，因为这是负责任的做法，也因为这是好的生意。但他们做生意是为了盈利，而这个目标会给他们带来压力，即使药品的安全性存在疑问，他们也要将药品投放或留在市场上。消费者的下一道防线是食品药品管理局 (FDA)，该机构负责批准新药，要求警告潜在风险，并在发现更大风险时下令将产品撤出市场。但 FDA 的流程存在重大漏洞。在最好的情况下，FDA 依赖于来自制药公司的信息，无法充分评估每种产品的风险。在最坏的情况下，正如法学教授和侵权法专家卡尔·博格斯 (Carl Bogus) 所写，像 FDA 这样的监管机构可能会“被控制、耗尽、围攻、僵化、士气低落、被收买和饿死”，受到其本应监管的公司的政治影响和控制。甚至 FDA 官员也承认存在问题； FDA药品安全办公室副主任戴维·格雷厄姆博士断言，FDA“无力保护美国”。当企业自身的激励机制或FDA监管失效时，侵权法就会介入填补这一空白。侵权法并不提供<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_149" class="calibre4"></a>然而，答案并不简单。决定制造商是否应该对生产危险药物承担责任，需要平衡受该药物危害的人和受益人之间的差距，并评估制造商对药物危害的了解程度、何时知道以及应该采取的措施。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Second, think about the problem of drug safety. Pharmaceutical manufacturers generally try to make safe drugs, because that is the responsible thing to do and because it is good business. But they are in business to make a profit, and that goal creates pressure to put or keep a drug on the market even if there are questions about its safety. The consumer’s next line of defense is the Food and Drug Administration, which approves new drugs, requires warnings of potential risks, and orders products taken off the market when greater risks become known. But there are major gaps in the FDA process. At its best, the FDA relies on information from drug companies and cannot adequately evaluate every product risk. At its worst, as law professor and torts expert Carl Bogus wrote, a regulatory agency such as the FDA can be “captured, exhausted, besieged, ossified, demoralized, co-opted, and starved,” subject to political influence and control by the companies it is meant to regulate. Even FDA officials concede the problem; Dr. David Graham, associate director of the FDA’s Office of Drug Safety, asserted that the FDA “is incapable of protecting America.” When companies’ own incentives or FDA regulation fail, tort law steps in to fill the gap. Tort law does not provide <a class="calibre4"></a>easy answers, however. Deciding whether a manufacturer should be liable for making a dangerous drug involves balancing between those who are harmed by the drug and those who are benefited by it and evaluating what the manufacturer knew about the dangers, when it knew it, and what it should have done.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0011_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-5-div1-4"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0036" class="calibre1">打人算侵权吗？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0036" class="calibre1">Is it a Tort When You Hit Someone?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">侵权法分为三类：故意侵权、过失侵权和严格责任。<em class="calibre8">故意侵权</em>是指造成损害的人故意造成的。<em class="calibre8">过失侵权</em>是指疏忽造成的损害。<em class="calibre8">严格责任则</em>要求行为人承担责任，即使他并非有意伤害受害人，并且在努力避免损害时已尽到谨慎义务。其中，最容易理解的是故意侵权，其典型侵权行为是<em class="calibre8">殴打</em>。</p><p class="noindent">Tort law is divided into three categories: intentional torts, negligence, and strict liability. An <em class="calibre8">intentional tort</em> is when the person causing the harm meant to do so. <em class="calibre8">Negligence</em> involves carelessness. <em class="calibre8">Strict liability</em> holds the actor responsible even though he did not mean to harm the victim and exercised care in trying to avoid the harm. Of these, the easiest category to understand is intentional torts, where the prototypical tort is known as <em class="calibre8">battery</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>当比夫猛击乔治的鼻子、将他推下楼梯，或得意洋洋地用车碾压他时，这都构成了故意殴打侵权行为。殴打行为保护一个人的身体不受故意侵害。为殴打行为提供救济符合侵权法的原则。我们希望阻止比夫和像他这样的人殴打他人，如果乔治因为受伤不得不去看医生，比夫赔偿他的损失是公平的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When Biff punches George in the nose, pushes him down a flight of stairs, or gleefully runs him over with his car, it constitutes the intentional tort of battery. Battery protects the integrity of a person’s body against intentional invasions. Providing a remedy for battery serves the policies of tort law. We want to deter Biff and people like him from punching others, and if George has to go to the doctor because of his injuries, it is fair that Biff compensate him for his loss.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>很简单。但当然，法律很少如此简单。故意侵权行为是错误的，因为侵权人有意伤害受害人。（“<em class="calibre8">侵权人</em>”是一个优雅的法律术语，指的是实施侵权行为的人；如果你愿意，也可以用“过错者”代替。）但“故意伤害”是什么意思？需要造成什么样的伤害？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Simple enough. But of course, the law is seldom that simple. Intentional torts are wrongful because the tortfeasor intended to cause harm to the victim. (<em class="calibre8">Tortfeasor</em> is an elegant legal term for someone who commits a tort; substitute “wrongdoer” if you like.) But what does it mean to intend harm? And what kind of harm is required?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>以华盛顿州最高法院1955年的加拉特诉戴利案<em class="calibre8">（Garratt v. Dailey</em>）为例。五岁男孩布莱恩·戴利（Brian Dailey）正在老妇人露丝·加拉特（Ruth Garratt）的后院做客。布莱恩搬动了露丝原本想坐的一把草坪椅。当她试图坐下时，没有注意到椅子已经不见了，摔倒在地，髋部骨折。事件的具体经过存在争议。露丝声称，布莱恩在她准备坐下时故意将椅子从她身下抽走。初审法院发现，布莱恩拿起椅子，将其移动了几英尺，然后坐了下来。当他发现露丝即将坐在椅子原来的位置时，他急忙站起来，试图将椅子放回原位，但没能及时阻止露丝摔倒。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Consider the case of <em class="calibre8">Garratt v. Dailey</em> (1955) from the Washington Supreme Court. Brian Dailey, a five-year-old boy, was visiting in the backyard of Ruth Garratt, an older woman. Brian moved a lawn chair that Ruth intended to sit in. When she tried to sit down, not noticing that the chair was no longer there, she fell to the ground and fractured her hip. The precise chain of events was in dispute. Ruth alleged that Brian deliberately pulled the chair out from under her as she started to sit down in it. The trial court found that Brian had picked up the chair, moved it a few feet, and sat down. When he discovered that Ruth was about to sit in the place where the chair had been, he hurriedly got up and tried to put the chair back, but he was not in time to prevent Ruth’s fall.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>先以露丝的说法为例。如果布莱恩作证说他并非有意伤害露丝，只是想看着她倒在地上很有趣，那么他是否有足够的故意让他承担责任？<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_150" class="calibre4"></a>殴打？用日常用语来说，布莱恩并非“故意”造成最终发生的伤害——髋骨骨折。他并非有意为之，但从法律角度来看，他仍然故意造成非法接触（导致露丝摔倒），这足以构成殴打。如果他真的想造成这种接触，那么他的动机——他想要造成什么样的伤害——就无关紧要了。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Take Ruth’s version of the events first. If Brian testifies that he didn’t mean to hurt Ruth but only thought it would be funny to see her fall to the ground, does he have sufficient intent to make him liable for a <a class="calibre4"></a>battery? In everyday language, Brian did not “intend” to cause the harm that ultimately occurred—a broken hip. He didn’t mean for it to happen, but from the law’s viewpoint, he still intended to cause an unlawful contact (having Ruth fall) that is sufficient for a battery. His motive—what kind of harm he intended to accomplish—is irrelevant if he wanted to bring about the contact.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>现在来看法院对事件的解释。在本案中，布莱恩甚至并非有意让露丝摔倒，但他仍然可能承担责任。根据法律，一个人要么故意造成伤害，要么在行为上<em class="calibre8">相当确定</em>伤害会发生，否则即构成殴打罪。如果布莱恩确切地（相当确定地）知道露丝会试图坐在椅子所在的地方——例如，因为她刚刚端来一盘食物，放在椅子前的野餐桌上——那么故意要件就满足了。我们希望既要劝阻相当确定会造成伤害的行为，也要劝阻有意造成伤害的行为，并希望对受害者给予同等程度的赔偿；就像布莱恩和受伤的露丝·加拉特之间一样，他（或他的父母）承担露丝受伤的费用比她自己承担更公平。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now take the court’s version of the events. Here Brian did not even intend that Ruth fall, but he still might be liable. Under the law, a person commits a battery either by intending to cause the harm or by acting with <em class="calibre8">substantial certainty</em> that the harm will occur. If Brian knew for sure (with substantial certainty) that Ruth would attempt to sit down where the chair had been—because she just brought over a plate of food and put it down on a picnic table in front of the chair, for example—the intent requirement is satisfied. We want to discourage conduct that is substantially certain to cause harm as much as conduct that is intended to cause harm, and we want to compensate the victims of that harm to the same extent; as between Brian and the injured Ruth Garratt, it is fairer that he (or his parents) should bear the cost of her injury than that she should.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>伤害的概念与故意的概念一样广泛。当某人故意造成<em class="calibre8">伤害性或冒犯性接触</em>时，即构成殴打。摔伤导致髋骨骨折或被拳打流鼻血是常见的伤害性接触案例，但并不需要达到那样严重的伤害程度。轻微的瘀伤或割伤就足够了。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The concept of harm is as broad as the concept of intent. A battery is committed when someone intentionally causes <em class="calibre8">harmful or offensive contact</em>. A broken hip from a fall or a bloody nose from a punch are easy cases of harmful contact, but severe injury like that is not required. A slight bruise or cut is more than enough.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>殴打责任的真正扩展来自于攻击性接触的概念。如果露丝倒地并且根本没有受伤，布莱恩仍然犯了殴打罪，因为这种接触侵犯了她的尊严。当法律将攻击性接触的概念与唯一需要的意图就是有意造成这种接触的想法结合起来时，就产生了一个扩张的殴打概念。从明显的一拳打在鼻子上的案例开始，法律不可避免地转向判断所有类型接触的适当性。如果乔给了玛丽亚一个不情愿的吻作为爱的表示，这可以被称为殴打。事实上，身体完整性的概念是如此强大，以至于即使乔在玛丽亚睡着并且没有意识到这个吻的时候亲吻了她，他也犯了殴打罪。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The real expansion of liability for battery comes from the concept of offensive contact. If Ruth falls to the ground and is not injured at all, Brian still has committed a battery because the contact offends her dignity. When the law combines the concept of offensive contact with the idea that the only intent required is the intent to cause such a contact, it produces an expansive conception of battery. From the obvious case of a punch in the nose the law inevitably moves to making judgments about the appropriateness of all kinds of contact. If Joe gives Maria an unwanted kiss as a sign of affection, it can be called battery. Indeed, the conception of bodily integrity is so strong that Joe commits a battery even if he kisses Maria while she is asleep and unaware of the kiss.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，并非所有故意造成伤害或冒犯的接触都构成殴打。如果受害者同意这种接触——例如玛丽亚同意亲吻——那就不构成殴打。这从侵权法的目标来看是有道理的。当当事人同意这种接触时，我们并没有同样的利益去阻止这种伤害或冒犯性的接触；实际上，他已经放弃了获得赔偿的权利。如果某人只是在做他人同意的事情，那么强加责任也是不公平的。<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_151" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Not every intentionally harmful or offensive contact is battery, however. If the victim consents to the contact—if Maria consents to the kiss—it is not battery. This makes sense in light of the goals of tort law. We do not have the same interest in deterring harmful or offensive contact when the person agrees to the contact; he has, in effect, forfeited his right of compensation. Nor would it be fair to impose liability on someone who is only doing what another person has agreed to.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，如果某人同意某种身体侵犯，他并不一定同意任何其他身体侵犯。职业橄榄球运动员同意在比赛过程中被击打，但他们并不一定同意任何暴力行为。当丹佛野马队的布比·克拉克在比赛结束后用前臂击打了辛辛那提猛虎队的戴尔·哈克巴特的后脑勺（当时哈克巴特正跪在地上），他的行为可能远远超出了体育运动的范畴，构成了侵权行为（<em class="calibre8">哈克巴特诉辛辛那提猛虎公司案</em>，1979）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If someone consents to a certain bodily invasion, he does not necessarily consent to any bodily invasion, however. Professional football players consent to be hit in the course of a game, but they do not necessarily consent to any act of violence. When Booby Clark of the Denver Broncos gave Dale Hackbart of the Cincinnati Bengals a forearm to the back of the head while Hackbart was kneeling on the ground after a play was over, he may have acted so far outside the scope of the sport that he committed a tort (<em class="calibre8">Hackbart v. Cincinnati Bengals, Inc</em>., 1979).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如何确定是否表现出同意？无需口头表示同意，否则将会构成殴打。行动胜于雄辩。通过踏上球场，足球运动员默认同意被殴打。但默认同意可能难以确定，这个问题出现在涉及涉嫌同意性接触的案件中，就像在强奸刑法中一样。同意可以通过行为（包括默许）以及言语表现出来。当对同意的存在和范围存在不同看法时，就会出现难题。当女性没有对男性的性挑逗进行身体反抗时，她真的同意了吗？在这些案件中，法院必须通过选择男性和女性对事件的解释来定义什么构成性情况下的合理行为。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>How is it determined whether consent has been manifested? Express verbal consent to what would otherwise be a battery is not required. Actions speak louder than words. By stepping onto the field, a football player implicitly consents to being hit. But implicit consent can be difficult to determine, an issue that arises in cases involving alleged consent to sexual contact, just as it does in the criminal law of rape. Consent can be manifested by conduct, including acquiescence, as well as by words. The difficult issues arise when there is a clash of perceptions about the presence and scope of consent. When a woman doesn’t physically resist a man’s sexual advances, is she really consenting? In these cases, the court must define what constitutes reasonable conduct in sexual situations by choosing between a man’s and a woman’s interpretation of events.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>来自体育和性行为场景的假设，揭示了诸如殴打之类的故意侵权行为的其他一些问题。这些问题加深了我们对侵权法本质的理解，但在实践中，殴打侵权行为的使用并不多。受伤的运动员或遭受非自愿性行为的受害者很少对加害者提起民事诉讼。通常情况下，诉讼金额不足以使其值得。即使有可能获得赔偿，受害者也可能出于其他原因不愿卷入诉讼，例如诉讼的旷日持久和情感上的创伤。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The hypotheticals from sports and sexual situations suggest something else about intentional torts such as battery. These issues sharpen our understanding of the nature of tort law, but in practical terms, the tort of battery is not used very much. Not many injured athletes or victims of unwanted sexual conduct bring civil suits against their injurers. Usually, not enough money is at stake to make it worthwhile. Even when there is the potential for recovery, the victim may not want to get involved in litigation for other reasons, such as its protracted nature and emotional toll.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>其他故意侵权行为更为常见。最常见的诉讼类型之一是非法监禁。这种侵权行为保护一个人的行动自由，就像殴打保护一个人的人身自由一样。将某人强行锁在房间里是典型的非法监禁，威胁她离开未上锁的房间就会伤害她也是非法监禁。此类行为应该受到制止，期望受害者冒着人身伤害的风险来抵抗可信的威胁是不合理的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Other intentional torts are used more often. One of the most commonly litigated is false imprisonment. This tort protects a person’s freedom from movement in the same way that battery protects freedom from bodily invasion. Locking someone in a room against her will is a classic case of false imprisonment, as is threatening to injure her if she leaves an unlocked room. Conduct like that should be deterred, and it is unreasonable to expect the victim to risk bodily harm in resisting a credible threat.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>许多有趣的非法监禁案件都是因为顾客在商店因涉嫌盗窃而被拘留。例如， 1971年科布林诉<em class="calibre8">肯尼迪公司案（Coblyn v. Kennedy's, Inc.</em>）。七十岁的马里乌斯·科布林（Marius Coblyn）在波士顿的肯尼迪商店购物。在试穿一件运动外套时，他脱下了自己佩戴的领巾，并将其放入口袋。之后<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_152" class="calibre4"></a>他买了一件运动外套，准备修改，就在离开商店前，他突然停下脚步，从口袋里掏出围巾，系在脖子上打了个结。他刚走出店门，被告人戈斯（商店员工）就冲他冲过来，说道：“住手。你从哪儿弄来的围巾？”戈斯抓住他的胳膊说：“你最好回去见经理。”周围站着八九个人，盯着科布林，科布林同意再去。他和戈斯上到商店二楼时，由于胸背疼痛，他停了两次。到达二楼后，卖给他外套的销售员认出了他，确认他买的是一件运动外套，围巾是他的。由于此事引发的情绪波动，科布林因心脏病住院治疗。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Many interesting false imprisonment cases arise when a customer in a store is detained under suspicion of shoplifting. Consider <em class="calibre8">Coblyn v. Kennedy’s, Inc</em>. (1971). Marius Coblyn, a seventy-year-old man, went shopping at Kennedy’s, a store in Boston. While trying on a sport coat, he removed the ascot he was wearing and placed it in his pocket. After <a class="calibre4"></a>purchasing the sport coat and leaving it for alterations, and just prior to exiting the store, he stopped, took the ascot out of his pocket, put it around his neck, and knotted it. Just as he stepped out of the door, the defendant Goss, a store employee, confronted him and said, “Stop. Where did you get that scarf?” Goss then grabbed his arm and said, “You better go back and see the manager.” Eight or ten other people were standing around and were staring at Coblyn, who agreed to return. As he and Goss went upstairs to the second floor of the store, he paused twice because of chest and back pains. After reaching the second floor, the salesman from whom he had purchased the coat recognized him and confirmed that he had purchased a sport coat and that the ascot belonged to him. As a result of the emotional upset caused by the incident, Coblyn was hospitalized and treated for a heart problem.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>科布林成功控告戈斯非法监禁。即使科布林自愿返回商店，戈斯的行为也足以构成侵权行为，而无需被告强制受害者留在商店。马萨诸塞州与许多州一样，也拥有<em class="calibre8">店主特权</em>法，根据该法，如果有充分理由相信顾客偷窃了物品，店主可以以合理的方式拘留顾客一段合理的时间。在科布林一案中，拘留时间虽然相当短，但方式并不合理；戈斯未能表明自己是商店员工，并且毫无必要地抓住了一位没有表现出任何反抗意愿或能力的老人的手臂。此外，戈斯拘留科布林没有合理的理由；仅仅在他离开商店时停下来戴上领巾，不足以作为证据让一个理性的人得出结论，认为他偷了东西。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Coblyn successfully sued for false imprisonment. Even though Coblyn voluntarily returned to the store, Goss’s actions were sufficient for the tort, which does not require that the defendant physically compel the victim to remain. Massachusetts, like many states, has a <em class="calibre8">shopkeeper’s privilege</em> statute under which a store owner may detain a customer in a reasonable manner for a reasonable length of time if there are adequate grounds to believe that the customer has stolen something. The detention in Coblyn’s case was reasonably brief, but it was not in a reasonable manner; Goss failed to identify himself as a store employee and unnecessarily grabbed the arm of an elderly man who showed no desire or ability to resist. Moreover, Goss had no reasonable grounds for detaining Coblyn; merely stopping and putting on his ascot as he left the store is insufficient evidence from which the reasonable person would conclude that he had stolen it.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0011_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-5-div1-5"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0037" class="calibre1">不小心把人弄伤了，这算是侵权行为吗？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0037" class="calibre1">Is it a Tort When You Injure Someone by Not Being Careful?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">虽然诸如殴打和非法监禁等故意侵权行为历史最为悠久，也最容易被视为不法行为，但最常见的侵权行为是因疏忽而非故意造成的伤害。侵权法的这一领域被称为<em class="calibre8">过失</em>。当我们说某人疏忽时，我们的意思是他们因未采取合理谨慎的行动而伤害了他人。例如，一名司机因疏忽而使用手机通话，注意力从路况上分散，从而导致了事故。一名医生因未根据患者的症状安排检查，而误诊了患者的病情，因此也存在疏忽。</p><p class="noindent">Although intentional torts such as battery and false imprisonment have the longest heritage and are the easiest to see as wrongful, the most common torts involve harm caused by carelessness, not intentional harm. This area of tort law is called <em class="calibre8">negligence</em>. When we say that someone has been negligent, we mean that they have injured someone by failing to act with reasonable care. For example, a driver is negligent in talking on his cell phone and letting his attention drift from the road, causing an accident. A physician is negligent in misdiagnosing a patient’s illness because she fails to order tests that are indicated by the patient’s symptoms.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>过失侵权行为与殴打等故意侵权行为一样容易理解。被告的行为不法，并非故意造成伤害，而是在行为中未充分考虑被侵权人的利益。<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_153" class="calibre4"></a>他人的。我们希望阻止这种行为，并鼓励人们谨慎行事。受害人已经遭受了损失，而造成损害的粗心侵权人应该承担损失，这似乎是公平的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The tort of negligence is about as easy to understand as intentional torts such as battery. The defendant has acted wrongfully, not in meaning to cause harm but in acting without sufficient concern for the interests <a class="calibre4"></a>of others. We want to discourage that behavior and to encourage people to act carefully. The injured victim has suffered a loss, and it seems fair that the careless tortfeasor who caused the harm should bear the burden of that loss.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，过失责任比故意侵权责任范围要窄。故意侵权者的行为缺乏正当理由；在未经同意或自卫的情况下殴打他人，没有任何法律上正当的理由。但过失行为中的被告正在进行一项活动——例如驾驶汽车——这项活动基本上是可以接受的，甚至是有用的。我们只是想确保她以合理的方式进行这项活动——并非完美，但合理——因此，只有违反交通规则才会被追究责任，这种违反是比喻意义上的，有时是字面意义上的。当然，在法律规则中使用“合理”这样的词语会引发无休止的争议，而过失法的大部分内容都与制定标准和设计赋予该术语内容的程序有关。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Liability for negligence is narrower than liability for intentional torts, however. Someone committing an intentional tort acts without justification; there is no legally justifiable reason to punch somebody in the absence of consent or self-defense. But the defendant in a negligence action is performing an activity—such as driving a car—that is basically acceptable and even useful. We just want to make sure that she performs the activity reasonably—not perfectly, but reasonably—so liability is imposed only for violating the rules of the road, figuratively and sometimes literally. Of course, putting a word like “reasonable” in a legal rule invites endless controversy, and much of the law of negligence is concerned with setting standards and devising a process to give content to the term.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>过失的核心理念是，人们在行动时应合理谨慎，并考虑到其可能预见地对他人造成的潜在损害。然而，这只是一个理念，而非规则，其本身就包含足够的模糊性（“合理”、“可预见”），因此法院在确定何时存在义务时拥有很大的灵活性。一个日常例子可以阐明这一核心理念。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The core idea of negligence is that people should exercise reasonable care when they act by taking account of the potential harm that they might foreseeably cause to other people. It is only an idea and not a rule, though, with sufficient vagueness built in (“reasonable,” “foreseeably”) so that the courts have great flexibility in determining when a duty exists. An everyday example illustrates the core idea.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>我们都同意，驾驶员有责任采取合理谨慎的措施，避免伤害行人和其他驾驶员，因为危险行为与受害者的潜在伤害之间存在直接联系。如果驾驶员在打电话时注意力不集中，可以预见他会撞到行人。如果撞到行人，行人可能会受到重伤，这将导致医疗和住院费用、工资损失以及巨大的痛苦。由于伤害是由于驾驶员的疏忽造成的，因此将这些费用的负担从行人转移到驾驶员身上是公平的。在这种情况下以及其他情况下，驾驶员都有义务小心驾驶，避免伤害行人。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We all would agree that a driver has a duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid injuring pedestrians and other drivers because there is a direct relationship between the dangerous conduct and the potential harm to the victim. If a driver is talking on a cell phone and not paying attention, it is foreseeable that he will hit a pedestrian. If he does, the pedestrian may suffer serious injuries that will result in doctor and hospital bills, lost wages, and considerable pain. Because the injuries were caused by the driver’s carelessness, it is fair that the burden of those costs should be shifted from the pedestrian to the driver. In this and other situations, motorists are under a duty to drive carefully to avoid injuring pedestrians.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在其他情况下，是否应该履行合理谨慎义务则更具争议。合理谨慎义务的核心理念存在许多传统例外。每一种例外都需要判断，如果某人行为疏忽，是否应该让他人承担责任是合理的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In other cases, whether there should be a duty to exercise reasonable care is more controversial. There are a number of traditional exceptions to the core idea of a duty of reasonable care. Each requires a judgment about whether it is good policy to make someone liable to someone else if they act carelessly.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>首先，某些类型的不法行为者完全免于承担责任（通常是所有侵权行为，而不仅仅是疏忽）。历史上，豁免范围非常广泛：配偶之间不能互相起诉，子女不能起诉父母，慈善机构也不能被……<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_154" class="calibre4"></a>受益于他们的善举，政府也享有诉讼豁免权——国王不会做错事。在二十世纪，豁免权急剧下降，如今大致分为两类。对于联邦政府和大多数州来说，政府豁免权仅被部分废除。法律规定了政府何时以及因何原因可以被起诉。例如，一项常见的例外情况是自由裁量权；当政府执行只有政府才能做的事情，例如决定在街上部署多少警察时，它不能因在决策过程中疏忽而被起诉。此外，针对特定类别被告的豁免权和准豁免权已成为侵权法改革议程的主要内容。杜邦公司因向一家生产用于治疗颞下颌关节疾病（这种疾病经常导致下颌骨折并引起免疫反应）的植入物制造商出售特氟龙而被起诉后，杜邦公司和其他制造商成功地向国会请愿，要求为医疗器械原材料供应商提供特殊保护。同样，在针对麦当劳提起备受瞩目的诉讼之后，游说者说服立法机构免除餐馆和其他食品公司因导致全国肥胖症流行而受到的诉讼。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>First, some classes of wrongdoers are simply immune from liability altogether (often from all torts, not just negligence). Historically the list of immunities was very broad: Spouses could not sue each other, nor could children sue their parents, charities could not be sued by the <a class="calibre4"></a>beneficiaries of their good works, and the government was immune from suit as well—the king could do no wrong. Immunities declined dramatically through the course of the twentieth century, and today they generally remain in two rough categories. For the federal government and most states, governmental immunity has been abrogated only in part. Statutes define when and for what the government may be sued. For example, a common exclusion is for a discretionary function; when the government does what only a government does, such as decide how many police to put on the street, it cannot be sued for acting negligently in making the decision. Otherwise, immunities and near immunities for particular classes of defendants have become a staple of the tort reform agenda. After DuPont was sued for selling Teflon to the manufacturer of implants designed to cure temporomandibular joint disorders, which often fractured in the jaw and caused immune reactions, it and other manufacturers successfully petitioned Congress to establish special protections for suppliers of raw materials used in medical devices. Similarly, after high-profile suits were filed against McDonald’s, lobbyists persuaded legislatures to immunize restaurants and other food companies from suits claiming they contributed to the national epidemic of obesity.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>其次，防止经济损害的义务比防止人身损害的义务要有限得多。如果一名司机因疏忽大意导致事故，堵塞了通往纽约的林肯隧道，许多人将上班迟到并被扣工资，一些销售代表将错过预约并无法完成重要交易，而曼哈顿那些向通勤者出售咖啡和甜甜圈的咖啡店也将失去生意。司机显然对事故中任何身体受伤的人负有注意义务，但她是否也对所有因同样的疏忽行为而仅遭受经济损失的人承担责任？通常不需要，因为即使发生的损害很容易预见，但潜在责任的范围却太大。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Second, the duty to prevent economic harm is much more limited than the duty to prevent physical harm. If a driver carelessly causes an accident that blocks the Lincoln Tunnel leading into New York, many people will be late for work and have their wages docked, some sales representatives will miss appointments and fail to close important deals, and the coffee shops in Manhattan that sell coffee and donuts to arriving commuters will lose business. The driver clearly has a duty of care to anyone physically injured in the accident, but is she also liable to all these people who suffer only economic injury because of the same act of carelessness? Generally not, because even though the harm that occurs is easily foreseeable, the scope of the potential liability is too great.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，在某些情况下，企业有义务防止经济损失。其中一类重要的案件涉及重大环境灾难。当Transocean公司拥有并租赁给BP公司的<em class="calibre8">“深水地平线”</em>钻井平台发生爆炸，导致井喷，数百万加仑的石油泄漏到墨西哥湾沿岸时，一些海岸业主的财产在石油冲上岸时遭受了实际损害。然而，更多的人在没有实际损害的情况下遭受了经济损失。渔民无法捕鱼，船舶租赁公司无法将船只出租给游客，驾车者支付了更高的汽油价格，等等。法院必须进行艰难的界定，以确定BP和Transocean对哪一方负有注意义务。<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_155" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In some cases, however, there is a duty to prevent economic harm. One important class of cases involves large environmental disasters. When the <em class="calibre8">Deepwater Horizon</em> oil drilling rig owned by Transocean and leased to BP suffered an explosion that caused a blowout and spilled millions of gallons of oil off the Gulf Coast, some shore property owners suffered physical damage to their property when the oil washed ashore. Many more people suffered economic harm without physical damage, though. Fishermen couldn’t fish, boat rental agencies couldn’t rent their boats to tourists, motorists paid higher gasoline prices, and so on. Courts have to engage in tough line-drawing issues to determine to which of these parties BP and Transocean owed a duty of care.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第三个限制是，保护孩子免受精神伤害的义务不如保护身体伤害的义务那么广泛。一位母亲得知孩子被车撞死后，情绪剧烈波动，失眠、溃疡发作、头痛欲裂。司机是否应对母亲的痛苦承担责任？（也就是说，司机是否对母亲负有责任？）在一系列案件中，法院已判处造成精神伤害的责任，但他们也面临着如何界定界限的难题。母亲在事故发生时站在孩子身边、在街对面，还是事后才得知事故，这些因素是否重要？一些法院认为，只有当母亲身处可能遭受身体伤害<em class="calibre8">的危险区域</em>时，她才能获得赔偿；另一些法院则允许母亲因目睹事故发生而获得赔偿，但如果她事后才得知事故，则不予赔偿。如果母亲为孩子感到悲伤，但没有出现身体症状，该怎么办？如果原告是孩子的祖母、姑姑或挚友，该怎么办？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A third limitation is that the duty to protect against emotional harm is less extensive than the duty to protect against physical injury. Upon hearing that her child has been run over by a car and killed, a mother suffers a severe emotional reaction that causes her to lose sleep, develop an ulcer, and have painful headaches. Is the driver liable to the mother for her suffering? (That is, did the driver owe a duty to the mother?) In a series of cases, courts have imposed liability for causing emotional harm, but they have also faced the difficulty of determining where to draw the line. Does it matter if the mother is standing next to the child when the accident occurs, is across the street, or only hears about it later? Some courts hold that the mother can recover only if she is in the <em class="calibre8">zone of danger</em> within which she could have been physically injured as well; others allow her to recover for observing the accident at the time it happens but not if she hears about it subsequently. What if the mother grieves for her child but has no physical symptoms? What if the plaintiff is the child’s grandmother? Aunt? Best friend?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最后，对于一般合理注意义务而言，最令人匪夷所思的例外情况是：一个人没有义务采取积极行动来防止他人遭受伤害。例如，假设一个男人坐在公园里吃午饭，眼睁睁地看着一个无人看管的幼儿爬向一处没有围栏的悬崖。这个男人是否有义务做好事，从椅子上站起来，走几步，去引导这个幼儿？普通法的传统答案是，在这种情况下，他没有法律义务采取行动，因此，他不应因未能尽到每个有道德的人都会认为的合理努力来避免悲剧而承担责任。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Finally, the exception to the general duty of reasonable care that seems most outrageous to the layperson states that a person has no duty to act affirmatively to prevent harm that might befall another person. For example, say that a man sitting in a park, eating his lunch, watches as an unattended toddler crawls toward an unfenced cliff. Is the man obligated to be a Good Samaritan and get out of his chair, walk a few feet, and redirect the toddler? The common law’s traditional answer is that he has no legal duty to act in this case, so he is not liable for failing to exert what every moral person would say is a reasonable effort to avert a tragedy.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这条骇人听闻的规则基于双重原则。首先，合理谨慎的义务施加于那些采取相关行动的人，而不是那些完全不作为的人。法律避免对人们施加积极的负担——即使是轻微的负担——因为这样做会侵犯他们的人身自由。防止伤害和补偿受害者的好处，被强迫无关人员采取行动的不公平所抵消。其次，一旦我们开始施加积极的义务，就很难知道该在哪里停止。（这就是律师所说的“<em class="calibre8">闸门论证”</em>或<em class="calibre8">“滑坡</em>论证”：以一种方式处理一个案件，我们打开了闸门，或者开始滑向滑坡，这导致我们以同样的方式处理许多其他案件。）如果一个人发现悬崖周围的围栏坏了，但附近还没有幼儿，他是否有义务打电话给当局报告需要维修？一个游泳健将是否必须去救助溺水的孩子？那么，水平一般的游泳运动员怎么样？<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_156" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The basis for this monstrous rule is twofold. First, the duty of reasonable care is imposed on those who enter into a course of conduct, not those who refrain from acting altogether. The law avoids imposing affirmative burdens on people—even modest burdens—because to do so impinges on their personal liberty. The benefits of preventing harm and compensating victims are outweighed by the unfairness of compelling an uninvolved person to act. Second, once we start down the path of imposing affirmative obligations, it is hard to know where to stop. (This is what lawyers call a <em class="calibre8">floodgates</em> or <em class="calibre8">slippery slope</em> argument: By deciding one case one way, we open the floodgates or start down the slippery slope that makes us decide many other cases the same way.) If the man sees that the fence around the cliff is broken but no toddler is in the area yet, is he obligated to call the authorities to report the need for repair? Is a strong swimmer required to go to the aid of a drowning child? How about a swimmer of modest abilities?<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>幸运的是，该法律的实际地位并不像乍看起来那么严重。由于世界上好心人多，未能采取积极行动的案件极其罕见。法院也为该规则规定了例外情况。例如，当一个人开始采取某种行为时，他不得放弃，将他人置于危险之中。当两个酒友一起在酒吧间度过一晚时，其中一个人不能让另一个人昏迷不醒、醉酒难耐地躺在街上而不寻求帮助。同样，到达事故现场的人没有义务停车并帮助疏导事故现场周围的交通，但如果她开始疏导交通，则必须小心谨慎。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Fortunately, the actual position of the law is less severe than it first appears. Cases that involve a failure to act affirmatively are extremely rare because the world is populated with Good Samaritans. And the courts have fashioned exceptions to the rule. For example, when someone has entered into a course of conduct, he may not abandon it and leave someone else at peril. When two drinking buddies spend the evening together going from one bar to another, one of them can’t leave the other unconscious, dangerously intoxicated, and lying in the street without seeking aid. Likewise, a person who comes upon the scene of an accident has no duty to stop and help direct traffic around the accident, but if she starts directing traffic, she must be careful in doing so.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>注意义务的一个相关限制是，侵权人仅对受害人承担责任，且仅对最初导致其行为过失的风险范围内的损害承担责任。因为缺少钉子，马蹄铁丢失了；因为缺少马蹄铁，马匹丢失了；以此类推，直至失去王国。那么，疏忽的铁匠是否应该为失去王国承担侵权责任？法院必须在某个时刻划清界限，裁定疏忽的被告无需对过于遥远的后果承担责任。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A related limitation on the duty of care is that a tortfeasor is liable only to victims and for harm within the scope of the risk that made its conduct negligent in the first place. For want of a nail the shoe was lost, for want of a shoe the horse was lost, and so on up to the loss of the kingdom. Is the negligent blacksmith liable in tort for the loss of the kingdom? Courts have to draw the line at some point, holding that a negligent defendant is not liable for consequences that are too remote.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这一观点在一个深受法学教授喜爱的案件<em class="calibre8">帕尔斯格拉夫诉长岛铁路公司案</em>（1928 年）中得到了体现，该案由美国著名法官本杰明·卡多佐撰写。海伦·帕尔斯格拉夫买了一张去海滩的票，正在火车站台上等火车。另一列火车进站，两名男子跑去赶火车。其中一名男子提着包裹，摇摇晃晃地跳上了火车。火车上的一名列车员伸手将他拉上来，而站台上的另一名列车员则从后面推了他一下。列车员的推拉使他的包裹移开了，掉落在铁轨上。包裹里装有烟花，撞击后爆炸。爆炸的冲击力震落了站台另一端的一些秤，砸在不幸的帕尔斯格拉夫身上，致她受伤。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This point was made in a favorite case of law professors, <em class="calibre8">Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co.</em> (1928), in an opinion authored by one of the great American judges, Benjamin Cardozo. Helen Palsgraf was waiting for her train on the railroad platform after buying a ticket to go to the beach. Another train arrived at the station, and two men ran to catch it. One of the men, carrying a package, unsteadily jumped aboard the train. A conductor on the train reached forward to pull him up while another conductor on the platform pushed him from behind. The conductors’ pushing and pulling dislodged his package, causing it to fall on the rails. The package contained fireworks that exploded upon impact. The shock of the explosion knocked down some scales at the other end of the platform, which fell on the unlucky Palsgraf, injuring her.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>假设，正如法院所做的那样，列车员在推拉携带包裹的乘客时存在疏忽。如果他从火车上摔下来受伤，铁路公司无疑要承担责任。（铁路公司对其雇员——列车员的行为负责。这被称为<em class="calibre8">替代责任</em>——被告对他人的行为负责，而被告应对此负责。）列车员的疏忽无疑也导致了帕尔斯格拉夫的受伤，那么铁路公司是否也应该对她的受伤负责？这两起案件的唯一区别在于，对她的伤害发生在一系列持续且怪异的事件中。法院会进行划线来判断何时才是适可而止。<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_157" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Assume, as the court did, that the conductors were negligent in pushing and pulling the passenger carrying the package. If he had fallen from the train and been injured, the railroad unquestionably would have been liable. (The railroad is responsible for the acts of its employees, the conductors. This is called <em class="calibre8">vicarious liability</em>—liability through the acts of another person for whom the defendant is responsible.) The conductors’ negligence also undoubtedly caused the injury to Palsgraf, so should the railroad also be liable for her injuries? The only difference in the two cases is that the harm to her occurred through an extended, bizarre set of circumstances. The courts engage in line drawing to determine when enough is enough.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0011_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-5-div1-6"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0038" class="calibre1">法律中合理谨慎的含义是什么？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0038" class="calibre1">What Does the Law Mean by Reasonable Care?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">奇怪的是，与故意侵权行为的意图定义不同，过失法中合理注意的定义几乎遵循了“合理”的字典定义和通常理解：合理且审慎的注意程度，足够但不过度。在适用这一定义时，法院自然倾向于将问题复杂化。</p><p class="noindent">Oddly enough, unlike the definition of intent for intentional torts, the definition of reasonable care in the law of negligence pretty much follows the dictionary definition and ordinary understanding of “reasonable”: the degree of care that makes sense and that is prudent, enough but not too much. In applying this definition, naturally, the courts tend to complicate matters.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最著名的合理注意定义尝试之一，是1947年<em class="calibre8">美国诉卡罗尔拖船公司</em>案。由于被告疏忽系泊“<em class="calibre8">安娜C”号</em>驳船，导致其脱离系泊，撞上一艘油轮，船体进水后沉没。在此期间，“驳船船员”（即掌管驳船的水手）并未在“<em class="calibre8">安娜C”号</em>船上。在有关财产损失的诉讼中，被告辩称，由于驳船船员将驳船无人看管是其疏忽行为，因此应减少损害赔偿金额。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One of the best-known attempts to define reasonable care came in the case of <em class="calibre8">United States v. Carroll Towing Co</em>. (1947). Because the defendants had negligently tied the <em class="calibre8">Anna C</em>, a barge, it broke free of its moorings, rammed a tanker, filled with water, and sank. During these events the “bargee,” the sailor in charge of the barge, was absent from the <em class="calibre8">Anna C</em>. In the litigation concerning the property loss, the defendants argued that the damages should be reduced because it was negligent of the bargee to leave the barge unattended.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>勒尼德·汉德法官指出，除非能找到替代者，否则不可能有明确的规则规定驳船工人何时必须留在驳船上。有时让驳船无人看管是合理的，有时则不合理：</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Judge Learned Hand pointed out that there could be no rule prescribing exactly when the bargee had to stay on the barge unless he could procure a substitute. Sometimes it would be reasonable to leave the barge unattended and sometimes not:</p>
<p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>由于每艘船舶都有脱离系泊的情况，而一旦脱离系泊，将对周围的船舶构成威胁，因此，与其他类似情况一样，驳船公司防止由此造成的损害的责任取决于三个变量：(1) 船舶脱离系泊的概率；(2) 如果脱离系泊，由此造成的损害的严重性；(3) 采取适当预防措施的负担。用代数形式表述这一概念或许更能说明问题：设概率为 P，损害为 L，负担为 B，则责任取决于 B 是否小于 L 乘以 P，即 B 是否小于 PL。</p><p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Since there are occasions when every vessel will break free from her moorings, and since, if she does, she becomes a menace to those about her; the [bargee’s] duty, as in other similar situations, to provide against resulting injuries is a function of three variables: (1) The probability that she will break away; (2) the gravity of the resulting injury, if she does; (3) the burden of adequate precautions. Possibly it serves to bring this notion into relief to state it in algebraic terms: if the probability be called P; the injury, L; and the burden, B; liability depends upon whether B is less than L multiplied by P: i.e., whether B &lt; PL.</p>
<p class="noindent">因此，是否存在疏忽取决于具体案件的事实。如果暴风雨即将来临且港口繁忙，P 和 L 的比例会比天气平静且港口空旷时更大。在前一种情况下，而非在后一种情况下，P 乘以 L 将高于 B，后者是让驳船工人加班或更换驳船工人的相对较小的负担。</p><p class="noindent">Thus whether there was negligence depends on the facts in a particular case. If a storm is brewing and the harbor is busy, P and L are proportionately larger than if the weather is calm and the harbor is empty. In the former case but not the latter, P times L will be higher than B, the relatively small burden of having the bargee remain beyond his normal working hours or get a substitute bargee.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>理论上，汉德公式可以用来判断任何情况下行为的合理性。例如，在建造少年棒球联盟球场时，多少谨慎程度才算合理？假设球场的建造者认为外场四英尺高的围栏就足够了。<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_158" class="calibre4"></a>由于围栏距离本垒板 200 英尺，只有不寻常的小联盟球员才能将球击得更远。如果球真的越过围栏，它很可能不会造成任何伤害——尽管它可能造成轻微损坏，比如砸碎停在附近的汽车的窗户。然而，可能会发生更奇怪的事情。一个大联盟的强击手可能会在球场上进行击球练习，连续将十几个球击出球场，或者一个球可能会击中行人头部较软的地方，造成重伤或死亡。但总而言之，造成伤害的概率 (P) 很低，可能的伤害 (L) 也很低，而通过建造 12 或 20 英尺高的围栏来防止伤害 (B) 的负担却很重。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In theory, the Hand formula can be applied to judge the reasonableness of conduct in any case. How much care is reasonable in the construction of a Little League baseball field, for example? Suppose the builders of the field decide that a fence four feet high is high enough in the outfield. <a class="calibre4"></a>Because the fence is 200 feet from home plate, only an unusual Little Leaguer could hit the ball farther than that. If a ball does clear the fence, it probably will fall harmlessly—although it might conceivably cause minor damage by breaking a window in a car parked nearby. Stranger things might happen, however. A major league slugger might take batting practice at the field and hit a dozen balls in a row out of the park, or a ball might hit a pedestrian on a soft spot on her head, causing serious injury or death. But all in all, the probability of harm (P) is low, the likely injury (L) is also low, and the burden of preventing harm (B)—by building a fence twelve or twenty feet high—is significant.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>现在将少年棒球联盟球场与冰球场进行比较。冰球场的建造者总是在冰面周围安装防碎玻璃，以保护球迷免受飞来的冰球的伤害。尽管这样做的成本 (B) 很高，但被冰球击中的概率 (P) 以及可能随之而来的严重伤害 (L) 也很高——远高于建造棒球场时 P × L 的乘积。因此，冰球场建造者的合理谨慎标准更高。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now compare the Little League field to an ice hockey rink. The builders of a hockey rink always put up shatterproof glass around the ice to protect fans from flying pucks. Even though the cost of doing so (B) is high, the probability that someone will be hit by a puck (P) and the serious harm that might follow (L) are also high—much higher than the product of P × L in the construction of a baseball field. Therefore, the standard of reasonable care is higher for the builders of the rink.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>基本的侵权政策为 Hand 公式提供了逻辑依据。我们希望鼓励人们谨慎行事，但该谨慎到什么程度呢？如果每个少年棒球联盟球场都必须建起一道 12 英尺高的围栏，这项运动的成本将大幅上升，甚至可能高到无法继续运营的程度。这似乎不太合理。有人可能会被飞过围栏的球重伤，但这属于意外事故——类似于被闪电击中——而不是球场建设者疏忽造成的后果。另一方面，当风险可预见且重大时，例如被冰球击中，我们要求冰场所有者防范风险，否则承担后果。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The fundamental tort policies provide the logic behind the Hand formula. We want to encourage people to exercise caution, but how much? If every Little League field had to have a twelve-foot fence, the cost of the sport would rise significantly, perhaps even to the extent that it would be too expensive to continue. That doesn’t seem right. Someone might be seriously hurt by a ball that sails over the fence, but that would be in the category of freak accidents—something like being struck by lightning—rather than a consequence of the carelessness by the builders of the field. On the other hand, when a risk is foreseeable and significant, such as being hit by a puck, we require the rink owner to protect against the risk or pay the consequences.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hand公式表达了在确定某人是否存在疏忽时需要考虑的因素，但它并不能将关于合理谨慎的判断简化为简单的算术。首先，大多数时候人们不会用代数思维来思考。例如，汽车驾驶员通常不会认真计算其行为的潜在风险。其次，即使人们使用Hand公式进行严格的分析，他们也会发现很难甚至不可能将数字与变量联系起来。在许多情况下，事故发生的概率和由此造成的损害程度是不确定的，因为事故的发生方式多种多样。行人可能会撞到头部，或者球可能会打破窗户，飞出的玻璃碎片会卡在某人的眼睛里。最后，在任何这些情况下，我们如何衡量伤害的价值？医疗费用和工资损失是否能够准确衡量一个人的伤害，或者我们是否必须考虑非经济因素？<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_159" class="calibre4"></a>因素，例如失去眼睛的人打网球会更加困难吗？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Hand formula expresses the factors to be taken into account in determining if someone has been negligent, but it can’t reduce the decision about reasonable care to simple arithmetic. First, most of the time people don’t think in algebraic terms. The driver of a car, for example, does not usually calculate in any serious way the potential risks of her action. Second, even if people did engage in rigorous analysis using the Hand formula, they would find it difficult or impossible to attach figures to the variables. In many cases, the probability of accident and the extent of resulting harm are uncertain because accidents can occur in all sorts of ways. A pedestrian might get a bump on the head, or the ball might break a window and a piece of flying glass lodge in someone’s eye. Finally, in any of these cases, how do we measure the value of the injury? Is the cost of medical treatment and lost wages an accurate measure of someone’s injury, or do we have to take into account noneconomic <a class="calibre4"></a>factors, like the fact that a person losing an eye will have more difficulty playing tennis?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hand 公式充其量只是一个粗略的指导方针，最糟糕的是它表面上的简单性具有误导性。法律已经发展出另一种衡量合理注意的标准，这个标准应该比 Hand 公式更容易被普通门外汉和一般陪审员理解：<em class="calibre8">合理的人</em>。要做到合理注意，你所要做的就是按照一个合理的人在相关情况下会采取的方式行事。这很容易。但是使用合理人标准来定义什么是合理注意，无异于白费力气。合理的人是一个法律概念，而不是经验事实。在定义合理的人会如何行动时，法院衡量的侵权政策与应用 Hand 公式时相同，或者，就此而言，在确定一项义务是否存在时也是如此。尽管如此，合理的人在过失法中无处不在，因此定义他或她的特质是有用的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Hand formula is at best a rough guideline and at worst misleading in its apparent simplicity. The law has developed another yardstick for measuring reasonable care that is supposed to be more accessible to the normal layperson and to the average juror than the Hand formula: the <em class="calibre8">reasonable person</em>. To exercise reasonable care, all you have to do is act the way a reasonable person would act in the circumstances. Easy enough. But using the reasonable person standard to define what constitutes reasonable care is putting the rabbit into the hat. The reasonable person is a legal construct, not an empirical fact. In defining how the reasonable person would act, courts weigh the same tort policies that they do in applying the Hand formula or, for that matter, in determining whether a duty exists in the first place. Nevertheless, the reasonable person is omnipresent in the law of negligence, so it is useful to define his or her qualities.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>理性人并非指任何特定的人或普通人。相反，理性人是汉德公式的化身，一个假设的、优越的个体，他的行为举止始终符合每个人应有的准则。理性人总是三思而后行，从不抚摸陌生的狗，会等飞机在登机口完全停稳后才解开安全带，除此之外，他还会做出令我们其他人感到厌恶的谨慎行为。正如一位法庭所说：“这个优秀却令人憎恶的人物像一座纪念碑一样矗立在我们的法庭上，徒劳地呼吁他的同胞效仿他来规范自己的生活。”</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The reasonable person is not any particular person or an average person. Instead, the reasonable person is the personification of the Hand formula, a hypothetical and superior individual who acts the way everyone should act all of the time. The reasonable person always looks before he leaps, never pets a strange dog, waits for the airplane to come to a complete stop at the gate before unbuckling his seatbelt, and otherwise engages in the kind of cautious conduct that annoys the rest of us. As one court put it, “This excellent but odious character stands like a monument in our Courts of Justice, vainly appealing to his fellow citizens to order their lives after his own example.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>合理人标准确实赋予了现实生活中的人一定的自由度，因为它会考虑被告行为被评判时所处的环境。例如，合理的人与现实生活中的人一样，都面临着相同的身体残疾。盲人的行为应根据一个合理的盲人的行为来评判，而不是一个合理的视力正常人的行为。盲人未能看到并避开道路上的障碍物并非不合理，但她试图驾驶汽车的行为才是不合理的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The reasonable person standard does give some latitude to real people by considering the circumstances in which the defendant whose conduct is being judged had to act. For example, the reasonable person is subject to the same physical disabilities as the actual person. The conduct of a blind person is judged according to the conduct of a reasonable blind person, not a reasonable sighted person. A blind person is not unreasonable in failing to see and avoid an obstacle in her path, but she is unreasonable in attempting to drive a car.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，理性人并不像被告那样受到精神缺陷的困扰，正如1837年英国<em class="calibre8">沃恩诉门洛夫案（Vaughan v. Menlove）</em>所确立的那样。门洛夫是一位不幸的地主，他以危险的方式堆放干草，导致火灾。火势蔓延，并损坏了邻居的财产。门洛夫辩称，他在堆放干草时运用了最佳判断，但他的判断力并不好。正如他的律师委婉地指出的那样，门洛夫“不幸地缺乏最高水平的智力”。<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_160" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>However, the reasonable person does not suffer from the same mental limitations as the defendant, as was established in the English case <em class="calibre8">Vaughan v. Menlove</em>, back in 1837. Menlove, a hapless landowner, piled hay in a dangerous manner that resulted in a fire. The fire spread and damaged a neighbor’s property. Menlove argued that he used his best judgment in stacking the hay, but his judgment just was not very good. As his lawyer delicately put it, Menlove suffered from “the misfortune of not possessing the highest order of intelligence.”<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法院说，真糟糕。合理人标准指的是具有普通知识和智力的合理人。或许在道德上不应责怪门洛夫，但在法律上他仍需承担责任。通过追究责任，法律鼓励门洛夫或其他可能对他负责的人在未来更加谨慎，例如不参与对他人构成危险的活动。如果考虑到门洛夫的愚蠢，我们就必须考虑到他各种各样的缺点——例如，糟糕的驾驶、反应迟钝和无知。结果将不只有一个合理人标准，而是有多少被告就有多少个标准。在这类案件中，过失法中发生的事情变得非常清晰：我们根据如何选择适用侵权政策来定义法律标准。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Too bad, said the court. The reasonable person standard means the reasonable person of ordinary knowledge and intelligence. Perhaps Menlove can’t be blamed morally, but he can still be held responsible legally. By imposing liability the law encourages Menlove or others who might be responsible for him to exercise more caution in the future, maybe by not engaging in activities that pose a danger to others. If we took into account Menlove’s dimwittedness, we would have to allow for all sorts of shortcomings—bad driving, slow reflexes, and ignorance, for instance. The result would be not one reasonable person standard, but as many standards as there are defendants. In this type of case, what happens throughout the law of negligence becomes very clear: We are defining a legal standard based on how we choose to apply the tort policies.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0011_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-5-div1-7"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0039" class="calibre1">原告如何证明被告存在疏忽？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0039" class="calibre1">How Does a Plaintiff Prove That a Defendant Has Been Negligent?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">在大多数情况下，原告试图证明被告存在过失，所使用的技巧与其他庭审（或在庭审之外得出结论）中使用的技巧相同。目击者的直接证据最具说服力。旁观者的证词显示，一名司机在驾车撞倒行人之前，一边大口喝酒，一边打电话，并超速闯红灯，这足以证明司机存在过失。但间接证据——陪审团据此推断过失的间接证据——也同样具有说服力。如果没有目击事故现场的目击者，但警方在汽车前座发现了一个半空的威士忌酒瓶和一部仍能正常使用的手机，司机的血液酒精含量是法定醉酒限值的两倍，并且事故专家证实轮胎痕迹表明司机在到达十字路口前没有刹车，那么任何陪审团都会认定司机存在过失。</p><p class="noindent">In most cases a plaintiff tries to prove that a defendant has been negligent by using the same techniques that are used in any other trial (or in drawing any conclusion outside of a trial, for that matter). Direct evidence from eyewitnesses is the most compelling. The testimony of a bystander who saw a driver taking swigs from a whiskey bottle, talking on a cell phone, and speeding through a stop sign just before the driver’s car ran over a pedestrian provides overwhelming evidence of the driver’s negligence. But circumstantial evidence—indirect evidence from which the jury infers negligence—can be just as persuasive. If no one witnesses the accident but the police find a half-empty whiskey bottle and a cell phone with the connection still intact in the front seat of the car, the driver’s blood alcohol reading is twice the legal limit for intoxication, and an accident expert testifies that tire marks indicate the driver did not brake before reaching the intersection, any jury would conclude that the driver was negligent.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>一些过失案件需要独特的举证规则。其中一套规则涉及专家证词的使用。通常，陪审团的任务是裁定被告是否存在过失行为的最终结论。证人提供与该结论相关的证据，但证人不得向陪审团暗示该结论。警官可以作证说她在车里发现了威士忌酒瓶和电话，但她不能就此断言被告一定是粗心驾驶。然而，有些问题更为复杂，需要专家证词，包括关于被告过失的专家意见，以协助陪审团做出裁决。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Some negligence cases require distinctive rules of proof. One set of rules concerns the use of expert testimony. Ordinarily, it is the jury’s task to decide the ultimate issue of whether the defendant acted negligently. Witnesses provide evidence relevant to that conclusion, but the witnesses are not allowed to suggest the conclusion to the jury. A police officer can testify that she found the whiskey bottle and telephone in the car, but she cannot then say that the defendant must have been driving carelessly. Some issues are more complicated, however, and require expert testimony, including expert opinions about the defendant’s negligence, to aid the jury in reaching its decision.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>专家证词最常用于医疗事故案件。如果外科医生在病人体内遗留了两个手术钳和三个手术海绵<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_161" class="calibre4"></a>手术后，陪审团很容易得出结论，认为外科医生存在疏忽。即使陪审团可能不了解手术室的具体流程，无法解释在缝合病人之前使用钳子和海绵的情况，但常识告诉我们，一定存在一些相对简单的方法来防止此类错误。然而，当受害人指控医生在诊断疾病或执行医疗程序时存在疏忽时，陪审团需要医学专家的帮助来评估索赔。例如，在电影《<em class="calibre8">大审判》</em>中，保罗·纽曼的委托人因医生在她进食后过早给她注射全身麻醉剂而遭受脑损伤，导致她呕吐到麻醉面罩内并停止呼吸，并且未能及时抢救她。在这种情况下，普通陪审员对麻醉剂施用的合理医疗实践了解不够，无法判断医生是否存在疏忽，因此他们需要专家意见来指导他们。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Expert testimony is most often used in medical malpractice cases. If a surgeon leaves two clamps and three surgical sponges inside a patient <a class="calibre4"></a>after an operation, it is easy for the jury to conclude that the surgeon was negligent. Even though the jury may not know the precise procedure in the operating room to account for clamps and sponges before closing up the patient, common sense dictates that there must be some relatively simple means of preventing this kind of mistake. When the victim alleges that a physician was negligent in diagnosing an illness or carrying out a medical procedure, however, the jury needs help from a medical expert to assess the claim. In the movie <em class="calibre8">The Verdict</em>, for example, Paul Newman’s client suffered brain damage because her doctors had administered a general anesthetic too soon after she ate, causing her to vomit into her anesthesia mask and stop breathing, and had failed to promptly resuscitate her. In such a case, the lay jurors do not know enough about reasonable medical practice concerning the administration of anesthetics to say whether the doctors had been negligent, so they need an expert opinion to guide them.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在大多数情况下，原告和被告各自的专家都会提出相互矛盾的意见，陪审团必须对所有意见进行梳理。在1993年的<em class="calibre8">Daubert诉Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</em>案中，该案指控孕吐药物Bendectin导致出生缺陷。最高法院强化了审判法官的守门人角色，授权法官在允许陪审团听取专家意见之前，先确定专家的理论和方法是否具有科学依据。因此，法院在审查专家证词时变得更加严格，会考虑诸如证词的科学依据是否经过同行评审以及是否被其他专家普遍接受等问题。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In most cases, the plaintiff and defendant will each have their experts offer conflicting opinions, and the jury will have to sort it all out. In <em class="calibre8">Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc</em>. (1993), a case alleging that the morning sickness drug Bendectin caused birth defects, the Supreme Court reinforced the trial judge’s gatekeeper role by empowering the judge to determine whether the expert’s theory and methodology are scientifically valid before allowing the jury to hear the expert. Accordingly, courts have become more strict in screening expert testimony, considering issues such as whether the scientific basis for the testimony has been subjected to peer review and whether it is generally accepted among other experts.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>疏忽是指未能遵守合理的谨慎，由于人们通常都会采取合理的行动，原告或被告可以提出与疏忽问题相关的<em class="calibre8">习惯</em>证据。在纽约的一个案例中，一位房客从淋浴门摔下，被严重割伤。淋浴门由普通的薄玻璃制成，很容易破碎，留下锋利的边缘。在事故发生前的至少十年里，房东通常会在淋浴门上使用防碎安全玻璃或塑料来防止此类伤害。使用安全玻璃的习惯为陪审团提供了有力证据，证明房东未能履行合理的房东职责。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Negligence is the failure to observe reasonable care, and since people ordinarily act reasonably, the plaintiff or defendant may introduce evidence of a <em class="calibre8">custom</em> that is relevant to the issue of negligence. In one New York case a tenant was badly cut when he fell through his shower door, which was made of ordinary thin glass that easily broke, leaving sharp edges. For at least ten years prior to the accident, landlords routinely used shatterproof safety glass or plastic in shower doors to prevent injuries like this. The custom of using safety glass was persuasive evidence for the jury of the landlord’s failure to act as the reasonable landlord acts.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>反过来也成立吗？如果房东证明大多数公寓的淋浴间没有安全玻璃，那么遵守这一惯例就能免除房东的责任吗？不一定。惯例是合理行为的证据，但它并不能定义什么是合理行为。如果陪审团认定少数房东使用安全玻璃，甚至没有房东使用安全玻璃，但安全玻璃很容易买到，而且价格便宜。<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_162" class="calibre4"></a>考虑到事故发生的概率及其严重程度，如果赔偿额不太高，陪审团可能会得出结论，认为遵守惯例不合理，房东存在疏忽。陪审团可以单独适用勒尼德·汉德公式或合理人标准，而惯例本身并不能作为结论。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Does the reverse hold true as well? If the landlord proved that most apartments do not have safety glass in the shower, does adherence to that custom exonerate the landlord? Not necessarily. Custom is evidence of reasonable conduct, but it does not define what is reasonable conduct. If the jury finds that a few landlords use safety glass, or even that no landlords do but that safety glass is readily available at a cost that <a class="calibre4"></a>is not too high considering the probability of accidents and their severity, it may conclude that adherence to the custom is unreasonable and the landlord was negligent. The jury applies the Learned Hand formula or the reasonable person standard on its own, and the custom is not conclusive.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法规比习惯更能成为疏忽行为的有力证据。假设一名司机在限速 35 英里的区域以 60 英里的时速行驶，撞到了一名行人。司机车速过快这一事实本身就表明存在疏忽，但司机违反了法定限速这一事实才是更有力的疏忽证据。法院通常将规定行为标准的法规视为公共政策声明，应将其视为对合理谨慎的定义。合理的人不会违反法律，因此违法者的行为根据定义就是不合理的。通常，像这样明确的规则需要一些例外情况。例如，如果司机正在紧急送往医院的重病儿童，超速行驶可能是合理的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A statute can be even stronger evidence of negligence than a custom. Suppose a driver traveling at 60 mph in a 35 mph zone strikes a pedestrian. The fact that the driver may have been going too fast suggests negligence, but the fact that the driver violated the legal speed limit is even more compelling evidence of negligence. Courts often view statutes that prescribe standards of conduct as statements of public policy that should be recognized as defining reasonable care. The reasonable person does not violate the law, so a lawbreaker is by definition acting unreasonably. As usual, a clear rule like this needs some exceptions. If the driver was rushing a desperately ill child to the hospital, for example, exceeding the speed limit might be reasonable.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>一旦原告证明被告存在疏忽，被告的疏忽行为与原告的损害之间的因果关系通常就显而易见了。一名司机在红灯前未停车，撞死了一名进入人行横道的行人；如果司机没有停车，行人就不会被撞死。这被称为“<em class="calibre8">但因”因果</em>关系规则：如果受害人没有因侵权人的疏忽而受伤，则侵权人应承担责任。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Once the plaintiff has proven that the defendant was careless, the causal link between the defendant’s careless act and the plaintiff’s harm is usually clear. A driver fails to stop at a red light and kills a pedestrian who has entered the crosswalk; if the driver had not failed to stop, the pedestrian would not have been killed. This is known as the <em class="calibre8">but for</em> rule of causation: A tortfeasor is liable if the victim would not have been injured but for the tortfeasor’s negligence.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>另一方面，假设对行人的尸检奇迹般地表明，她在被车撞前一刻因心脏病突发而死亡。在这种情况下，司机的疏忽与行人受伤之间不存在因果关系。这就像司机碾过一具尸体一样，因此司机不承担责任。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On the other hand, suppose that an autopsy of the pedestrian miraculously reveals that the pedestrian died from a fatal heart attack a moment before she was struck by the car. In that case, there is no causal link between the driver’s negligence and the harm to the pedestrian. It is just as if the driver had run over a corpse, so the driver is not liable.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>但事情可能会变得更加复杂。假设行人正在十字路口向东行驶。两名司机，一人向北行驶，一人向南行驶，两人都疏忽了交通信号灯；他们都闯了各自的红灯，并在同一时刻撞向行人，导致她被撞身亡。（阅读足够多的侵权案例，你会发现更奇怪的事情也发生过。）根据“但……规则”，每位司机都逃脱了责任，因为如果不是第一位司机的疏忽，行人仍然会被第二位司机撞死，反之亦然。但这似乎是错误的答案。侵权法旨在阻止两位司机闯红灯，而行人同样会丧命。两位司机都被免责，而行人的继承人却因为两位司机的疏忽恰好与另一位司机的疏忽同时发生而得不到赔偿，这似乎不公平。因此，法律采用了另一种规则：如果侵权人的疏忽……<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_163" class="calibre4"></a>是造成损害的<em class="calibre8">重要因素</em>，即使损害无论如何都会发生，他也应承担责任。在这种情况下，每位驾驶员都是造成损害的重要因素，因此每位驾驶员都应承担责任。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But things can get more complicated. Suppose the pedestrian is crossing eastward at a four-way intersection. Two drivers, one heading north and one heading south, are each inattentive to the traffic lights; they both drive through their respective red lights and converge on the pedestrian at the same instant, crushing and killing her. (Read enough torts cases and you will find that stranger things have happened.) Under the but for rule each driver escapes liability, because but for the negligence of the first driver, the pedestrian still would have been killed by the second driver, and vice versa. But that seems like the wrong answer. Tort law wants to deter both drivers from running red lights, and the pedestrian is just as dead. It seems unfair that both drivers are let off the hook and that the pedestrian’s heirs go uncompensated because of the fortuity that each driver’s negligence coincided with the negligence of the other driver. So the law adopts an alternative rule: If the tortfeasor’s negligence <a class="calibre4"></a>was a <em class="calibre8">substantial factor</em> in causing the harm, he is liable even if the harm would have occurred anyway. In this case each driver is a substantial factor in causing the harm, so each is liable.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在某些情况下，法院允许以统计证据作为责任认定的依据。科学证据从来都不是精确的，但它往往是我们所能做的最好的证明。一家化工厂排放有毒废物，污染了城镇的供水系统；结果，居民中一种罕见癌症的发病率急剧上升。受害者如何证明她的癌症是由有毒化学物质引起的？如果她能证明，通常情况下，千分之一的人会患上这种癌症，但该镇千分之五十的人患上这种癌症，法院可能会认为证据充分。同样，如果医生误诊导致患者死亡，患者的继承人无法绝对证明医生的疏忽导致了死亡，因为即使患者接受了正确的诊断和治疗，他也可能死亡；最好的治疗方法并非在所有情况下都有效。然而，如果继承人证明医生的疏忽将患者的生存几率从80%降低到20%，他们可能已经满足了举证责任。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In some cases, courts allow statistical evidence as the basis for liability. Scientific proof is never exact, but it is often the best we can do. A chemical plant dumps toxic waste that pollutes a town’s water supply; as a result, the incidence of an unusual type of cancer among residents increases dramatically. How can a victim prove that her cancer was caused by the toxic chemicals? If she proves that one person out of a thousand normally develops this cancer but fifty people out of a thousand in the town developed it, the court may conclude that proof is sufficient. Similarly, if a physician misdiagnoses a patient and the patient dies, the patient’s heirs cannot prove absolutely that the physician’s negligence caused the death, since the patient might have died even if he had received the correct diagnosis and treatment; the best treatment may not work in 100 percent of the cases. If the heirs prove that the doctor’s negligence reduced the patient’s chance of survival from 80 percent to 20 percent, however, they probably have satisfied their burden of proof.</p>

<p class="noindent">一名行人无​​视“禁止通行”标志，走进十字路口，被一辆超速20英里/小时的汽车撞倒。司机超速行驶存在疏忽，如果当时保持安全速度，本可以避免事故。但行人也存在疏忽，没有遵守标志，而她的疏忽导致了她受伤。如果行人提起诉讼，司机是否可以以其疏忽为由抵消其疏忽，从而免于承担责任？</p><p class="noindent">A pedestrian ignores a “Don’t Walk” sign and steps into an intersection where she is struck by a car going 20 mph over the speed limit. The driver was negligent in speeding and could have avoided the accident if he had been going at a safe speed. But the pedestrian also was negligent in not observing the sign, and her negligence contributed to her being injured. If the pedestrian sues, can the driver use her negligence to cancel out his negligence, so that he is not liable?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>侵权法的传统答案是肯定的。即使被告存在过失，原告的<em class="calibre8">共同过失</em>也会阻止原告获得任何赔偿。这种答案背后的原因一直不太明确。我们当然希望鼓励原告采取安全措施，强迫被告赔偿原告部分过失造成的损害本身就有些不公平，但禁止原告获得任何赔偿又可能过于严厉。因此，法院经常以各种方式限制该原则的适用范围。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Tort law’s traditional answer was yes. Even if the defendant is negligent, the plaintiff’s <em class="calibre8">contributory negligence</em> prevents any recovery. The reason for this answer was never quite clear. Surely we want to encourage plaintiffs to act safely, and there is something unfair about forcing the defendant to compensate the plaintiff for an injury that is partly her own fault, but barring any recovery by the plaintiff may be too harsh. As a result, courts often limited the scope of the doctrine in one way or another.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>绝大多数州通过放弃共同过失原则，转而采用<em class="calibre8">比较过失原则，</em>解决了这一困境。在比较过失原则下，原告的过失会减轻但不会完全免除被告对原告伤害的责任。陪审团的任务是量化过失程度，并根据他们得出的数字确定赔偿金额。如果超速驾驶者<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_164" class="calibre4"></a>如果司机对事故负有80%的责任，则司机承担80%的损失，行人承担20%的费用。或者，如果疏忽大意的行人被两名超速行驶的司机撞倒，且双方均负有同等责任，则双方各承担40%，行人承担20%。在麦当劳咖啡案中，陪审团裁定原告斯特拉·利贝克对事故负有20%的责任，因为她在打开咖啡杯盖时不够小心，因此她的补偿性赔偿金从20万美元降至16万美元。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The great majority of states have resolved this dilemma by abandoning contributory negligence in favor of <em class="calibre8">comparative negligence</em>. Under comparative negligence, the plaintiff’s fault reduces but does not entirely eliminate the defendant’s liability for the plaintiff’s injury. The jury is assigned the task of quantifying the degree of fault, and the damages are based on the numbers they come up with. If the speeding driver is <a class="calibre4"></a>80 percent responsible for the accident, the driver pays 80 percent of the damages and the pedestrian is left to bear 20 percent of the cost. Or if the inattentive pedestrian is hit by two speeding drivers, each of whom is equally responsible, they each pay 40 percent and she pays 20 percent. In the McDonald’s coffee case, the jury decided that the plaintiff, Stella Liebeck, was 20 percent responsible for the accident because she wasn’t careful enough in taking the lid off the coffee cup, so it reduced her compensatory damages from $200,000 to $160,000.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>比较过失本身就具有令人愉悦的对称性，但问题的关键在于细节。陪审团必须量化那些无法量化的因素，将精确的数字与一堆杂乱无章的事实联系起来。然后，法院必须弄清楚如何处理这些数字。如果陪审团裁定行人应承担51%的责任，司机应承担49%的责任，那么她是否应该因为过错比司机更大而被禁止获得任何赔偿？假设是50%对50%呢？如果有两个司机，每人各负30%的责任，而行人负40%的责任呢？那么，行人的责任比他们任何一个人单独承担的责任都大，但比他们两人加起来的责任要小。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Comparative negligence has a pleasing symmetry about it, but the devil is in the details. The jury must quantify the unquantifiable, attaching precise numbers to a messy set of facts. Then the court must figure out what to do with the numbers. If the jury determines that the pedestrian is 51 percent responsible and the driver 49 percent, should she be barred from collecting anything because she is more at fault than he is? Suppose it is 50–50? How about if there are two drivers, each of whom is 30 percent at fault, and the pedestrian is 40 percent at fault? Then the pedestrian is more responsible than either of them separately but less responsible than both of them together.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>各州采用了不同的比较过失规则来考虑这些可能性。基本分为两种：一种是纯粹的比较过失制度，根据该制度，即使被告只承担1%的责任，原告也总能获得一定数额的赔偿；另一种是各种改良的比较过失制度，根据该制度，只有当原告的责任不及被告（50%）或高于被告（51%）时，原告才能获得赔偿。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>States have adopted different rules of comparative negligence to take account of these possibilities. The basic split is between a pure comparative negligence system, under which the plaintiff can always recover some amount, even if the defendant is only 1 percent responsible, and various modified comparative negligence systems, under which the plaintiff can only recover if she is not as (50 percent) or more (51 percent) responsible than the defendant.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>另一种涉及原告对损害承担责任的情况是，原告承担了损害<em class="calibre8">风险</em>。如果您去漂流、滑雪或跳伞，或者即使您加入了配备健身器材的健身俱乐部，您也将被要求签署一份免责声明，<em class="calibre8">承认</em>这项运动具有某些固有的危险性，并在您受伤时免除所有者或教练的责任。这些免责声明（也称为<em class="calibre8">免责声明</em>）可以强制执行吗？同意承担风险就像同意参加一项高风险运动一样，这构成了对运动过程中受伤的同意。免责声明还会降低提供某些活动的成本，如果没有这些免责声明，这些活动可能无法再提供；一个不得不为所有雪道伤害买单的滑雪场可能会倒闭。但免责声明可能会破坏激励安全行为和对受伤者进行赔偿的侵权政策，我们怀疑，人们在签订免责声明时往往并不真正了解或考虑其后果，或者在这个问题上可能没有太多选择。法院试图平衡这些考虑因素。对于基本服务的责任免责声明通常是不可执行的；你不能<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_165" class="calibre4"></a>实际上，如果您的医生因疏忽而对您造成伤害，您同意不起诉他。在漂流等娱乐活动中，除非人们愿意承担风险，否则无需参与，因此免责条款更有可能获得执行。然而，即使在此类活动中，法院也会仔细审查免责条款，以确保其已让消费者充分认识到所承担的风险；跳伞学校准备的免责条款中，参与者同意“放弃任何及所有……人身伤害索赔”，但由于条款中未明确提及疏忽，因此法院认为该条款不构成对疏忽诉讼的禁止。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One other situation involving the plaintiff’s contribution to the harm arises when the plaintiff engages in <em class="calibre8">assumption of the risk</em> of harm. If you go whitewater rafting, skiing, or skydiving, or even if you join a health club with workout equipment, you will be required to sign a <em class="calibre8">release</em> acknowledging that the sport has certain inherent dangers and absolving the owner or instructor of liability if you are injured. Are these releases, also called <em class="calibre8">disclaimers</em>, enforceable? Agreeing to assume a risk is just like agreeing to play a risky sport, which constitutes consent to injuries incurred along the way. Releases also reduce the cost of providing some activities, and without them, these activities might no longer be offered; a ski area that had to pay for all injuries on the slopes might be put out of business. But releases threaten to undermine the tort policies of incentives for safe conduct and compensation of the injured, and we suspect that people often do not really know or think about the consequences of releases when they enter into them or may not have much choice in the matter. Courts attempt to balance these considerations. A disclaimer of liability for an essential service is generally unenforceable; you cannot <a class="calibre4"></a>effectively agree not to sue your doctor if he injures you through his negligence. Liability releases in recreational activities like rafting, in which people do not have to participate unless they are willing to assume the risk, are more likely to be enforceable. Even there, however, a court will scrutinize a release to make sure that it brought home to the consumer the risk being assumed; a release prepared by a skydiving school by which a participant agreed to “waive any and all claims...for any personal injuries” was held not to bar a suit for negligence because it did not specifically mention negligence.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>风险承担可以是明示的，也可以是暗示的。在纽约一个著名的案例中，墨菲在科尼岛游乐园乘坐名为“飞天小女警”（The Flopper）的游乐设施时摔倒受伤。飞天小女警是一条向上倾斜的移动传送带，乘客试图在上面站立。许多像墨菲一样的乘客无法站立，被抛回铺有软垫的地板或墙壁上。当然，从它的名字和简单的观察就可以看出，这项游乐设施的乐趣在于被抛出并观看别人被抛出。尽管墨菲没有签署任何责任免除书，但他还是冒险承担了受伤的风险。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Assumption of the risk can be implicit as well as express. In a famous New York case, Murphy was injured when he fell while on a ride known as “The Flopper” at the amusement park at Coney Island. The Flopper was a moving belt angling upward on which passengers attempted to stand. Many of the riders, like Murphy, were unable to stand and were thrown back onto the padded floor or walls. The obvious fun of the ride, of course, apparent from its name and from simple observation, was to be thrown and see others thrown. Although Murphy signed no release, he took his chances by implicitly assuming the risk of injury.</p>

<p class="noindent">绝对如此。除了故意侵权和过失侵权之外，侵权责任的第三个主要领域是<em class="calibre8">严格责任</em>——即使没有故意伤害或过失，也必须承担的责任。严格责任由来已久，也是过去半个世纪以来产品责任领域侵权责任扩张最具争议的根源之一。</p><p class="noindent">Absolutely. The third major area of tort liability, along with intentional torts and negligence, is <em class="calibre8">strict liability</em>—liability that is imposed even in the absence of intent to injure or negligence. Strict liability has been around for a long time, and it is also a source of the most controversial expansion of tort liability over the last half-century, in the realm of products liability.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最早的严格责任案件之一是1868年由上议院裁决的<em class="calibre8">赖兰兹诉弗莱彻案（Rylands v. Fletcher）</em>。被告是工厂主，他们在自己的土地上建造了一个水库。他们不知道，水库建在一个废弃的煤矿之上。水库里的水冲刷了废弃的煤矿，淹没了相邻土地所有者的连接煤矿。由于被告不知道或没有理由知道废弃煤矿的存在，因此他们在水库选址上并非疏忽。但是，法院表示，某些活动，例如建造一个蓄水库来容纳大量的水，即使谨慎行事，也异常危险。这些活动虽然不至于危险到违法，但危险程度足以使行为人对由此造成的所有损害承担无过错责任。这鼓励了人们更加谨慎，并要求行为人承担与该活动相关的所有费用。因此，<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_166" class="calibre4"></a><em class="calibre8">在Rylands v. Fletcher</em>案中，被告尽管采取了合理的谨慎措施，但仍需承担责任。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One of the earliest strict liability cases was <em class="calibre8">Rylands v. Fletcher</em>, decided by the House of Lords in 1868. The defendants, mill owners, had built a reservoir on their property. Unbeknownst to them, the reservoir was built on top of an abandoned coal mine. The water in the reservoir broke through the abandoned mine and flooded the connecting mine of an adjoining landowner. Because the defendants did not know or have reason to know of the abandoned mine, they were not negligent in locating the reservoir where they did. But, the court said, some activities, like building a reservoir to hold a large quantity of water, are abnormally dangerous even if they are performed with due care. The activity is not so dangerous that it is illegal, but it is sufficiently dangerous that we make the actor liable without fault for all damages that flow from it. This encourages a heightened degree of care, and it imposes on the actor the duty to pay all of the costs associated with the activity. Accordingly, <a class="calibre4"></a>the defendants in <em class="calibre8">Rylands v. Fletcher</em> were liable even though they acted with reasonable care.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>严格责任尤其适用于那些不仅危险而且在当地并不常见活动。以取水为例，如<em class="calibre8">Rylands v. Fletcher</em>案中所述。如果郊区房主在其花园内修建了一个小型装饰性池塘，水溢出并淹没了邻居的地下室，则他不需承担严格责任（但如果他没有采取合理的措施防止水溢出，则他可能因疏忽而承担责任）。在郊区，收集这么小的水来装饰花园并不罕见，而且并不是特别危险。但是，如果房主修建了一个大型灌溉系统来浇灌她郊区的小花园，则他将承担严格责任；在农村地区适用且常见的灌溉系统在郊区开发项目中是不合适的，而且过于危险。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Strict liability is imposed especially for activities that are not only dangerous but are unusual for their locale. Consider the collection of water, as in <em class="calibre8">Rylands v. Fletcher</em>. A suburban homeowner who builds a small decorative pond as part of his garden will not be strictly liable if water escapes and floods his neighbor’s basement (although he may be liable in negligence if he has not taken reasonable care to prevent the escape of the water). Collecting such a small body of water to decorate a garden is not unusual in the suburbs and not particularly dangerous. But the homeowner who builds a massive irrigation system to water her small suburban garden will be strictly liable; the irrigation system that would be appropriate and common in a rural area is out of place and excessively dangerous in a suburban development.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>当然，问题在于划清界限。在郊区开发区，把水放在一个小小的装饰性池塘里并不算异常危险；但在灌溉系统中储存大量的水才是异常危险的。养一只可卡犬，不可以；养一头狮子，可以。那养一条蟒蛇呢？养一只比特犬呢？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The problem, of course, is drawing the line. Holding water in a small, decorative pond in a suburban development is not abnormally dangerous; keeping a massive quantity of water in an irrigation system is abnormally dangerous. Keeping a cocker spaniel, no; keeping a lion, yes. How about a python? A pit bull?</p>

<p class="noindent">严格责任有时也适用于对造成损害的缺陷产品制造商追究责任——律师称之为<em class="calibre8">产品责任</em>。产品责任的扩展是二十世纪侵权法的伟大成功之一。或许正因为这一成功，产品责任也成为大型企业、保险公司及其律师对侵权法体系发起最猛烈攻击的领域之一。如今，关于产品责任在何种程度上是或应该是严格责任、过失责任，还是两者的混合，存在着激烈的争论。</p><p class="noindent">Strict liability also is sometimes applied to impose liability on manufacturers of defective products that cause injury—what lawyers call <em class="calibre8">products liability</em>. The expansion of products liability was one of the great success stories of tort law in the twentieth century. Perhaps because of that success, it is also the area in which large corporations, insurance companies, and their lawyers have mounted one of the strongest attacks on the tort system. Today there is great debate about the extent to which products liability is or should be strict liability, negligence, or a mixture of the two.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>先从一起普通的案例说起，这起案例涉及一个促成严格产品责任法通过的著名案例。格拉迪斯·埃斯科拉（Gladys Escola）是一家餐厅的女服务员，当时她正把可口可乐瓶子从货柜里搬到冰箱里，突然一个瓶子在她手中爆炸了。埃斯科拉说，瓶子“发出的声音就像电灯泡掉下来的声音。砰的一声巨响。”瓶子碎成了两截参差不齐的碎片，在埃斯科拉身上留下了一道五英寸深的伤口，切断了她拇指和手掌的血管、神经和肌肉。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Begin with an ordinary situation that was involved in one of the famous cases that led to the adoption of strict products liability. Gladys Escola, a waitress in a restaurant, was moving Coca-Cola bottles from their case to a refrigerator when one exploded in her hand. Escola said that the bottle “made a sound similar to an electric light bulb that would have dropped. It made a loud pop.” The bottle broke into two jagged pieces and inflicted a deep, five-inch cut on Escola, severing blood vessels, nerves, and muscles of the thumb and palm of the hand.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如果本案适用一般过失规则，Escola 必须证明瓶装公司未能采取合理措施防止瓶子爆炸，从而导致她受伤。为了证明<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_167" class="calibre4"></a>装瓶商缺乏合理谨慎，Escola 必须证明两件事：首先，瓶子存在问题，要么是瓶子本身存在缺陷，要么是灌装压力过高；其次，装瓶商在生产过程中存在疏忽或未能发现问题，例如购买了劣质瓶子、未能正确检查瓶子，或未正确操作灌装机。这两点都很难证明。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If this case is governed by the ordinary rules of negligence, Escola has to prove that the bottling company failed to exercise reasonable care to prevent the explosion of the bottle that injured her. To establish the <a class="calibre4"></a>bottler’s lack of reasonable care, Escola must prove two things: first, that there was something wrong with the bottle, either that there was a defect in the bottle itself or that it was filled at too high a pressure; and second, that the bottler acted carelessly in producing or failing to detect the problem, by, for example, buying an inferior grade of bottle, failing to inspect bottles properly, or not operating its filling machines correctly. Both of these can be hard to prove.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>为了证明瓶子有问题，埃斯科拉首先必须找到瓶子，或者爆炸后瓶子的残骸。在很多情况下，这都会成为问题；在实际案例中，有人把瓶子碎片扫起来扔掉了。即使她有碎片，也可能无法从残留的碎片中确定事故原因。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To prove that there was something wrong with the bottle, Escola first has to have the bottle, or what is left of it after the explosion. In many cases this will be a problem; in the actual case, someone swept up the pieces of the bottle and threw them away. Even if she has the pieces, it may be impossible to identify the cause of the accident from the fragments that remain.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>假设埃斯科拉克服了第一个障碍，能够确定瓶子存在缺陷，从而导致了爆炸。她仍然必须证明装瓶公司在生产过程中存在疏忽或未能发现缺陷。装瓶公司会辩称，它从信誉良好的制造商处购买瓶子，像其他装瓶商一样谨慎地组织生产线，使用高质量的设备，培训工人，并在适当的点检查瓶子——也就是说，它的行为是合理的。装瓶商甚至可能承认瓶子可能存在缺陷。可能有统计数据显示，十万个瓶子中会有一个会爆炸。但这不是装瓶商的错。只要它谨慎行事，根据过失规则，它就不承担责任。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Suppose, though, that Escola gets over the first hurdle and is able to determine that there was a defect in the bottle that caused the explosion. She still must prove that the bottling company was negligent in producing or failing to discover the defect. The bottling company will argue that it buys its bottles from a reputable manufacturer, organizes its production line in as careful a manner as other bottlers, uses high quality equipment, trains its workers, and inspects the bottles at appropriate points—that is, that it acts reasonably. The bottler may even concede that there may have been a defect in the bottle. There may be statistics showing that one out of 100,000 bottles will explode. But that is not the bottler’s fault. As long as it has acted carefully, it is not liable under a rule of negligence.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>至此，我们或许可以说侵权法已尽其所能，Escola 只能默默承受损失。那些只关注可识别过错作为唯一责任基础的人往往就此止步。然而，制定产品责任法的法院认为他们可以做得更好，因此创立了严格产品责任原则。制造商销售缺陷产品需承担责任，无需原告证明其存在过失。产品责任的关键在于产品处于“不合理危险的缺陷状态”，这是严格产品责任规则中措辞略显生硬但被广泛采用的表述。爆炸的瓶子处于缺陷状态（爆炸的瓶子肯定有问题），不合理危险（爆炸可能会伤人）。这种不合理危险的缺陷状态是由灌装疏忽、制造过程中检查疏忽造成的，还是无法避免的，都无关紧要。装瓶商负有严格责任——即使无法证明其存在疏忽，也要承担责任。<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_168" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At this point we might say the tort system has done its best and that Escola just has to suffer her loss in silence. Someone who focuses narrowly on identifiable fault as the exclusive basis of liability is inclined to stop there. The courts that developed the law of products liability, however, thought they could do better and so created the doctrine of strict products liability. The manufacturer is liable for marketing a defective product without any requirement that the plaintiff prove its negligence in doing so. The key to products liability is that the product is in “a defective condition unreasonably dangerous,” to quote the awkwardly phrased but widely adopted formulation of the rule for strict products liability. A bottle that explodes is in a defective condition (something must be wrong with an exploding bottle), unreasonably dangerous (the explosion might injure someone). Whether the unreasonably dangerous, defective condition was caused by negligent filling or a negligent failure to inspect during manufacture or was unpreventable doesn’t matter. The bottler is strictly liable—liable even if it cannot be proven negligent.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法院制定严格产品责任制度有四个基本原因。首先，在许多情况下，产品缺陷是由制造商的疏忽造成的，但该疏忽难以或无法证明。物证可能被毁坏或无法确定，或者证明疏忽所需的制造过程信息可能完全由制造商控制。其次，仅靠疏忽责任不足以激励制造商生产安全的产品。在考虑在精心的产品设计、制造和质量控制方面投入多少资金时，制造商应该计算其产品造成的伤害的全部成本，并将这些损失计入产品成本。实施严格责任鼓励制造商加倍努力生产更安全的产品，而且在许多情况下，制造商比产品使用者更有能力将伤害降至最低。第三，制造商通常声称其产品是安全的，消费者由此产生的期望应该得到保护。第四，即使制造商采取了合理的行动，产品事故的受害者仍然会受到伤害。如果将损害赔偿成本转嫁给制造商，制造商就会将损失分摊给所有消费者。每件产品的成本都会略有增加，因此每位购买者实际上都在购买保险，以防成为不幸的产品使用者，否则将遭受灾难性的损失。这种通过严格责任分摊损失的方式并非简单地寻找一个“财力雄厚”的人，或者一个有足够资金承担原告损失的人；相反，它让产品承担其真实成本，包括其造成的损害成本，并将成本分摊给所有产品使用者。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The courts developed strict products liability for four basic reasons. First, in many cases the defect in a product is caused by the manufacturer’s negligence but the negligence is difficult or impossible to prove. The physical evidence may be destroyed or inconclusive, or the information about the manufacturing process that is required to prove negligence may be uniquely within the control of the manufacturer. Second, negligence liability alone provides insufficient incentives to induce manufacturers to make safe products. When considering how much to invest in careful product design, manufacture, and quality control, a manufacturer should calculate the full cost of injuries caused by its products and figure those damages into the cost of the product. Imposing strict liability encourages manufacturers to go the extra mile to produce safer products, and in many cases, manufacturers are in a better position to minimize injuries than are the users of the products. Third, manufacturers typically represent their products to be safe, and the expectations of consumers created by those representations should be protected. Fourth, even if the manufacturer has acted reasonably, the victim of the product accident is still injured. If the cost of the injury is shifted to the manufacturer, the manufacturer will in turn distribute the loss among all of its customers. The cost of each product increases slightly so that each purchaser is in effect buying insurance against being the unlucky product user who otherwise would suffer a catastrophic loss. This form of loss distribution through strict liability is not simply a question of finding a “deep pocket,” or someone who has enough money to bear the plaintiff’s loss; instead, it makes the product bear its true cost, including the cost of the injuries it produces, and distributes the cost among all users of the product.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>因此，严格产品责任广泛适用于制造缺陷，例如可乐瓶的生产不当。产品还有另外两种缺陷：产品存在设计缺陷，以及制造商未能警告产品造成的风险。将严格责任扩展到这些类型的缺陷一直备受争议。从 20 世纪 60 年代到 80 年代，大多数法院对设计缺陷采用严格责任，有时也对警告缺陷采用严格责任。此后，出现了一种更为保守的反应，导致严格责任被削弱，转而采用范围更窄的过失规则，以至于一本主要的侵权法教科书在其讨论该主题时题为“严格产品责任的发展、基本原理和衰落”。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Strict products liability, therefore, is widely imposed for manufacturing defects, as when a Coke bottle is improperly made. Products can be defective in two other ways as well: when the product has a design defect and when the manufacturer fails to warn about a risk created by the product. The expansion of strict liability to these types of defects has been more controversial. From the 1960s into the 1980s, most courts adopted strict liability for design defects and sometimes for warning defects as well. Since then, there has been a more conservative reaction leading to a cutback in strict liability in favor of a narrower, negligence rule, such that a leading torts textbook captions its discussion of the subject “Development, Rationales, and Decline of Strict Products Liability.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如果产品没有按照预期的方式生产，则存在制造缺陷。相反，设计缺陷是指产品完全按照制造商的意图生产，但问题出在产品本身的设计上。这是最具争议的领域。<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_169" class="calibre4"></a>产品责任，而关于责任范围的争论主要集中在定义设计缺陷的测试方法上。如果产品的危险性超出了产品用户的通常预期（称为<em class="calibre8">消费者预期测试</em>），那么该产品是否存在设计缺陷？如果设计带来的危险性超过了设计带来的益处（称为<em class="calibre8">风险效用测试</em>），那么该产品是否存在设计缺陷？如果是后者，我们该如何权衡危险和益处？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A product has a manufacturing defect when it is not made the way it is supposed to be. With a design defect, by contrast, the product is made exactly as the manufacturer intended, but the problem is with the design of the product itself. This is the most controversial area of <a class="calibre4"></a>products liability, and the debate over the scope of liability plays out in defining the test for a design defect. Is a product defectively designed if it is more dangerous than users of the product ordinarily expect it to be (called the <em class="calibre8">consumer expectations test</em>)? Is it defectively designed if the dangers created by its design outweigh the benefits of the design (called the <em class="calibre8">risk-utility test</em>)? If the latter, how do we weigh the dangers and the benefits?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>根据消费者预期测试，如果产品存在设计缺陷，且其危险性超出普通消费者的预期，则制造商应承担严​​格责任。广为遵循的《侵权法重述（第二版）》认可了消费者预期测试，即当产品“危险程度超出购买该产品的普通消费者基于其特性的普遍常识所能预见的程度”时，制造商应承担责任。但保护消费者权益的法院认为，仅靠消费者预期测试不足以评估缺陷设计，而支持过失标准的人士则认为，在许多情况下，尤其是在涉及复杂产品的情况下，消费者对安全并没有固定的预期。因此，风险效用测试应运而生，成为一种补充或替代标准。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Under the consumer expectations test, a product has a design defect and strict liability is imposed on its manufacturer if the product is more dangerous than would be expected by the ordinary consumer. The widely followed Restatement (Second) of Torts endorsed the consumer expectations test, imposing liability when a product is “dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics.” But courts that were protective of consumers found that the consumer expectations test by itself is not enough to evaluate defective designs, while advocates of a negligence standard argued that in many cases, particularly involving complex products, consumers had no fixed expectations of safety. Therefore, the risk-utility test developed as an additional or alternative standard.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>风险-效用测试衡量产品的成本和收益。在根据风险-效用测试确定产品是否存在设计缺陷时，法院会权衡产品给用户带来的风险与产品给用户和整个社会带来的收益。如果风险大于收益，则产品存在缺陷，制造商应对产品造成的损害承担责任。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The risk-utility test balances the costs and benefits of the product. In determining whether a product is defectively designed under the risk-utility test, the court weighs the risks that the product poses to users against the benefits of the product to users and society at large. If the risks outweigh the benefits, the product is defective and the manufacturer is liable for the harm the product causes.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>随着风险效用测试的发展，它逐渐脱离了严格责任，而更接近于过失。支持过失的法院将该测试与勒尼德·汉德公式中的过失公式非常相似，要求受害人证明产品存在合理的替代设计，可以避免事故的发生。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As it developed, the risk-utility test moved away from strict liability and became more like negligence. Courts that favor negligence treat the test very much like the Learned Hand formula for negligence and require the victim to prove that there was a reasonable alternative design of the product that would have prevented the accident.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在权衡产品设计的风险和收益时，制造商必须考虑产品的所有正常用途。这条规则催生了许多与汽车耐撞性相关的有趣案例。驾驶员当然不想卷入事故，但每个人都知道，许多汽车迟早都会发生碰撞。在设计汽车时，制造商必须认识到这一事实，并制造出具有一定耐撞性的汽车。如今，许多碰撞安全功能，例如安全带、安全气囊和加强型车架，都是政府法规所要求的，但这些功能的重要性最初是由产品责任诉讼和消费者权益倡导者强调的。<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_170" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In weighing the risks and benefits of the design of a product, a manufacturer has to consider all of the normal uses of a product. This rule has produced a number of interesting cases involving the crashworthiness of cars. Drivers certainly don’t want to be involved in accidents, but everybody knows that sooner or later many cars will crash. In designing cars, manufacturers have to recognize this fact and make a car that is to some degree crashworthy. Today many crash safety features, such as seat belts, airbags, and reinforced frames, are required by government regulations, but the need for them was first highlighted by products liability litigation and consumer advocates.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最常见的情况是，当产品存在替代设计或替代产品能够降低风险并提供大部分或全部相同益处时，产品的风险会超过其效用。产品责任领域具有开创性的案例之一，<em class="calibre8">Greenman诉Yuba Power Products案</em>（1963年），就阐述了存在替代设计时的产品缺陷。Greenman是一位家庭木工，妻子在圣诞节送给他一台Shopsmith电动工具。Shopsmith电动工具是一款多功能电动工具，可用作锯子、钻头和木工车床。当他正在用Shopsmith电动工具加工一块木头时，木头突然从工具中飞出，击中他的额头，造成重伤。Greenman的专家作证称，Shopsmith电动工具存在缺陷，其使用不合适的固定螺钉固定机器部件，导致正常振动使螺钉松动，导致固定木头的机器部件移位，木头飞出。专家认为，制造商本可以使用更坚固的螺丝或其他更好的方法来固定机器的各个部件，以避免此类事故的发生。由于当时已经有了现成的替代设计，因此以这种方式制造机器的风险（可能造成伤害）超过了其益处（成本略有降低）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Most commonly, the risks of a product outweigh its utility when there is either an alternative design of the product or an alternative product that reduces the risks while providing much or all of the same benefits. One of the pathbreaking cases for products liability, <em class="calibre8">Greenman v. Yuba Power Products</em> (1963), illustrates a defect when there is an alternative design. Greenman, a home woodworker, received a Shopsmith from his wife for Christmas. The Shopsmith was a combination power tool that could be used as a saw, drill, and wood lathe. While he was working on a piece of wood on the Shopsmith, it suddenly flew out of the tool and struck him on the forehead, inflicting serious injuries. Greenman’s expert testified that the Shopsmith was defective in using inadequate set screws to hold parts of the machine together, so that normal vibration loosened the screws, causing the part of the machine holding the wood in place to move out of position, allowing the wood to fly off. In the expert’s opinion, the manufacturer could have used stronger screws or other, better ways of fastening the parts of the machine together to prevent this kind of accident. Because there was a readily available alternative design, the risk of making the machine this way (the possibility of injury) outweighed the benefit of doing so (the slight reduction in cost).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>许多其他卷入产品责任诉讼的产品之所以存在缺陷，是因为该产品有其他设计，可以达到同样的目的，而且风险更低。例如，相对于价格稍高、经过阻燃处理的服装，未经阻燃处理的睡袍和睡衣就存在缺陷。如果汽车的油箱位于容易发生轻微事故泄漏的位置，那么这种汽车就太危险了，因为通过重新安置或加衬里来预防泄漏的成本相对较低。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Many other products that have been involved in products liability litigation are defective because there is an alternative design of the product that serves the same purpose with less risk. Nightgowns and pajamas not treated with a flame retardant are defective relative to the slightly more expensive, treated garment, for example. An automobile with a gas tank situated where it will leak easily in a minor accident is too dangerous because the cost of prevention through relocating or lining the tank is relatively small.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>有时，产品存在缺陷是因为存在其他具有类似功效且风险更低的替代产品。一个著名的例子是达康盾牌（Dalkon Shield）避孕装置。达康盾牌是一种宫内节育器（IUD），其避孕效果极佳，但却带来了悲剧性的副作用，即大幅增加使用女性盆腔疾病的发病率。即使达康盾牌无法在不影响其基本功能的前提下重新设计以避免这个问题，但市面上还有许多其他有效的避孕措施可供选择，因此，与现有替代方案相比，使用IUD的风险远远大于其益处。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sometimes a product is defective because there is an alternative product that provides similar benefits at less risk. A famous example of this type involved the Dalkon Shield contraceptive device. The Dalkon Shield was an intrauterine device (IUD) that was highly effective as a contraceptive but had the tragic side effect of dramatically increasing the incidence of pelvic diseases among woman who used it. Even if the Dalkon Shield could not be redesigned to avoid this problem without losing its basic function, there are many other effective contraceptives available, so the risk of using the IUD far outweighed the benefits provided by it when considered in light of the available alternatives.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第三类产品缺陷是未发出警告，导致产品不合理地危险。过度警告，据称是由于诉讼威胁而导致的，已成为侵权法改革笑话的常见笑柄：儿童滑板车上的标签警告“本产品使用时会移动”，或电动搅拌机上的警告“切勿拆卸”。<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_171" class="calibre4"></a>产品运行时，请勿将食物或其他物品从刀片上滑落。” 事实上，制造商无需警告明显的危险，例如滑板车的移动。但制造商必须警告产品的其他风险，以便消费者能够选择是否使用，并更安全地使用。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The third type of product defect involves failure to warn that render the product unreasonably dangerous. Excessive warnings supposedly caused by the threat of litigation have become a staple butt of tort reform jokes: the label on a children’s scooter that warned “This product moves when used,” or the warning on an electric blender to “Never remove <a class="calibre4"></a>food or other items from the blades while the product is operating.” In fact, manufacturers are not required to warn of obvious dangers—that scooters move, for example. But manufacturers do have to warn about other risks of a product so a consumer can choose whether to use it and can use it more safely.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>警告并非总是能够解决产品的设计缺陷。如果工业机器很容易设计成配备安全防护装置，那么仅靠标签警告操作员不要将手放入机器中是不够的。但是，产品存在设计缺陷并不一定是因为其存在危险；相反，这种危险可能需要警告才能使产品达到合理的安全水平。有些产品存在缺陷是因为制造商没有充分警告产品的风险，例如药品制造商没有警告用户与其使用相关的风险。其他产品存在缺陷是因为制造商未能提供正确的使用说明，例如药品制造商没有警告其与其他药物的危险相互作用。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A warning cannot always cure a design defect in a product. A label warning the operator of an industrial machine not to put his hands in the machine is not sufficient when the machine could easily be designed with a safety guard. But a product is not necessarily defectively designed because it is dangerous; instead, the danger may require a warning to render the product reasonably safe. Some products are defective because the manufacturer does not adequately warn of the risks of the product, as when the manufacturer of a drug does not warn users of risks associated with its use. Other products are defective because the manufacturer fails to provide proper instructions as to its use, as when the drug manufacturer does not warn of dangerous interactions with other drugs.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>通常，警告必须传达给产品使用者才算充分，但处方药是传统的例外。根据<em class="calibre8">知情中介规则</em>，警告应适当地发送给患者的医生——知情中介——因为他们最有资格评估信息并评估产品的风险和益处。然而，在许多司法管辖区，大规模接种（例如流感疫苗）和口服避孕药都有例外。在这些情况下，患者在选择药物时拥有比医生为鼻窦感染开抗生素时更多的选择权。随之而来的问题是，知情中介原则是否应扩展到直接向消费​​者做广告的日益流行的药物。电视广告大肆宣扬治疗关节炎、过敏或勃起功能障碍的最新药物的益处，鼓励消费者要求医生特别开这些药物；如果消费者拥有更多选择，那么是否应该通过适当的警告来告知这种选择？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Usually, the warning must be communicated to the user of a product to be adequate, but prescription drugs are a traditional exception. Under the <em class="calibre8">learned intermediary rule</em>, the warning is properly directed to the patient’s doctor—the learned intermediary—who is in the best position to evaluate the information and assess the risks and benefits of the product. In many jurisdictions, however, there are exceptions for mass inoculations, such as flu vaccine, and for oral contraceptives. There the patient exercises more choice in the process of choosing the medication than, say, when her physician prescribes an antibiotic for a sinus infection. The issue then arises whether the learned intermediary doctrine should be extended to the increasingly popular drugs advertised directly to consumers. Television ads tout the benefits of the latest drug for arthritis, allergies, or erectile dysfunction, encouraging consumers to ask their doctors to prescribe those drugs in particular; if consumers are exercising more choice, should that choice be informed by an appropriate warning?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在某些情况下，法院评估警告是否充分的权力被立法或法规所取代。国会规定烟草公司必须在香烟包装上标注某些警告，并规定各州不得施加不一致的警告要求。最高法院对该法规的解释是，排除州侵权法裁决，认为规定的警告不充分，以及州政府更直接的监管形式。在这种情况下，该法规相对明确。在许多其他情况下，该法规对其优先效力含糊不清，法院必须裁定立法机关是否有意将该法规作为排他性法规。当FDA规定某些<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_172" class="calibre4"></a>例如，如果处方药中没有提供信息，这是否会阻止法院裁定也应披露其他风险？在 2009 年的一项重要裁决中，最高法院裁定，FDA 规定中规定的警告并不优先于因未发出警告而提起的州侵权诉讼。大法官约翰·保罗·史蒂文斯 (John Paul Stevens) 代表法院的多数意见指出，FDA 的资源有限，无法监控市场上 11,000 种药品的安全性，并且曾未能要求向医生和患者提供足够的警告。史蒂文斯还称赞根据州法律提起的诉讼发挥了侵权法的基本功能。他写道：“州侵权诉讼可以发现未知的药物危害，并激励药品制造商及时披露安全风险。它们还发挥着独特的补偿功能，可以激励受害人站出来提供信息。”（<em class="calibre8">Wyeth v. Levine</em>，2009 年）</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In some cases, the court’s power to evaluate the adequacy of a warning is preempted by legislation or regulation. Congress prescribed certain warnings that tobacco companies must place on packs of cigarettes and provided that the states could not impose inconsistent requirements of warnings. The Supreme Court interpreted the statute to preclude state tort law decisions holding that the prescribed warnings were inadequate, as well as more direct forms of state regulation. In that case, the statute was relatively clear. In many other cases, the statute is vague about its preemptive effect, and the courts have to decide whether the legislature intended the statute to be exclusive. When the FDA prescribes that certain <a class="calibre4"></a>information be provided with a prescription drug, for example, does that prevent a court from holding that additional risks should have been disclosed as well? In an important 2009 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that FDA regulations specifying warnings do not preempt state tort lawsuits for failure to warn. The Court’s majority opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens noted that the FDA has limited resources to monitor the safety of the 11,000 drugs on the market and a history of failing to require adequate warnings to doctors and patients. Stevens also praised suits under state law as serving the basic functions of tort law. “State tort suits,” he wrote, “uncover unknown drug hazards and provide incentives for drug manufacturers to disclose safety risks promptly. They also serve a distinct compensatory function that may motivate injured persons to come forward with information” (<em class="calibre8">Wyeth v. Levine</em>, 2009).</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法律体系无法充分赔偿凯娃·理查德森所受的伤害，正如医学无法治愈她的伤病一样。法律体系所能做的最好的事情就是尽力评估她的伤势，并要求造成她受伤的疏忽大意的卡车司机、他的雇主及其保险公司赔偿，以减轻这些伤害的负担。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The legal system cannot adequately compensate Keva Richardson for her injuries, just as medical science cannot cure them. The best it can do is attempt to measure her injuries and require the negligent truck driver who injured her, and his employer and their insurance companies, to pay money to ease the burden of those injuries.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>理查森遭受了多项损失。截至庭审时，她的医疗费用已达258,814美元，并且因失业而损失了收入。但她的损失并未就此结束。根据她的医生和经济专家的证词，陪审团估计，她的总收入损失将达到90万美元，未来的医疗费用将达到1100万美元。所有这些都构成了被告给她造成的经济损失，因此，法院判决其赔偿<em class="calibre8">经济损失</em>的赔偿金是合理的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Richardson suffered several kinds of losses. Up to the time of trial, she incurred medical expenses of $258,814, and she lost income from being out of work. But her losses did not end at the time of trial. Based on the testimony of her doctors and expert economists, the jury estimated that her total lost earnings would be $900,000 and her future medical expenses would be $11 million. All of these are elements of the financial loss inflicted on her by the defendant and are appropriately awarded as damages for <em class="calibre8">economic loss</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>受伤带来的经济损失甚至还不是全部。理查森的腿部和肩部疼痛难忍。由于事故中面部受伤，加上坐轮椅，她对自己的外表很不自在。她作证说，她最怀念的就是“能够早上起床开始新的一天”，然后独自度过这一天；她需要别人帮忙洗澡和穿衣，只能在光滑的路面上推轮椅，每六个小时需要有人插导尿管排空膀胱，每天排便也需要有人帮忙。当然，她也忍受着事故和手术带来的痛苦，现在无法进行以前可以做的很多活动，她知道自己无法重返空乘工作，也无法实现成为一名教师的梦想。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The financial consequences of the injury are not even the whole story. Richardson suffers pain in her legs and shoulders. She is self-conscious about her appearance because of the facial injuries she suffered in the accident and because of being in a wheelchair. What she misses most, she testified, is “just being able to get up in the morning and begin her day” and then go through the day without assistance from others; she requires help to shower and dress, she can only push her wheelchair on a smooth, level surface, and she needs help to empty her bladder by catheterization every six hours and to empty her bowels every day. Of course, she also endured the pain of the accident and her operation and now is unable to carry out many of the activities she could do before, and she knows she is unable to return to her job as a flight attendant or achieve her ambition of becoming a teacher.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>为了补偿此类损失，侵权法规定了<em class="calibre8">非经济损害</em>赔偿。陪审团判决理查森因残疾获得350万美元赔偿，因毁容获得210万美元赔偿，并因精神痛苦和折磨获得460万美元赔偿。虽然非经济损害赔偿通常被称为精神<em class="calibre8">痛苦和折磨</em>，但理查森的案例表明，其范围远不止于此。除了受伤带来的身体疼痛外，她的生活质量也受到了影响，因为她无法进行正常的日常活动，无法像事故前那样享受生活，也无法实现自己的梦想。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To compensate for losses like these, tort law gives <em class="calibre8">noneconomic damages</em>. The jury awarded Richardson $3.5 million for being disabled, $2.1 million for disfigurement, and $4.6 million for pain and suffering. Although noneconomic damages are commonly referred to as <em class="calibre8">pain and suffering</em>, Richardson’s case illustrates why they are broader than that. In addition to the physical pain caused by her injuries, she suffers a loss of quality of life in being unable to carry on her normal, daily activities, to enjoy life in the same way she could before the accident, and to fulfill her dreams.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这里的原则很容易表述：金钱赔偿是为了消除伤害造成的经济后果，并为非经济后果提供金钱补偿。原告所需的赔偿金额取决于被告造成的损害。出于公平和社会政策的考虑，被告应对这些损害负责。（具体规则要复杂得多）<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_174" class="calibre4"></a>当然，在它们的应用中，但我们不会担心这里的细节。）请注意这个看似简单的系统的几个显著特点。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The principle here is easy to state: Money damages are awarded to remove the economic consequences of an injury and to provide monetary compensation for the noneconomic consequences. The amount required to compensate the plaintiff is the measure of the harm done by the defendant. The defendant is responsible for these damages as a matter of fairness and social policy. (The rules are much more complicated <a class="calibre4"></a>in their application, of course, but we will not worry about the details here.) Notice several striking features of this seemingly simple system.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>首先，该制度遵循单一判决规则。侵权损害赔偿仅在庭审时判给一次。庭审时，过去的损害赔偿相对简单明了。理查森发生了医疗费用，并提交了账单来证明，而且她有一段时间没有工作，可以证明她在那段时间应该赚多少钱。疼痛和痛苦的损害赔偿则更加模糊（稍后会详细介绍），但至少原告和其他证人可以描述她当时的感受、她的活动如何受到限制等等。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>First, the system operates under a single-judgment rule. Tort damages are awarded only once, at the time of trial. At the time of trial the past damages are relatively straightforward. Richardson incurred medical expenses and presented bills to prove it, and she was out of work for a time and could prove what she would have earned for that time. Damages for pain and suffering are much hazier (more on that in a moment), but at least the plaintiff and other witnesses could describe how she had been feeling, how her activities had been limited, and so on.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>单一判决规则还要求对未来进行预测，而未来必然是不确定的。法院必须根据双方提供的证据，对原告未来的损失做出预测。原告的伤势可能会好转，也可能会恶化，需要进一步治疗或进行大手术。她的疼痛和正常活动能力可能会减轻，也可能会增强。凯娃·理查森是一名空乘人员，拥有小学教育学士学位，她预计将重返研究生院，然后从事教学工作。预测她未来几十年的职业道路，以及由此导致的她收入能力的损失，需要进行推测。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The single-judgment rule also requires a prediction about the future, and the future is necessarily uncertain. The court must make a prediction about the plaintiff’s future losses based on the evidence presented by both parties. The plaintiff’s injury might get better or worse, requiring little more treatment or major surgery. Her pain and her ability to function normally might diminish or increase. Keva Richardson was working as a flight attendant, she had a bachelor’s degree in elementary education, and she expected to return to graduate school and then teach. Predicting her future career path over several decades, and therefore her lost earning capacity, requires speculation.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>单一判决规则是精准执行侵权法政策优于行政效率的一个例子。法院可以无限期地控制案件，要求被告在原告产生费用时支付，并定期补偿非经济损失。侵权法制度不会这样做，因为这会过于复杂和繁琐；为了简化程序，我们接受这样一个事实：许多关于未来损害赔偿的预测最终都会被证明是错误的，事实会证明原告获得的赔偿过少，而被告支付的赔偿不足，反之亦然。在越来越多的案件中，原告并非一次性获得损害赔偿。相反，通过<em class="calibre8">结构化和解</em>，赔偿金会分期支付，就像年金一样。有时，双方会使用结构化和解来保证未来需要时资金可用。在其他情况下，侵权行为改革法规要求采用结构化和解，甚至规定如果原告死亡，福利将终止，这对被告有利。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The single-judgment rule is an instance in which serving the tort policies in a precise manner yields to administrative efficiency. The court could maintain control of the case into the indefinite future, requiring the defendant to pay the plaintiff’s expenses as they arise and compensate periodically for noneconomic losses. The tort system does not do this because it would be too complicated and burdensome; to make things simpler, we accept the fact that many of the predictions about future damages will turn out to be wrong, with the plaintiff getting too little and the defendant not paying enough, or vice versa, as the facts turn out. In an increasing number of cases, the plaintiff does not receive the damage award in a lump sum. Instead, through a <em class="calibre8">structured settlement</em>, the award is paid out over time, much like an annuity. Sometimes the parties use a structured settlement to guarantee that the money will be available as it is needed in the future. In other cases, tort reform statutes require that a structured settlement be used, and even provide that benefits end if the plaintiff dies, which works to the defendant’s benefit.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>其次，损害赔偿金额是根据具体事故和原告的具体情况而定的。凯娃·理查德森（Keva Richardson）因自身事故获得了损害赔偿，而不是因普通的追尾事故或像她这样有健康问题的普通人获得损害赔偿。或者想象一下，一系列司机，每个人都无视停车标志，开车驶入十字路口，撞到了行人。每个司机都犯了<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_175" class="calibre4"></a>相同的疏忽行为，但赔偿金额却大相径庭。第一位司机只是擦伤了行人，因此行人仅受轻伤。这位司机的赔偿金额微不足道。第二位司机也只是擦伤了行人，但行人患有退行性骨病，因此车辆的轻微碰撞导致其双腿严重骨折。根据“被告对受害者的处境负责”的原则，被告应对原告的巨额医疗费用和巨额收入损失承担全部责任。第三位司机碾压了行人，使其受重伤，但这位行人是一位年老体弱、寿命短且没有工作的人，因此未来经济和非经济损失的赔偿金额很小。第四位司机也碾压了行人，但这位行人恰好是篮球巨星勒布朗·詹姆斯，因此该司机应对詹姆斯数千万美元的收入损失负责。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Second, the damage award is individualized to the particular accident and the circumstances of the particular plaintiff. Keva Richardson received the damages from her accident, not from the average rear-end car accident or the average person with a medical condition like hers. Or imagine a series of drivers, each of whom ignores a stop sign and drives into an intersection, hitting a pedestrian. Each driver commits <a class="calibre4"></a>an identical act of negligence but pays a very different damage award. The first driver delivers only a glancing blow, so the pedestrian is only slightly bruised. That driver’s damages will be trivial. The second driver also delivers a glancing blow, but the pedestrian suffers from a degenerative bone disease, so the slight touch of the car causes major fractures of both legs. Under the rule that the defendant “takes the victim as he finds him,” the defendant is liable for all of the plaintiff’s huge medical bills and substantial income loss. The third driver runs over the pedestrian, seriously injuring him, but this pedestrian is an ailing, elderly person with a short life expectancy and no job, so the damages for future economic and noneconomic losses are small. The fourth driver also runs over the pedestrian, but the pedestrian happens to be basketball superstar LeBron James, so the driver is liable for James’s lost earning capacity in the tens of millions of dollars.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>正如这些假设所表明的那样，赔偿原告实际损失的愿望与激励正当行为的侵权政策相冲突。过失行为的成本难以提前预测，且在实践中具有偶然性，这使得被告难以评估在合理谨慎方面应投入多少资金。这些假设还表明，侵权损害赔偿与许多其他事物一样，遵循社会现有的财富和收入分配。侵权法对富裕、高收入原告的赔偿高于对经济前景较差的贫困原告的赔偿。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As these hypotheticals suggest, the desire to compensate the plaintiff for her actual losses is in tension with the tort policy of providing incentives for proper conduct. The costs of a negligent act are hard to predict in advance and fortuitous in practice, making it difficult for defendants to assess how much to invest in reasonable care. They also suggest that tort damages, like so many other things, follow the existing distribution of wealth and income in society. Tort law compensates rich, highly paid plaintiffs more than poor plaintiffs with fewer economic prospects.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第三，陪审团的损害赔偿裁决并非最终裁决。初审法官以及（在较小程度上）上诉法院可以审查裁决并撤销原判。通常的审查标准是，陪审团的裁决“与证据的权重相悖”；这是一种尊重的审查标准，因为损害赔偿是陪审团职权范围内的事实，只有当裁决反映的是个人的主观情绪或偏见，而非对证据的理性评估时，才应该推翻裁决。（这解释了为什么上诉法院在审查裁决时应该更加谨慎，因为实际上只有初审法官听取了所有证据。）一些州的侵权法改革法规赋予了法官更多审查陪审团裁决的权力；例如，在纽约州，如果裁决“与合理赔偿金额存在重大偏差”，则可以被推翻。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Third, the jury’s award of damages is not the final word on the subject. The trial judge and, to a lesser extent, the appellate court can review the award and set aside the verdict. The usual standard for doing so is that the jury’s award is “against the weight of the evidence”; this is a deferential standard of review, because damages are a fact within the jury’s purview, and the award should be upset only if it reflects passion or prejudice rather than a reasoned assessment of the evidence. (This explains why the appellate court should be more circumspect in reviewing the verdict, because only the trial judge actually heard all the evidence.) Some state tort reform statutes have given the judges more power to review jury verdicts; in New York, for example, a verdict can be overturned if it “deviates materially from what would be reasonable compensation.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在绝大多数案件中，法官审查陪审团的损害赔偿裁决是否过高，而不是过低。对过高判决的传统补救措施是判被告重新审判。然而，有时，法院会通过一种被称为<em class="calibre8">“减刑”</em>的机制，让原告选择再次开庭审理，或者在不重新审判的情况下接受较小的赔偿。例如，在凯娃·理查德森一案中，上诉法院裁定，未来损害赔偿金<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_176" class="calibre4"></a>医疗费用高于证据所证明的合理金额，因此他们下令减刑100万美元，将陪审团的判决金额减少了100万美元。减刑节省了重新审判的费用，但也使原告面临艰难的选择：要么获得比陪审团认为她应得的金额更少的赔偿，要么承受重新审判的拖延和费用，并决定是否由第二个陪审团来决定。如果原告需要这笔钱来支付后续的护理或生活费用，那么这种选择就尤其困难。（法院提供的附加程序<em class="calibre8">，</em>即法院让被告选择支付更高的赔偿金或再次开庭审判，这种程序很少使用。）</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the overwhelming majority of cases, judges review jury damage awards to determine if they are too high, not if they are too low. The traditional remedy for an excessive verdict is to award a new trial to the defendant. Sometimes, however, through a device known as <em class="calibre8">remittitur</em>, the court offers the plaintiff a choice between going to trial again or taking a smaller award without a new trial. In Keva Richardson’s case, for example, the appellate court determined that the damages for future <a class="calibre4"></a>medical costs were higher than the evidence justified, so they ordered remittitur in the amount of $1 million, reducing the jury’s award by that amount. Remittitur saves the expense of a new trial, but it also can put to the plaintiff a difficult choice: take less than the jury thought she was entitled to or undergo the delay and expense of a new trial and roll the dice on a second jury. The choice is particularly difficult if the plaintiff needs the money for ongoing care or living expenses. (The parallel procedure of <em class="calibre8">additur</em>, by which the court offers the defendant the choice of paying a larger award or going to trial again, is used much less often.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第四，许多侵权赔偿金中很大一部分用于赔偿受害人的非经济损失。非经济损失包括身体疼痛和折磨、因受伤而产生的极度痛苦或抑郁、因残疾或毁容而产生的精神损害、生活乐趣的丧失、无法进行正常活动（例如在公园散步或享受性生活），以及所有其他因受伤而导致的精神痛苦。毫无疑问，这些都是真实的损失，但金钱也无法弥补这些损失，这一点也毋庸置疑。传统上，法院认为，非经济损失赔偿金有多种用途。它在一定程度上（尽管可能不充分）衡量了受害人的损失，确认了受害人受伤的严重性，并要求被告承担其不法行为的全部成本（这鼓励潜在被告在计算应采取的谨慎程度时将这些成本考虑在内）。它还为受害人提供了一笔资金，用于开展可以减轻其痛苦并弥补其乐趣损失的活动和娱乐活动；例如，能够建造新游泳池的受害人可能会找到某种方式来弥补她失去的打网球的能力。最后，非经济损失赔偿金提供了一种支付原告律师费的手段，同时又能保持经济损失赔偿的完整性；否则，原告将因需要支付律师费而无法获得对其经济损失的充分补偿。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Fourth, a substantial portion of many tort awards is for the victim’s noneconomic loss. Noneconomic loss includes physical pain and suffering, anguish or depression resulting from an injury, emotional harm that accompanies disability or disfigurement, loss of enjoyment of life, inability to perform normal activities such as taking a walk in the park or enjoying sexual relations, and all other forms of emotional distress caused by an injury. There is no doubt that these are real losses, but there also is no doubt that money doesn’t make up for them. Traditionally, courts have concluded that an award for noneconomic loss serves several purposes. It provides some measure, however inadequate, of the victim’s loss, affirming the significance of her injury and requiring that the defendant bear the full cost of his wrongdoing (which encourages potential defendants to take those costs into account in calculating how much care to exercise). It also provides the victim a fund for activities and pleasures that can reduce her pain and make up for her loss of enjoyment; the victim who can build a new swimming pool may find a partial substitute for her lost ability to play tennis. Finally, damages for noneconomic loss provide a means of paying the plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees while allowing the award for economic loss to remain intact; otherwise, the plaintiff is not fully compensated for her economic loss because of the need to pay a lawyer.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这些理由对他们来说相当有力。然而，侵权法改革者认为事情已经走得太远，并在大多数州颁布了限制非经济损失赔偿的立法。一项被广泛采用的措施于1975年在加利福尼亚州首次颁布，此后一直受到侵权法改革者的欢迎，该措施规定医疗事故案件中非经济损失的绝对上限为25万美元。绝对上限对不同的受害者有不同的影响。例如，在加利福尼亚州，婴儿和妇女是最常受到赔偿限制的群体。出生时遭受终身致残伤害的婴儿可能会因为受伤程度而遭受巨大的非经济损失，但这些损失的赔偿金受到上限的限制。相反，女性的平均经济损失相对于非经济损失较小。<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_177" class="calibre4"></a>由于收入能力较低，她们的损失比男性更大，因此她们的赔偿金额也很可能被上限削减。例如，一位全职妈妈可能不会因为不必要的乳房切除术而遭受收入损失，因此与她高收入的丈夫相比，她的非经济损失将占赔偿金的更重要部分。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These reasons have considerable power to them. Tort reformers think things have gone too far, however, and have enacted in most states legislation limiting damages for noneconomic loss. One widely adopted measure, first enacted in California in 1975 and popular among tort reformers ever since, imposes an absolute cap of $250,000 on noneconomic damages in medical malpractice cases. An absolute cap affects different victims in different ways. In California, for example, infants and women are among the groups whose damages are most often capped. Infants who suffer lifelong, disabling injuries at birth are likely to have huge noneconomic losses because of the extent of their injuries, but the damages for those losses are limited by the cap. Conversely, women on average have smaller economic losses relative to their noneconomic <a class="calibre4"></a>losses than men, because of their lower earning capacity, so they are also very likely to have their damages cut by the cap. A stay-at-home mom may suffer no income loss from an unnecessary mastectomy, for example, so her noneconomic loss will be a more important part of her award, compared to that of her high-earning husband.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>事实上，设定赔偿上限可能会让许多受害者完全得不到任何救济。设定赔偿上限会降低潜在的赔偿额，从而降低受害者律师的潜在胜诉费。因此，律师不太可能接手责任不明确或经济损失不大的案件；遭受不必要手术的母亲可能找不到愿意接手她案件的律师。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Indeed, the effect of a cap may be to deny many victims a remedy at all. A damage cap reduces the potential recovery and therefore reduces the potential contingent fee for the victim’s lawyer. Therefore, lawyers are less likely to take cases in which liability is not clear or economic loss is not large; the mom who suffered an unnecessary operation may not be able to find a lawyer willing to take her case.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0011_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-5-div1-12"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0044" class="calibre1">何时判给损害赔偿金以惩罚被告？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0044" class="calibre1">When Are Damages Awarded to Punish the Defendant?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">典型的侵权损害赔偿纯粹是补偿性的。这些损害赔偿可能会给被告带来沉重的负担，甚至导致其破产，但损害赔偿的衡量标准是原告的损失。然而，在极端情况下，法院会判处另一种损害赔偿，其唯一目的是惩罚被告的错误行为。这种损害赔偿被称为<em class="calibre8">惩罚性损害赔偿</em>或<em class="calibre8">惩戒性损害赔偿</em>。</p><p class="noindent">The typical tort damages are purely compensatory. They may be burdensome to the defendant, even to the point of bankruptcy, but the measure of damages is the plaintiff’s loss. In extreme cases, however, a different kind of damage is awarded with the sole purpose of punishing the defendant for doing wrong. These are called <em class="calibre8">punitive damages</em> or <em class="calibre8">exemplary damages</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>从法律和实践角度来看，只有极少数案件会判处惩罚性赔偿。各州关于惩罚性赔偿的法律规定各不相同，但所有州都要求被告的行为必须超出一般过失或典型的故意侵权行为的范围，才能判处惩罚性赔偿。判罚标准包括：被告的行为是否“令人震惊”、“令人发指”，或是否表现出对原告安全的“鲁莽漠视”或“故意且肆意漠视”。由于标准狭窄，在最终判决的侵权案件中，只有1%或2%的案件会判处惩罚性赔偿。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As a matter of law and practice, punitive damages are awarded in only a very small number of cases. The law on punitive damages varies from state to state, but everywhere something more than ordinary negligence or even the typical intentional tort is required before punitive damages can be awarded. The tests are stated in terms such as whether the defendant’s conduct “shocks the conscience,” is “outrageous,” or demonstrates a “reckless indifference” or “willful and wanton disregard” for the safety of the plaintiff. Because of the narrowness of the standard, punitive damages are awarded in only 1 or 2 percent of the tort cases that go to judgment.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>惩罚性赔偿，尤其是巨额惩罚性赔偿，最常用于商业案件。例如，美国最高法院关于惩罚性赔偿的一起重要案件涉及畅销产品莱泽曼多功能工具制造商对其竞争对手提起的虚假广告诉讼。然而，人身伤害案件有时也会产生巨额惩罚性赔偿。石棉制造商数十年来一直隐瞒石棉的有害影响，并在多起案件中被追究惩罚性赔偿责任。陪审团判给一位妻子死于中毒性休克综合症的丈夫1000万美元的惩罚性赔偿，因为在其他卫生棉条制造商对信息做出回应的时候，Playtex公司故意无视将高吸收性卫生棉条与该综合症联系起来的研究和医学报告。<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_178" class="calibre4"></a>通过修改或从市场上撤回其高吸收率卫生棉条来损害赔偿；审判法官将赔偿金额降至135万美元，并在上诉中维持了减少后的赔偿金额。AH Robins公司在堪萨斯州的一起案件中因“恶意沉默”隐瞒其Dalkon Shield避孕装置的危害信息而被判赔偿1000万美元。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Punitive damages, especially large amounts of punitive damages, are most often awarded in commercial cases. A leading U.S. Supreme Court case on punitive damages, for example, involved a false advertising claim by the maker of the popular Leatherman multifunction tool against one of its competitors. Sometimes, though, personal injury cases produce substantial punitive damage awards. Asbestos manufacturers concealed the harmful effects of asbestos for decades and were held accountable through punitive damages in several cases. A jury awarded $10 million in punitive damages to a husband whose wife died of toxic shock syndrome, because Playtex deliberately disregarded studies and medical reports linking superabsorbent tampons and the syndrome at a time when other tampon manufacturers responded to the information <a class="calibre4"></a>by modifying or withdrawing from the market their high-absorbency tampons; the trial judge reduced the award to $1.35 million, and the reduced award was upheld on appeal. A. H. Robins Co. was held liable for $10 million in a Kansas case for “malicious silence” in concealing information about the dangers of its Dalkon Shield contraceptive device.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>惩罚性赔偿有两个目的。顾名思义，惩罚被告的不法行为。法律惩罚不法行为的方式多种多样，其中刑事程序最为常见。行政处罚具有惩罚性功能，例如机动车管理局吊销驾驶执照，或证券交易委员会吊销股票经纪人执照。但私人民事诉讼也服务于公共价值，寻求惩罚性赔偿的原告成为公共利益的私人检察官。故意制造危险产品的被告的危险或不法行为可能不符合犯罪行为的定义，也未必会引起检察官的注意。惩罚性赔偿与刑事处罚一样具有惩罚性，赔偿金的判给是对受害原告以这种方式服务于公共利益的奖励和激励。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Punitive damages serve two purposes. As the name suggests, they punish the defendant for its wrongdoing. The law has different means of punishing wrongdoers; the criminal process is the most obvious. Administrative penalties serve a punitive function—such as when the motor vehicles bureau suspends a driver’s license or the Securities and Exchange Commission suspends a stockbroker’s license. But private civil litigation also serves public values, and plaintiffs who seek punitive damages become private prosecutors of the public good. The dangerous or wrongful behavior of defendants who intentionally manufacture dangerous products might not fit within a definition of criminal conduct or come to the attention of the public prosecutor. Punitive damages punish just as criminal penalties do, and the award of damages is a reward and incentive to the injured plaintiff to serve the public good in this way.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第二个目的是增强侵权法的威慑力。在某些情况下，被告的行为极其恶劣，以至于补偿性赔偿似乎不足以起到震慑作用。在其他情况下，补偿性赔偿也不足以阻止所有受害受害者提起诉讼或获得赔偿。在这两种情况下，惩罚性赔偿都降低了被告实施不法行为的动机，如同一根巨棒，迫使潜在的不法行为者三思而后行。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The second purpose is to enhance the deterrent effect of tort law. In some cases, the defendant’s conduct is so outrageous that the award of compensatory damages seems insufficient to deter it. In other cases, compensatory damages are inadequate because all of the injured victims will not sue or recover. In both situations, punitive damages reduce the defendant’s incentive to engage in wrongful conduct, acting as a big stick that requires a potential wrongdoer to think twice about the consequences of his or her actions.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>从数量上看，惩罚性赔偿并非侵权法体系的重要组成部分。尽管新闻报道颇为引人注目，但近年来判处惩罚性赔偿的案件比例实际上并未增加，而且大多数惩罚性赔偿裁决源于不正当商业交易，而非人身伤害。尽管如此，惩罚性赔偿还是引起了侵权法改革者的关注，并在许多司法管辖区受到抨击。抨击的关键在于陪审团在决定何时判处惩罚性赔偿以及赔偿金额时拥有的自由裁量权。与设定精神痛苦和创伤赔偿金一样，法官会向陪审团提供指导方针，但陪审团在决定惩罚被告所需的金额方面拥有一定的自由裁量权。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Punitive damages are not numerically an important part of the tort system. Despite spectacular news reports, the proportion of cases in which punitive damages are awarded has not really increased in recent years, and most punitive damage awards arise out of wrongful business transactions, not personal injuries. Nevertheless, punitive damages have attracted the attention of tort reformers and are under attack in many jurisdictions. The key to the attack is the degree of discretion afforded to the jury in determining when to award punitive damages and how high they should be. As in setting pain and suffering damages, the judge gives guidelines to the jury, but the jury has leeway in determining what amount is necessary to punish the defendant.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>由于这些攻击，一些州的法规对惩罚性赔偿的判决施加了限制。一些法规对惩罚性赔偿设定了上限，要么是固定金额，要么是补偿性赔偿的倍数。另一些法规则规定了更高的举证责任，或对可判处惩罚性赔偿的行为类型设定了严格的限制。<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_179" class="calibre4"></a>可以判处损害赔偿金。美国最高法院还制定了惩罚性赔偿金的合宪限制。在 1996 年开始的一系列案件中，法院确定了惩罚性赔偿金的判罚标准，超过该标准即构成违宪。例如，在<em class="calibre8">State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. 诉 Campbell</em> (2003) 案中，一名投保人证明 State Farm 通过欺诈、谎言、销毁文件和“疯狗式防御策略”实施了一项长达二十年的计划，限制其保单的赔付，但该计划的受害者很少起诉 State Farm。除了 260 万美元的精神损害补偿金（法官将其减为 100 万美元）外，陪审团还判给投保人 1.45 亿美元，以惩罚 State Farm 的不法行为并阻止其未来的不当行为。法院虽然承认State Farm的行为“不值得赞扬”，但同时裁定，陪审团只能考虑对个人投保人造成的损害，而不能考虑其所属的更广泛体系，并且很少有惩罚性赔偿与补偿性赔偿比例超过个位数的裁决符合宪法。因此，针对最恶劣行为的最高额赔偿最有可能被削减。<a id="text/part0011_split_001.html.page_180" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As a result of these attacks, a number of state statutes have imposed restrictions on the award of punitive damages. Some statutes cap punitive damages, either at a flat dollar amount or as a multiple of the compensatory damages award. Others impose higher burdens of proof or set narrow limits on the kind of behavior for which punitive <a class="calibre4"></a>damages can be awarded. The U.S. Supreme Court also has developed constitutional limits on punitive damages. In a series of cases beginning in 1996, the Court defined a standard for the award of punitive damages beyond which they are constitutionally excessive. In <em class="calibre8">State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Campbell</em> (2003), for example, a policyholder proved that State Farm had engaged in a twenty-year scheme of limiting payouts on its policies by fraud, lies, document destruction, and “mad dog defense tactics,” but it was seldom sued by victims of the scheme. In addition to compensatory damages of $2.6 million for emotional distress (which the judge reduced to $1 million), the jury awarded a policyholder $145 million to punish State Farm for its wrongdoing and to deter future misconduct. The Court, while acknowledging that State Farm’s conduct “merited no praise,” held that the jury could only consider the harm done to the individual policyholder and not the broader scheme of which it was a part and that few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio of punitive to compensatory damages would pass constitutional muster. As a result, the largest awards, directed at the worst behavior, are the most likely to be cut.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>

<p class="noindent">合同法涉及承诺和协议的制定、履行和违约的各个方面。人们无时无刻不在做出承诺和达成协议。周六晚上，达娜邀请布莱恩到她公寓吃饭；布莱恩说他会过来带酒。一位消费者通过签署背面印有细则的表格来接受Visa卡的垃圾邮件邀请，或者通过在线填写表格并点击“我接受”框来申请Visa卡。一位工人接受了新工作，无论是否签订了书面雇佣合同。一家建筑公司与一家土地开发商签订了建造大型办公楼的合同。</p><p class="noindent">Contract law concerns all aspects of the making, keeping, and breaking of promises and agreements. People make promises and agreements all the time. Dana asks Brian over to her apartment for dinner Saturday night; he says he will come and bring the wine. A consumer accepts a junk mail solicitation for a Visa card by signing a form with paragraphs of fine-print terms on the back or signs up for a Visa card by filling in a form online and clicking the “I accept” box. A worker takes a new job, with or without a written employment contract. A construction company contracts with a land developer for the erection of a large office building.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这些承诺和协议，以及人们每天做出的数百万承诺和协议，彼此之间有着巨大的差异。同意去吃饭和同意建造一座办公楼是两码事。同意在一个普通的周六晚上去吃饭甚至和同意参加一生一次的毕业舞会也是两码事。在当地麦当劳兼职翻汉堡和签署成为麦当劳公司总裁的雇佣合同也是两码事。尽管存在差异，但合同法涵盖了所有这些事件。如果布莱恩放了黛娜的鸽子，她可以起诉布莱恩，要求赔偿她在食物上花的钱吗？<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_182" class="calibre4"></a>和一件新裙子？Visa 客户是否应该受到所有他未曾阅读、也根本不会理解的条款的约束？如果办公楼的建造耗时数月，而且远远超出预算，那么谁应该负责——开发商还是建筑公司？合同法提供了答案，或者至少提供了一个工具，让我们可以借此探讨答案的真正含义。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These promises and agreements, and the millions more that people make every day, are vastly different from each other. Agreeing to come to dinner is different from agreeing to build an office building. Agreeing to come to dinner on a typical Saturday night is even different from agreeing to go to the once-in-a-lifetime senior prom. Taking a part-time job flipping burgers at the local McDonald’s is different from signing an employment contract to become president of McDonald’s Corporation. Despite the differences, contract law deals with all of these events. If Brian stands up Dana, can she sue him for the money she spent on food <a class="calibre4"></a>and a new dress? Is the Visa customer bound by all the fine print he didn’t read and wouldn’t understand anyway? If the office building takes months longer to build and comes in far over budget, who is responsible—the developer or the construction company? Contract law provides the answers, or at least the vehicle through which we can argue about what the answers should be.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>合同法管辖不同类型的协议，不论协议由谁签订或其标的是什么，但某些类型的协议不在其管辖范围内。例如，合同法管辖福特总裁与该公司之间的雇佣合同，但一项称为劳动法的专门法律管辖福特与代表福特工厂工人的工会全美汽车工人联合会之间的集体谈判协议。律师事务所合伙人之间的协议是合同，但管辖该协议的不是一般合同法，而是合伙法。合同法的规则和原则是劳动法和合伙法的基础，但它们已被调整以满足专门标的的需要。这样，合同法就成为一种剩余法律——它处理的是某些类型的合同由其他更专业的法律领域处理之后剩下的所有协议。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Contract law governs different types of agreements without regard for who made them or what their subject matter is, but some types of agreements are excluded from its scope. For example, contract law governs the employment contract between the president of Ford and the company, but a specialized body of law, known as labor law, governs the collective bargaining agreement between Ford and the United Auto Workers, the union that represents Ford’s factory workers. The agreement among the partners in a law firm is a contract, but partnership law, rather than general contract law, controls the agreement. The rules and principles of contract law underlie labor law and partnership law, but they have been adapted to meet the needs of the specialized subject matter. In this way, contract law is residual—it deals with all those agreements that are left over after certain types of contracts are dealt with by other, more specialized areas of law.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>合同法注重承诺和协议，这使其有别于私法的另外两个主要领域：财产法和侵权法。承诺和协议着眼于未来——例如周六晚上的某个日期，或是几年后办公楼的建成。因此，合同法关注的是未来<em class="calibre8">。</em>当某人做出承诺却未能兑现时，合同法会要求其赔偿，因为她未能实现其承诺所承诺的未来状态。另一方面，财产法处理的是现状<em class="calibre8">。</em>当侵入者未经许可进入他人财产时，侵入者应对干扰现有状态承担责任——即所有者使用该财产并禁止他人使用的权利。侵权法关注的是过去状态<em class="calibre8">——</em>损害发生之前的过去状态。因疏忽而致行人受伤的司机应承担责任，因为他剥夺了行人在事故前拥有的某些东西，例如健康或赚钱能力，从而使行人的处境比以前更糟。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Contract law’s focus on promises and agreements distinguishes it from the two other major areas of private law: property law and tort law. Promises and agreements look to the future—the date on Saturday night or the building of an office building over a period of years. Contract law, therefore, is concerned with what <em class="calibre8">will be</em>. When someone makes a promise and fails to keep it, contract law makes her pay because she has failed to bring about a future state of affairs to which her promise committed her. Property law, on the other hand, deals with what <em class="calibre8">is</em>. When a trespasser enters someone’s property without permission, the trespasser is liable for interfering with an existing state of affairs—the owner’s right to use the property and to exclude others from using it. Tort law looks to what <em class="calibre8">was</em>—the past state of affairs before harm occurred. A driver who negligently injures a pedestrian is liable because he has made the pedestrian worse off than he was before by taking away something the pedestrian had before the accident, such as his health or earning capacity.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0012_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-6-div1-3"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0047" class="calibre1">为什么我们需要合同法？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0047" class="calibre1">Why Do We Need Contract Law?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">从律师的角度来看，合同是社会运转的机制，而合同法则是使这一机制更好地运转的润滑剂。在市场经济中，工作完成、商品分配、劳动分工和生产协调都通过……<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_183" class="calibre4"></a>合同。人们需要一种交通工具，而福特通过销售廉价的小型车和大型SUV来满足人们的需求。如果汽车外观漂亮且价格具有竞争力，人们就会签订合同购买。福特通过雇佣工人、购买钢材和成品轮胎、在电视上宣传汽车、授权当地经销商销售其汽车以及签订数千份其他合同来满足消费者需求。这种复杂的生产和分销体系并非像前苏联那样由汽车生产中央委员指挥；相反，它是由众多合同相互作用而形成的。</p><p class="noindent">From the lawyer’s perspective, contracts are the mechanism by which society works and contract law is the lubricant that makes the mechanism work better. In a market economy, work is done, goods are distributed, and specialization of labor and production is coordinated through <a class="calibre4"></a>contracts. People want a means of transportation, and Ford makes it available to them by offering for sale cheap subcompacts and large SUVs. If the cars are attractive and the price competitive, people will contract to buy them. Ford meets consumer demand by hiring workers, buying raw steel and finished tires, advertising the cars on television, franchising local dealers to sell its cars, and entering into a thousand other contracts. This complex system of production and distribution is not dictated by a Central Commissar of Automobile Production, as it might have been in the former Soviet Union; instead, it is organized through the interaction of many contracts.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这些合约使参与者受益：福特希望盈利，其员工获得报酬，固特异以盈利的方式向福特出售轮胎，而购车者则以诱人的价格获得一辆可用的汽车。经济学理论认为，每个人都能从基于合约的市场体系中受益，因为人们可以得到他们想要的东西，并且资源得到了最有效的利用。如果驾驶者想要省油且易于停车的汽车，福特就会生产和销售更多的混合动力汽车和小型车；如果他们想要高油耗的汽车，福特就会提供SUV。如果福特对消费者需求的猜测错误，那么丰田就会获得他们的生意。所有这些经济效应都是通过合约协调个人选择而实现的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These contracts benefit the participants: Ford hopes to make a profit, its workers get paid, Goodyear sells tires at a profit to Ford, and the car buyer gets a usable car at an attractive price. Economic theory asserts that everyone benefits from a contract-based market system because people get what they want and resources are used most effectively. If drivers want fuel-efficient cars that are easy to park, Ford will produce and sell more hybrids and subcompacts; if they want big gas guzzlers, Ford will provide SUVs. If Ford guesses wrong about what consumers want, Toyota will get their business instead. All of these economic effects are achieved by the coordination of individual choices through contracts.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>契约过程提供的不仅仅是产品。人们可以通过达成的协议来满足自己的愿望，实现人生目标。上大学、选择工作、建造房屋、收藏艺术品以及加入健身俱乐部，所有这些都是通过契约来实现的。广义上讲，契约过程关乎每个人的自由和自主权。根据这种观点，在我们这种开放、民主的社会中，个人的自由取决于他们能够做出的选择。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The contract process provides more than products. People can fulfill their desires and achieve what they want in life through the agreements they make. Going to college, choosing one job over another, building a home, collecting art, and joining health clubs are all accomplished through contracts. Seen broadly, the contracting process is about the freedom and autonomy of each individual. In our kind of open, democratic society, according to this view, individuals are free to the extent that they can make choices.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>因此，合同定义了我们所说的基于市场和个人选择的社会。合同法在实现这种社会方面发挥了两项特殊功能。它为交易提供了纠纷解决机制，并体现了社会对自由和自治的承诺。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Contracts, therefore, define what we mean by a society based on the market and individual choice. Contract law has two special functions in making this kind of society possible. It provides a dispute resolution mechanism for exchanges, and it demonstrates society’s commitment to freedom and autonomy.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如果双方的履行可以在合同签订时发生，那么合同法就没有必要了。然而，立即、同时履行的情况很少发生。购房协议必须在交易完成前几周或几个月达成，以便买方有时间获得抵押贷款，卖方有时间准备搬家。因此，合同法为预期未来的交易提供了保障。在达成协议和最终履行之间，可能会发生许多事情，<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_184" class="calibre4"></a>这可能会破坏双方关系。买家可能会找到更好的房子，改变主意，或者无法获得抵押贷款。合同法通过为未来需要履行的协议提供执行机制，确保合同双方能够依据他人对其做出的承诺进行计划或投资。卖家可以准备搬家，因为他们知道合同法可以阻止买家改变主意，并在买家试图反悔时为卖家提供补救措施。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If the performance of both parties to an agreement could occur at the moment the contract is made, contract law would be unnecessary. Immediate, simultaneous performance is seldom the case, however. An agreement to buy a house must be made weeks or months before the deal closes to allow time for the buyer to obtain a mortgage and for the seller to prepare to move. Therefore, contract law provides security for exchanges that are projected into the future. Between the time of agreement and the time for final performance, many things can happen that <a class="calibre4"></a>may upset the relationship. The buyer may find a better house, have a change of heart, or be unable to get a mortgage. By providing an enforcement mechanism for agreements that are to be performed in the future, contract law assures contracting parties that they can make plans or investments in reliance on the promises others have made to them. The home seller can get ready to move, knowing that contract law deters the buyer from changing his mind and gives the seller a remedy if the buyer does try to back out.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>合同法还提供了一种机制，用于解决合同履行过程中或履行后出现的问题。房屋买卖双方可能没有在销售合同中明确规定如果房屋在交割前被烧毁会如何处理，但如果出现此类问题，法律会予以处理。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Contract law also offers a mechanism for working out problems that arise during or after performance. The home seller and buyer may not have stated in their sales contract what happens if the house burns down before the time of closing, but the law will deal with that problem if it arises.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>虽然合同法在履行这些职能方面发挥着重要作用，但律师们往往夸大其重要性。合同法固然重要——合同双方在规划、起草协议以及解决纠纷时都会咨询律师——但纵观整个社会的合同领域，我们就会发现合同法只是其中的一小部分。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>While contract law is useful in performing these functions, lawyers are inclined to overstate its importance. Contract law is important— contracting parties consult their lawyers for help in planning and drafting agreements and resolving disputes—but when we look at the entire landscape of contracting in society, we see that contract law is only a small part of the picture.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>大多数协议的谈判和执行都毫无障碍。法学院的学生被训练成把每笔交易都视为潜在的灾难，因此律师常常忽视事情通常如何顺利进行。例如，福特、其供应商和经销商每年签订的数百万份合同中，只有少数会出现问题。大多数情况下，固特异轮胎都能按时交付，并且质量符合规定，购车者也能顺利从经销商处提车。在一个基于私人协议的经济体中，大多数情况下一切都必须顺利进行，否则系统就会崩溃。幸运的是，一切通常都能顺利进行，因此合同法介入的场合相对较少。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Most agreements are negotiated and performed with no trouble. Law students are trained to look on every deal as a potential disaster, so lawyers often lose sight of how well things usually work. For example, of the millions of contracts made each year by Ford, its suppliers, and its dealers, only a small number generate problems. Most of the time Goodyear delivers the tires on time and they are of the specified quality, and the car buyer gets the car from the dealer with no problem. In an economy based on private agreements, everything has to run smoothly most of the time or the system falls apart. Fortunately, everything usually does run smoothly, so contract law has to step in on relatively few occasions.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>即使合同确实出现问题，合同法也是最后的补救措施。当福特与其供应商之间发生纠纷时，双方都不会立即联系律师。相反，福特的采购代理和供应商的销售经理会打电话，试图解决问题。供应商希望维护其声誉和未来向福特的销售前景，而福特希望保持其装配线的正常运转，因此双方或一方可能愿意做出让步来解决问题。人们签订合同是为了完成任务，而不是为了在违约时维护自己的合法权利。如果问题确实出现，说服对方、诉诸合理的行为准则或威胁实施经济制裁，都是比聘请律师和进行昂贵的诉讼更可行的补救措施。<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_185" class="calibre4"></a>诉讼。通常情况下，争议的规模本身就不足以构成诉讼的理由。如果房主对水管工更换水龙头的工作不满意，可能会向水管工或商业改进局投诉，但不太可能为了重做工作而花费数百美元而提起诉讼。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Even when trouble does occur in a contract, contract law is a remedy of last resort. When a dispute arises between Ford and one of its suppliers, neither of them will immediately call their lawyers. Instead, the purchasing agent for Ford and the sales manager for the supplier will get on the phone and try to work things out. The supplier wants to protect its reputation and the prospect of future sales to Ford, and Ford wants to keep its assembly line moving, so either or both of them may be willing to make concessions to resolve the problem. People enter into contracts to get things done, not to establish their legal rights in case of breach. If problems do arise, persuading the other party, appealing to reasonable standards of behavior, or threatening economic sanctions are remedies much preferred to calling in lawyers and engaging in expensive <a class="calibre4"></a>litigation. Often, the size of the dispute does not justify litigation anyway. A homeowner who is dissatisfied with the job a plumber did replacing a faucet may complain to the plumber or the Better Business Bureau but is unlikely to sue for the hundred dollars it will cost to have the job redone.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>合同法的第二个也是更普遍的功能是尊重个人自由和自主。合同法通过强制执行人们达成的协议并仅在人们同意承担义务时且在人们同意的范围内对他们施加义务来表明法律对这些价值观的尊重。这就是我们所说的<em class="calibre8">合同自由</em>。合同自由包含缔结合同的自由和免于合同的自由。<em class="calibre8">缔结</em>合同的自由是指您可以签订任何类型协议的能力。理论上，您签订合同的能力不受合同法的限制。<em class="calibre8">免于</em>合同的自由是指您可以不签订协议，除非您选择这样做。如果您不想购买野马，福特不能通过法院命令您这样做。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The second and more general function of contract law is to honor individual freedom and autonomy. Contract law demonstrates the law’s respect for these values by enforcing the agreements people make and by imposing obligations on people only when and to the extent that they consent to assume those obligations. This is what we mean by <em class="calibre8">freedom of contract</em>. Freedom of contract encompasses freedom to contract and freedom from contract. Freedom <em class="calibre8">to</em> contract is the ability to enter into any kind of agreement that you want. In theory, your ability to enter into contracts is unrestrained by contract law. Freedom <em class="calibre8">from</em> contract is your ability to not enter into an agreement unless you choose to do so. If you don’t want to buy a Mustang, Ford cannot get a court to order you to do so.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>一个多世纪以来，契约自由既是合同法的核心组织原则，也是个人主义社会组织哲学的战斗口号。然而，契约自由是法律和政治中那些宏大的口号之一，它仅仅抓住了一个理念，却忽略了实施该理念所需的任何微妙之处。实际上，契约自由反映了合同法所基于的选择或同意理念的一个重要方面，但如果运用不当，这一原则可能会产生误导。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For more than a century, freedom of contract has been both the central organizing principle of contract law and a rallying cry for an individualist philosophy of social organization. But freedom of contract is one of those great slogans in law and politics that captures an idea by ignoring any of the subtlety that implementation of the idea requires. Actually, freedom of contract reflects an important aspect of the idea of choice or consent that underlies contract law, but the principle can be misleading if not applied carefully.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>要了解契约自由中的一些微妙之处和弱点，请思考一下 1901 年印第安纳州最高法院的经典案例<em class="calibre8">Hurley v. Eddingfield</em>。印第安纳州梅斯小镇的医生乔治·爱丁菲尔德是夏洛特·伯克及其家人的家庭医生，并在伯克怀孕期间照顾她。伯克临产时病得很重。她的家人派人去请爱丁菲尔德，但他拒绝前来。信使多次去找爱丁菲尔德，告诉他伯克和她未出生的孩子有危险，没有其他医生可以就诊，并要求他支付费用。然而，正如法院所说，爱丁菲尔德“毫无理由”地拒绝帮助她。由于得不到治疗，伯克和她的孩子死了，她的继承人起诉了爱丁菲尔德。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To see some of the subtleties and weaknesses in freedom of contract, think about a classic case, <em class="calibre8">Hurley v. Eddingfield</em>, from the Indiana Supreme Court in 1901. George Eddingfield, a physician in the small town of Mace, Indiana, was the family doctor for Charlotte Burk and her family and attended Burk during her pregnancy. When Burk went into labor she became seriously ill. Her family sent for Eddingfield, but he refused to come. Several times a messenger went to Eddingfield, told him that Burk and her unborn child were in danger and that no other doctor was available and tendered payment of his fee. Nevertheless, Eddingfield refused to come to her aid “without any reason whatever,” as the court said. Burk and her baby died because of the lack of medical treatment, and her heirs sued Eddingfield.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>印第安纳州最高法院裁定，埃丁菲尔德作为一名执业医师没有义务帮助伯克。法院甚至没有考虑埃丁菲尔德作为伯克的家庭医生，根据合同法有义务帮助他的病人。合同自由原则直接说明了这个问题。因为合同<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_186" class="calibre4"></a>法律以同意为基础，任何人都不能被迫违背自己的意愿签订合同，即使是唯一可以治疗他以前治疗过的垂死病人的医生也不行。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Indiana Supreme Court held that Eddingfield had no duty as a licensed physician to come to Burk’s aid. And the court did not even consider the idea that Eddingfield, as Burk’s family doctor, had a duty as a matter of contract law to come to the aid of his patient. The principle of freedom from contract speaks directly to this issue. Because contract <a class="calibre4"></a>law is based on consent, no one can be compelled to enter into a contract against his will, not even the only physician available to treat a dying patient whom he had treated previously.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">赫尔利诉埃丁菲尔德案</em>阐明了契约自由以及构成契约法基础的选择或同意理念的一些难题。首先，免于契约并非绝对原则。由于我们的观念自1901年以来发生了变化，如今的联邦法律要求医院在某些情况下治疗患者。许多其他法律也要求人们无论是否愿意都必须签订合同，从而限制了他们的免于契约的自由。一个有偏见的雇主可能不想雇用黑人、穆斯林或女性，但民权法要求他这样做。司机必须与保险公司签订合同，以获得州政府强制要求的汽车保险，这是驾驶汽车的条件。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">Hurley v. Eddingfield</em> illustrates some difficulties of freedom of contract and of the idea of choice or consent that underlies contract law. First, freedom from contract is not an absolute principle. Because our sentiments have changed since 1901, federal law today requires hospitals to treat patients in certain circumstances. Many other laws also require people to enter into contracts whether they want to or not, thereby limiting their freedom from contract. A prejudiced employer might not want to hire blacks, Muslims, or women, but the civil rights laws require him to do so. A driver has to contract with an insurance company to obtain state-mandated auto insurance as a condition of driving a car.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>其次，即使契约自由确实适用，个人的契约自由也受到实际情况的强烈影响。例如，在<em class="calibre8">赫尔利</em>案中，患者对医生的选择受医疗服务提供系统的控制。到20世纪初，医生已成为一个执业医师，开始严格限制进入该行业的人员，并发起了一场消灭其他类型医疗保健从业者的运动。所有这些可能使得伯克除了印第安纳州一个小镇上的一名医生外，别无其他医疗服务来源。如果当时有更多的医生可供选择，或者医疗保健被视为一种通过政府项目向所有人提供的公共资源，她家的选择将会大不相同。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Second, even when freedom of contract does apply, a person’s freedom to contract is powerfully influenced by the practical circumstances of the situation. In <em class="calibre8">Hurley</em>, for example, the patient’s choice of a physician is controlled by the system for the delivery of medical care. By the beginning of the twentieth century physicians had established themselves as a licensed profession, begun to severely limit entry into the profession, and engaged in a campaign to eliminate other types of health care practitioners. All of this may have left Burk with no source of medical care other than the single doctor in a small Indiana town. Her family’s choices would have been very different if more doctors had been available or if medical care had been regarded as a public resource that was available to everyone through a government program.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>我们在许多当代环境中都能看到类似的影响。广告塑造了消费者的偏好。许多社区缺乏完善的公共交通系统，因此人们需要购买汽车。在经济衰退时期，工人们往往不得不接受任何他们能找到的工作，无论条件如何。因此，合同自由的理想总是在社会因素和经济约束的背景下付诸实践。当法律界定合同自由的界限时，它必须决定我们在多大程度上要考虑这些背景。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We can see similar influences in many contemporary settings. Advertising shapes consumer preferences. Many communities have no adequate public transportation systems, so people need to buy cars. In a recession workers often have to take whatever jobs they can get on whatever terms are available. Thus the ideal of freedom of contract is always put into practice against a background of social factors and economic constraints. When the law defines the contours of freedom of contract, it has to decide the extent to which we want to consider that background.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第三，合同法只是部分地涉及选择。假设，由于埃丁菲尔德反复治疗伯克及其家人，随着时间的推移，他们彼此视为“我的医生”和“我的病人”。那么我们可以假设这里存在家庭医生与病人的关系。我们能否由此推断，埃丁菲尔德同意在紧急情况下前来就诊？如果是这样，我们就不再以同意作为合同的基础了。合同双方可能受特定条款的约束——在紧急情况下提供服务——即使他们实际上并未同意或从未具体考虑过这一点。我们可以说，病人已经<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_187" class="calibre4"></a>患者有权期望医生根据医患关系的通常条款在紧急情况下为她提供治疗。如果是这样，那么合同责任的基础就是保护患者因家庭医生关系而产生的期望，而不是其背后的意图。但即便如此，也并不完全正确。正如埃丁菲尔德可能无意提供紧急服务一样，伯克也可能事先没有考虑过这个问题。在这种情况下，她并没有真正需要保护的期望。然而，当紧急情况确实发生时，我们仍然可以要求医生为未能及时响应承担责任。在这种情况下，责任的基础源于我们对这种关系本身的理解。而且，除了同意之外，我们对这些义务的理解并非源于对医生和患者的想法以及他们通常如何行动的简单实证调查。我们每个人都会根据典型的医患关系、我们自身与医生打交道的经验以及我们对人们之间应承担哪些义务的理解来确定我们认为的正确答案。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Third, contract law is only partly about choice. Suppose that, because Eddingfield repeatedly treated Burk and her family, over time they thought of each other as “my doctor” and “my patient.” Then we could assume that there was a relationship of family doctor and patient here. Can we infer from this that Eddingfield has agreed to come when called in emergencies? If so, we are moving away from consent as the basis of contract. The parties to a contract may be bound to a particular term—providing service in an emergency—even if they did not actually agree to it or never thought specifically about it. We could say that the patient has <a class="calibre4"></a>a right to expect that her doctor would treat her in an emergency because of the usual terms of the doctor–patient relationship. If that is so, then the basis of contractual liability is protecting the patient’s expectation raised by the relationship of being a family doctor, rather than the intent behind it. But even that is not quite right. Just as Eddingfield may not have intended to provide emergency service, Burk may not have thought about the issue in advance either. In that case, she had no real expectations to protect. When the emergency does arise, though, we could still hold the doctor liable for failing to respond. The basis of liability in that case flows from our sense of the relationship itself. And, taking one more step away from consent, our sense of what those obligations are is not derived from some simple empirical survey about what doctors and patients think and how they ordinarily act. Each of us determines what we think the right answer should be based on evidence about the typical doctor–patient relationship, our own experience with doctors, and our sense of what kinds of duties people should owe to each other.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">在赫尔利诉埃丁菲尔德</em>一案中，对法律义务范围的判定，如同在任何其他合同案件中一样，就是对最佳社会政策的判定。当事人的同意并不决定缔约自由和不缔约自由的范围；法律制度必然会做出这一判断。当法院裁定医生在紧急情况下是否必须治疗患者时，我们所做的判断与立法机关所做的判断相同，例如，立法机关裁定汽车司机必须购买保险，或者雇主不得基于种族歧视。这些规则中的每一项都基于对整个社会利益最有利的决策。因此，合同环境中的选择总是以法律政策制定为背景。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This decision about the extent of legal obligation in a case like <em class="calibre8">Hurley v. Eddingfield</em>, as in any other contract case, is a decision about what is the best social policy. The consent of the parties does not determine the scope of freedom to contract and freedom from contract; the legal system necessarily makes this judgment. When a court says that a doctor does or does not have to treat a patient in an emergency, we are making the same kind of judgment that the legislature makes when it says, for example, that an automobile driver must carry insurance or an employer cannot discriminate on the basis of race. Each of these rules rests on a decision about what is best for the interest of society as a whole. Thus choice in a contractual setting always operates against a background of legal policymaking.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0012_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-6-div1-4"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0048" class="calibre1">如何签订合同？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0048" class="calibre1">How Do You Make a Contract?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">您几乎可以按照任何您想要的方式签订合同。</p><p class="noindent">You can make a contract almost any way you want.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>合同法的基本原则规定了订立合同的条件。我们考察一个理性的人是否有理由假设一个人已经做出了承诺——即该人选择承诺未来采取的行动。承诺的两个要素——承诺和未来——是缔约和合同法的关键。当你承诺做某事时，你是在说你真的会去做，而不是说你到时候想做就会做，或者除非你改变主意，否则你都会去做。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The basic principles of contract law dictate what it takes to make a contract. We look to see whether a reasonable person would be justified in assuming that a person has made a promise—that the person has chosen to commit to a future course of action. The two elements of promise—commitment and future—are the keys to contracting and contract law. When you promise to do something, you are saying that you really will do it, not that you will do it if you feel like it when the time comes or you will do it unless you change your mind.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>判断一个人是否做出承诺的最好方法是通过承诺的言语。当有人说：“我承诺支付 5,000 美元<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_188" class="calibre4"></a>如果一个人承诺购买你的车”，那么可以合理地假设他已经承诺购买这辆车。但这绝不是找到合同承诺的唯一方法。合同可以通过默示或无言的方式达成。在拍卖会上，拍卖师会说：“我们拿到了这幅可爱的毕加索作品。”就像无数的喜剧小品一样，如果你举手、点头或挠鼻子，你可能就承诺要为这幅画支付2000万美元。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The best way of determining if someone has made a promise is through words of commitment. When someone says, “I promise to pay $5,000 <a class="calibre4"></a>for your car,” it is reasonable to assume that the person is committed to buying the car. But that is by no means the only way of finding commitment to contract. It’s possible to make a contract by implication or with no words at all. At an auction, the auctioneer says, “We have this lovely Picasso.” As in innumerable comedy sketches, if you raise your hand, nod your head, or scratch your nose, you may have obligated yourself to pay $20 million for the painting.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">这一领域被称为合同成立</em>法——合同是如何成立的。合同成立法中有两个问题：我们寻找什么？我们在哪里寻找它？基于合同法关乎明示同意这一理念，我们考察当事人是否已表明其同意订立合同。为了确定这一点，我们考察当事人的言行。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This area is called the law of <em class="calibre8">contract formation</em>—how a contract is formed. There are two questions in the law of contract formation: What are we looking for? Where do we look to find it? Proceeding from the idea that contract law is about manifested consent, we look to see if the parties have demonstrated their consent to enter into a contract. To determine that, we look at the words and conduct of the parties.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>以一组事实为例，它们可以说明一份格式良好的合同。一名员工的雇佣合同将于12月15日到期。12月初，公司总裁提出续签一年合同。总裁与员工详细讨论了员工的职责、薪资、健康福利、休假和病假，并将双方的理解整合成一份长篇书面文件。双方隆重地签署了书面合同，握手言和，并举起香槟，庆祝双方合作关系的延续。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Consider a set of facts that illustrates a well-formed contract. An employee is working under an employment contract that expires on December 15. In early December the president of the company offers to renew the employee’s contract for another year. The president and the employee discuss in detail the employee’s duties, salary, health benefits, vacation, and sick leave and incorporate their understanding in a lengthy written document. With great ceremony they both sign a written contract, shake hands, and break out the champagne to toast the continuation of their relationship.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在这个假设中，两个关于合同成立的问题都很容易回答。通过签署一份名为“雇佣协议”的书面文件，其中包含我们通常在此类文件中看到的条款，总裁和员工表明他们有意建立被称为雇佣合同的法律关系；他们的握手和香槟祝酒虽然并非必要，但也表明了他们的意图。该文件详细而具体地说明了合同内容；这进一步证明了他们的意图，因为写出这种长篇协议的人通常打算受其约束，并且如果发生纠纷，法院也可以从中找到协议条款。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In this hypothetical, both of the contract formation questions can be answered easily. By executing a written document labeled “Employment Agreement” that contains the terms we normally see in such a document, the president and the employee have indicated that they intend to enter into the legal relationship called an employment contract; their handshake and champagne toast, while not necessary, also show their intent. The document is detailed and specific about the content of the contract; this is further evidence of their intent because people who write out agreements at this length usually intend to be bound by them, and it gives the court somewhere to find the terms of the agreement in case a dispute arises.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这个假设说明了一个形式完善的合同，因为合同意向的证据令人信服，并且最终的协议清晰完整。合同在双方签署文件时即成立，但协议的达成过程也可以采取其他形式。通常，合同的达成是通过<em class="calibre8">要约</em>和<em class="calibre8">承诺的</em>方式进行的，即一方发起协议流程，另一方随后完成。一封信中写道：“我将以1500美元的价格将我的旧车卖给你”，这是一个要约，你可以通过回信“我买下它”来接受它。<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_189" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This hypothetical illustrates a well-formed contract because the evidence of intent to contract is compelling and the resulting agreement is clear and complete. Here the contract is formed at the moment when both sign the document, but the agreement process can take other forms. Often formation occurs through <em class="calibre8">offer</em> and <em class="calibre8">acceptance</em>, in which one party initiates the agreement process and the other party then completes it. A letter saying, “I will sell you my old car for $1,500” is an offer that you accept by writing back, “I will buy it.”<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>不幸的是，在合同法中，完美形式的合同难以捉摸。许多合同并非以这种精确度或清晰度形成的。不妨考虑一下前述假设所基于的实际案例：<em class="calibre8">Embry v. Hargadine, McKittrick Dry Goods Co.</em> (1907)。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Unfortunately for contract law, the perfectly formed contract is elusive. Many contracts are not formed with this degree of precision or clarity. Consider the actual case on which the previous hypothetical is based, <em class="calibre8">Embry v. Hargadine, McKittrick Dry Goods Co</em>. (1907).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>安布里是一家纺织品公司样品部的经理。尽管安布里的合同将于12月15日到期，但每次他试图提出续约问题，公司总裁麦基特里克都会推脱。最终，12月23日，安布里找到麦基特里克，表示如果双方不同意续签一年的合同，他就当场辞职。麦基特里克问他部门进展如何，安布里说他们部门很忙，因为当时正是销售人员外出拜访客户的旺季。麦基特里克说：“去吧，你没问题。让你的人出去，别担心。”安布里以为自己签了新合同，一直工作到2月15日，才被告知被解雇。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Embry was the manager of the samples department of a dry goods company. Although Embry’s contract was due to expire on December 15, McKittrick, the president of the company, had put him off whenever he tried to raise the issue of a renewal. Finally, on December 23, Embry went to McKittrick and said he would quit then and there unless they agreed on a contract for another year. McKittrick asked him how his department was getting along, and Embry said they were very busy, as it was the height of the season for getting salespeople out on the road to see customers. McKittrick then said, “Go ahead, you’re all right. Get your men out and don’t let that worry you.” Embry, assuming he had a new contract, worked until February 15, when he was told he was fired.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>本案是否存在合同？Embry 认为存在，但 McKittrick 称自己只是忙，心不在焉，所以试图敷衍了事，并非有意要与 Embry 签订新合同。这里再次涉及到一个问题：同意是否是合同责任的唯一依据。如果是，那么 Embry 就没戏了。实际上，法律规定，如果 Embry 合理地假设 McKittrick 正在做出承诺，我们将保护他的合理预期。合同成立的标准并非某人是否真的有意做出承诺，而是其言行是否被接受者合理理解为足以构成承诺。（我们称做出承诺的人为承诺人<em class="calibre8">，</em>受诺人为受诺人<em class="calibre8">。</em>）法律对此的术语是<em class="calibre8">“表示同意”</em>，它为我们提供了一种<em class="calibre8">客观的合同成立理论</em>，该理论侧重于言行等客观可观察的因素，而非<em class="calibre8">主观理论</em>，后者侧重于承诺人的实际心理状态。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Was there a contract in this case? Embry thought so, but McKittrick said that he had just been busy and distracted so he tried to brush off Embry, not intending to bind the company to a new contract. Here again we have the issue of whether consent is the exclusive basis of contractual liability. If it is, then Embry is out of luck. Actually, the law says that if Embry was reasonable in assuming that McKittrick was making a promise, we will protect his reasonable expectation. The test for contract formation is not whether someone actually intended to make a promise but whether their words and conduct as reasonably understood by the person to whom they were directed were sufficient to imply a promise. (We call the person who makes a promise the <em class="calibre8">promisor</em> and the person to whom the promise is made the <em class="calibre8">promisee</em>.) The law’s term for this is <em class="calibre8">manifestation of assent</em>, and it gives us an <em class="calibre8">objective theory</em> of contract formation, focusing on objective, observable factors such as words and conduct, rather than a <em class="calibre8">subjective theory</em>, which would focus on the promisor’s actual state of mind.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>关注文字而非意图的目的是为了保护承诺对象的合理期望。正如一句古老的法律谚语所说：“即使是魔鬼也不知道人心。”无论是听取承诺的人，还是审理案件的法庭，都无法判断另一个人的主观心理状态，只能通过他使用的词语和采取的行动来判断。当恩布里听到麦基特里克说出在当时情况下听起来像承诺的话时，他有权认为承诺已经做出。恩布里合理地认为他已经签订了合同，并依靠麦基特里克表示的同意，继续工作。如果让承诺令人失望，那将是不公平的。<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_190" class="calibre4"></a>由于 Embry 的假设，所以即使 McKittrick 从未打算同意该合同，他也必须遵守。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The purpose of looking at the words rather than the intention is to protect the reasonable expectations of the person to whom the promise is directed. As an old legal saying goes, “Not even the Devil knows the mind of man.” Neither a person hearing a promise nor a court adjudicating a case has any way of judging another person’s subjective state of mind except through the words he uses and the actions he takes. When Embry hears McKittrick say what sounds in the circumstances like a promise, he is entitled to assume that a promise is being made. Embry reasonably assumes he has a contract and, relying on McKittrick’s manifestation of assent, continues working. It would be unfair to disappoint <a class="calibre4"></a>Embry’s assumption, so McKittrick is bound even if he never intended to consent to the contract.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>律师经常会区分合同法和侵权法，认为合同责任是通过选择而产生的，而侵权责任即使在没有同意的情况下也是法律规定的。我们根据客观理论所做的就是使合同法类似于侵权法。说话就像开车；如果不小心，就会有人受伤。麦基特里克的话语（以及伴随而来的行为——不以为意的挥手、微笑、耸肩）可能会提高恩布里的期望，使他继续工作而不是换一份工作。无论麦基特里克是否有意受自己话语的约束，他都应该谨慎考虑这些话语对恩布里的影响。如果他不小心，他可能会因“疏忽承诺”而承担责任，就像他因疏忽驾驶对恩布里造成身体伤害一样。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Lawyers often distinguish contract law and tort law by saying that contract liability is assumed by the exercise of choice while tort liability is imposed by law even in the absence of consent. What we have done by the objective theory is make contract law resemble tort law. Using words is very much like driving a car; if it is not done carefully, someone can be injured. McKittrick’s words (and the conduct that accompanies them—a dismissing wave of the hand, a smile, a shrug) can raise an expectation in Embry and cause him to keep working at his job instead of taking another one. Whether or not McKittrick intends to be bound by his words, he should be careful in considering their effect on Embry. If he is not careful, he can be liable for “negligent promising,” just as he would be liable if he physically injured Embry by negligent driving.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>一个常见的订立问题与不定期合同有关。假设一份房屋买卖的书面协议没有明确规定交易何时完成（即买方何时交付款项以换取房产证）。或者假设该协议包含了所有其他相关条款，但未包含价格，因为双方尚未就价格达成一致。如果卖方想退出交易，他可能会以协议期限过长为由，以不定期合同为由提出异议，认为该协议无法执行。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A common formation problem concerns indefinite contracts. Suppose a written agreement for the sale of a house doesn’t state anything about when the closing of the transaction will take place (that is, when the buyer will hand over the money in return for the deed). Or suppose that it has all the other relevant terms but doesn’t include the price because they haven’t agreed on one. If the seller wants to get out of the deal, he might argue in either case that the agreement is too indefinite to enforce.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>合同订立时，明确性至关重要，原因有二。首先，明确性是双方同意的证据；我们通常认为，一份条理清晰、无所不包的合同，比一份大范围未尽的合同更能证明合同的签订意图。其次，一份明确的合同能为法院处理违约案件提供更完善的依据。如果合同没有规定双方何时履行义务，法院就无法知晓他们何时违约；如果合同没有规定违约价格，法院将很难确定补救措施。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Definiteness is important in contract formation for two reasons. First, definiteness is evidence of consent; we ordinarily assume that a contract that dots all the i’s and crosses the t’s is better evidence of intent to contract than one that leaves large areas uncovered. Second, a definite contract gives the court a better basis for dealing with a breach. If the contract doesn’t say when the parties will perform, the court cannot know when they are in breach; if it doesn’t say what the price is, the court will be hard-pressed to prescribe a remedy.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>回到客观测试，我们可以看到这两种情况是不同的。从双方合理的预期出发，我们能否填补这两份协议中的空白？如果双方没有明确交割日期，我们可以说双方有合理的履行时间。我们可以通过观察类似的房地产交易以及双方为交割做准备的工作来确定合理的时间——在本例中，买方需要时间获得抵押贷款或以其他方式筹集资金。基于所有这些信息，我们可能会得出结论，60天或90天是合理的时间。但是，如果双方没有明确规定合理的价格，那么合理的价格又是什么呢？虽然我们可以查看类似房产的售价，但我们知道每处房产都是不同的，买卖双方通常会单独协商价格。因此，我们可能更不愿意<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_191" class="calibre4"></a>对当事人施加价格条款而不是履行时间条款，因此，如果这里没有价格条款，就没有合同。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Going back to the objective test, we can see these two cases are different. Proceeding from the reasonable expectations of the parties, can we fill in the gap in either agreement? Where they have not specified a date for the closing, we might say that the parties have a reasonable time to perform. We can determine a reasonable time by looking at similar real estate transactions and at what the parties have to do to prepare for closing—in this case, the buyer needs time to get a mortgage or otherwise raise the money. Based on all this information, we might conclude that sixty or ninety days would be a reasonable time. But what is a reasonable price where the parties have not specified one? Although we can look at the sale prices of comparable properties, we have the sense that every property is different and sellers and buyers usually negotiate about price on an individual basis. Accordingly, we might be more reluctant to <a class="calibre4"></a>impose a price term on the parties than a time of performance term, so where there is no price term here, there is no contract.</p>

<p class="noindent">通常情况下，合同不必采用书面形式。只要双方充分表明其有意签订合同，口头承诺即可生效。</p><p class="noindent">Usually, a contract doesn’t have to be in writing. As long as the parties sufficiently indicate that they intend to make a contract, oral promises are enforceable.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，有些类型的合同必须以书面形式订立才能生效。这些承诺受《反欺诈法》管辖。《反欺诈法》最初于1677年在英国颁布，旨在减少英国革命时期普遍存在的欺诈和伪证行为。该法列出了一些被认为欺诈问题尤为严重的合同类型，并要求必须提供书面协议证据才能使合同生效。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There are some kinds of contracts, however, that must be in writing to be enforceable. These are the promises governed by the Statute of Frauds. The Statute of Frauds originally was enacted in Britain in 1677 and was designed to cut down on widespread fraud and perjury at the time of the English revolution. The statute listed a number of kinds of contracts in which the problem of fraud was thought to be especially acute and required that there be written evidence of the agreement to make the contract enforceable.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>《反欺诈法》已被所有普通法管辖区效仿。（奇怪的是，英国议会于1954年废除了该法的大部分内容。）该法要求的书面合同清单因管辖区而异，但以下几种合同是常见的：</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Statute of Frauds has been copied in every common law jurisdiction. (Oddly enough, Parliament repealed most of the British Statute in 1954.) The list of contracts required by the statute to be in writing varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but there are a few that are commonly on the list:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bullet">• 偿还他人债务的合同。</p><p class="bullet">•&nbsp;&nbsp;A contract to pay someone else’s debt.</p>
<p class="bullet">• 为婚姻而签订的合同。</p><p class="bullet">•&nbsp;&nbsp;A contract made in consideration of marriage.</p>
<p class="bullet">• 土地权益买卖合同。</p><p class="bullet">•&nbsp;&nbsp;A contract for the sale of an interest in land.</p>
<p class="bullet">• 合同签订后一年内不履行的合同。</p><p class="bullet">•&nbsp;&nbsp;A contract that is not to be performed within one year of the time it is made.</p>
<p class="bullet">• 价值 500 美元或以上的商品销售合同。</p><p class="bullet">•&nbsp;&nbsp;A contract for the sale of goods for $500 or more.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">为了执行其中一份合同，原告必须出示另一方签署的包含合同证据的书面文件。</p><p class="noindent">To enforce one of these contracts, a plaintiff must produce a writing signed by the other party that contains evidence of the contract.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>《反欺诈法》体现了合同法对合同执行形式化的重视。当合同双方遵守规定的程序，例如签署书面文件以订立合同时，他们就会意识到其行为的严肃性，就像孩子们许下承诺时说“我发誓，愿你死而无憾”一样。遵守程序也能为法院提供确凿的证据，证明他们签订合同的意图以及他们所同意的条款。<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_192" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Statute of Frauds expresses contract law’s preference for formality in the execution of contracts. When contracting parties observe prescribed formalities such as signing a writing to enter into a contract, it brings home to them the seriousness of their actions, just as when children making a promise say “cross my heart and hope to die.” Observing formalities also gives the court solid evidence of their intent to make a contract and of the terms on which they agreed.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>出于同样的原因，法律的其他领域也关注形式。我们认为某些行为足够重要，需要规定参与者必须遵守的某些形式才能获得法律的承认。遗嘱必须为书面形式，并由签名和见证人签署。财产转让契约必须签署、盖章并交付。然而，这些强制性形式的问题在于，有时人们就是不遵守。一位年迈体弱的老人会草草地写下一些关于他希望在死后如何分配财产的笔记。一位土地所有者会非正式地将她的土地分配给她的孩子们，而不给他们契约。在每种情况下，由于未遵循适当的形式而扰乱交易可能会破坏既定的关系，或违背参与者的明显意图。另一方面，承认非正式交易会削弱形式要求的效力。在处理这些案件时，我们经常会遇到一种尴尬的境地：我们制定了一项政策（此处指形式）来防止不公正，但我们知道严格执行该政策会导致不公正。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Formality is a concern in other areas of the law for the same reasons. We regard some acts as sufficiently important to prescribe certain formalities that the participants must observe before the law will recognize the acts. A will must be in writing, signed, and witnessed. A deed transferring property must be signed, sealed, and delivered. The problem with required formalities, however, is that sometimes people just won’t follow them. An ailing, elderly man will scribble a few notes about how he wants his property distributed after his death. A landowner will informally divide up her land among her children without giving them deeds. In each case, upsetting the transaction because the proper formality wasn’t followed can create havoc in a settled relationship or go against the obvious intentions of the participants. On the other hand, recognizing the informal transaction undermines the strength of the formality requirement. In dealing with these cases, we are in the awkward but frequent situation of having created a policy (here formality) to prevent injustice but knowing that strictly applying the policy will cause injustice.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法院对《反欺诈法》的解读反映了尊重形式化诉求与承认需要放宽个案公正要求之间的冲突。在确定某一合同是否受该法约束时，法院在认为形式化真正重要的领域会更加严格，而在形式化不重要的领域则会更加宽松。例如，土地出售通常是一项具有重大经济意义的交易，拥有书面记录以确立所有权至关重要。因此，法院将该法的范围广义地解释为涵盖大多数期权、销售合同以及其他与土地转让、租赁或抵押有关的协议。一年内未履行的合同为何受该法约束并不那么明显，因此法院淡化了一年要求的范围，最重要的是将“一年内未履行的合同”的法定要求解读为“一年内<em class="calibre8">无法</em>履行的合同”。因此，建造摩天大楼的合同不在该法规的范围内，因为理论上有可能（尽管物理上不可能）在一年内建造一座摩天大楼；如果有人愚蠢到同意在没有签署书面合同的情况下建造一座摩天大楼，那么该协议将是可执行的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The courts’ interpretation of the Statute of Frauds reflects the conflict between honoring the desire for formality and recognizing the need to loosen the requirements to do justice in individual cases. In determining whether a particular contract is covered by the statute, courts are more rigorous in areas in which they think formality is really important and more relaxed in areas in which it is not. The sale of land, for example, is usually an economically significant transaction and one in which it is important to have a written record to establish ownership. Therefore, courts broadly interpret the scope of the statute to cover most options, sales contracts, and other agreements concerning the transfer, leasing, or mortgaging of land. It is not as obvious why contracts that are not to be performed within one year are within the statute, so courts water down the scope of the one-year requirement, most importantly by reading the statutory requirement of “a contract that is not to be performed within one year” as “a contract that <em class="calibre8">cannot</em> be performed within one year.” Thus a contract to build a skyscraper is not within the statute because it is theoretically possible (though physically impossible) to build a skyscraper within one year; if anyone were foolish enough to agree to build a skyscraper without signing a written contract, the agreement would be enforceable.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法院也认识到在适用《反欺诈法》时需要灵活性，因此对合同必须以书面形式证明的要求进行了宽泛的解释。根据普遍的解释，该法并不要求提交双方签署的单一文件来证明合同的存在。合同可以<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_193" class="calibre4"></a>由当事人所写的信件、表格、支票或收据构成。如果关键条款的证据充分，则无需陈述所有条款。书面文件无需签名；姓名首字母、橡皮图章或打印的信笺抬头即可证明文件的真实性。近期法规对电子交易的兴起做出了回应，规定《欺诈法》所依据的正式政策和类似的书面要求通常可以通过电子记录（例如电子邮件）以及实体书面文件来满足。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Courts also recognize the need for flexibility in the application of the Statute of Frauds by loosely interpreting the requirement that the contract be evidenced by a writing. As universally interpreted, the statute does not require that a single document signed by both parties be presented to prove the existence of the contract. The contract can be <a class="calibre4"></a>constructed from letters, forms, checks, or receipts made by the parties. All of the terms do not have to be stated if there is sufficient evidence of the crucial terms. And the writings do not have to be signed; initials, a rubber stamp, or a printed letterhead are sufficient to authenticate the document. Recent statutes have responded to the rise of electronic transactions by dictating that the formality policy underlying the Statute of Frauds and similar writing requirements generally can be satisfied by an electronic record such as an e-mail as well as by a physical writing.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0012_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-6-div1-6"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0050" class="calibre1">任何人都可以签订合同吗？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0050" class="calibre1">Can Anyone Make a Contract?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">几乎任何人都可以签订合同，但有两类人受到合同法的特别保护：未达到法定成年年龄（通常为18岁）的儿童和精神残疾者。如果儿童或精神残疾者订立了协议，则该协议可由其撤销。这些人被称为缺乏缔约<em class="calibre8">能力的人。</em></p><p class="noindent">Almost anyone can make a contract, but two groups of people are specially protected by contract law: children who have not reached the legal age of majority (generally eighteen years old) and people operating under a mental disability. If a child or a person lacking mental capacity makes an agreement, it is voidable on her part. People like these are said to lack the <em class="calibre8">capacity</em> to contract.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>乍一看，这一结果似乎源于合同法的基本原则。合同基于自由选择，但有些人缺乏做出自由选择的能力。儿童尚未达到进行真正选择所需的成熟度。一些成年人患有残疾，导致他们丧失做出有意义选择的认知能力，或者他们可能在受到同样具有致残效果的药物或酒精影响的情况下试图达成协议。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At first glance this result seems to follow from the basic principle that drives contract law. Contracts are based on free choice, but some people are incapable of making a free choice. A child has not achieved the maturity necessary to exercise real choice. Some adults suffer from disabilities that deprive them of the cognitive capacity to make a meaningful choice, or they may attempt to make an agreement while under the influence of drugs or alcohol that have the same disabling effect.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>但请记住，合同的执行取决于承诺对象期望的合理性。如果有人与一个看起来十九岁但实际上只有十七岁的人签订合同，或者与一个行为正常但精神病或醉酒的人签订合同，会发生什么？我们再次面临原则冲突。我们想要保护没有能力签订合同的人，但我们也希望在与她签订合同的人行为合理的情况下保护她。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Remember, though, the counterprinciple that the enforcement of contracts is based on the reasonableness of the expectations of the person to whom a promise is directed. What happens when someone contracts with a person who looks nineteen but is really only seventeen, or with a person who acts normally but is psychotic or drunk? Once again, we are faced with a conflict of principles. We want to protect someone who doesn’t have the capacity to contract, but we also want to protect the person with whom she has contracted when that person has acted reasonably.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法律对这些冲突的反应，有时试图找到一个中间立场，有时则在原则之间来回摇摆。例如，在涉及精神障碍人士的案件中，法院通常会认为，只有在另一方知晓或有理由知晓其残疾的情况下，他们的残疾才允许他们解除合同。如果该人看起来和行为举止都像具有合同能力，那么依赖这种外表是合理的；另一方面，如果缔约一方知道另一方有精神疾病史，并且在当前交易中做出了非理性的选择，那么该另一方<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_194" class="calibre4"></a>很难说他因为允许对方解除合同而遭受损失。在未成年人案件中，法院通常坚持未成年者可以撤销合同的规则；外表和行为成熟的未成年人仍然是未成年人。但法院也规定了一系列例外情况。未成年人在达到成年年龄后，可以通过口头承认或接受对方的履行来批准其合同，然后该合同即成为具有约束力的合同。未成年人在收到“必需品”时也需要支付合同款项。这个古老的普通法术语曾经指的是食物、饮料和其他一些物品，但如今它可能要求儿童支付医疗服务、教育或汽车的费用。在某些州，如果未成年人谎报了自己的年龄，他有义务支付合同规定的费用；未成年人如果未达到签订合同所需的成熟度，则需要遵守诚实的成熟标准。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The law responds to these conflicts by sometimes trying to find a middle ground and sometimes flipping back and forth between the principles. In the case of the mentally handicapped, for example, courts often say that their disability allows them to get out of the contract only when the other party knows or has reason to know of the disability. When the person looks and acts as if he or she has contractual capacity, it is reasonable to rely on the appearance; on the other hand, when the contracting partner knows that the other has a history of mental illness and is making an irrational choice in the present transaction, the partner <a class="calibre4"></a>can hardly say he suffers by allowing the other out of the contract. In the case of minors, courts generally adhere to the rule that someone who has not reached the age of majority can avoid a contract; a minor who looks and acts mature is still a minor. But the courts have created a series of exceptions. The minor can ratify his contract after reaching the age of majority by recognizing it in words or accepting the other party’s performance, and it then becomes a binding contract. The minor also is required to pay on his contract when he has received “necessaries.” That old common law phrase once meant food, drink, and little else, but today it may bind a child to pay for medical services, education, or a car. In some states, a minor is obligated to pay for what he has received under the contract if he has misrepresented his age; the minor who lacks sufficient maturity to contract is held to a standard of maturity in telling the truth.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>长期以来，合同法中一个重大问题是“法律将执行哪些承诺？” 合同理论的这一领域被称为承诺的<em class="calibre8">有效性，其主要理论是</em><em class="calibre8">约因原则</em>。约因原则的故事离奇却又耐人寻味。从十九世纪末开始的约一百年间，约因原则名义上是合同法的核心理论。然而，它在实际应用中却毫无意义，以至于法院经常回避它，现在已经废除了其中的大部分内容。如今，约因原则只在特殊案件中才会出现问题，但对该原则的讨论可以提供一些有趣的见解，让我们了解律师的思维方式以及合同法的发展历程。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For a long time the great question of contract law was, “Which promises will the law enforce?” This area of contract doctrine is known as the <em class="calibre8">validation</em> of promises, and the main doctrine is <em class="calibre8">consideration</em>. The story of consideration is bizarre but intriguing. For about a hundred years, beginning in the late nineteenth century, consideration was nominally the central doctrine of contract law. It was so nonsensical in application, however, that courts routinely avoided it and have now discarded large portions of it. Today consideration doctrine only presents problems in unusual cases, but a discussion of the doctrine provides some interesting insights into how lawyers think and how contract law has developed.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>考虑两个简单的假设，它们基于合同法老师们最常讨论的一个案例：（1）叔叔同意出售，侄子同意以 5,000 美元的价格购买叔叔的汽车。（2）叔叔承诺在侄子的下一个生日时把车送给他。在这两种情况下，如果叔叔改变主意，他的承诺是否具有强制执行力？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Consider two simple hypotheticals based on a favorite case of contract law teachers: (1) Uncle agrees to sell and Nephew agrees to buy Uncle’s car for $5,000. (2) Uncle promises to give Nephew the car on Nephew’s next birthday. In each case, if Uncle changes his mind, is his promise enforceable?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第一个假设很简单。叔叔和侄子各自行使了合同自由，明显表示同意，因此我们倾向于执行承诺。对价的本质是交换的概念。任何交换都是可执行的合同，因为双方才是价值的真正评判者。一辆汽车、一年的工作、一把斯特拉迪瓦里小提琴和一栋房子的价值取决于别人愿意为它们支付的价格。只要双方明确表示愿意签订合同，<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_195" class="calibre4"></a>有交易就有合同。市场经济中公平的唯一衡量标准是自愿买卖双方达成的价格，因此法院没有理由质疑双方的判断。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The first hypothetical is an easy one. Uncle and Nephew have each exercised their freedom of contract in an obvious manifestation of assent, so we are inclined to enforce the promise. The essence of consideration is the concept of exchange. Any exchange is an enforceable contract, because the parties are the only true judges of value. A car, a year’s work, a Stradivarius violin, and a house are worth what someone else is willing to pay for them. As long as there is manifested intention to enter into <a class="calibre4"></a>a bargain, there is a contract. The only measure of fairness in a market economy is the price arrived at by a willing buyer and a willing seller, so the court has no basis for second-guessing the parties’ judgment.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>现在考虑第二个假设：叔叔承诺把车送给侄子。这里也体现了同意。这就足够了吗？虽然有承诺，但这是赠与的承诺，而不是达成交易的承诺。赠与承诺，尤其是在家庭成员之间的承诺，通常比商业交易的承诺更随意，更缺乏深思熟虑。这就带来了一个问题，因为有时更难弄清楚赠与承诺是否是认真做出的以及是否应该认真理解，而且我们不想鼓励人们轻易做出赠与承诺。赠与也不是一种具有经济生产力的交易。如果合同的目的是促进交换，以便最有效地利用资源，那么赠与承诺就无关紧要。也许合同法有限的资源应该留给商业承诺的执行。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now consider the second hypothetical: Uncle’s promise to give the car to Nephew. Here, too, we have a manifestation of assent. Is it enough? Although there is a promise, it is a promise to make a gift, not a promise to enter into a bargain. Gift promises, especially between family members, often are more loosely made, with less deliberation, than promises to make commercial exchanges. This presents a problem because it is sometimes harder to figure out if a gift promise was seriously made and should be seriously understood and because we don’t want to encourage people to make gift promises lightly. Nor is a gift an economically productive transaction. If the purpose of contract is to promote exchange so that resources will be used most productively, gift promises are irrelevant. Perhaps the limited resources of contract law should be saved for the enforcement of commercial promises.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这是对价理论所采取的方法。任何有对价支持的承诺均可执行，这一原则的必然结果是，任何<em class="calibre8">无</em>对价支持的承诺均不可执行。赠与的承诺是自愿且认真的，但由于叔叔没有收到任何回报，因此该承诺不具有法律约束力。我们或许会认为叔叔确实得到了一些东西——他从赠与中获得的精神满足。然而，法律拒绝了这种观点，因为它侧重于交换；即使叔叔对帮助侄子感到高兴，侄子也没有给予他这种感觉来换取承诺。（但请注意，一旦叔叔实际将车赠予他人，他就不能要求归还；虽然根据合同法，赠与的承诺不可执行，但根据财产法，已执行的赠与是具有约束力的交易。）</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This is the approach taken by the doctrine of consideration. The corollary of the principle that any promise supported by consideration is enforceable is the rule that any promise <em class="calibre8">not</em> supported by consideration is unenforceable. A promise to make a gift is given freely and seriously, but because Uncle receives nothing in return for his promise, it is not legally binding. We might argue that Uncle does receive something—the psychic gratification he received from giving the gift. The law rejects that idea, though, because of its focus on exchange; even if Uncle feels good about helping out Nephew, Nephew has not given him that feeling in exchange for the promise. (Note, however, that once Uncle actually gives the car he cannot demand it back; although a promise to make a gift is unenforceable under contract law, an executed gift is a binding transaction under property law.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>另一方面，考虑这位法学教授最喜欢的案例，<em class="calibre8">哈默诉西德韦案</em>（1891）。在本案中，叔叔承诺侄子，如果侄子在21岁生日前戒烟戒酒，他将给他5000美元。叔叔并没有从侄子履行承诺中获得任何经济价值，但这并不重要；该承诺仍然有对价支持，因此可以强制执行。如果叔叔因为关心侄子的健康或道德品质而值得进行这笔交易，那么这足以成为法院强制执行该交易的理由。侄子是否因履行承诺而得到身体上的帮助而非受到伤害也无关紧要；因为他放弃了一些东西，因此由此产生的交易是可以强制执行的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On the other hand, consider the law professor’s favorite, <em class="calibre8">Hamer v. Sidway</em> (1891). In this case Uncle promised Nephew that he would give Nephew $5,000 if Nephew refrained from smoking or drinking until his twenty-first birthday. Uncle derives no economic value from Nephew’s performance of his side of the bargain, but that doesn’t matter; the promise is still supported by consideration and therefore enforceable. If it was worth it for Uncle to make the deal, because of his interest in his nephew’s health or moral fiber, then that is reason enough for the court to enforce the exchange. Nor does it matter that Nephew is physically helped and not harmed by performing; because he gave something up, the resulting exchange is enforceable.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>考虑一下对价原则的其他一些传统应用。签订合同的双方在合同期间重新协商条款。<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_196" class="calibre4"></a>履行过程中。根据传统的对价规则，修改可能无法执行。如果雇主同意给予现有员工更高的工资，或贷款人同意免除部分债务，则该承诺不可执行，因为它不属于交换的一部分。雇主或贷款人不会因新的承诺而获得任何回报，因为员工已有法律义务工作，而债务人有法律义务偿还贷款。该规则被称为“<em class="calibre8">既有义务规则”</em>：履行既有义务不能作为新承诺的对价。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Consider some other traditional applications of the consideration doctrine. Two parties who have a contract renegotiate its terms during <a class="calibre4"></a>the course of performance. Under traditional consideration rules, the modification may be unenforceable. If an employer agrees to give a current employee a higher salary or a lender agrees to forgive part of a debt, the promise is unenforceable because it is not part of an exchange. The employer or lender is not receiving anything in return for the new promise, because the employee is already legally obligated to work and the debtor to repay the loan. The rule is called the <em class="calibre8">preexisting duty rule</em>: Performance of a preexisting duty cannot be consideration for a new promise.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>或者假设一家公司的董事会通知一位长期员工，为了表彰她多年的忠诚服务，公司将在她选择退休时向她支付终身养老金。这位员工因财务保障的承诺而感到欣慰，不久后就退休了。公司不可避免地会食言。如果承诺的措辞不同（“如果你退休，我们将支付养老金”），那么双方之间就会存在交换，但如上所述，公司的承诺本质上是一种赠予的承诺。由于员工没有承诺或给予任何回报，该承诺因缺乏对价而无法执行。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Or suppose the board of directors of a company informs a longtime employee that, in recognition of her years of faithful service, the company will pay her a lifetime pension whenever she chooses to retire. The employee, relieved at the promise of financial security, retires shortly thereafter. Inevitably, the company reneges. If the promise had been framed differently (“If you retire, we will pay a pension”), there would have been an exchange, but, as stated, the company’s promise is essentially a promise to make a gift. Because the employee has promised or given nothing in return, the promise is unenforceable for lack of consideration.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>对价原则对人性和缔约实践提出了一种狭隘的看法。每个人都只顾自己；没有人会放弃任何东西而不求回报；只有经济上富有成效的交易才值得。这种观点的局限性使得上述每个案例的结果都令人难以接受。先前存在的义务案例和雇员信赖案例使普通、可理解的商业交易无效。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Consideration doctrine presents a crabbed view of human nature and contracting practice. Everyone looks out for himself or herself; no one gives up anything without getting something in return; only economically productive exchanges are worthwhile. The limitations of that view make the results in each of these cases unpalatable. The preexisting duty cases and the employee reliance case invalidate ordinary, understandable commercial transactions.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法院回应了人们对对价案件的这些感受，制定了规避该原则严苛性的规则。在早期发展阶段，这些规则通常以操纵或规避对价原则的形式出现，以达到相反的结果。例如，如果债务人除了偿还部分债务外还履行了其他义务——例如，他给了债权人1000美元和一条手帕来偿还2000美元的债务——那么先前义务规则就得到满足，因为债务人所做的已经超过了他已有义务的履行。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The courts responded to these feelings about the consideration cases by developing rules that avoided the harshness of the doctrine. At an early stage of development these rules commonly took the form of manipulation or evasion of consideration doctrine to reach contrary results. For example, if a debtor rendered some performance in addition to repaying part of the debt—for example, he gave the creditor $1,000 and a handkerchief to settle a $2,000 debt—the preexisting duty rule was satisfied because the debtor had done more than render the performance to which he was already obligated.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最近，法院彻底驳回了将对价作为强制执行的必要条件。其中一些举措是基于公平和公共政策。即使捐赠者未获得任何回报，向慈善机构捐赠的承诺也是可以强制执行的。其他驳回对价的案例主要基于商业现实。先前存在的义务规则已被强制执行善意或根据具体情况进行的合同修改的规则所取代。<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_197" class="calibre4"></a>这些在签订合同时是无法预料的。如今，对对价的主要反规则是信赖原则。即使没有对价支持的承诺，只要受诺人合理地信赖该承诺，也是可以执行的。当长期雇员信赖董事会支付养老金的承诺而退休时，她的退休就取代了对价，并使该承诺生效。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>More recently, the courts have rejected consideration outright as a requirement for enforcement. Some of the moves have been based on fairness and public policy. A promise to make a gift to a charity is enforceable even though the donor receives nothing in return. Other rejections of consideration have been based mostly in commercial reality. The preexisting duty rule has been replaced by rules that enforce contract modifications that are made in good faith or in light of circumstances <a class="calibre4"></a>that were unanticipated at the time of contracting. And today the major counterrule to consideration is the reliance principle. A promise unsupported by consideration is enforceable if the promisee reasonably relies on it. When the long-time employee retires in reliance on the board’s promise to pay her a pension, her retirement substitutes for consideration and validates the promise.</p>

<p class="noindent">这对合同法来说是一个棘手的问题。合同法强调交换，禁止法院推翻一项交易，无论该交易看起来多么不公平；双方达成了他们想要的交易，现在却不得不遵守。但有些合同就是很糟糕。在极端情况下，法院还有其他一些工具来避免执行不公平的合同。</p><p class="noindent">This is a tough question for contract law. The emphasis on exchanges prohibits the court from upsetting a bargain, no matter how unfair it seems; the parties made the deal they wanted and now they are stuck with it. But some contracts just stink. In extreme cases, the court has a few other tools to avoid enforcing an unfair contract.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在这种情况下，我们很难明确“不公平”的含义，也很难为法庭提供一个精确的公式来判断一份合同何时不公平。法庭应该根据管辖类似案件的一般原则来裁决每个案件，因此不能仅仅凭直觉就认为一方做了一笔糟糕的交易。法庭已经制定了两条指导方针，表明一份合同可能需要特别审查。首先，双方达成合同的协商过程存在一些可疑之处。自由缔约模式假设两个独立、知情的当事方各自以自己的最佳利益进行谈判，但特定案件中的流程在某些重要方面与这一理想情况并不相符。其次，最终的合同过于片面。一方——通常是在协商过程中占优势的一方——最终获得的利益远远超出了当时情况下看似合理的范围。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is difficult to pin down what we mean by “unfair” in this context and to give the court a precise formula for determining when a contract is unfair. A court is supposed to decide each case according to a general principle that governs like cases, so it can’t just go on a gut feeling that one party made a terrible bargain. Courts have developed two guidelines that suggest that a contract might need special scrutiny. First, there is something suspicious about the agreement process by which the parties arrived at their contract. The model of free contracting assumes two independent, informed parties each negotiating a deal in his or her best interest, but the process in a particular case doesn’t measure up to that ideal in some important respect. Second, the resulting contract is too one-sided. One party—typically the one who had the advantage in the agreement process—ends up getting a lot more than seems justified in the circumstances.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这两条准则都极具问题。如果过度应用，就会破坏合同法的根基。在许多合同中，一方或另一方会凭借其优越的知识、技能或经济地位在谈判中占据优势，最终获得更有利的交易；签订合同的本质就是尽可能地争取最好的交易。棘手的问题在于，如何界定公平优势与不公平优势之间的界限。我们可以通过简要探讨胁迫和显失公平这两个原则来了解其中的难点。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Both of these guidelines are extremely problematic. If they are applied too generously, they will undermine the foundations of contract law. In many contracts one party or the other will have the advantage in bargaining and will end up with a better deal because of superior knowledge, skill, or economic position; contracting is all about trying to get the best deal possible. The tough question is where to draw the line between fair and unfair advantage. We can see the difficulties by briefly exploring two doctrines, duress and unconscionability.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">胁迫</em>原则允许一方在受到另一方威胁而被迫签订合同时解除合同。例如，当抢劫案的受害者同意将钱包交给劫匪，或父母同意向绑架者支付赎金以换取孩子安全归还时，由此产生的合同不可执行，因为它是在胁迫下签订的。同样的逻辑也适用于商业合同。<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_198" class="calibre4"></a>一方向另一方勒索合同条款的情况。在一个著名案例中，一位曾经的债权人对债务人不再拥有有效的债权，却在债务人的冰车装满冰块后，获得法院命令扣押。债务人必须支付无效的债权，否则将眼睁睁地看着自己的生意消失殆尽，而这笔付款显然是受到胁迫的（<em class="calibre8">钱德勒诉桑格案</em>，1874年）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The doctrine of <em class="calibre8">duress</em> allows a party to get out of a contract when he was forced to enter into the contract by threats from the other party. When the victim of a holdup agrees to give up his wallet to a robber or a parent agrees to pay ransom to the kidnaper of her child in exchange for the child’s safe return, the resulting contract is unenforceable because it was entered into under duress. The same logic applies in a commercial <a class="calibre4"></a>setting in which one party extorts contract terms from the other. In a famous case, a one-time creditor who no longer had a valid claim against the debtor obtained a court order to seize the debtor’s ice wagon after it had been loaded with ice. The debtor had to pay the invalid claim or watch his business melt away, a payment that obviously was induced by duress (<em class="calibre8">Chandler v. Sanger</em>, 1874).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>当然，区分敲诈勒索和允许的经济压力极其困难。当沃尔玛利用其经济实力从供应商那里获得优惠价格时，这只是艰难的谈判和良好的交易，而不是等同于敲诈勒索的不合理讨价还价。胁迫原则仅适用于合同方别无选择，只能接受对方提出的交易，且该交易实际上是单方面的，例如抢劫案的受害者或冰车车主的情况。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Of course drawing the line between extortion and permissible economic pressure is extremely difficult. When Walmart uses its economic muscle to get an advantageous price from a supplier, that’s just hard negotiating and good business, not unreasonable bargaining that is the equivalent of extortion. The doctrine of duress is reserved for cases in which the contracting party has no reasonable alternative but to take the deal that is offered and the deal is really one-sided, as is the case with the victim of a holdup or the owner of the ice wagon.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">同样，如果一方选择有限、谈判地位低下，且该协议显得极不公平，则显失公平</em>原则允许法院拒绝执行。在一个著名的案例中，华盛顿特区的福利领取者奥拉·李·威廉姆斯（Ora Lee Williams）在五年的时间里，以分期付款的方式从市中心的一家家具店购买家具和其他家居用品。每次她签署的合同都包含以下信用条款：</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Similarly, the doctrine of <em class="calibre8">unconscionability</em> allows a court to refuse to enforce a deal in which one party had limited choices and poor bargaining position and the deal seems grossly unfair. In a famous case Ora Lee Williams, a welfare recipient in Washington, D.C., over a period of five years had purchased furniture and other household items on an installment plan from an inner-city furniture store. Each time she signed a form contract that included the following credit term:</p>
<p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>购买者根据本租约向公司支付的每期分期付款金额应包括而非额外于购买者根据该等先前租约、账单或账户支付的每期分期付款金额；且购买者现在和以后支付的所有款项应按比例计入购买者在每次支付时应付给公司的所有未偿租约、账单和账户。</p><p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The amount of each periodical installment payment to be made by purchaser to the Company under this present lease shall be inclusive of and not in addition to the amount of each installment payment to be made by purchaser under such prior leases, bills or accounts; and all payments now and hereafter made by purchaser shall be credited pro rata on all outstanding leases, bills and accounts due the Company by purchaser at the time each such payment is made.</p>
<p class="noindent">这个模糊条款的效果是，每件购买的商品都会有一笔欠款，直到所有商品的余额全部付清为止。当威廉姆斯拖欠她购买的最后一件商品——一台售价515美元的立体声音响——的款项时，商店援引了合同条款，要求收回这台立体声音响以及她过去五年购买的所有其他商品。这些商品的总价为1800美元，其中威廉姆斯只支付了1400美元。</p><p class="noindent">The effect of this obscure term was to keep a balance owing on every item purchased until the entire balance for all items purchased had been paid. When Williams defaulted on the payments for the last item she purchased, a stereo set with a price of $515, the store invoked the contract term to reclaim the stereo and all the other items she had bought over the last five years. The total price of those items was $1,800, of which Williams had paid $1,400.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">在威廉姆斯诉沃克-托马斯家具公司</em>案（1965年）中，美国上诉法院裁定，如果信用条款不公平，则不能对威廉姆斯强制执行。由于不公平性取决于每个案件的具体事实，上诉法院指示初审法院回溯，看看这些事实是否构成威廉姆斯缺乏……的案件。<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_199" class="calibre4"></a>由于她的经济状况和条款的法律措辞，签订合同时是否做出“有意义的选择”，以及最终的交易是否对商店“不合理地有利”。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In <em class="calibre8">Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co</em>. (1965), the U.S. Court of Appeals held that the credit term could not be enforced against Williams if it was unconscionable. Because unconscionability depends on the particular facts in each case, the appeals court instructed the trial court to go back and see if these facts presented a case in which Williams lacked <a class="calibre4"></a>“meaningful choice” in entering the contract because of her economic circumstances and the legalese of the terms and whether the resulting deal was “unreasonably favorable” to the store.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这是一个令人同情的不公平案例：一个剥削成性的商家让一位福利领取者购买她可能买不起的东西，然后用一份充斥着晦涩难懂的法律术语的合同，要求她在一次付款后收回所有商品。但在本案中运用不公平原则存在问题，律师们可能会辩称，如果我们以某种方式判决一个案件，可能会打开闸门，造成灾难性的后果。如果法院以不公平为由驳回这份合同，那么在下一个案件中，法院就不得不再次驳回，直到下一个案件，合同法的根基被破坏。在市场经济中，在有限且往往难以接受的选项中进行选择是签订合同的本质。如果一位福利领取者无力支付现金，那么少数愿意向她提供信贷的商店之一，却要求她接受保护商店利益的苛刻条款，这是否不公平？如果我们过度推翻此类合同，法院将会看到更多声称合同不公平的案件，我们可能不得不放弃“交易就是交易”这一基本理念。正因如此，法院一直不愿将不公平的条款推得太过分。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This is a very sympathetic case for unconscionability: An exploitative merchant gets a welfare recipient to buy things she probably can’t afford and then uses a contract chock-full of incomprehensible legalese to take back all the merchandise when she misses a single payment. But applying unconscionability in this case presents problems, and lawyers might argue that if we decide one case in a certain way, the floodgates may open and cause calamitous results. If a court strikes down this contract as unconscionable, it will have to do the same in the next case, and the next, until the foundations of contract law are undermined. Choosing among limited and often unpalatable options is the essence of contracting in a market economy. If a welfare recipient can’t afford to pay cash, is it unfair for one of the few stores that is willing to extend her credit to require her to acquiesce to tough terms that protect the store’s interest? If we go too far in upsetting contracts like this, the courts will see many more claims that contracts are unconscionable, and we may have to give up on the basic notion that a deal is a deal. For that reason, courts have been reluctant to take unconscionability too far.</p>

<p class="noindent">如今，一些关于合同订立、可执行性和公平性的重要问题都出现在最常见的合同类型——<em class="calibre8">格式合同</em>（通常被称为<em class="calibre8">附合合同</em>，因为一方只需遵守，无需协商条款）中。格式合同是由交易的主导方为该交易及许多类似交易制定的标准化协议，包含标准条款，通常以“接受或放弃”的方式提交给另一方。保险单、信用卡协议、雇佣合同、互联网服务协议、软件许可和购买合同只是我们日常接触到的格式合同的一部分。</p><p class="noindent">Today some of the most important issues about contract formation, enforceability, and fairness arise in the most common type of contract—a <em class="calibre8">form contract</em>, often called an <em class="calibre8">adhesion contract</em> (because one party just adheres to it, without negotiating terms). A form contract is a standardized agreement prepared by the dominant party to a transaction for that and many similar transactions, containing standard terms and usually presented to the other party on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Insurance policies, credit card agreements, employment contracts, Internet service agreements, software licenses, and purchase contracts are only some of the form contracts people encounter every day.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>形式合同对现代经济至关重要，因为它们使大型组织能够高效运作，并降低每个人的交易成本。然而，形式合同也可能存在问题，因为当合同条款的呈现方式使得当事人在签订合同时不太可能阅读或理解，且没有协商的机会时，形式合同允许主导方将其意愿强加于人。由于形式合同背离了合同法所倡导的由两个独立当事人在充分知情的情况下达成协议的理想，法律应如何应对形式合同引发了巨大争议。在查尔斯·纳普教授的<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_200" class="calibre4"></a>在这些色彩斑斓的条款中，格式合同是否应该被视为“危险的动物，除非加以限制和驯服，否则可能会造成伤害”或“神圣不可侵犯的事物”？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Form contracts are essential to a modern economy because they allow large organizations to operate efficiently and reduce transaction costs for everyone. But they can be problematic, because they allow a dominant party to impose its will when the contract terms are presented in such a way that they are unlikely to be read or understood at the time of contract and there is no opportunity for negotiation. Because form contracts depart from contract law’s ideal of two independent parties with full knowledge hammering out a deal, great controversy has arisen as to how the law should respond to them. In Professor Charles Knapp’s <a class="calibre4"></a>colorful terms, should form contracts be treated as “dangerous animals, likely to do harm unless confined and tamed” or as “sacred cows”?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法院运用合同成立的客观理论来判定形式合同及其条款是否有效。在传统方法下，如果买方签署了表格，卖方可以假定买方要么已阅读并同意表格中的条款，要么在未阅读的情况下默许了这些条款。在这种假设不切实际的情况下，法院有时会规定例外情况。在停车场收到理赔支票的司机可能不会被要求期望支票背面包含责任限制条款，因此合同不成立。然而，法院越来越多地强制执行甚至隐藏的条款。尤拉拉·舒特（Eulala Shute）与丈夫参加了为期七天的嘉年华邮轮之旅，在参观邮轮厨房时，在甲板垫上滑倒，随后在其家乡华盛顿州的联邦法院起诉嘉年华邮轮公司，要求赔偿她的伤势。嘉年华公司成功驳回了此案，理由是邮轮合同中的一项条款要求所有诉讼都必须在其总部所在地佛罗里达州进行。在上诉中，美国最高法院的大多数法官认为没有必要处理舒特夫妇是否真的同意了该条款，因为舒特夫妇“已被告知该法院条款，因此，大概有权选择拒绝履行合同而不受惩罚”。该条款的“通知”仅以小字形式出现在船票上，是二十五个编号段落中的第八个，而舒特夫妇是在购买游轮之后才收到船票的。此外，另一项条款规定游轮价格不可退款，所以，即使舒特夫妇真的阅读了船票并理解其含义，他们规避选择法院条款的唯一方法就是在最后一刻放弃他们的度假计划并放弃他们支付的价格，或者至少从他们在华盛顿的家中前往佛罗里达州的法院试图获得退款（<em class="calibre8">嘉年华邮轮公司诉舒特案</em>，1991年）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Courts apply the objective theory of contract formation to determine whether form contracts and terms within them are valid. Under traditional approaches, if a buyer signs a form, the seller can assume that the buyer has either read and agreed to the terms presented in a form or has acquiesced to them without reading. In situations in which that assumption is unrealistic, sometimes courts create exceptions. A driver who receives a claim check in a parking garage may not be held to expect that the back of the check includes a limitation of liability, so no contract results. Increasingly, however, courts have enforced even hidden terms. Eulala Shute, on a seven-day Carnival cruise with her husband, slipped on a deck mat during a guided tour of the ship’s galley and subsequently sued Carnival for her injuries in federal court in Washington, her home state. Carnival successfully moved to have the case thrown out, pointing to a clause in the cruise contract requiring that all litigation be brought in Florida, where it was headquartered. On appeal, the majority of the U.S. Supreme Court felt no need to address whether the Shutes had actually agreed to the clause, because the Shutes “were given notice of the forum provision and, therefore, presumably retained the option of rejecting the contract with impunity.” The “notice” of the provision was included only in fine print as the eighth of twenty-five numbered paragraphs on the ticket, a ticket they did not receive until after they had purchased their cruise. Moreover, another of the terms stated that the price of the cruise was nonrefundable, so even if the Shutes actually read the ticket and understood its import, the only way they could avoid the forum selection clause would be to give up their vacation plans at the last minute and forfeit the price they paid, or at least go to court in Florida from their home in Washington in an attempt to get a refund (<em class="calibre8">Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute</em>, 1991).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>更棘手的问题出现在<em class="calibre8">“收缩包装合同”、“浏览包装合同”</em>和<em class="calibre8">“点击包装合同”</em>中。在“收缩包装合同”中，合同条款仅在购买完成后才会显示。（该名称源于一种销售计算机软件的做法，即用塑料收缩包装密封的盒子出售软件，盒子内附有合同条款，消费者只有在购买后才能打开。）点击包装合同是指您在网站上点击“我接受”框时产生的。在“浏览包装合同”中，网站的使用条款位于网站的某个位置，但您无需点击“我接受”框即可继续操作。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>More difficult problems arise with <em class="calibre8">shrinkwrap, browsewrap</em>, and <em class="calibre8">clickwrap contracts</em>. In shrinkwrap contracts, the contract terms are presented only after the purchase already has been made. (The name comes from the practice of selling computer software in a box sealed by plastic shrinkwrap, with contract terms inside, that the consumer can open only after purchase.) Clickwrap contracts arise when you click the “I accept” box on a website. In browsewrap contracts, the terms of use of the website are located somewhere on the site but you do not have to click an “I accept” box before proceeding.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">例如，在1997年的Hill诉Gateway案</em>中，Rich和Enza Hill致电Gateway订购了一套计算机系统，并在付款时提供了他们的信用卡号。货物送达时，盒子里装着他们新的<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_201" class="calibre4"></a>电脑、常见的各种电缆和手册，以及一张写有一套样板条款的纸，其中包括一份声明，声明希尔夫妇除非在三十天内退回电脑，否则他们将接受这些条款。几个月后，他们的电脑出现故障，而 Gateway 却不愿维修，于是他们提起诉讼。Gateway 辩解说，他们放弃了起诉 Gateway 的权利，而必须通过仲裁解决所有索赔。尽管希尔夫妇下订单且 Gateway 接受订单时并未提出仲裁条款，但法院裁定，当希尔夫妇未能按照 Gateway 的声明要求打包电脑并将其寄回（费用自理）时，仲裁条款即成为合同的一部分。其他法院得出了不同的结论，裁定消费者不受合同签订后提出的条款的约束。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In <em class="calibre8">Hill v.

When their computer did not work some months later and Gateway would not repair it, they sued. Gateway defended by pointing to another boilerplate term that stated they had given up their right to sue Gateway and instead had to take any claims to arbitration. Even though the arbitration clause had not been presented when the Hills placed their order and Gateway accepted the order, the court held that it became part of the contract when the Hills failed to pack up their computer and ship it back (at their own expense), as Gateway’s statement required. Other courts have reached different results, holding that consumers are not bound by terms presented after the contract has been made.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>通过点击包装协议和浏览包装协议签订在线合同可能已成为最普遍的合同形式。在亚马逊 (Amazon.com) 上购物或注册在线服务时，您显然是在签订合同，因为您必须点击一个方框以表明交易完成。大多数法院裁定点击包装协议具有强制执行力。无论您是在接受之前看到条款，还是可以选择先转到网站的其他页面阅读条款，您都有机会阅读条款（尽管几乎没有人这样做），如果您不喜欢这些条款，可以不购买产品或服务。浏览包装协议更为普遍，因为几乎每个商业网站都有这种协议，但它们也更具争议性。即使您只是浏览 Gawker 或《赫芬顿邮报》，也会在网站的某个地方链接协议条款，旨在控制您对网站的使用。例如，Gawker 的使用条款长达 6,000 字，其中一项条款赋予该网站以任何其想要的方式使用您的姓名和您发布的任何内容的权力，另一项条款规定您与该网站之间的任何争议将通过仲裁解决，从而避免您诉诸法庭。法院对浏览包裹协议的可执行性存在分歧；用户同意条款的明显程度以及条款的可获取性是决定法院判决的关键因素。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Online contracting through clickwrap and browsewrap agreements has probably become the most pervasive form of entering into contracts. It is obvious that you are entering into a contract when making a purchase on Amazon.com or signing up for an online service because you have to click a box indicating that the transaction is complete. Most courts have held that clickwrap agreements are enforceable. Whether you are presented with the terms before accepting or given the option to go to another page of the website to read the terms first, you have the opportunity to read the terms (although almost no one does) and, if you don’t like them, to not purchase the product or use the service. Browsewrap agreements are more widespread, because almost every commercial website has them, but they are more controversial. Even if you just look at Gawker or Huffington Post, there are terms of agreement linked somewhere on the site that purport to control your use of the site. Gawker’s Terms of Use, for example, run 6,000 words and include a term that gives the site the power to use in any way it wants your name and any content you post and a term dictating that any disputes between you and the site will be resolved through arbitration, preventing your resort to court. Courts have divided over the enforceability of browsewrap agreements; how obvious it is that the user is agreeing to terms and how readily the terms are accessible are key facts that move courts one way or the other.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">嘉年华邮轮公司诉舒特案</em>和Gawker用户协议中的<em class="calibre8">强制仲裁条款</em>是标准合同中常见条款的例子。这些条款规定消费者必须放弃起诉权，并要求所有争议必须提交特定形式的私人仲裁。在仲裁中，由一名仲裁员或一组仲裁员（他们不是法官，甚至可能不是律师）对案件进行裁决。尽管仲裁员应该遵循相同的<em class="calibre8"></em><a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_202" class="calibre4"></a>根据法律规则，作为法官和陪审团，他们的裁决通常不受法院审查，即使他们认定的事实或法律有误。企业更倾向于仲裁，因为它可以降低诉讼成本，并将案件从法院和陪审团转移到他们选择的、他们认为更为友好的机构。如今，仲裁条款在信用卡协议、雇佣合同、消费者购买合同以及许多其他合同中随处可见。尽管它们通常隐藏在文件细则中或“我接受”框之前的文本中，但它们通常具有可执行性，而且美国最高法院对《联邦仲裁法》进行了广泛的解释，将仲裁条款与大多数可能限制其效力的其他合同法原则隔离开来。然而，仲裁条款也存在局限性。20世纪90年代，Gateway公司的仲裁条款规定，仲裁应根据国际商会的规则进行。这些规则要求仲裁费用为4,000美元，其中2,000美元即使电脑购买者胜诉也不予退还。正如纽约一家法院指出的那样，这超过了大多数Gateway产品的价格，导致购买者在出现问题时得不到有效的补救措施。因此，该仲裁条款根据不公平原则应受到质疑（<em class="calibre8">Brower诉Gateway 2000, Inc.案</em>，1998年）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The <em class="calibre8">mandatory arbitration clauses</em> in <em class="calibre8">Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute</em> and in the Gawker user agreement are examples of a common provision in standard forms. These clauses dictate that a consumer has to give up the right to sue and require that all disputes be referred to a specified form of private arbitration. In arbitration, one person or a panel of arbitrators, who are not judges and may not even be lawyers, decide the case. Although the arbitrators are supposed to follow the same <a class="calibre4"></a>rules of law as judges and juries, their decision is not generally subject to review in court, even if they get the facts or law wrong. Businesses prefer arbitration because it can reduce their litigation costs and shift cases away from courts and juries to a forum of their choosing that they expect will be more congenial. Arbitration clauses are now ubiquitous in credit card agreements, employment contracts, consumer purchases, and many other contracts. Even though they are typically buried in the fine print of documents or in the text before the “I accept” box, they generally are enforceable, and the U.S. Supreme Court has broadly interpreted the Federal Arbitration Act to insulate arbitration clauses from most other contract law doctrines that might limit their effect. There are limits, however. In the 1990s Gateway’s arbitration clause specified arbitration under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce. Those rules required fees of $4,000, of which $2,000 was nonrefundable even if the computer purchaser prevailed. As a New York court pointed out, this was more than the cost of most Gateway products and left the purchaser without an effective remedy in case of a problem. As a result, the arbitration clause was subject to challenge under the doctrine of unconscionability (<em class="calibre8">Brower v. Gateway 2000, Inc.</em>, 1998).</p>

<p class="noindent">解除合同最简单的方法是让对方解除合同。即使对方可能拥有要求你履行合同的合法权利，她也可能不会坚持要求你履行合同。大多数商界人士都是通情达理、善解人意的。他们希望做正确的事情，但这并不总是意味着要最大限度地维护自己的合法权利。在很多情况下，人们会认为强迫对方做他不想做的事情是不礼貌的。此外，大多数合同都源于长期合作关系，维护这种关系可能比获得单次履行合同的利益更重要。很多时候，为小合同提起联邦诉讼可能并不值得。</p><p class="noindent">The easiest way to get out of a contract is to have the other party let you out. Even though the other party may have a legal right to have you perform the contract, she may not insist that you perform. Most people in business are reasonable and understanding. They want to do the right thing, which is not always to pursue their legal rights to the full extent. In many settings people would say it is not nice to make the other person do something he doesn’t want to do. In addition, most contracts arise out of long-term relationships, and it may be more important to preserve the relationship than to obtain the benefit of a single performance. Many times it may not be worthwhile to make a federal case out of a small contract.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>订立合同的人也可以通过多种方式援引法律来解除合同。我们已经看到，许多协议由于协议程序存在缺陷，或存在胁迫或显失公平等原则而无法执行。此外，合同一方也可能因合同订立错误、履行义务变得不可能或其履行义务的条件不成立而被免除履行义务。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Someone who has made a contract can invoke the law in a number of ways to get out of it, too. We have already seen that many agreements are not enforceable because of a defect in the agreement process or a doctrine such as duress or unconscionability. In addition, one party to a contract may be excused from performance because of a mistake in the formation of the contract, because his performance has become impossible, or because a condition of his duty to perform has failed.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>许多合约都涉及对未来的预测，但预测结果可能是错误的。投资者签订合约购买一家公司的<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_203" class="calibre4"></a>投资者预期公司业务扩张，股价上涨，从而购买股票。如果投资者判断失误，导致股价暴跌，她很难因为自己的失误而退出交易（如果交易已经完成，她也无法撤销交易）。股价下跌的可能性是她签订合同时承担的风险之一，法律不会因为她的错误而免除她承担的风险。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Many contracts involve a prediction about the future, but the prediction may turn out to be wrong. An investor contracts to buy a company’s <a class="calibre4"></a>stock in the expectation that the company’s business will expand and the price of the stock will go up. If the investor is mistaken and the value of the stock plummets, she can hardly get out of the deal (or undo it, if the transaction has already been consummated) because of her mistake. The possibility that the stock price might fall is one of the risks that she took in entering into the contract, and the law will not relieve her of that risk because of her mistake.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>不过，有时错误并不涉及双方正在讨价还价的风险之一。假设一个承包商在准备一项建筑工程的投标时，犯了一个算术错误，将所需材料的成本计算为 1,000 美元而不是 11,000 美元。承包商提交的投标价格是 15,000 美元而不是 25,000 美元，而业主接受了该投标。如果承包商立即发现错误，法院会倾向于以该错误为由让其解除合同。与承包商以较低价格履约的负担相比，如果错误立即发现，让承包商解除合同对业主并无太大损害，而且如果其他投标的报价在 25,000 美元左右，业主应该意识到这个错误。另一方面，如果承包商判断失误——预测工作需要两周时间完成，而实际上需要一个月——法院不会原谅他。当承包商以固定价格在此假设下进行投标时，就承担了工作时间超过两周的风险。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sometimes, though, the mistake doesn’t involve one of the risks the parties were bargaining about. Suppose a contractor, in preparing a bid on a construction job, makes an arithmetical error in figuring the cost of the materials needed at $1,000 instead of $11,000. The contractor submits a bid for $15,000 instead of $25,000 and the owner accepts the bid. If the contractor discovers the error immediately, courts would be inclined to let him out of the contract because of the mistake. The owner is not much prejudiced by letting the contractor out if the mistake is discovered right away, compared to the burden on the contractor of performing at the lower price, and the owner should be aware of the mistake if the other bids come in around $25,000. On the other hand, if the contractor makes an error in judgment—predicting it will take two weeks to do the job when it actually takes a month—the court will not excuse him. The contractor takes the risk that the job will take longer than two weeks when it makes its bid on that assumption at a fixed price.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>有时，当事人所犯的错误与合同签订时的事实状况有关，而非对未来履行的预测。这就是合同法中一个重要案例——<em class="calibre8">舍伍德诉沃克</em>案（1887年）——“不育母牛”案中发生的情况。买方想购买一些安格斯牛，于是联系了卖方，卖方的农场里有一些牛。卖方警告买方，这些牛很可能不育，无法繁殖。买方选中了一头名叫罗斯二世（Rose 2d of Aberlone）的母牛，双方约定以每磅5.5美分的价格出售，前提是这头母牛无法繁殖，因此其唯一的价值就是作为牛肉。当买方在母牛称重后支付80美元时，卖方拒绝将其交出，因为他发现罗斯已经怀了一头小牛，这使得它作为繁殖母牛的价值在750美元到1000美元之间。法院表示，卖方不必完成这笔交易，因为双方对买卖的实质内容存在误解。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sometimes the mistakes parties make concern the state of facts at the time the contract is made rather than predictions about the future performance. This is what happened in one of the great cases of contract law, <em class="calibre8">Sherwood v. Walker</em> (1887), the “barren cow” case. The buyer, wanting to buy some Angus cattle, contacted the seller, who had some cattle on his farm. The seller warned the buyer that in all probability the cows were sterile and would not breed. The buyer picked out a cow named Rose 2d of Aberlone, and they agreed on a price of 5.5 cents per pound, on the assumption that the cow was incapable of breeding so her only value would be as beef. When the buyer tendered $80 after the cow was weighed, the seller refused to turn her over, because he had discovered that Rose was bearing a calf, making her value as a breeder between $750 and $1,000. The court said the seller did not have to go through with the deal because the parties had been mistaken about the substance of what they were buying and selling.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">Sherwood诉Walker案</em>的判决基于合同风险的概念。买卖双方当然知道他们正在就一头名为Rose 2d的母牛进行交易，但他们在交易时，却假设这头母牛仅用于屠宰和<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_204" class="calibre4"></a>无法繁殖。他们对母牛状况的错误判断涉及到合同的基本假设，会对合同价值产生重大影响，而且双方都无需承担风险，因为（法院假设）双方都确信母牛无法繁殖。当合同风险之外的假设被证明是错误的时，卖方可以解除合同。如果合同的风险之一是母牛是否能够繁殖，买方认为母牛可能繁殖，而卖方猜测母牛可能不会繁殖，那么情况就会有所不同。那么，无论结果如何，双方都得继续履行合同。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The decision in <em class="calibre8">Sherwood v. Walker</em> is based on the concept of the risks of the contract. Surely the buyer and seller knew they were bargaining with respect to a particular cow, Rose 2d, but they were bargaining about her on the assumption that she was useful only for butchering and <a class="calibre4"></a>not breeding. Their mistake about her condition went to a basic assumption of the contract, would have a significant effect on the value of the contract, and was not a risk that either of them took, since (the court assumed) they were both sure she could not breed. When the assumption outside the risks of the contract turned out to be incorrect, the seller could get out of the contract. The case would have been different if one of the risks of the contract had been whether the cow could breed, with the buyer thinking she might and the seller guessing she probably wouldn’t. Then they both would be stuck with the deal whichever way things turned out.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>合同风险的概念延伸到另一类免责案件，涉及所谓的<em class="calibre8">不可能</em>和<em class="calibre8">挫败</em>。有时，一方承诺的履行在到期时是不可能实现的。例如，在经典案例<em class="calibre8">泰勒诉考德威尔</em>（1863 年）中，一家音乐厅的老板同意将其出租给当地一家承办商，用于在四天内举办一系列音乐会。在他们签订协议和预定演出时间之间，音乐厅被烧毁了。承办商要求赔偿损失，因为音乐厅老板无法在承诺的日期提供音乐厅供使用。音乐厅老板回应说，他应该免除合同义务，因为履行已经变得不可能；当音乐厅不再存在时，他无法提供音乐厅。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The concept of the risks of the contract extends to another class of excuse cases involving what are known as <em class="calibre8">impossibility</em> and <em class="calibre8">frustration</em>. Sometimes the performance that a party has promised to render is impossible to achieve when the time comes. In the classic case of <em class="calibre8">Taylor v. Caldwell</em> (1863), for example, the owner of a music hall had agreed to rent it out to a local promoter for a series of concerts over four days. Between the time they made the agreement and the time scheduled for the performances, the music hall burned down. The promoter asked for damages because the owner of the hall couldn’t make the music hall available for use on the days promised. The owner of the hall responded that he should be relieved of his contractual obligation because performance had become impossible; he could not make the music hall available when it no longer existed.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这是一个很有吸引力的观点；如果你做不到某件事，又怎么能为未能做到而承担责任呢？然而，需要注意的是，要得出这个结论，我们需要采取几个中间步骤。业主无法提供大厅，但这并不意味着他不能因未能履行承诺而承担损害赔偿责任。问题在于他是否应该免除责任，而不是他是否应该被迫去做不可能的事情。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This is an appealing argument; if you cannot do something, how can you be held responsible for failing to do it? Note, however, that there are several intermediate steps we need to take to reach that conclusion. The owner cannot provide the hall, but that does not mean that he cannot be held liable for damages for failing to do what he promised to do. The issue is whether he should be relieved from liability, not whether he should be compelled to do the impossible.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法院处理此问题的方式与处理其他合同法问题的方式完全相同。当双方当事人未明确约定音乐厅发生火灾后应如何处理时，法院必须确定他们的意图，这实际上意味着他们合理地应该采取的行动，这实际上意味着根据法院对双方在此情况下通常的行为和预期的看法，公平的结果是什么。基于此分析，法院通常会得出结论，不可能性确实构成了解除合同的某种理由，因此，例如，音乐厅业主无需因未能向主办方提供音乐厅而承担费用。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Courts resolve this issue exactly the way they resolve other contract law issues. When the parties have not clearly said what should happen if the music hall burns down, the court has to determine what they intended, which really means what they reasonably should have intended, which really means what is the fair result given the court’s views of what parties ordinarily do and should expect in this context. Following this analysis, courts generally conclude that impossibility does constitute the kind of excuse that lets a person out of a contract, so the music hall owner, for example, doesn’t have to pay for failing to have the hall available for the promoter’s use.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>合同的另一方也存在类似的原则，即“<em class="calibre8">目的受挫”</em>。1902年，一场盛大的游行被安排在<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_205" class="calibre4"></a>在伦敦庆祝爱德华七世加冕为英格兰国王。游行路线沿线公寓的业主以远高于正常租金的价格将房间出租给潜在的观众。不幸的是，爱德华生病了，加冕典礼被推迟。那些为了观看游行而租用房间的人寻求解除合同。他们履行合同既不是不可能，也不是不切实际的。他们完全有可能在约定的日期支付费用并坐在房间里。然而，实际情况是，他们签订合同的目的落空了；虽然他们可以租用房间，但他们无法用它们观看现在已经不存在的游行。法院在这种情况下准许了这种免责，理由与无法举行的游行可以免责的理由相同。法院裁定，根据对合同的合理理解，加冕典礼的推迟不属于承租人应承担的风险之一。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There is a parallel doctrine from the other side of the contract, known as <em class="calibre8">frustration of purpose</em>. In 1902 a great procession was scheduled <a class="calibre4"></a>in London to mark the coronation of Edward VII as King of England. Owners of apartments along the parade route rented out their rooms to prospective spectators at rates much higher than the normal rental value. Unfortunately, Edward became ill and the coronation was postponed. The persons who had taken the rooms in anticipation of the procession sought to be excused from their contracts. Their performance was neither impossible nor impracticable. It was perfectly possible for them to pay the money and sit in the rooms on the appointed date. What had happened, though, was that their purpose in entering into the contract had been frustrated; although they could rent the rooms, they could not use them to watch the now nonexistent procession. The court granted an excuse in this circumstance, for the same reason that an impossible performance is excused. The court determined that postponement of the coronation was not one of the risks that the renter should bear under the reasonable understanding of the contract.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0012_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-6-div1-11"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0055" class="calibre1">如果一方的表现取决于某件事的发生而该事并未发生，会发生什么情况？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0055" class="calibre1">What Happens if One Party’s Performance Depends on Something Happening and It Doesn’t Happen?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">为不履行合同而找借口的最常见方式是，你有履行的义务，只有当某事发生而该事从未发生时才产生。律师把某事称为你义务的<em class="calibre8">条件</em>。回到<em class="calibre8">哈默诉西德威案</em>，假设叔叔承诺如果侄子在二十一岁生日之前不抽烟不喝酒，就给他 5,000 美元。在侄子的二十一岁生日聚会上，他告诉叔叔，他最近一直在酗酒，每天抽一包烟，但他还是想要钱。叔叔有义务给他吗？当然没有。叔叔给 5,000 美元的承诺表面上是有条件的：如果你不抽烟不喝酒，那么我会给你钱。因为叔叔的付款义务条件从未发生，所以他没有义务履行。即使侄子从未承诺不抽烟不喝酒，情况也是如此。因为侄子从未承诺不这样做，所以叔叔不能起诉他——条件不同于承诺——但除非条件实现，否则侄子不能兑现叔叔的承诺。</p><p class="noindent">The most common way to get an excuse for not performing a contract is because you have a duty to perform that arises only if something happens and the something never happens. Lawyers call the something a <em class="calibre8">condition</em> of your duty. Returning to <em class="calibre8">Hamer v. Sidway</em>, suppose Uncle promises to give Nephew $5,000 if Nephew refrains from smoking and drinking until his twenty-first birthday. At Nephew’s twenty-first birthday party, he tells Uncle that he has been hitting the bottle and smoking a pack a day, but he wants the money anyway. Is Uncle obligated to give it to him? Of course not. Uncle’s promise to give $5,000 was conditional on its face: If you refrain from smoking and drinking, then I will give you the money. Because the condition of Uncle’s duty to pay never occurred, he is not obligated to follow through. This follows even though Nephew never promised to refrain. Because Nephew never promised to refrain, Uncle can’t sue him—a condition is different from a promise—but unless the condition comes about, Nephew can’t collect on Uncle’s promise.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这个案子很简单，因为承诺条款明确规定了是有条件的。假设叔叔同意出售，侄子同意以5000美元的价格购买叔叔的车。侄子在约定的时间和地点出现，告诉叔叔他仍然想要这辆车，但不想付款，要求叔叔交出钥匙和所有权证书，并表示如果叔叔不交出这些东西，他将提起诉讼。侄子可以就这辆车提起诉讼吗？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That was an easy case because the terms of the promise expressly stated that it was conditional. Suppose instead that Uncle agrees to sell and Nephew agrees to buy Uncle’s car for $5,000. Nephew shows up at the appointed time and place, informs Uncle that he still wants the car but doesn’t want to pay for it, demands the keys and title, and says he will sue if Uncle doesn’t hand them over. Can Nephew sue for the car?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这个案子和第一个案子一样简单。虽然协议里没有明确规定叔叔只有在侄子付款的情况下才需要交车，但我们<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_206" class="calibre4"></a>确信这是正确结果。我们怎么知道的？在这里，我们使用了与我们在考虑合同成立时确定是否存在承诺时相同的构建承诺含义的过程。让侄子得到汽车，而叔叔除了价格诉讼之外什么也不做是不合理的，所以侄子必须履行叔叔承诺的隐含条件——拿出钱来——然后才有权得到汽车。在这种情况下，条件也是一个承诺；如果侄子不付款，叔叔可以拒绝交出汽车（因为他的义务条件没有发生）并起诉侄子违约（因为侄子违背了付款的承诺）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This case is as easy as the first one. Even though the agreement did not expressly state that Uncle has to deliver the car only if Nephew pays, we <a class="calibre4"></a>are sure that is the right result. How do we know that? Here we use the same process of constructing the meaning of the promises that we used to determine if there were promises at all, when we considered contract formation. It would be unreasonable to allow Nephew to get the car and leave Uncle with nothing but a lawsuit for the price, so Nephew has to fulfill the implied condition of Uncle’s promise—coming up with the money—before he is entitled to the car. In this case, the condition is also a promise; if Nephew doesn’t pay, Uncle can refuse to turn over the car (because the condition of his duty to do so has failed to occur) and sue Nephew for breach (because Nephew has broken his promise to pay for the car).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>但这确实造成了一个两难境地。想必情况也可能反过来。除非叔叔把车给他，否则侄子无需付款；侄子是在买车，而不是在打官司。我们最终可能会遇到这种荒谬的局面：叔叔拿着钥匙，侄子拿着现金，他们都要求对方先履行义务，然后自己才会履行义务。双方是否都因未能履行义务而违约，还是双方都没有违约，因为双方履行义务的条件尚未发生？在这里，我们再次需要运用我们的经验和判断来构建一个合理的解决方案。叔叔实际上不必在侄子的付款义务条件发生之前把钥匙交给侄子。如果他这样做了，侄子可能会不付钱就开车走人。相反，叔叔只需<em class="calibre8">履行</em>义务，表明他已准备好、愿意并且能够履行义务，侄子也必须这样做。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This does create a dilemma though. Presumably the condition runs in the other direction, too. Nephew is not required to pay the money unless Uncle gives him the car; Nephew is buying a car, not a lawsuit. We can end up with the absurd situation of Uncle holding the keys and Nephew holding the cash, each demanding that the other perform before he will perform. Are both in breach for failing to perform, or is neither in breach because the condition of his performance has not occurred? Here again we have to use our experience and judgment to construct a reasonable solution. Uncle does not actually have to give Nephew the keys before the condition of Nephew’s duty to pay has occurred. If he did, Nephew might drive off without paying. Instead, Uncle only has to <em class="calibre8">tender</em> performance, by showing he is ready, willing, and able to perform, and Nephew has to do the same.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>许多合同包含不取决于对方履行情况的条款。保险单就是一个常见的例子。保险公司承诺，如果房屋受损，保险公司将根据房主保单赔偿被保险人房屋的任何损失。如果房屋从未受损，保险公司的义务条件就不会成立，因此保险公司无需赔偿。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Many contracts contain conditions that do not depend on the performance of the other party. An insurance policy is an everyday example. The insurance company promises to pay on a homeowner’s policy for any damage to the insured’s house if the house is damaged. If the house is never damaged, the condition of the company’s duty never arises, so the company never has to pay.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>当法院裁定合同义务有条件时，该条件是否必须完全满足才能生效？在某些情况下，当然如此；如果侄子只拥有5,000美元价款中的2,000美元，他就不能索要车钥匙。但在其他情况下，条件可以通过严格履行以外的其他方式来满足。例如，1921年雅各布与扬斯公司诉肯特案（<em class="calibre8">Jacob &amp; Youngs, Inc. v. Kent</em>）就是著名法官本杰明·卡多佐（Benjamin Cardozo）的判决。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When the court decides that a contractual duty is conditional, must the condition be fully met before the duty becomes binding? In some cases, certainly; if Nephew only has $2,000 of the $5,000 price, he can’t demand the keys to the car. But in other cases conditions can be satisfied by something other than strict performance. Consider <em class="calibre8">Jacob &amp; Youngs, Inc. v. Kent</em> (1921), an opinion by the great judge Benjamin Cardozo.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>肯特聘请了建筑公司 Jacob &amp; Youngs, Inc. 来建造他定制设计的乡村住宅。建筑合同详细规定了房屋的建造方式，包括要求部分管道系统使用的铸铁管必须“雷丁制造”（由可靠的制造商雷丁管道公司生产）。当工程即将完工时，肯特得知雅各布<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_207" class="calibre4"></a>Jacob &amp; Youngs公司使用了Cohoes公司生产的管道，而不是Reading管道。肯特郡的建筑师命令Jacob &amp; Youngs公司将有问题的管道从墙体上拆除，并用Reading管道替换，尽管两者的质量完全相同。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Kent hired Jacob &amp; Youngs, Inc., a construction company, to build his custom-designed country residence. The construction contract specified in detail how the house was to be built, including a requirement that the cast iron pipe used for part of the plumbing be “of Reading manufacture” (made by the Reading Pipe Company, a reliable manufacturer). When construction was almost finished, Kent learned that Jacob <a class="calibre4"></a>&amp; Youngs had used some pipe manufactured by the Cohoes Company instead of Reading pipe. Kent’s architect ordered Jacob &amp; Youngs to tear the offending pipe out of the walls and replace it with Reading pipe, even though the two were of identical quality.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>大多数理性的房主都会原谅Jacob &amp; Young公司未能履行合同义务，不要求其严格履行。然而，肯特却以“为了一分钱跑遍全城”而闻名，所以他拿出合同，要求Jacob &amp; Young公司不计成本地严格履行合同，否则他不会支付合同中剩余的欠款。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Most reasonable homeowners would have excused Jacob &amp; Young’s failure of condition by not insisting on strict performance. Kent, however, was known as a man who would “chase all over town for a dollar,” so he pointed to the contract and demanded strict performance, regardless of the expense, or else he would not pay Jacob &amp; Youngs the amount he still owed on the contract.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这是一个耐人寻味的案例。Jacob &amp; Youngs公司并未履行合同；其未能履行合同是否与Nephew未能支付汽车款一样，构成了合同条件的缺失？让建筑商用Reading管道替换功能完好的Cohoes管道，却做了很多无用功，这似乎很不公平。（我们怀疑Kent预料到承包商不会这么做，所以Kent可以保留合同规定的所有款项，而对管道问题不采取任何行动。）另一方面，双方已经达成了一项指定使用Reading管道的协议，而协议就是协议。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This is an intriguing case. Jacob &amp; Youngs has not performed; does its failure to perform operate as a failure of condition in the same way that Nephew’s failure to tender the price of the car does? It seems unfair to make the builder do a lot of useless work in replacing the perfectly functional Cohoes pipe with Reading pipe. (And we suspect that Kent anticipates that the contractor won’t do it, so Kent can keep whatever payments he still has to make under the contract and do nothing about the pipe.) On the other hand, the parties have made a deal that specified Reading pipe, and a deal is a deal.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>但交易究竟是什么呢？本案中，法院裁定，交易并非要求Jacob &amp; Youngs公司必须完全按照设计图建造房屋才能获得报酬，而只是要求其基本按照设计图建造。细微的偏差，例如管道的差异，即使不影响其功能，也无关紧要；建筑商仍然有权获得报酬。如果Jacob &amp; Youngs公司房屋只完成了一半，他们可能得不到合同上的任何报酬，但如果他们几乎完成了所有工作，Kent就必须支付报酬。正如卡多佐法官在本案中所写，</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But what was the deal? Here the court decided that the deal was not that Jacob &amp; Youngs had to build the building exactly as specified in order to be paid but only that it build substantially in accordance with the plans. Minor deviations, like a difference in pipe that has no functional effect, don’t matter; the builder is still entitled to be paid. If Jacob &amp; Youngs leaves the house half-finished, it may not get anything on the contract, but if it does nearly all of the work, Kent has to pay. As Judge Cardozo wrote in this case,</p>
<p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>那些在制定法律规则时更注重对称性和逻辑性，而非实际运用以达到公正结果的人，会对这种界限如此模糊不清的分类感到困惑。毫无疑问，在一致性和确定性方面，或许有人会倾向于采用更严格的标准。法院已将此类考虑与公平公正的考虑进行了权衡，并认定后者更为重要。</p><p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Those who think more of symmetry and logic in the development of legal rules than of practical adaptation to the attainment of a just result will be troubled by a classification where the lines of division are so wavering and blurred. Something, doubtless, may be said on the score of consistency and certainty in favor of a stricter standard. The courts have balanced such considerations against those of equity and fairness, and found the latter to be weightier.</p>
<p class="noindent">一个相关的问题与满意度条件有关。假设肯特聘请了一位室内设计师来设计乡村住宅的装修方案。肯特很挑剔，所以他承诺，如果肯特喜欢这个设计，就支付设计师两倍的时薪，如果不喜欢，就一分钱也不付。这位设计师工作勤奋，最终设计出了一个获奖方案，并得到了艺术评论家和其他设计师的称赞。不幸的是，肯特<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_208" class="calibre4"></a>讨厌它并拒绝付款。我们会说这个设计很像管道——其他人都认为它很好，所以业主也应该满意吗？这里不是。对管道的满意度应该基于纯粹的功能特性，但对艺术设计的满意度则取决于个人。肯特可以自由地按照自己的条件达成交易，这导致法院得出结论：如果肯特真的不喜欢该设计，那么他付款义务的条件就不成立。（不过，肯特必须真的不喜欢这个设计；他不能以所谓的不满为由，以其他理由解除合同。）</p><p class="noindent">A related issue concerns conditions of satisfaction. Suppose Kent hires an interior decorator to prepare a plan for decorating the country residence. Kent is fussy, so he promises to pay the decorator twice her normal hourly fee if he likes the design and nothing if he doesn’t. The decorator works furiously and comes up with a plan that wins prizes and is applauded by art critics and other designers. Unfortunately, Kent <a class="calibre4"></a>hates it and refuses to pay. Will we say that the design is much like pipe—everyone else agrees it is good so the owner should be satisfied, too? Not here. Satisfaction with pipe ought to be based on purely functional characteristics, but satisfaction with an artistic design is personal. Kent’s freedom to make a deal on his terms leads the court to conclude that if Kent really does not like the design, the condition of his duty to pay has failed to occur. (Kent really has to not like the design, though; he can’t use his purported dissatisfaction to get out of the contract for some other reason.)</p>

<p class="noindent">如果某人不履行承诺，即构成违约。违约的一个常见后果是另一方无需履行其承诺。前者违约构成了另一方履行义务的条件，例如，如果侄子拒绝付款，叔叔不必交出车钥匙。无需履行义务，甚至可能保留对方的部分履约款（例如首付款），往往是合同一方所能获得的最大优势。</p><p class="noindent">If someone doesn’t do what she has promised to do, she is in breach of contract. One common consequence of breach is that the other party does not have to perform its side of the bargain. The first party’s breach constitutes a failure of a condition of the other party’s duty to perform, as when Uncle doesn’t have to hand over the keys to the car if Nephew refuses to pay. Not being required to perform and perhaps being able to keep part of the other party’s performance (such as a down payment) is often the greatest advantage that a contracting party can have.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>违约的另一个后果是受害方有权获得违约的法律救济。我们或许认为受害方应该有权要求对方履行承诺，例如交付货物或完成承诺的工作。责令违约方履行承诺，可以强调信守承诺的重要性，并确保对方不会因违约而受到损害。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The other consequence of breach is that the injured party is entitled to a legal remedy for breach of contract. We might think that the injured party should be able to demand that the other party perform, by delivering the goods or performing the job that was promised. Ordering the breaching party to perform would affirm the importance of keeping one’s promises and make sure that the other party is not harmed by the breach.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，在合同法中，命令对方履行义务（称为<em class="calibre8">“特定履行</em>”）是一种特殊救济，仅在特殊情况下才会被要求。通常情况下，受害方仅有权获得金钱赔偿，以替代承诺的履行，而非实际履行本身。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In contract law, however, ordering the other party to perform (called <em class="calibre8">specific performance</em>) is an exceptional remedy that is ordered only in unusual cases. Ordinarily, the injured party is entitled only to money damages as a substitute for the promised performance, not the actual performance itself.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法院将特定履行视为特殊救济有三个原因。第一个原因，或许也是最重要的原因，是历史原因。金钱赔偿是法院惯常的救济手段。命令某人采取某种救济措施通常只在衡平法院适用。由于法院与衡平法院之间的政治冲突，特定履行等衡平救济措施被视为例外情况。（参见<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.n0121" href="#text/part0010_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-4" class="calibre4">第四章</a>。）</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There are three reasons that courts treat specific performance as an extraordinary remedy. The first and probably most important is historical. Money damages were the usual remedy in law courts. Ordering someone to do something as a remedy was generally available only in equity courts. As a result of the political conflict between the law courts and equity courts, equitable remedies such as specific performance became regarded as exceptional. (See <a href="#text/part0010_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-4" class="calibre4">Chapter 4</a>.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第二个原因是实际的。在很多情况下，法院很难命令某人做某事，然后再确定他或她是否履行了义务。如果合同要求建筑商<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_209" class="calibre4"></a>建造一栋房屋时，一些履行条款很容易确定——例如房屋是否符合计划中描述的物理尺寸——但其他许多条款将很难监督——例如木工是否“熟练地”完成。法院不希望监督一项复杂的履行，也不想听取当事人反复跑到法庭抱怨其中的某些方面。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The second reason is practical. In many cases it would be difficult for the court to order someone to do something and then to determine whether he or she has complied. If the contract requires a builder to <a class="calibre4"></a>construct a house, some of the terms of performance will be easy to determine—whether the house meets the physical dimensions described in the plans—but many of the other terms will be difficult to supervise—whether the carpentry has been done in “a workmanlike manner.” The court does not want to have to supervise a complex performance and listen to the parties as they repeatedly run into court to complain about some aspect of it.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第三个原因是概念上的。合同救济的基本原则是，典型的合同具有金钱价值。合同法旨在保护依赖承诺的人，但给予他们与承诺履行等值的金钱，而非实际履行，就能充分保护他们。金钱赔偿被认为与履行义务同等有效，因为受害方可以用这笔钱在市场上购买替代品。如果合同是建造房屋，而建筑商拒绝履行，业主可以聘请其他建筑商，并起诉建筑商，要求其支付更高的费用（如有）；如果业主违约，建筑商可以获得其本应在这项工作中获得的利润。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The third reason is conceptual. The basic principle of contract remedies is that the typical contract has a monetary value. Contract law serves to protect people who rely on promises, but they can be adequately protected by giving them the monetary equivalent of the performance promised to them instead of the actual performance itself. Money damages are thought to be as good as performance because the injured party can use the money to procure a substitute on the market. If the contract is to build a house and the builder refuses to perform, the owner can hire another builder and sue the builder for the higher cost, if any; if the owner breaches, the builder can get the profit it would have made on the job.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>金钱赔偿足以替代合同履行，这一原则非常有力，几乎没有例外。只有在金钱赔偿无法替代合同履行的情况下，受害方才有权要求合同的特定履行。这种情况通常只发生在所售商品独一无二，市场上没有替代品的情况下。如果买方与通用汽车经销商签订合同购买一辆新的凯迪拉克，而经销商违约，则买方无权要求特定履行，因为她可以在其他地方买到一模一样的车。如果买方签订合同购买一辆二手2010款凯迪拉克，而卖方违约，那么在其他地方可能很难找到相同车况的同款车型，但即便如此，法院也会裁定金钱赔偿已经足够，因为买方应该能够买到类似的车。然而，如果买方签订合同购买一辆猫王埃尔维斯·普雷斯利驾驶的1966年金色凯迪拉克，她将有权要求特定履行。猫王的凯迪拉克是独一无二的，因此任何损害赔偿都无法弥补损失。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The principle that money damages are an adequate substitute for a contractual performance is so strong that there are very few exceptions to it. Only where money damages cannot substitute for the performance is the injured party entitled to specific performance of the contract. This usually occurs only when the item sold is unique so that no market substitute is available. If a buyer contracts to buy a new Cadillac from a GM dealer and the dealer breaches, the buyer is not entitled to specific performance because she can get an identical car elsewhere. If a buyer contracts to buy a used 2010 Cadillac and the seller breaches, it may be hard to find the exact model in the same condition elsewhere, but even then the court will say that money damages are enough because the buyer should be able to get a similar car. However, if the buyer contracts to buy a 1966 gold Cadillac driven by Elvis Presley, she will be entitled to specific performance. Elvis’s Cadillac is unique, so no damage remedy can make up for the loss.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>合同法或许可以做的一件事就是界定是非对错。信守承诺是正确的，违背承诺是错误的，支付赔偿金并不能真正使其正确。然而，这种观点在合同救济法中几乎被一致否定，因为金钱赔偿足以替代履行的原则建立在对合同法在社会中的作用的特定看法之上。合同法仅仅涉及经济关系，没有道德内容。不履行承诺的唯一后果是违约方必须赔偿另一方的损失。没有道德谴责。<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_210" class="calibre4"></a>违约责任是附加在违约行为上的，因此法律并不要求违约方履行义务或因违约而惩罚他，而只是要求赔偿另一方的损失。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One thing that contract law might do is to define right and wrong. It is right to keep promises and wrong to break them, and paying damages doesn’t really make it right. However, this view has been rejected almost uniformly in the law of contract remedies because the principle that money damages are an adequate substitute for performance rests on a particular view of the role of contract law in society. Contract law is solely about economic relations with no moral content to it. The only consequence of failing to keep a promise is that the breaching party must pay the other party’s loss. No moral condemnation <a class="calibre4"></a>attaches to the breach, so the law does not order the breaching party to perform or punish him for breaching but only to compensate the other party for its loss.</p>

<p class="noindent">合同具有强制执行力，是因为人们期望做出承诺的人会履行承诺。当承诺被违背时，受害方的期望通常就是合同损害赔偿的衡量标准。</p><p class="noindent">Contracts are enforceable because people expect that someone who makes a promise will carry through on it. When the promise is broken, the injured party’s expectation is the usual measure of contract damages.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>举一个简单的例子。一位农民同意以100美元的价格将一卡车南瓜卖给路边农产品摊位的老板。当这位农民未能交付南瓜时，摊位老板以120美元的价格从另一位农民那里购买了一卡车的南瓜作为替代。摊位老板预计支付100美元才能收到一卡车南瓜，因此要求违约的农民支付20美元的赔偿金就可以满足这一预期。如果摊位老板以100美元或更低的价格购买了替代南瓜，那么农民就不欠任何钱，因为即使没有支付赔偿金，摊位老板的处境也和农民的承诺已经履行一样好。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Take a simple example. A farmer agrees to sell a truckload of pumpkins to the owner of a roadside produce stand for $100. When the farmer fails to deliver the pumpkins, the stand owner buys a substitute truckload from another farmer for $120. The owner expected to have paid $100 to receive a truckload of pumpkins, so requiring the breaching farmer to pay $20 damages would satisfy that expectation. If the owner buys substitute pumpkins for $100 or less, the farmer owes nothing, because the owner is in as good a position as if the farmer’s promise had been performed even without the payment of damages.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>同样，如果摊主拒绝收南瓜，而农民以90美元的价格转售，摊主应该支付10美元，以弥补农民履行承诺后的损失：卡车上没有南瓜，而农民口袋里却有100美元。如果南瓜市场没有下跌，农民以100美元或更高的价格转售，摊主就不欠任何钱。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Similarly, if the stand owner refuses to take the pumpkins and the farmer resells them for $90, the owner should pay $10 to put the farmer where he would have been if the promise had been performed: no pumpkins in his truck and $100 in his pocket. If the pumpkin market doesn’t fall and the farmer resells for $100 or more, the stand owner owes nothing.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在所有这些案件中，我们假设受害方在购买替代南瓜或转售合同规定的南瓜方面均无需任何费用。如果有此类费用，则将被计入损害赔偿金。例如，如果在摊位所有者违约后，农民必须将南瓜用卡车运送一段距离才能转售，则农民可以收回运输成本；如果他无法收回这些成本，则其合同预期并未完全实现。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In all of these cases we assume that the injured party has no expenses in either buying substitute pumpkins or reselling the pumpkins that were contracted for. If there are such expenses, they will be added to the damages. If, for example, the farmer has to truck the pumpkins some distance to resell them after the stand owner’s breach, the farmer could recover the cost of transportation; if he cannot recover those costs, his expectation from the contract has not been fully satisfied.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>假设农民违约时，摊主没有购买任何替代南瓜。法律规定，他仍然有权获得赔偿，赔偿金额以他购买替代南瓜应支付的价格计算。如果市场价格上涨到每卡车120美元，即使摊主没有任何实际损失，他也有权获得20美元的赔偿。合同救济基于对履行的预期，而不是基于对履行预期而实际采取的行动。其原因尚不清楚，但这与许多情况下难以证明当事人确实依赖了特定合同有关。如果买家不是路边小摊的老板，而是利比超市，购买了数千卡车南瓜来加工成馅饼馅，那么很难<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_211" class="calibre4"></a>将特定的违约合同与特定的替代品联系起来，但我们认为无论如何那里必定存在损失。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Suppose when the farmer breaches the stand owner doesn’t buy any substitute pumpkins. The law says he is still entitled to his damages, measured by what he would have paid for substitute pumpkins. If the market price has risen to $120 per truckload, the owner is entitled to $20 even though he does not have any tangible loss. Contract remedies are based on the expectation of performance, not actions actually taken in reliance on the expectation of performance. The reasons for this are obscure, but it has something to do with the difficulty in many situations of proving that one actually relied on a specific contract. If the buyer is not the owner of a small roadside stand but Libby’s, buying thousands of truckloads of pumpkins to process into pie filling, it would be hard <a class="calibre4"></a>to link a particular broken contract and a particular substitute, but we imagine there must be a loss there anyway.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>合同法对预期损失有一些限制。其中之一是损失必须是可预见的。假设南瓜合同要求在10月15日交货，摊主已做出特殊安排，将南瓜以高价转售给学校团体，用于制作万圣节的南瓜灯。当农民未能交货时，摊主已经来不及从其他地方进货，因此他的损失超过了南瓜的正常转售加价。此时，摊主的预期高于正常水平，问题在于哪一方应该承担这笔损失。摊主会指出他期望获得更高的利润，但农民会回应说他不知道这些特殊安排。法律规定，只有在农民知道或理应知道摊主的特殊损失的情况下，他才承担责任。由于违背承诺不会受到道德谴责，因此承诺方只需采取合理行动，包括支付其本应预见到的损失。这与侵权法损害赔偿规则形成了有趣的对比，在侵权法中，造成损害的一方应对所有后果负责，无论是否可预见，因为过错在侵权法中比在合同法中更重要。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Contract law imposes some limitations on expectation damages. One is that damages must be foreseeable. Suppose the pumpkin contract called for delivery on October 15 and the stand owner had made special arrangements to resell the pumpkins at a premium to school groups to make into jack-o’-lanterns for Halloween. When the farmer fails to deliver, it is too late for the stand owner to get pumpkins from anywhere else, so he loses more than the ordinary resale markup for pumpkins. Here the owner’s expectation is higher than usual, and the issue is which party should bear the burden of this loss. The owner will point to his expectation of higher profit, but the farmer will respond that he did not know about the special arrangements. The law states that only where the farmer knows or reasonably should know of the owner’s special loss will he be liable for it. Because no moral condemnation attaches to a broken promise, the party making the promise is only required to act reasonably, which includes paying for damages it should have anticipated. This provides an interesting contrast with the tort law damage rules, in which the party causing the harm is responsible for all the consequences, foreseeable or not, because fault is more important in tort than in contract law.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第二个限制是，守约方不能追回其本可以通过合理努力避免的损失。这条规则在雇佣案件中最常见。如果一位公司高管在雇佣合同还剩六个月时被解雇，她能一边在家看肥皂剧、吃糖果一边领工资吗？不一定。如果她不寻找其他工作，或者在有类似工作机会时不接受，她的损失将会减少，其数额应为前雇主能够证明她在替代工作中本可以挣到的钱。标准是合理性；她不需要跨越全国去接受一份工作，也不必接受麦当劳的最低工资工作。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A second limitation is that the nonbreaching party cannot recover damages that it could have avoided through reasonable efforts. This rule operates most frequently in employment cases. If a corporate executive is fired with six months remaining on her employment contract, can she just sit home watching soap operas and eating bon-bons while collecting her salary? Not necessarily. If she does not look for another job or take a comparable job if one is offered, her damages will be reduced by what her former employer can prove she could have earned in the substitute employment. The standard is reasonableness; she is not required to move across the country to take a position, nor does she have to take a minimum-wage job at McDonald’s.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第三个限制是，损害赔偿必须以合理的确定性予以证明。对于新企业而言，这一限制尤其棘手。假设一位企业家计划于3月1日开设一家新餐厅，但由于厨房设备供应商未能按时交付炉灶和冰箱，餐厅开业时间被推迟了两个月。这位企业家可能难以以合理的确定性证明餐厅在这两个月内的利润；新餐厅的客流量具有高度的不确定性，很难从其他餐厅的经验中得出推论。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A third limitation is that damages must be proven with reasonable certainty. This limitation can be particularly troublesome in the case of new businesses. Suppose an entrepreneur plans on opening a new restaurant on March 1, but the opening is delayed for two months because the kitchen equipment supplier fails to deliver the ranges and refrigerators on time. The entrepreneur may have difficulty proving with reasonable certainty what the restaurant’s profit would have been during those two months; the patronage of a new restaurant is highly speculative, and it is hard to draw inferences from the experience of other restaurants.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这一假设表明，需要其他类型的救济措施来补充预期损害赔偿。<em class="calibre8">信赖损害赔偿的</em>判定条件如下：<a id="text/part0012_split_001.html.page_212" class="calibre4"></a>预期损害赔偿无法用于补偿受害方因信赖合同而产生的费用。餐馆老板可能无法弥补利润损失，但如果她花费数百美元购买报纸广告并印刷3月1日开业的邀请函，这些费用就浪费了，供应商应承担信赖损害赔偿责任。<em class="calibre8">恢复性损害赔偿</em>是指对已授予另一方的利益的追偿。如果老板取消与供应商的合同并从其他地方购买设备，老板有权收回已支付给供应商的预付款。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This hypothetical suggests the need for other types of remedies to supplement expectation damages. <em class="calibre8">Reliance damages</em> are awarded when <a class="calibre4"></a>expectation damages are unavailable, to compensate the injured party for expenses incurred in reliance on a contract. The restaurant owner may not be able to recover for lost profits, but if she has spent hundreds of dollars buying newspaper advertising and printing invitations for the March 1 opening, those expenses are wasted and the supplier is liable for them as reliance damages. <em class="calibre8">Restitution damages</em> are the recovery of benefits conferred on the other party. If the owner cancels the contract with the supplier and gets equipment elsewhere, the owner is entitled to get back the down payment made to the supplier.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如果合同损害赔偿规则真的有效，人们就很少会违背承诺。除非有人能通过违约转而选择其他方式获得更有利的条件，否则一旦违约方支付了对方的损害赔偿金，就没有任何意义了。但合同损害赔偿规则的效果并不理想。除了预期损害赔偿金的可预见性、可避免性和确定性限制之外，获得损害赔偿还需要花费金钱。受害方必须聘请律师并支付诉讼费用才能追回损失。这些费用也是违约造成的损失，但不能作为合同损害赔偿金获得补偿。因此，如果受害方损失了1万美元，她可能需要支付2000美元的律师费和其他费用才能收回损失，这意味着她获得的赔偿金远远不足。诉讼也需要时间和精力，而且经济和精神上的负担也无法弥补。因此，许多有效的违约案件并不值得追究。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If the contract damage rules worked really well, people would seldom break their promises. Unless someone could get a much better deal by breaking a contract and going elsewhere, it just wouldn’t pay once the breaching party had paid the other party’s damages. But contract damage rules don’t work very well. Aside from the foreseeability, avoidability, and certainty limitations on expectation damages, it costs money to get damages. The injured party has to hire a lawyer and pay litigation expenses to recover the damages. These costs are also damages caused by the broken promise, but they are not recoverable as contract damages. So if the injured party has a loss of $10,000 she might have to pay $2,000 in attorney’s fees and other expenses to get it back, meaning she has been undercompensated to that extent. It also takes time and aggravation to litigate, and the financial and psychic burden cannot be recovered either. Therefore, many valid breach of contract cases are not worth pursuing.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>不过，从另一个角度来看，合同救济，就像合同法的责任规则一样，是残留的。法律救济的威胁在阻止人们违背承诺方面，不如其他因素那么重要。人们会避免违背承诺，因为他们认为这样做是错误的。如果他们违背承诺，其他人可能会对他们产生不好的看法，而声誉在商业中是一种宝贵的商品。如果他们违约，他们的合同伙伴将来可能会拒绝与他们合作。因此，合同救济，就像合同法的其他部分一样，只是故事的一部分。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>From a different direction, though, recall that contract remedies, like the liability rules of contract law, are residual. The threat of legal remedies is not as important in deterring people from breaking their promises as are other factors. People will avoid breaking their promises because they think that it is wrong to do so. Other people may think badly of them if they do, and reputation is a valuable commodity in business. Their contracting partner may refuse to deal with them in the future if they breach. So contract remedies, like the rest of contract law, are only part of the story.</p>

<p class="subtitle1">财产法</p><p class="subtitle1">The Law of Property</p>
<p class="noindent">财产法可能是最让法学院学生头疼的基础科目。财产法的基本原则显而易见：如果你拥有某样东西，它就是你的，你可以随心所欲地处置它。但与其他任何科目相比，财产法承载着上千年的法律历史和大量的技术性区别。你知道吗？你很可能拥有<em class="calibre8">绝对所有权</em>——除非你的<em class="calibre8">绝对所有权受到执行限制</em>。如果你打算把财产留给孙辈，一定要小心，不要违反“禁止永久产权规则”。这两种封建主义的残余，以及许多其他的残余，在现代仍然具有影响力。</p><p class="noindent">Property law may be the basic subject that most irritates law students. The fundamental principle of property law seems obvious: If you own something it’s yours, and you can do what you want with it. But more than any other subject, property law is burdened with a thousand years of legal history and a plethora of technical distinctions. Did you know you probably own your house in <em class="calibre8">fee simple absolute</em>—unless you have a <em class="calibre8">fee simple subject to an executory limitation</em>? And if you plan to leave property to your grandchildren, be careful not to violate the Rule Against Perpetuities. Both of these vestiges of feudalism, and many others, still have bite in the modern day.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>与此同时，财产法关乎重大社会政策和尖端技术。即使沙丘遮挡了海滨住宅的海景，政府是否应该有权建造沙丘来防止海滩侵蚀？如果一位从事研究的医生利用病人的血液研制出一种具有商业价值的产品，那么该产品的所有权应该归谁所有——医生还是病人？一位音乐爱好者可以制作一段混音视频并将其发布到YouTube上吗？如果可以，那么谁拥有该视频的版权？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At the same time, property law concerns issues of great social policy and cutting-edge technology. Should the government be able to construct dunes to prevent beach erosion even if the dunes block the ocean view of beachfront homes? If a research physician develops a commercially valuable product from a patient’s blood, who owns the rights to the product—the physician or the patient? Can a music fan make a mash-up video and post it to YouTube? If so, who owns the rights to the video?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>本章首先从一些基本原则入手，然后探讨中世纪至今财产法中一些最重要的问题。由于主题过于庞大，我们只能略谈一些重点。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This chapter begins with some basic principles and then examines some of the most important issues in property law from medieval times to the present. The subject is so large that we can only hit some highlights.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0013_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-7-div1-2"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0059" class="calibre1">什么是物权法？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0059" class="calibre1">What Is Property Law?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">在我们的文化中，人们对财产有着直觉的概念，而本章的部分任务就是探讨法律对财产的理解与这种直觉概念的差异程度。让我们先从对财产的直觉谈起，这一点可以从孩子们从父母那里吸收的观念中看出。<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_214" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="noindent">People in our culture have an intuitive notion of what property is, and part of the task of this chapter is to explore the extent to which the law’s idea of property differs from that intuitive notion. Let’s begin with intuitions about property, which we can see from the ideas children absorb from their parents.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>小孩子对财产的概念非常清晰：“我的！”小苏西的玩具、洋娃娃或心爱的毯子都是她的财产。“我的”一词隐含着所有权的概念，这与她父母对房子、汽车或金钱（其他财产）的所有权概念相同。这一概念的核心，正如十八世纪权威英国法律著作的作者威廉·布莱克斯通爵士所说的：“对……事物……独占且专制的支配权……完全排除宇宙中任何其他个体的权利。” 所有权，或支配权，是指控制财产使用的能力。苏西可以假装她的洋娃娃是茶话会的客人、超级英雄，或是她外出上班的母亲，就像她的父母可以把房子漆成橙色，把床放在客厅，或者在墙上贴阿道夫·希特勒的海报一样。她可以允许朋友玩她的娃娃，也可以阻止朋友玩，就像她的父母可以邀请邻居来家里做客或不让他们来一样。她可以把娃娃送给朋友永久收藏，也可以和朋友交换其他玩具，或者她可以拒绝，就像她的父母可以以任何价格卖掉房子或自己留着一样。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A small child has a very clear concept of property: “Mine!” Little Suzie’s toy, doll, or favorite blanket is her property. Implicit in “mine” is a concept of ownership, the same concept of ownership that her parents may have about their house, car, or money, which are other examples of property. The core of this concept is what Sir William Blackstone, author of the definitive eighteenth-century treatise on English law, called “sole and despotic dominion...over...things...in total exclusion of the right of any other individual in the universe.” Ownership, or dominion, is the ability to control the use of the property. Suzie can pretend that her doll is a guest at a tea party, a superhero, or her mother going off to work, just as her parents can paint their house orange, put their bed in the living room, or hang posters of Adolf Hitler on the walls. She can allow a friend to play with her doll, or she can prevent her friend from playing with it, just as her parents can invite neighbors over or keep them out. She can give it to her friend for keeps, she can trade with her friend for a different toy, or she can refuse to do so, just as her parents can sell their house at any price they can get or keep it for themselves.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在我们的文化中，物权所有权的概念一直是财产观念的核心。财产法关注的是人们可以拥有的不同物权以及他们拥有这些物权的方式。然而，该概念的两个要素——物权法的主体和绝对所有权——都存在缺陷，财产法也因此变得更加模糊。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In our culture, this concept of the ownership of things has been central to the idea of property. Property law concerns the different things people can own and the ways in which they can own them. Both elements of the concept—things as the subject of property law and absolute ownership—are deficient, however, and property law is more diffuse.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>首先考虑物品，或者说财产的标的物。苏西的洋娃娃和她父母的房子都可以成为某人的财产。几乎任何有形的东西都可以成为财产的标的物。我们必须说“几乎”，因为某些有形的东西是否可以成为财产存在争议。苏西“属于”她的父母，但她不是他们的财产。（这表明财产的定义会发生变化；如果苏西是非裔美国人，那么在内战之前，她可能是某人的财产。）那么苏西父亲的肾脏呢？它们是财产，因为没有人可以拿走它们；但它们是否意味着他可以把肾脏卖给需要移植的人呢？（在伊朗，答案是肯定的；在其他国家，答案是否定的，至少到目前为止是这样。）</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Think first about things, or the subject matter of property. Suzie’s doll and her parents’ house are things that can be someone’s property. Almost anything tangible can be the subject matter of property. We have to say “almost,” because whether some tangible things can be property is controversial. Suzie “belongs” to her parents, but she is not their property. (This shows that definitions of property change; if Suzie is African American, prior to the Civil War she could have been someone’s property.) What about Suzie’s father’s kidneys? They are property in the sense that no one else can take them away, but are they property in the sense that he could sell one to someone who needs a transplant? (In Iran the answer is yes; in other countries, the answer is no, at least to date.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>财产并不局限于有形的事物。如果苏西的父亲是一位作家，他拥有自己所写小说的版权。这是一种无形的<em class="calibre8">知识产权</em>；他并不拥有这些书籍，但他拥有出版这些书籍的权利。苏西的父母也可能拥有股票、债券和共同基金份额。这类金融工具是我们社会中最普遍的财产形式，尽管它们是无形的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Property isn’t limited to tangible things either. If Suzie’s father is an author, he has a copyright in the novels he writes. This is an intangible form of <em class="calibre8">intellectual property</em>; he doesn’t own the books, but he does own the right to produce the books. Suzie’s parents also may own stocks, bonds, and mutual fund shares. Financial instruments like these are the most prevalent form of property in our society, even though they are intangible.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>一旦法律开始承认无形财产利益，财产的核心概念就变成了“物”。<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_215" class="calibre4"></a>分开。员工是否对其工作拥有财产权？获得或维持政府福利或特权（例如出租车牌照或电视广播许可证）的权利是否属于财产？每种特权或权益是否都可能成为财产的标的？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Once the law goes down the path of recognizing intangible property interests, the core conception of property as involving “things” comes <a class="calibre4"></a>apart. Does an employee have a property right in her job? Is the right to receive or maintain government benefits or privileges, like a taxi medallion or television broadcast license, property? Is every kind of privilege or entitlement potentially the subject of property?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>从有形财产到无形财产的转变给财产法带来了一个难题。如果财产不能局限于物品，那么财产法的适用范围又是什么呢？如果它涵盖所有潜在的有价资源，那么一切都应受财产法的约束。但如果一切都是财产的一部分，那么财产法就没有什么特别之处了。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The move from tangible to intangible property presents a problem for property law. If property cannot be confined to things, then what is the scope of property law? If it extends to every potentially valuable resource, then everything is subject to property law. But if everything is part of property, then there is nothing really special about property law.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>提出这些问题也说明了财产的第二个要素——绝对所有权概念——的缺陷。苏西的父母拥有自己的房子，但这种所有权远远达不到布莱克斯通所定义的绝对支配权。他们不能将自己的财产用于任何他们想要的用途。如果他们想在该房产上开一家商店，当地的分区法规可能会阻止他们。如果他们举办喧闹的派对或在草坪上堆放垃圾，邻居或当地官员可能会提起法律诉讼来阻止他们。他们也不能阻止所有其他人使用该房产。他们拥有房子前的人行道，但他们不能禁止行人使用人行道。其他人也可能对该房产拥有所有权。当他们借钱买房时，他们赋予了银行一项合同权利（偿还贷款的承诺）和一项财产权益（担保贷款的抵押）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Raising these questions also illustrates the deficiency of the second element of property, the concept of absolute ownership. Suzie’s parents own their house, but the ownership falls far short of Blackstone’s conception of absolute dominion. They cannot use their property for anything they want. If they want to put a store on the property, local zoning regulations may prevent it. If they host loud parties or leave garbage piled on the lawn, the neighbors or local officials may bring legal action to stop them. Nor can they prevent all others from using the property. They own the sidewalk in front of their house, but they cannot exclude pedestrians from using the sidewalk. And others may have ownership interests in the property, too. When they borrowed money to buy the house, they gave the bank a contract right (a promise to repay the money) and a property interest (the mortgage that secures the loan).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>当我们将财产的范畴扩展到无形资产，并推翻绝对所有权的理念时，我们就会发现，财产并非真正关乎物质的所有权。相反，财产关乎人们之间就宝贵资源所建立的关系。这些关系并非由布莱克斯通（或苏西）的绝对所有权概念所定义，而是根据具体情况而有所不同。财产法涉及一系列<em class="calibre8">权利</em>；没有单一的所有权概念是普遍适用的。相反，人们就宝贵的利益可以拥有各种各样的法律关系。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When we put together the extension of property to intangibles and the collapse of the idea of absolute ownership, we see that property is not really about the ownership of things. Instead, property is about relationships among people with respect to valuable resources. Those relationships are not defined by Blackstone’s—or Suzie’s—concept of absolute ownership but instead vary depending on the context. Property law involves a <em class="calibre8">bundle of rights</em>; no single concept of ownership prevails. Instead, there are a variety of legal relationships that people can have with respect to valuable interests.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>潜在权利束定义了所有者对某项财产可以拥有的权益。将权利束想象成一捆木棍。如果一个人持有某项财产（无论是有形的还是无形的）的所有木棍，那么我们认为该人是该财产的所有者。即使他们并非持有所有木棍，如果他们持有大部分木棍，或者持有一些特别重要的木棍，我们仍然可以认为他们拥有该财产。以下是人们可能拥有的最重要的木棍或财产权益。由于财产并非绝对，所有这些权益都受到限制。<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_216" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The bundle of potential rights defines what interests an owner can have in an item of property. Think of the bundle of rights as a bundle of sticks. If an individual is holding all of the sticks with respect to a certain subject of property, tangible or intangible, then we think of that person as the owner of the property. Even if they do not hold all of the sticks, if they hold most of them, or some particularly important sticks, we might still think of them as owning the property. Here are the most important sticks, or interests in property that one might have. Because property is not absolute, all of these are subject to limitation.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<div class="top">
<p class="bullet">•&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre8">使用自由</em>。苏西的父母可以对自己的房子做任何他们想做的事情，而不需要经过任何人的许可。</p><p class="bullet">•&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre8">Liberty to use</em>. Suzie’s parents can do pretty much what they want with their house without anyone else’s permission.</p>
<p class="bullet">•&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre8">排除权</em>。除非苏西的父母允许，否则任何人都无权使用这所房子。</p><p class="bullet">•&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre8">Right to exclude</em>. No one else has a right to use the house unless Suzie’s parents let them.</p>
<p class="bullet">•&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre8">房屋转让权</em>。苏西的父母可以出售或赠予房屋。他们也可以决定自己去世后房屋的归属，在遗嘱中将其留给苏西或防止虐待动物协会 (SPCA)。</p><p class="bullet">•&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre8">Power to transfer</em>. Suzie’s parents can sell or give away the house. They also can determine what happens to it upon their deaths, by leaving it in their wills to Suzie or to the SPCA.</p>
<p class="bullet">•&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre8">免于损害</em>。正如其他人无权使用该财产一样，其他人也无权损害该财产。如果邻居砍倒了自己的树，树倒塌砸穿了自家屋顶，苏西的父母可以向邻居索要维修屋顶的赔偿金。</p><p class="bullet">•&nbsp;&nbsp;<em class="calibre8">Immunity from damage</em>. Just as no one else can use the property, no one else has a legal power to damage the property. If a neighbor chops down his own tree and it falls through their roof, Suzie’s parents can recover money damages from the neighbor for the cost of repairing the roof.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">通过查看一些定义和限制这些基本利益的方式的例子，可以明显看出财产法在多大程度上是相对的而不是绝对的。通常，权利束中最重要的是禁止他人使用自己的财产的权利。禁止权的某些方面是显而易见的；无家可归的人未经允许不能在你的客厅睡觉。未经你的许可或没有合法权利进入你的土地都是<em class="calibre8">非法侵入</em>。如果有人穿过你的土地，在上面扔垃圾，甚至在你的草坪上遛狗，都是非法侵入。传统上，人们认为土地所有者不仅拥有土地的表面，还拥有延伸到地心和“天堂”的所有财产。前者仍然是正确的；你的邻居不能在你的土地下挖隧道，也不能斜挖以开采你土地下的矿产。然而，后一个概念已经被侵蚀了；飞机以 30,000 英尺的高空飞过您的房屋，或者卫星在您的房产上方绕地球运行，这并不构成侵犯。</p><p class="noindent">The extent to which property law is relational rather than absolute is evident by looking at a few examples of the ways in which one of these fundamental interests is defined and limited. Often the most important of the bundle of rights is the right to exclude others from the use of one’s property. Some aspects of the right to exclude are obvious; a homeless person can’t come sleep in your living room without permission. Any entry upon your land without your permission or without a legal privilege to enter is a <em class="calibre8">trespass</em>. If someone walks across your land, throws garbage on it, or even walks a dog on your lawn, it is a trespass. Traditionally, a landowner was thought to own not only the surface of the land but also all property extending down to the center of the earth and up “to the heavens.” The former is still true; your neighbor cannot dig a tunnel under your land, or dig diagonally to extract minerals under your land. The latter concept has been eroded, however; it is not a trespass for an airplane to fly over your house at 30,000 feet, or for a satellite to orbit the Earth above your property.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>不过，进入他人土地的某些行为享有特权，因此不构成非法侵入。例如，房屋出售后，卖方有合理的时间移走留在那里的物品，除非双方约定在出售前移走卖方的所有财产。警察、消防员和卫生检查员等公职人员在某些情况下可以进入该房产，以保护公共安全。如果苏西的父母在其房产上经营生意，反歧视法禁止他们以种族为由拒绝顾客。<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_217" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Some entries on other people’s land are privileged, though, and therefore are not trespasses. For example, the seller of a house has a reasonable time after the sale to remove items that have been left there, unless the parties have agreed that all of the seller’s property will be removed before the sale. Public officials such as the police, firefighters, and health inspectors can enter property under some circumstances to protect the public safety. If Suzie’s parents operate a business on their property, antidiscrimination laws prevent them from excluding customers on the grounds of race.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>假设没有物理入侵，而是其他类型的入侵。业主是否有权排除噪音、气味、烟雾或振动？如果您住在化肥厂附近，而该厂散发出难闻的气味，偶尔还会有灰尘落在您的土地上，您的财产权是否受到侵犯？如果对您财产权的侵犯被认为是不合理的，法律的答案是肯定的。这些对您财产的入侵被称为<em class="calibre8">滋扰</em>。它们也可能违反专门针对此类问题的地方法令或州法律。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Suppose there is not a physical invasion of the property but some other type of entry. Does a property owner have the right to exclude noise, smells, smoke, or vibrations? If you live near a fertilizer plant and the plant emits unpleasant odors and occasionally dust that settles on your land, have your property rights been invaded? The law’s answer is yes, if the infringement on your enjoyment of your property is deemed to be unreasonable. These invasions of your property are called <em class="calibre8">nuisances</em>. They also may violate local ordinances or state law specifically directed at these kinds of problems.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>当然，棘手的部分在于弄清楚灰尘、气味或噪音等何时才构成不合理。想想哪些噪音可能构成滋扰：你邻居家的孩子放学后练了一个小时的钢琴（很糟糕）？你十几岁的弟弟的摇滚乐队放学后开着最大音量练习了一个小时？三个小时？在午夜？在他们大型音乐会的前一天晚上？每天晚上？正如你所见，这里需要做出判断。法院将考虑入侵的类型、发生的时间、地点和频率，以及它对你财产的享受和经济价值的影响程度，以决定是否将某项活动定性为滋扰。这些判断是法院定义构成财产法的关系的任务的一部分。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The tricky part, of course, is figuring out when something like dust, odors, or noise are unreasonable. Think about noises that might constitute nuisances: Your neighbor’s kid practicing the piano (badly) for an hour after school? The kid’s teenage brother’s rock band practicing at full volume for an hour after school? For three hours? At midnight? The night before their big concert? Every night? As you can see, there are judgment calls to be made here. The court will look at the kind of invasion, when, where, and how frequently it occurs, and how much impact it has on the enjoyment and economic value of your property in deciding whether to label a certain activity a nuisance. These judgment calls are part of the courts’ task of defining the relationships that constitute the law of property.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>因此，财产法并非关乎物，甚至在简单意义上也并非关乎物的所有权。相反，财产法——如同所有其他法律一样——关乎社会中的价值分配。它不可避免地与经济、政治以及我们对美好社会的愿景息息相关。因此，我们需要探索什么才算财产，说某物是财产意味着什么，以及这些问题的答案如何与社会关系、权力和正义相联系。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>So property law is not about things, or even in a simple sense about the ownership of things. Instead, property law—like all other law—is about the allocation of value in society. It is inevitably tied to questions about economics, politics, and our vision of the good society. We need to explore, then, what qualifies as property, what it means to say something is property, and how the answers to those questions tie in to social relations, power, and justice.</p>

<p class="noindent">与任何法律体系一样，第一个问题是，我们究竟为何需要财产法？具体来说，我们为何需要私有财产制度？如果每个人都“拥有”一切共同财产，或者不存在任何可依法强制执行的所有权，那又有什么错呢？</p><p class="noindent">The first question, as with any body of law, is why do we need property law at all? In particular, why do we need a system of private property? What would be wrong if instead everybody “owned” everything in common, or if there were no legally enforceable rights to own anything?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>事实上，我们并不“需要”私有财产，因为一个社会即使没有私有财产也能存在。我们之所以知道这一点，是因为其他社会在完全不同的财产法理念下也做得很好。不妨想想我们社会的前身之一——封建时代的英国。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Actually, we don’t “need” private property, in that it would be possible for a society to exist without it. We know this because other societies have done perfectly well with wholly different conceptions of property law. Consider one of the predecessors of our own society, feudal England.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在中世纪，特别是在 1066 年诺曼征服之后，英国社会和政府的组织与<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_218" class="calibre4"></a>如今依然如此。流行赞美诗《万物光明美丽》中有一句不太为人所知的诗句，概括了封建生活的等级本质：</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the Middle Ages, especially after the Norman Conquest in 1066, English society and government were organized very differently than <a class="calibre4"></a>they are today. A lesser known verse of the popular hymn “All Things Bright and Beautiful” sums up the hierarchical nature of feudal life:</p>
<div class="top">
<p class="block"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>富人住在他的城堡里，</p><p class="block"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The rich man in his castle,</p>
<p class="block"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>门口的穷人，</p><p class="block"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The poor man at his gate,</p>
<p class="block"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>上帝创造了他们，无论高贵还是卑微，</p><p class="block"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>God made them, high or lowly,</p>
<p class="block"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>并命令他们的财产。</p><p class="block"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And ordered their estate.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">国王位于封建金字塔的顶端，金字塔向下延伸，包括主要领主、小贵族和骑士，一直到最底层的“低等”农奴。等级森严的统治者不能像今天的政府那样命令下属自动服从，下属也不能像今天的公民那样要求上级保护。服从和保护这两个难题通过一种结构得到解决，在这种结构中，封建秩序中的每个成员都拥有一个<em class="calibre8">庄园</em>。封建庄园界定了土地（最重要的财产形式）的所有权以及社会地位和政治义务。国王会将土地授予领主，作为回报，领主同意提供一定数量的士兵为国王作战。反过来，领主会将土地授予骑士，作为回报，骑士同意为领主作战，这有助于领主履行对国王的义务。如此循环往复，直至农奴，他们被授予土地耕种，作为回报，他们有义务向领主提供某些作物或劳作。由于财产权附带着战斗或耕作的义务，财产不能自由转让；国王不能冒险让领主财产的购买者或继承人无法提供必要的服务。因此，封建财产与现代私有财产几乎没有相似之处，但它所支撑的社会秩序却运行良好。</p><p class="noindent">The king was at the top of the feudal pyramid, which then extended down to include principal lords, lesser nobles, and knights, all the way down to “lowly” serfs at the bottom. Hierarchs could not command automatic obedience from subordinates, as governments can today, nor could subordinates demand protection from their superiors, as citizens can today. The twin problems of obedience and protection were solved by a structure in which each member of the feudal order had an <em class="calibre8">estate</em>. The feudal estate defined rights of ownership in land—the most significant form of property—as well as social status and political obligation. The king would grant land to a lord, in return for which the lord would agree to provide a certain number of soldiers to fight for the king. The lord, in turn, would grant land to a knight, in return for which the knight would agree to fight for the lord, which could help satisfy the lord’s obligations to the king. And so on down the line to the serfs, who would be granted land to farm in return for the duty to provide certain crops or labor to their lord. Because property rights carried with them obligations to fight or to farm, property was not freely transferable; the king could not take the chance that the buyer or heir of a lord’s property would be unable to provide the requisite service. So feudal property bore little resemblance to modern private property, but the social order it supported worked reasonably well.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>我们当代的私有财产法体系源于中世纪的等级制度。我们为什么拥有私有财产？它对我们有何意义？自布莱克斯通和约翰·洛克时代至今，律师、法官和学者们一直在努力解答这些问题。答案并不完全令人满意，而这种缺乏清晰度是法律混乱的根源之一。本文我们将重点探讨主导财产辩论的三类论点：第一，财产鼓励生产活动。第二，财产保护政治自由。第三，财产促进人类繁荣。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Our contemporary system of private property law evolved from the medieval estates system. Why do we have private property, and what does it do for us? Lawyers, judges, and scholars have grappled with these questions from the time of Blackstone and John Locke to the present. The answers are not entirely satisfactory, and this lack of clarity is one source of the confusion in the law. Here we focus on three types of arguments that have dominated the debate over property: First, property encourages productive activity. Second, property protects political liberty. Third, property contributes to human flourishing.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>财产可以说鼓励人们从事生产活动，因为它为人们提供了一定的安全感，使他们知道自己的财产将受到保护，并创建了一个系统，使财产可以转移到那些最有效地利用它的人手中。同样的寓言<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_219" class="calibre4"></a>从布莱克斯通时代到现代法律和经济学者，人们一直用这种方法来解释这一观点。假设你决定在一块土地上种植庄稼。你耕耘土地、播种、浇水施肥。然而，到了收获的日子，你却发现邻居前一天晚上就已经来过，把你种的所有粮食都占为己有。如果你对这些庄稼没有合法的产权，你唯一的选择就是对邻居动武，但如果邻居比你体格强壮，你可能不会这么做。将来，如果你无法享受劳动成果，你就没有动力辛勤种植庄稼了。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Property arguably encourages people to engage in productive activity by providing them some security in knowing that their property will be protected and by creating a system in which property can be transferred to those people who will use it most effectively. The same parables have <a class="calibre4"></a>been used from the time of Blackstone to modern law and economics scholars to illustrate the point. Suppose you decide to grow crops on a piece of land. You till the soil, plant seeds, and water and fertilize your crops. When the day comes for your crops to be harvested, however, you find that your neighbor has been there the night before and has taken for himself all of the food you have grown. If you don’t have a legally enforceable property right in the crops, your only recourse is to use force against your neighbor, which you may not be inclined to do if he is bigger and stronger than you are. In the future, you won’t have much of an incentive to work hard growing crops if you won’t be able to enjoy the fruits of your labor.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>假设你和你的邻居相比，不是一个很优秀的农民。你每年只能在这块土地上生产100蒲式耳的玉米，而一个更优秀的农民可以生产200蒲式耳。如果你能把土地卖给邻居，或者把种植玉米的土地使用权卖给邻居，你和邻居的境况都会好转。但除非你拥有土地的产权，拥有土地的独占使用权，并可以转让使用权，否则你无法这样做。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Suppose also that you are not a very good farmer, compared to some of your neighbors. You can only produce 100 bushels a year of corn on the land, while a better farmer could produce 200 bushels. If you can sell your land to your neighbor, or sell the right to use the land to grow corn, you and your neighbor both will be better off. But you cannot do so unless you have property rights in the land, to use it exclusively and to transfer the right to use.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>简而言之，财产法发挥着经济功能。如果人们拥有财产使用权的法律保障、排除他人使用财产的合法权利以及将财产转让给他人的权利，他们就更有可能投入劳动力和资本来开发资源，而资源也会流向那些能够最有效地利用资源的人。这些结果不仅惠及使用资源的个人，也惠及整个社会，因为正如经济学家所说，它们鼓励人们将资源“发挥到极致”。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In short, property law serves an economic function. If people have legal protection for the use of property, the legal ability to exclude others from using it, and the capacity to transfer property to others, they are more likely to invest labor and capital in the development of resources, and resources will flow to the hands of those who can use them most effectively. These consequences benefit the individuals who use resources and they benefit society as a whole because, as the economists say, they encourage people to put resources to their “highest and best use.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>私有财产是否真的能以这些方式促进生产活动，取决于经济学论证所隐含假设的有效性。许多著作致力于探讨这些经济学论证，本文无法深入探讨。然而，经济学论证将理论分析转化为实证假设：一个人会做任何法律未禁止的事情，并且一个人只会做受法律保护的事情。强者掠夺弱者，农民只有在其劳动成果受到法律保护的情况下才会耕种，这未必属实。在这两种情况下，社会约束或对自身利益和社区利益的不同看法，都可能导致人们做出经济学论证未曾预测的行为。人类学家已经描述了许多社会和情境，在这些社会和情境中，资源的集体所有制而非私有财产制在经济上更具生产力。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Whether private property really does encourage productive activity in these ways depends on the validity of the implicit assumptions underlying the economic argument. Many books have been devoted to examining these economic arguments, and they cannot be explored in depth here. Consider, however, that the economic argument translates a theoretical analysis into an empirical assumption: that a person will do anything not prohibited by law, and that a person will only do things protected by law. It is not necessarily true that the strong will steal from the weak, nor that farmers will farm only if they have legal protection for their efforts. In both instances, social constraints or different perceptions of self-interest and community interest may cause people to act in ways that the economic argument does not predict. Anthropologists have described many societies and situations in which collective ownership of resources rather than private property was economically productive.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>此外，今天关于私有财产的经济功能的争论在考虑知识产权时呈现出不同的形式<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_220" class="calibre4"></a>电子形式，例如电影、音乐和在线内容。提供强有力的保护或许可以鼓励制作人创作更多此类内容——摇滚乐队会录制更多歌曲，唱片公司会发行更多CD——但同时也会阻止或阻碍其他人利用这些内容进行创作——嘻哈艺人将更难重新混音歌曲，歌迷也将更难创建包含这些歌曲的致敬网站。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Moreover, today the debate about the economic function of private property takes on a different form when considering intellectual property <a class="calibre4"></a>in electronic form, such as movies, music, and online content. Providing strong protection may encourage producers to create more such content—rock groups will record more songs and recording companies will distribute more CDs—but it also prevents or discourages other people from building on that content—hip-hop artists will be less able to remix the songs, and fans will be less able to create tribute websites containing the songs.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>私有财产也具有政治维度。拥有财产并由此建立一种独立于他人（无论这些人是封建领主还是现代政府）的手段的能力，使财产所有者能够主张政治独立。有时人们说财产是民主的先决条件，因为财产使公民能够自由发言并参与公共事务，而不必担心政治参与会损害其经济福祉。对托马斯·杰斐逊来说，这意味着每个人（或至少每个成年白人男性）都应该有机会拥有土地，并且土地所有权不应集中在少数富裕家庭手中。他写道：“依赖导致屈从和贪婪”，而独立所有权则有助于民主。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There also is a political dimension to private property. The ability to own property and thereby to establish a means of independence from others—whether those others are feudal lords or the modern government—makes it possible for the property owner to assert political independence. Sometimes it is said that property is a precondition of democracy, because property enables a citizen to speak freely and participate in public affairs without concern that political participation will undermine one’s economic well-being. For Thomas Jefferson, this meant that everyone (or at least every adult white male) should have the opportunity to own land and that land ownership should not be concentrated in a few wealthy families. “Dependence begets subservience and venality,” he wrote, while independent ownership contributes to democracy.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>20世纪60年代，关于财产的政治争论被应用于众多依靠政府救济维持生计的人们。耶鲁大学法学院教授查尔斯·赖希在一篇备受赞誉的法律评论文章《新财产》中指出，福利领取者、政府雇员以及公共特许经营权和执照持有者需要对其福利拥有财产权，以确立自己在政治上独立于国家的地位。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the 1960s the political argument for property was applied to the many people who depend on government largesse for their livelihood. In a much-celebrated law review article titled “The New Property,” Yale law school professor Charles Reich argued that welfare recipients, government employees, and the holders of public franchises and licenses needed property rights in their benefits to establish themselves as politically independent of the state.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>近来，我们逐渐认识到政治上关于私有财产的论证的局限性。正如杰斐逊所言，促成民主的不仅仅是财产，还有财产的分散。当财产集中在大公司手中，当富裕的机构主宰大众媒体和政治进程时，个人参与和影响事务的能力就会下降。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Lately we have come to recognize the limits of the political argument for private property. As Jefferson noted, it is not just property but the dispersion of property that contributes to democracy. When property is concentrated in large corporations, and when wealthy institutions dominate the mass media and the political process, the ability of individuals to participate and influence affairs declines.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最后，财产具有强烈的个人维度。物品对人们来说可能非常重要，因为它们有助于建立自我意识、地域感、存在感和归属感。毫不夸张地说，一个心爱的洋娃娃或一条珍贵的毛毯对小苏西的重要性，就如同她父母拥有一栋房子或其他珍贵物品（从传家宝到昂贵的汽车）一样重要。这些财产元素在一定程度上定义了苏西和她父母的身份，如果没有拥有这些物品的能力，他们就不再是同一个人。这一点可以通过观察人们几乎无法获得财产的环境来理解。在监狱或精神病院里，<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_221" class="calibre4"></a>囚犯会收集一些物品，藏起来，或者随身携带，以建立个人空间和自我意识。宗教团体中无私的一个重要表现是放弃财产：这不仅意味着发誓过着清贫的生活，也意味着放弃拥有一些必需品作为个人财产的权利。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Finally, there is a strong personal dimension to property. Things can be very important to people because they contribute to creating a sense of self, a sense of place, a sense of being and belonging. It is not too far a stretch to say that the importance of a favorite doll or a treasured blanket to little Suzie is analogous to her parents’ ownership of a house, or other cherished items, from family heirlooms to an expensive car. These elements of property define, in part, who Suzie and her parents are, and without the ability to own them they would not be the same persons. The point can be seen by looking at environments in which people have little access to property. In prisons or mental institutions, <a class="calibre4"></a>inmates collect a few belongings, hide them, or carry them around to establish a personal space and a sense of self. And an important demonstration of selflessness in a religious order is abandoning property: not just taking a vow of poverty but giving up the ability to own more than a few necessities as personal property.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0013_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-7-div1-4"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0061" class="calibre1">有哪些类型的财产？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0061" class="calibre1">What Kinds of Property Are There?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">财产涵盖范围很广。（请原谅我的双关语。）正如我们所见，苏西的洋娃娃、她父母的房子以及她父亲的版权只是财产的几个方面。法律对不同类型的财产有不同的处理方式，因此，理清一个人可以拥有的财产类型是有帮助的。</p><p class="noindent">Property covers a lot of ground. (Forgive the pun.) As we have seen, Suzie’s doll, her parents’ house, and her father’s copyright are only some of the subjects of property. The law treats different kinds of property differently, so it is helpful to sort out the kinds of property that one can own.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>或许最基本的区别在于<em class="calibre8">不动产</em>和<em class="calibre8">动产</em>之间的区别。不动产是指土地以及永久附着于土地的物品。（“房地产”和“房地产经纪人”等术语的由来也源于此。）动产则涵盖其他一切。家具、珠宝和汽车属于动产，但诸如版权、专利、股票和债券等无形资产也属于动产。某些类型的财产存在难以定义的问题——例如，种植的农作物有时属于不动产，有时属于动产——但在大多数情况下，不动产和动产之间的区别很容易理解。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Perhaps the most basic distinction is between <em class="calibre8">real property</em> and <em class="calibre8">personal property</em>. Real property is land and things permanently attached to the land. (Thus the origin of terms such as “real estate” and “Realtor.”) Personal property is everything else. Furniture, jewelry, and cars are personal property but so are intangibles such as copyrights, patents, and stocks and bonds. Some types of property present difficult definitional issues—growing crops are sometimes real property, sometimes personal property—but for the most part the distinction between real and personal property is easy to understand.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，我们为何要进行这种区分以及其含义则更为复杂。正如我们所见，在中世纪，土地不仅是财富的载体，也是社会组织体系的基础。封建制度衰落后，土地仍然值得特殊对待，因为它是最广泛、最重要的财富形式，因此需要遵循特殊的程序形式。例如，当托马斯·杰斐逊主张将财产分配作为抵御暴政的保障时，他指的是将土地分配给小农户，而不是像王朝那样将土地全部占有。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Why we have the distinction and what it means are more complicated, though. In medieval times, as we have seen, land was not only an object of wealth but also the basis of a system of social organization. After the decline of feudalism, land still merited special treatment because it was the most widespread and important form of wealth and, as such, was subject to special procedural forms. For example, when Thomas Jefferson argued for the distribution of property as protection against tyranny, he meant the distribution of land among small farmers, in opposition to large dynastic landholdings.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如今，不动产与动产之间历史性的区别，加上不动产与动产之间的功能差异，体现在不同种类财产的不同处理方式上。不同的法律体系分别管辖不同类型的财产以及每种财产中的许多子类别。出售一块土地受一套法律管辖，而出售一辆汽车则受另一套法律管辖。土地所有者使用土地的方式受几套相互重叠的法律体系管辖，而所有者对汽车或版权的权利则有所不同。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Today the historical distinction between real and personal property, combined with the functional differences between property that doesn’t go anywhere and property that does, is seen in the different treatment of the different kinds of property. Separate bodies of law regulate each type of property and many subcategories within each type. Selling a piece of land is governed by one body of law; selling a car is governed by another. The ways in which a landowner can use a piece of land is governed by several overlapping bodies of law, while the rights an owner has in a car or a copyright are different still.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>显而易见，有些财产是有形的，有些是无形的。土地曾经是最普遍的财产形式，但<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_222" class="calibre4"></a>如今，无形资产的价值和重要性远超有形资产。普通家庭可能拥有汽车和房产，但他们也可能拥有退休账户、一些共同基金以及银行账户，这些账户的价值甚至超过了有形资产。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As should be evident, some property is tangible and some is intangible. Indeed, land once was the most prevalent form of property, but <a class="calibre4"></a>now intangible property dwarfs real property in value and importance. The average family may own a car and a house, but they also may own a retirement account, some mutual funds, and bank accounts that exceed the value of their tangible property.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>一种特殊的无形财产是<em class="calibre8">知识产权</em>，即通过智力劳动而非体力劳动创造的财产。专利和版权都属于知识产权。<em class="calibre8">专利</em>是使用、许可或销售一项发明的专有权。当一位发明家设计出一种更好的捕鼠器（或者，如今更现实的情况是，当一家大型制药公司的研发部门研发出一种新药时），发明家可以向政府申请专利，证明该发明的原创性和实用性，并获得专利，使该发明在一定年限内成为发明家的财产。专利法最初保护的是机械创新，例如捕鼠器，但现在已扩展到其他类型的发明；关于专利应在多大程度上涵盖商业方法（例如亚马逊的一键订购系统）、生物体（例如用于清理漏油的微生物），甚至科学发现（例如人类基因组的解码），一直存在争议。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A particular kind of intangible property is <em class="calibre8">intellectual property</em>, or property created through intellectual work rather than physical work. Patents and copyrights are intellectual property. A <em class="calibre8">patent</em> is the exclusive right to use, license, or sell an invention. When an inventor designs a better mousetrap (or, more realistically these days, when the research department of a large pharmaceutical company creates a new drug), the inventor can apply to the government, proving the originality and usefulness of the invention, and be granted a patent that makes the invention the inventor’s property for a term of years. Patent law originally protected mechanical innovations, like mousetraps, but it now extends to other types of inventions; controversies have arisen over how far it should go in covering business methods (such as Amazon.com’s one-click ordering system), living organisms (such as microbes used for cleaning up oil spills), and even scientific discoveries (such as the decoding of the human genome).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>同样，当小说家创作书籍时，她获得了作品的财产权益，即<em class="calibre8">版权</em>。版权涵盖多种类型的创意作品，包括虚构和非虚构作品（例如本书）、摄影、歌曲、电影和网站。版权保护的是思想的表达，而不是思想本身；迪士尼无法阻止你创作以一只有趣的老鼠为主角的动画片，但它可以阻止你描绘其特有的老鼠米奇。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Similarly, when a novelist writes a book, she acquires a property interest in the work known as a <em class="calibre8">copyright</em>. Copyright covers many kinds of creative works, including works of fiction and nonfiction (such as this book), photographs, songs, movies, and websites. Copyright protects the expression of ideas rather than the ideas themselves; Disney cannot prevent you from creating a cartoon with an amusing mouse as the protagonist, but it can prevent you from depicting its particular mouse, Mickey.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">商标</em>是一种与知识产权相关的财产。专利和版权之所以受到保护，是因为它们具有原创性；商标之所以受到保护，是因为它们具有商业价值。“麦当劳”这个名称和金色拱门标志之所以有价值，是因为人们将它们与麦当劳快餐以及该公司试图通过其形象所传达的便利、品质和乐趣联系起来。因此，麦当劳公司对该名称和标志拥有财产权益，尽管权益的程度与其他形式的财产不同。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">Trademarks</em> are a kind of property related to intellectual property. Patents and copyrights are protected because they are original creations; trademarks are protected because they have commercial value. The name “McDonald’s” and the golden arches symbol have value because people associate them with McDonald’s fast food and all of the convenience, quality, and fun that the company tries to evoke with the images. Accordingly, the McDonald’s Corporation has a property interest in the name and the symbol, although the extent of the interest is different from other forms of property.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>知识产权体现了关于财产权的一些非常重要的观点。首先，当我们思考财产权时，我们很容易认为财产权是自然产生的，唯一的问题是如何分配它。土地、树木，甚至制成品，在它们被分配为财产之前就已经存在了。但版权和专利的性质应该清楚地表明，财产权是法律的产物。没有法律，发明和小说仍然会存在，但<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_223" class="calibre4"></a>它们中不存在任何财产权。由于知识产权是由法律创造和监管的，因此与几个世纪以来由普通法裁决分配的财产相比，这一点可能更容易理解。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Intellectual property illustrates some very important points about property in general. First, when we think of property, it is easy to think that property is somehow naturally occurring and the only issue is to how to allocate it. Land, trees, and even manufactured products have an existence that predates their allocation as property. But the nature of copyrights and patents should make clear that property is a product of the law. Without law, there would still be inventions and novels, but <a class="calibre4"></a>there would be no property rights in them. Because intellectual property is created and regulated by law, it may be easier to see this than with property that has been allocated by centuries of common law rulings.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>其次，知识产权明确指出，财产所有权的概念并非单一。专利、版权和商标都是知识产权的形式，但管辖它们的法律为每一种形式赋予了不同的权益——不同的权利组合。例如，财产权益的期限：专利为20年；版权为作者终生加70年（公司持有的版权最长可达120年）；商标为具有商业价值的期限。国会不时修改这些条款——1998年，它延长了版权期限，尤其是保护即将到期的迪士尼米老鼠版权。到期后，该财产将进入<em class="calibre8">公共领域</em>，任何人都可以复制或使用。在每种情况下，法律都会构建财产所有权的含义，并且不同类型的财产的定义也有所不同。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Second, intellectual property makes clear that there is no single conception of the ownership of property. Patents, copyrights, and trademarks are all forms of intellectual property, but the law governing them creates different interests with respect to each—a different bundle of rights. The duration of the property interest, for example, is twenty years for a patent, the life of the author plus seventy years for a copyright (or up to 120 years for copyrights held by companies), and as long as it is commercially valuable for a trademark. Congress changes these terms from time to time—in 1998, it extended copyright terms, notably protecting Disney’s Mickey Mouse copyright, which was about to expire. After those periods, the property goes into the <em class="calibre8">public domain</em> and can be copied or used by anyone. In each case, the law constructs what it means to own property, and the definition differs with respect to different kinds of property.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第三，知识产权与所有其他财产一样，是法律平衡所有者、非所有者和整个社会利益的产物。宪法授权联邦政府授予专利和版权，“以促进科学和实用艺术的进步”，而知识产权法既创造又限制所有者的权利，以实现这一目标。作为政府授予专有专利权的回报，发明人必须披露其发明是什么以及它是如何运作的；其他发明人可以在此基础上进行自己的发现。版权包含<em class="calibre8">合理使用</em>的概念，因此版权所有者的利益并非排他性的；评论者可以在评论中引用小说的部分内容，或者大学教授可以在英语课程中使用其中的一部分来阐明某个观点，而不会侵犯版权。近年来一些最激烈的知识产权辩论都涉及这种平衡，例如版权期限是否应该延长，以及通过点对点网络共享文件是否侵犯版权。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Third, intellectual property, like all other property, is a product of the law’s balancing of the interests of owners, nonowners, and society at large. The Constitution empowers the federal government to grant patents and copyrights “to promote the progress of science and useful arts,” and intellectual property law both creates and restricts the owner’s rights in order to achieve that objective. In return for the grant of exclusive patent rights by the government, the inventor has to disclose what the invention is and how it works; other inventors can then build on that knowledge in making discoveries of their own. Copyright includes a concept of <em class="calibre8">fair use</em>, so that the copyright owner’s interest is not exclusive; a reviewer can quote part of a novel in a review, or a college professor can use a portion of it to illustrate a point in an English course without infringing the copyright. Some of the most heated intellectual property debates of recent years have involved this kind of balancing, such as whether copyright terms should be extended for longer periods and whether file-sharing through peer-to-peer networks infringes copyrights.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0013_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-7-div1-5"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0062" class="calibre1">谁拥有互联网？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0062" class="calibre1">Who Owns the Internet?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">互联网是一个特别好的例证，可以用来思考财产问题，因为新技术和新用途的爆炸式增长为法律带来了许多不同的难题。本章开篇解释了财产法并不遵循对物权绝对所有权的直观理解。互联网由多种事物构成，包括与物类似的信息，以及一些与物相关的事物。<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_224" class="calibre4"></a>几乎根本不像事物，决定谁拥有什么权利需要创造性的分析，而不仅仅是直觉。</p><p class="noindent">The Internet is a particularly good illustration for thinking about property because the explosion of new technologies and new uses presents many different puzzles for the law to solve. The beginning of this chapter explained that property law does not follow the intuitive understanding of the absolute ownership of things. The Internet is made up of many kinds of things, information that is like things, and some things that are <a class="calibre4"></a>hardly thing-like at all, and deciding who has what rights requires creative analysis and not just intuition.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>从产权角度来看，互联网最容易理解的部分是其物理基础设施。互联网是由计算机网络组成的网络。你拥有位于网络末端的计算机。你的互联网服务提供商拥有接入你家并连接到你计算机的线路。星巴克拥有向顾客广播Wi-Fi信号的路由器。无数其他路由器、接入点、卫星、计算机以及绵延数英里的电缆都归某人所有。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The easiest part of the Internet to understand in property terms is its physical infrastructure. The Internet is a network of computer networks. You own your computer at the very end of the network. Your Internet service provider owns the wires that go into your house and connect to your computer. Starbucks owns the router that broadcasts a Wi-Fi signal to its customers. Innumerable other routers, access points, satellites, computers, and miles of cable are owned by somebody.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，当我们谈论互联网时，我们大多数时候谈论的是流经物理基础设施的信息：电子邮件、YouTube视频、博客、维基百科、电影、报纸的在线版本等等。法律，包括合同法、侵权法以及财产法，在适应这些海量信息的生产和传播方面遇到了一些困难。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When we talk about the Internet, however, most of the time we are talking about the information that flows through the physical infrastructure: e-mails, YouTube videos, blogs, Wikipedia, movies, online editions of newspapers, and more. The law, including contract and tort law as well as property law, has had some difficulty adapting to the production and distribution of this wealth of information.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>一个基本原则是，互联网上的所有内容都归某人所有。福克斯电视网拥有其网站上发布的<em class="calibre8">《辛普森一家》</em>剧集的版权。谷歌拥有其搜索主页上多彩的“Google”标志的商标。在其网站上投放广告的大公司、在YouTube上发布古怪视频的大学生，或发布关于她爱犬的感想的博主，每个人都拥有这些信息的财产权。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A basic principle is that everything on the Internet is owned by someone. The Fox television network holds the copyright in episodes of <em class="calibre8">The Simpsons</em> posted on its website. Google owns the trademark in the multicolored “Google” that resides on its search home page. A big company that puts a commercial on its websites, a college student who posts a wacky video on YouTube, or a blogger who posts musings about her dog each has property rights in the information.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>由于网上的一切均归某人所有，所有者可以主张财产所有者的普通权利。拥有歌曲版权的音乐公司在互联网上发行该歌曲的权利与在CD上发行该歌曲的权利相同。因此，当罗德岛州普罗维登斯的研究生乔尔·特南鲍姆使用Napster等文件共享网站发布和下载涅槃乐队和其他乐队的30首歌曲时，陪审团裁定他向这些乐队的唱片公司支付67.5万美元的版权侵权赔偿金。同样，如果你在你的网站上发布《辛普森一家》的剧集，福克斯的律师会向你的互联网服务提供商发送一份“删除通知”，告知他们你侵犯了他们的版权，并要求互联网服务提供商删除该剧集。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Because everything online is owned by someone, the owner can assert the ordinary rights of a property owner. A music company that copyrights a song has the same rights to distribution of the song on the Internet as it does in distribution on a CD. Therefore when Joel Tenenbaum, a Providence, Rhode Island, graduate student, used file-sharing sites like Napster to post and download thirty songs by Nirvana and other groups, a jury ordered him to pay $675,000 to the groups’ recording companies for copyright infringement. Similarly, if you post a Simpsons episode on your website, Fox’s lawyers will send a “take-down notice” to your Internet service provider telling them that you are infringing their copyright and demanding that the ISP remove it.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>商标赋予了类似的权利。电影摄像设备制造商潘那维申（Panavision）试图注册panavision.com，却发现该网址已被丹尼斯·托彭（Dennis Toeppen）注册。托彭提出以1.3万美元的价格将该域名出售给潘那维申，作为他注册著名商标域名（包括达美航空、艾迪·鲍尔、汉莎航空和尼曼·马库斯等）并将其转售给商标所有者的计划的一部分（<em class="calibre8">潘那维申国际诉托彭案</em>，1998年）。潘那维申非但没有支付这笔费用，反而成功起诉托彭，指控他稀释了其商标价值。国会颁布了《反域名抢注法》。<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_225" class="calibre4"></a>1999年《消费者保护法》旨在防止此类大胆却非法的行为。约翰·祖卡里尼（John Zuccarini）注册了electronicboutique.com、ebwold.com和ebworl.com等域名，利用网络用户在访问电子游戏零售商Electronics Boutique的网站electronics.com和ebworld.com时出现的拼写错误。Electronics Boutique提起诉讼，法院依据法律规定，责令祖卡里尼交出这些域名并赔偿损失（<em class="calibre8">Electronics Boutique Holdings Corp.诉祖卡里尼案</em>，2000年）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Trademarks give similar rights. Panavision, the maker of movie camera equipment, tried to register panavision.com, only to discover that the URL had already been registered by Dennis Toeppen. Toeppen offered to sell the domain name to Panavision for $13,000, as part of his enterprise of registering domain names of famous trademarks—Delta Airlines, Eddie Bauer, Lufthansa, and Neiman Marcus, among others—and reselling them to the trademark owners (<em class="calibre8">Panavision International v. Toeppen</em>, 1998). Instead of paying, Panavision successfully sued Toeppen for diluting the value of its trademark. Congress enacted the Anticybersquatting <a class="calibre4"></a>Consumer Protection Act in 1999 to prevent such enterprising but illegal behavior. John Zuccarini registered the domain names electronicboutique.com, ebwold.com, and ebworl.com to take advantage of misspelling by Web users trying to go to electronics boutique. com and ebworld.com, the sites of video game retailer Electronics Boutique. Electronics Boutique sued and the court, applying the statute, ordered Zuccarini to turn over the domain names and to pay damages (<em class="calibre8">Electronics Boutique Holdings Corp. v. Zuccarini</em>, 2000).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>但正如本章经常提到的，财产权不是绝对的。商标或版权所有者不能禁止任何人以任何目的使用其作品的任何部分。安德鲁·费伯 (Andrew Faber) 创建了一个名为 Bally Sucks 的网站，用于发布对 Bally Total Fitness 健身俱乐部的投诉。尽管该网站使用了 Bally 的商标徽标和名称，但它并未侵犯或淡化商标，因为没有人会将投诉网站与真正的 Bally 混淆（<em class="calibre8">Bally Total Fitness Holding Corp v. Faber</em>，1998）。同样，当斯蒂芬妮·伦茨 (Stephanie Lenz) 上传了一段她 13 个月大的儿子跟着 Prince 的歌曲“Let's Go Crazy”蹦蹦跳跳的 YouTube 视频时，环球唱片根据《数字千年版权法》向 YouTube 发出通知，要求删除该视频，因为它侵犯了他们对这首歌的版权。YouTube 通知伦茨将删除该视频。伦茨根据该法规行使她的权利，提出抗议，声称她对这首歌的使用是版权法允许的合理使用。 YouTube转发了这首歌，Lenz更进一步，起诉环球影业滥用版权法。（这起案件已经持续了六年多。）</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But as is often stated in this chapter, property rights are not absolute. The owner of a trademark or copyright cannot bar anyone from using any portion of its work for any purpose. Andrew Faber created a website called Bally Sucks to post complaints about Bally Total Fitness health clubs. Although the site used Bally’s trademarked logos and names, it did not infringe or dilute the trademarks because no one could confuse the complaint site with the real Bally’s (<em class="calibre8">Bally Total Fitness Holding Corp v. Faber</em>, 1998). Similarly, when Stephanie Lenz uploaded a YouTube video of her thirteen-month-old son bouncing along to “Let’s Go Crazy” by Prince, Universal Music sent a notice to YouTube under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act demanding that the video be taken down because it infringed their copyright in the song. YouTube notified Lenz that it was removing the video. Exercising her rights under the statute, Lenz filed a protest claiming that her use of the song was fair use permitted under the copyright law. YouTube reposted the song and Lenz went one step further, suing Universal for misusing the statute. (The case has been going on for more than six years.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>新的互联网技术带来了更为复杂的问题。谷歌和其他搜索引擎依赖于使用他人的知识产权。在谷歌上搜索“辛普森一家”，会跳转到福克斯电视台的网站链接、存储在谷歌电脑中的福克斯网站“缓存”图片，以及来自各个网站的辛普森一家角色的缩略图和全尺寸图片。谷歌展示这些图片、在其电脑上存储图片或链接到可能侵犯福克斯版权的网站，是否侵犯了福克斯的版权？一系列案例提供了答案，通常认为搜索引擎展示不属于其所有的内容属于合理使用。除其他原因外，搜索过程具有“转化性”，而非简单地重新发布图像，版权法的目的是促进创造力；搜索引擎通过使在线查找信息变得更容易来实现这一目的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>New Internet technologies present even more complex problems. Google and other search engines depend on using other people’s intellectual property. A search for “The Simpsons” on Google produces links to the Fox television websites, “cached” images of the Fox website that are stored in Google’s computers, and thumbnail and full-size images of the Simpsons characters from various sites. Does Google infringe on Fox’s copyright by showing the images, storing images on its computers, or linking to websites that may themselves be infringing Fox’s copyright? A series of cases have offered answers, generally holding that search engines’ display of items they do not own is fair use. Among other reasons, the search process is “transformative” rather than a simple republication of the image, and the purpose of the copyright law is to promote creativity; search engines serve that purpose by making it easier to find information online.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>人们本能地会将互联网信息与传统形式的财产进行类比，但有时这种类比很难实现。在现实世界中，<em class="calibre8">侵犯动产</em>的侵权行为提供了一种补救措施<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_226" class="calibre4"></a>侵犯个人财产（动产）所有者的利益，例如青少年开着邻居的车兜风。有人能侵入计算机系统吗？当 Bidder's Edge 的软件机器人每天访问 eBay 的拍卖网站 100,000 次，收集信息并汇总到 Bidder's Edge 自己的网站上时，其他拍卖聚合器可能会做同样的事情并压垮 eBay 的服务器，法院下令 Bidder's Edge 停止（<em class="calibre8">eBay, Inc. v. Bidder's Edge, Inc.</em>，2000 年）。但是，当英特尔公司心怀不满的前雇员 Kourosh Hamidi 在两年内向大约 35,000 名英特尔员工发送了六封电子邮件时，法院裁定不存在侵入，因为 Hamidi 的电子邮件对英特尔系统的影响微不足道（<em class="calibre8">英特尔公司诉 Hamidi</em>，2003 年）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One instinct about information on the Internet is to analogize it to traditional forms of property, but sometimes the analogy is hard to draw. In the physical world the tort of <em class="calibre8">trespass to chattels</em> provides a remedy <a class="calibre4"></a>for interfering with the interest of an owner of personal property (a chattel), as where a teenager takes a neighbor’s car for a joyride. Can someone trespass on a computer system? When Bidder’s Edge’s software robot accessed eBay’s auction website 100,00 times a day to collect information to aggregate on Bidder’s Edge’s own site, thereby raising the possibility that other auction aggregators would do the same thing and overwhelm eBay’s servers, the court ordered Bidder’s Edge to stop (<em class="calibre8">eBay, Inc. v. Bidder’s Edge, Inc</em>., 2000). But when Kourosh Hamidi, a disgruntled former employee of Intel Corporation, sent six e-mails over two years to some 35,000 Intel employees, the court found there was no trespass because the impact of Hamidi’s e-mails on Intel’s system was trivial (<em class="calibre8">Intel Corp. v. Hamidi</em>, 2003).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>互联网受合同法和财产法的管辖。网站通过服务条款限制人们使用其所含信息的方式，无论是否通过“我接受”框同意；<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.n0122" href="#text/part0012_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-6" class="calibre4">第六章</a>讨论了这些条款的可执行性。但一些网络知识产权所有者采取了不同的方式，扩大而不是限制他人使用其财产的权利。暴雪娱乐为其广受欢迎的角色扮演游戏《魔兽世界》的用户提供一项全面许可，允许他们在个人网站上使用游戏截图。知识共享组织是一个非营利组织，提供标准的知识产权许可形式，使网络用户可以轻松地允许他人使用其作品。知识共享许可包括以下形式：允许他人以任何方式使用其作品，只要注明原所有者；允许他人使用其作品，即通过财产进行“相同方式共享”；以及允许他人以任何方式使用其作品，但仅限于非商业用途。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Internet is governed by contract law as well as property. Websites restrict how people can use the information they contain through terms of service, whether agreed to through an “I accept” box or not; <a href="#text/part0012_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-6" class="calibre4">Chapter 6</a> discusses the enforceability of these terms. But some owners of intellectual property on the Web have taken a different approach and expanded rather than restricted the rights of other people to use their property. Blizzard Entertainment gives users of its hugely popular World of Warcraft role-playing game a blanket license to use screen-shots from the game on their personal websites. Creative Commons is a nonprofit group that offers standard forms for licensing intellectual property that make it easy for Web users to allow others to use their works. Creative Commons licenses include forms that, for example, allow others to use their work in any way as long as they credit the original owner, to “share alike” by using property as long as they then allow others to use their own works, and to use it in any way but only for noncommercial purposes.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>互联网对法律提出的最具挑衅性的挑战出现在虚拟世界中，包括亡灵法师、圣骑士、暗影骑士以及其他潜伏在《无尽的任务》中的虚拟人物，以及拥有数百万居民和自身经济的《第二人生》。虚拟世界中的资产具有现实世界的价值；《第二人生》的货币林登币可以用真实的美元进行买卖。虚拟世界中的虚拟人物获得财产的方式与现实生活中的虚拟人物相同，都是通过工作、交易和创造力获得的，而财产之于虚拟人物，其重要性不亚于传统财产之于现实生活中的人们。因此，法律是否应该承认虚拟财产权？或者，创建和托管虚拟世界的公司是否可以利用服务条款来控制虚拟世界中发生的一切？马克·布拉格起诉了《第二人生》的制作公司林登研究公司，此前林登研究公司冻结了他的账户，剥夺了他在现实世界中价值4000至6000美元的虚拟财产；布拉格<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_227" class="calibre4"></a>最终，林登和解了此案。那么，应该用什么法律来解决由此产生的纠纷呢？如果虚拟世界是一个拥有自身规范和规则的社区，那么它也应该拥有自己的法律体系吗？或者，现有的法律体系至少应该承认这些规范和规则在现实世界的法庭上具有约束力吗？随着这些环境从游戏演变为现实世界，它们挑战着我们对财产和法律的观念。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The most provocative challenge the Internet presents to law arises in virtual worlds, including the Necromancers, Paladins, Shadowknights, and other avatars who stalk EverQuest, and Second Life with its millions of inhabitants and its own economy. Assets in virtual worlds have real-world value; Linden dollars, the currency of Second Life, are bought and sold for real U.S. dollars. Avatars in virtual worlds acquire property the same way as their real-life counterparts, through work, trade, and ingenuity, and the property is as important to the virtual persona as traditional property is to physical people. Should the law therefore recognize virtual property rights? Or can the company that produces and hosts a virtual world use the terms of service to exercise control over everything that happens there? Marc Bragg sued Linden Research, the producer of Second Life, after Linden froze his account, depriving him of virtual property worth $4,000 to $6,000 in the real world; Bragg <a class="calibre4"></a>and Linden eventually settled the case. And what law should be used to resolve the disputes that arise? If a virtual world is a community with its own norms and rules, should it have its own legal system as well, or should the existing legal system at least recognize the norms and rules as binding in real-world courts? As these environments have evolved from games to worlds, they challenge our notions of property and law.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0013_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-7-div1-6"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0063" class="calibre1">一个人如何获得财产？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0063" class="calibre1">How Can Someone Acquire Property?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">财产法的一个关键问题是，在何种情况下法律会承认某人拥有某项财产。在做出这一认定时，法律必须应对构成财产法基础的潜在矛盾政策。我们希望鼓励人们参与生产活动。我们希望承认财产对个人的价值。我们希望建立一个能够清晰地表明谁拥有什么的制度。等等。</p><p class="noindent">A crucial issue for the law of property is under what circumstances the law will recognize that someone has come to own an item of property. In making that determination, the law has to grapple with the potentially inconsistent policies that underlie property law. We want to encourage people to engage in productive activity. We want to recognize the personal value property holds for people. We want a system that will provide clear indications of who owns what. And so on.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>一个人可以通过多种方式拥有一块财产。其中两种方式曾经具有历史意义，但现在已不常见，那就是发现和征服。发现意味着找到以前未知的领土并采取行动占领它，例如插上国旗和建立定居点。如今，整个地球都已被绘制成地图，因此发现已无关紧要。唯一剩余的未占领土地在外太空，但根据国际条约，美国并不拥有月球，尽管它是第一个登陆月球的国家。从历史上看，征服与发现密切相关。荷兰、英国、法国和西班牙等欧洲列强通过建立第一个非原住民定居点、征服居住在这里的美洲原住民并绘制新领土地图，获得了对美洲的所有权。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A person can come to own a piece of property in a number of ways. Two ways that were of historical importance but don’t happen much anymore are discovery and conquest. Discovery means finding previously unknown territory and doing something to take possession of it, such as planting a flag and establishing a settlement. Today the whole world has been charted, so discovery is irrelevant. The only remaining unoccupied land is in outer space, but, by virtue of an international treaty, the United States doesn’t own the moon, even though it was the first nation to land there. Historically, conquest has been closely related to discovery. European powers such as Holland, England, France, and Spain acquired ownership of America by establishing the first non-native settlements, conquering the Native Americans who lived here, and mapping the new territories.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>与发现和征服相关的一种获取财产的方式是成为第一个拥有或使用它的人，这也就是“先到先得”这句谚语的由来。这一原则体现在巴里·邦兹（Barry Bonds）为了争夺他创纪录的第73支本垒打而展开的肉搏和法律斗争中。2001赛季的最后一天，这位旧金山巨人队强击手将一记本垒打击向了太平洋贝尔公园（Pac Bell Park）的右外野看台。球迷亚历克斯·波波夫（Alex Popov）用手套接住了球，但随后发生了一场混战，另一位球迷帕特里克·林（Patrick Hayashi）拿到了球。波波夫起诉了林，声称球理应属于他，因为他是第一个拥有它的人。按照惯例，巨人队作为球的原主人，将所有权转让给最先拿到球的球迷。经过长达三周的法庭斗争，包括观看事件录像、听取十几位证人的证词以及……<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_228" class="calibre4"></a>高等法院法官凯文·麦卡锡在征求法律专家意见后裁定，波波夫短暂地接住了球，但持球时间不足以控制球。林也非自愿地被撞倒在地，捡起了松散的球。两人各自拥有球的所有权，但并非侵权人，因此各自拥有球的所有权。根据麦卡锡法官的所罗门式裁决，如果球被出售，这些所有权将实现，两人各得一半收益。（该球在拍卖会上拍出了45万美元的价格，这让波波夫和林感到失望，因为此前的估价高达150万美元。）</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A means of acquiring property related to discovery and conquest is by being the first person to possess or use it, giving rise to the saying “first in time, first in right.” The principle is illustrated by the struggle, physical and legal, for the baseball that Barry Bonds hit for his record-setting seventy-third home run. The San Francisco Giants slugger crushed a homer into the right-field stands of Pac Bell Park on the last day of the 2001 season. Fan Alex Popov caught the ball in his glove, but a melee ensued, and another fan, Patrick Hayashi, came up with the ball. Popov sued Hayashi, claiming the ball was rightfully his because he was the first to possess it. By convention, the Giants, the original owner of the ball, yielded ownership to whichever fan first came up with it. After a three-week court battle that involved viewing videotape of the event, hearing more than a dozen witnesses, and <a class="calibre4"></a>soliciting the opinions of legal experts, Superior Court Judge Kevin McCarthy found that Popov had momentarily caught the ball but had not held it long enough to establish control. Hayashi also was involuntarily knocked to the ground, where he picked up the loose ball. Each had a type of possession, neither was a wrongdoer, so each had rights in the ball which, according to Judge McCarthy’s Solomonic ruling, would be realized if the ball was sold, with each of them getting half of the proceeds. (When the ball was sold at auction, it fetched a price of $450,000, disappointing Popov and Hayashi because of earlier estimates up to $1.5 million.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如果财产是在他人已经确认所有权后才被发现的，那该怎么办呢？假设你在人行道上捡到一枚戒指，并把它带到珠宝商那里估价。珠宝商告诉你，戒指上镶着珍贵的钻石，但却拒绝归还，理由是你并非真正的主人。那么，这枚戒指究竟是谁的？要知道，财产不是人与物之间的关系，而是人与人之间的关系。诚然，你不是戒指的主人，但你拥有比珠宝商更高的所有权，因为你捡到并拥有这枚戒指，所以你有权要求归还。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>What about property that is discovered after someone else already has established ownership of it? Suppose you find a ring on the sidewalk and take it to a jeweler to determine its value. The jeweler tells you that the ring contains valuable diamonds but refuses to return it to you, arguing that you are not the true owner. Who is entitled to the ring? Recall that property is not a relationship between people and things but among people. It is true that you are not the owner of the ring, but you do have a superior right of ownership to the jeweler because you found and possessed the ring, so you are entitled to have it returned to you.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>但现在假设珠宝商认出戒指属于他的一位顾客，并打电话给来店里认领戒指的顾客。谁会得到戒指？你还是顾客？顾客——原主人——会得到戒指。你，拾得者，拥有优先于珠宝商和除真正主人之外的所有人的所有权。因此，“拾得者归原主，失者哀悼者”这句格言并非良法。这解释了关于丢失物品的一般规则：将物品交给警方，如果原主人在规定时间内没有认领，物品就归你所有，而你的认领权优先于除主人之外的任何人。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But now suppose that the jeweler recognizes the ring as belonging to one of his customers and calls the customer who comes to the store to reclaim the ring. Who gets the ring, you or the customer? The customer—the original owner—does. You, the finder, have a right of ownership that is superior to the jeweler and everyone else, except the true owner. Thus the maxim “finders keepers, losers weepers” is not good law. This explains the general rule about lost items: Turn them in to the police, and if the original owner does not claim them within a specified time period, the items belong to you, whose claim is superior to everyone except the owner.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>获得财产所有权的另一种方式是<em class="calibre8">逆权侵占</em>。逆权侵占是一个比较特殊的概念，因为它允许某人通过从合法所有者手中夺走财产来获得所有权。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Another way to acquire ownership to property is by <em class="calibre8">adverse possession</em>. Adverse possession is an odd concept because it allows someone to acquire ownership by taking it away from the rightful owner.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>假设你在边远地区拥有一间小屋，但为了追求财富，你搬离了那里，搬到了大城市的公寓里。搬家很成功，你享受着城市生活。与此同时，你不知道的是，喜欢离群索居的泽克搬进了小屋，并且几乎把小屋当成了自己的家。如果你几年后回到小屋，发现泽克一直在那里非法居住，你可以勒令他搬走；如果他拒绝离开，你可以提起法律诉讼，要求他搬走。但如果你拖延太久，你对该房产的合法所有权将丧失，泽克可以通过逆权侵占原则成为合法所有者。<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_229" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Suppose you own a cabin in the backwoods, but, intent on seeking your fortune, you move away from it to live in an apartment in the big city. The move is successful and you enjoy urban life. Meanwhile and unknown to you Zeke, who likes to live off the grid, moves into the cabin and for all practical purposes treats the cabin as if he actually owned it. If you return to the cabin in a couple of years and discover that Zeke has been squatting there, you can order him out and, if he refuses to leave, bring a legal action to have him ejected. But if you wait too long, your legal claim to the property will be lost and Zeke can become the legal owner through the doctrine of adverse possession.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>正如财产学者约瑟夫·辛格所言，逆权侵占是一条“神奇的规则，能将错误转化为正确”。为什么法律要偏袒泽克这个非法侵入者和不法行为人，而反对你这个小屋的真正合法所有者呢？该原则在一定程度上是对诉讼时效原则的应用<em class="calibre8">，</em>该原则要求必须在损害发生后的一定时间内提出索赔，否则索赔将永远失效。此外，虽然法律通常不会奖励犯有不法行为的人，例如占用他人土地，但在这里，法律奖励泽克的勤奋，并惩罚你缺乏勤勉，长期未能照管你的财产并维护你的权利。虽然正如格言所说，占有权并不总是法律的十分之九，但在这里，占有权受到奖励，并被用作明确所有权的基础。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Adverse possession is, as property scholar Joseph Singer notes, a “magical rule [that] mutates a wrong into a right.” Why should the law favor Zeke, a trespasser and wrongdoer, over you, the true legal owner of the cabin? In part the doctrine is an application of the principle of a <em class="calibre8">statute of limitations</em>, which requires that a claim be brought within a certain period of time after a harm occurs, or else the claim is lost forever. Moreover, although ordinarily the law does not reward someone for doing a wrongful act, such as occupying someone else’s land, here the law rewards Zeke for his industriousness and penalizes you for your lack of diligence in failing to attend to your property and to assert your rights for so long. Although possession isn’t always nine-tenths of the law, as the maxim says, here possession is rewarded and used as the basis for clarifying ownership.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>各司法管辖区对逆权侵占的具体要求各不相同，但一般而言，如果逆权侵占者在法定期限内（根据州不同，期限从10年到21年不等）未经土地所有者许可公开且持续地使用土地，则可以主张所有权。本质上，逆权侵占者必须像土地所有者一样行事，以所有者的方式使用土地，并以此方式让真正的土地所有者知晓有人实际上已将土地据为己有。这正是泽克所做的，逆权侵占原则意味着，如果你打瞌睡，你就输了。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The jurisdictions vary in the precise requirements for adverse possession, but generally an adverse possessor can claim ownership if for the statutory period (from ten to twenty-one years, depending on the state) it has made open and continuous use of the land without the owner’s permission. In essence, the adverse possessor has to have acted like the owner, making use of the land as an owner would, in such a way as to put the real owner on notice that someone has effectively taken the land for its own. This is just what Zeke did, and the doctrine of adverse possession means that if you snooze, you lose.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>某人也可以通过赠与获得财产。赠与是财产权益的即时转移。赠与要具有法律效力，赠与人必须有赠与的意图，财产或其证明必须交付给受赠人，并且受赠人必须接受赠与。法律对所谓的赠与持谨慎态度，或许是认为人们更倾向于自利而非利他，因此要求提供意图和交付的明确证据。（如果赠与对受赠人有利，则推定接受。）要求交付尤为重要，因为它能让赠与人意识到他或她正在放弃财产，并提供赠与的证据，以防日后发生纠纷。因此，如果我递给你一枚戒指，说“我想让你拥有这个”，那么这份赠与就是有效的。如果我说“我想让你拥有这枚戒指，我戴着它去吃晚饭后会把它给你”，那么这份赠与就无效。不存在即时交付，赠与的承诺通常是无法执行的。（参见<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.n0123" href="#text/part0012_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-6" class="calibre4">第六章</a>。）</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Someone also can acquire property by gift. A gift is a present transfer of a property interest. For a gift to be legally effective, the donor must intend to make a gift, the property or evidence of it must be delivered to the recipient, and the recipient must accept it. The law is wary of purported gifts, presuming perhaps that people are more self-interested than altruistic, so it requires clear evidence of the intention and delivery. (Acceptance is presumed where the gift is beneficial to the recipient.) Requiring delivery is particularly important because it brings home to the donor the fact that he or she is relinquishing the property and provides evidence of the gift, in case there is a subsequent dispute. Therefore, if I hand you a ring, saying, “I want you to have this,” the gift is effective. If I say, “I want you to have this ring, and I will give it to you after I wear it to dinner,” the gift is not effective. There is no present delivery, and a promise to make a gift is usually unenforceable. (See <a href="#text/part0012_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-6" class="calibre4">Chapter 6</a>.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>那么订婚戒指呢？当一个男人把订婚戒指送给未婚妻时，他有赠予、交付和接受的意图。如果订婚解除，他是否有权取回戒指？这是一种特殊情况，法院将其定义为有条件赠予。戒指是在考虑结婚时赠送的，因此它不同于他在结婚期间赠送的毛衣、书籍或其他珠宝。<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_230" class="calibre4"></a>求爱期间。如果婚姻破裂，他有权要求归还戒指。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>What about an engagement ring? When a man gives an engagement ring to his fiancée, there is intention to make a gift, delivery, and acceptance. If the engagement is broken off, is he entitled to get the ring back? This is a unique situation that the courts characterize as a conditional gift. The ring is given in contemplation of marriage, so it is unlike a sweater, a book, or even another piece of jewelry that he gives her during <a class="calibre4"></a>the courtship. If the marriage is off, he has a right to ask for the ring to be returned.</p>

<p class="noindent">最常见的购置房产方式是购买。当然，人们每天都会买卖房产，从清晨的一杯咖啡到家用汽车。这些交易中产生的大多数法律问题受合同法而非物权法管辖。本文将讨论对许多人来说，他们一生中最重要的经济支出——购房。本文的目的并非为购房者提供法律清单，而是阐明房地产交易中出现的一些物权法重要问题。</p><p class="noindent">The most common method of acquiring property is by purchase. People buy and sell property every day, of course, from a morning cup of coffee to the family car. Most of the legal issues that arise from these transactions are governed by contract law, not property law. Here we discuss what is for many people the most economically significant purchase they will ever make, the purchase of a home. The purpose is not to provide a legal checklist for the home buyer but to illustrate some of the important issues in property law as they arise in real estate transactions.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>首先，思考一下为什么购房值得单独审查。一个原因显然是涉及的金额。一个家庭的房屋可能是他们最大的资产之一，或许与人寿保险和退休基金并列。涉及的金额越大，法律往往越复杂。但由于财产的“权利束”概念，房地产的出售也更加复杂。对于大多数形式的动产，同一时间只有一个人对该财产拥有权益，而该人通常是财产的拥有者。不动产则不同。可能有几个不同的人对该财产拥有权益，而“占有”并不能很好地表明所有权。同一处房产多年来可能被多次转让，边界不明确，所有权标识不明确，两个邻居院子之间的房产边界可能不明确，银行、房屋净值贷款机构以及帮助支付首付的祖父母都可能对该房产拥有权益。因此，围绕房地产交易，一些特殊的法律原则应运而生。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>First consider why home purchases are worth examining separately at all. One reason obviously is the amount of money at stake. A family’s home is likely to be one of their largest assets, perhaps along with life insurance and a retirement fund. Where more money is at stake, the law tends to be more complicated. But the sale of real estate is also more complicated because of the bundle of rights concept of property. With most forms of personal property, only one person has an interest in the property at a time, and that person usually is the one who possesses the property. Real property is different. Several different persons are likely to have an interest in the property, and possession is not as good an indicator of ownership. The same piece of property will have been transferred many times over the years, with unclear boundaries and careless indications of ownership, the property boundary between two neighbors’ yards may not be well established, and a bank, a home equity lender, and the grandparents who helped with the down payment all may have an interest in a piece of property. Therefore, some special principles of law have grown up around real estate transactions.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>让我们先来描述一下典型房屋销售的要素，然后重点讨论其中两个与我们考察物权法特别相关的要素。交易涉及物权和合同两个概念。合同问题出现的频率相当高，因此其处理方式往往与其他情况下出现的合同法问题略有不同。而习俗、地方惯例、诚信和合作，而非法律，才是促成许多此类交易得以完成的关键；只有当问题无法通过其他方式解决时，双方才会诉诸法律体系。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Let’s describe the elements of a typical home sale and then focus on two of the elements as particularly pertinent to our examination of property law. The transaction involves both property and contract concepts. The contract issues arise sufficiently frequently that they tend to be treated a little differently from contract law issues arising in other contexts. And custom, local practices, good faith, and cooperation, more than law, are what carry many of these transactions through to completion; only where problems come up that cannot be resolved by other means do the parties resort to the legal system.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>房主和买家可以自行安排交易，但通常情况下，房地产经纪人是交易的中间人。虽然经纪人通常与卖方和买方都有合作，但帮助<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_231" class="calibre4"></a>卖方负责准备待售房屋、定价、做广告，并帮助买方找到理想的房屋。根据合同，经纪人通常是卖方的代理人，而不是买方的代理人。（有时会有单独的买方代理人，或者该代理人充当双重代理人，代表双方。）根据经纪合同，卖方的经纪人有义务帮助卖方获得尽可能高的价格，并在其他方面维护卖方的利益。然而，法律也规定了经纪人对买方应承担的某些义务，例如公平地描述房屋状况的义务。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A homeowner and a purchaser can arrange the sale themselves, but very often a real estate broker is the intermediary in the transaction. Although the broker often works with both seller and buyer, helping the <a class="calibre4"></a>seller get the house ready for sale, setting the price, and advertising, and helping the buyer find the perfect house, by contract the broker often is the agent of the seller, not the buyer. (Sometimes there is a separate buyer’s agent, or the agent acts as a dual agent, representing both parties.) Under the brokerage contract, the seller’s broker has the obligation to help the seller get the highest price possible and to otherwise serve the seller’s interests. The law also defines certain obligations that the broker owes to the buyer, however, such as a duty to fairly represent the condition of the house.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>买家看中房屋后，会发出购买报价。当地惯例规定了报价是口头还是书面形式，是否必须附带定金，以及后续谈判如何进行。买卖双方就价格达成一致后，便会签订书面买卖协议。该协议包含交易的所有条款，包括价格、成交​​日期和成交条件；买方检查房产的权利；以及卖方交付房产所有权的义务。成交日期通常定在几周甚至几个月后，以便买方做好成交前的准备工作，尤其是申请抵押贷款。过渡期结束后，双方将通过交换多份文件来完成交易，包括买方支付给卖方的款项以及卖方的契约。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Once the buyer has focused on a house, she makes an offer to buy. Local practice dictates whether the offer is oral or in writing, whether it must be accompanied by an earnest money deposit, and how the subsequent negotiations will be carried out. When the buyer and seller have agreed on a price, they proceed to enter into a written purchase and sale agreement. The agreement includes all of the terms of the transaction, including the price, closing date, and conditions to the closing; the buyer’s right to inspect the property; and the seller’s duty to deliver good title to the property. The closing date is set several weeks or even months away, enabling the buyer to do what she needs to do to get ready to close, especially obtaining a mortgage. Once this interim period is concluded, the parties close the transaction by exchanging numerous pieces of paper, including the money from the buyer to the seller and the deed in the other direction.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>考虑一下这笔交易的两个要素。首先，交易的本质是卖方将其在土地上的权益转让给买方。卖方究竟转让了什么？如果出现关于谁拥有什么的问题，该怎么办？其次，在大多数情况下，买方需要借款来支付卖方的价格，通常是从银行或抵押贷款公司借款。抵押贷款是什么样的财产权益？它对买方和银行意味着什么？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Consider two elements of this transaction. First, the essence of the transaction is the seller conveying to the buyer its interest in the land. What exactly is the seller transferring, and what happens if questions arise concerning who owns what? Second, in most cases the buyer has to borrow money to meet the seller’s price, typically from a bank or mortgage company. What kind of property interest is a mortgage, and what does it mean to the buyer and the bank?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>土地出售时，卖方会向买方交付契据，这是一份正式的书面文件，用于记录土地的转让。（所有土地转让都需要契据，即使土地是赠予而非出售。）在中世纪，土地转让的方式并非通过文件，而是通过<em class="calibre8">土地占有证（live of seisin</em>）。买卖双方会在证人面前在土地上会面，卖方会声明他正在转让所有权，并递给买方一根树枝或一块泥土来象征转让。如今，契据也发挥着同样的正式作用；它向所有人明确表明转让已经发生，并通过文件而非证人，建立了转让记录。契据确认了当事人和土地，并表达了卖方转让土地的意图。契据必须由卖方和<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_232" class="calibre4"></a>交付给买方（或买方代理人）；这就是“签字、盖章、交付”这一短语的由​​来，尽管大多数司法管辖区已经废除了对盖章的要求。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When land is sold, the seller delivers to the buyer a deed, a formal written document embodying the conveyance of the property. (Deeds are used in all transfers of land, even if the property is given away rather than sold.) In medieval times the means of transfer was not by document but by <em class="calibre8">livery of seisin</em>. The buyer and seller would meet on the property, in the presence of witnesses, and the seller would state that he was transferring ownership and would hand the buyer a twig or a clod of dirt to symbolize the transfer. Today a deed serves the same formal purposes; it makes clear to all that a transfer has taken place and, through the document rather than the witnesses, establishes a record of the transfer. The deed identifies the parties and the land and expresses the seller’s intent to convey the property. The deed must be signed by the seller and <a class="calibre4"></a>delivered to the buyer (or to the buyer’s agent); this is the origin of the phrase “signed, sealed, and delivered,” though most jurisdictions have abolished the need for a seal.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>收到契约的房主将获得房屋所有权。所有权是财产法中正式的所有权概念。通常，卖方需要将可转让的所有权交付给买方。该定义的完整法律含义很复杂，但请思考一下买方期望获得什么：完全拥有房产所有权，且不存在任何利益冲突，例如其他所有权主张、租赁或抵押（称为<em class="calibre8">产权负担</em>），并且产权证明记录中没有任何问题（称为<em class="calibre8">产权链缺陷</em>）。不动产出售产生如此复杂的法律体系的原因之一是，很难保证一处房产上不存在产权负担或产权链缺陷。毕竟，这片土地已经存在了数百年，在此期间，许多人拥有、使用过它，用它抵押借款、转让它，让邻居使用它等等。任何这些行为都可能影响产权的现状。卖方和买方如何确保卖方给予买方所支付的所有权？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The homeowner who receives the deed acquires title to the house. Title is the formal concept of ownership in property law. Typically, a seller is required to deliver marketable title to a buyer. The full legal meaning of this definition is complex, but think about what the buyer expects to be getting: full ownership of the property, without any conflicting interests such as other claims of ownership, leases, or mortgages (called <em class="calibre8">encumbrances</em>) and without any problems in the record that substantiates the title (called <em class="calibre8">chain of title defects</em>). One of the reasons that the sale of real property generates such a complicated body of law is that it is not easy to guarantee that there are no encumbrances or chain of title defects on a piece of property. After all, the land has been there for hundreds of years, during which time many people have owned it, used it, borrowed money against it, conveyed it, let their neighbors use it, and so on. Any of these acts could affect the current state of the title. How do a seller and buyer make sure that the seller is giving the buyer the kind of title the buyer is paying for?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>每个州都通过颁布土地登记法来解决这个问题，该法设立了政府土地登记库。这些法案通常会指定县级契约登记员或法院书记员，负责保存契约、长期租约、抵押以及其他与土地转让相关的文件。由于许多州的土地登记法已经存在了几个世纪，因此土地登记提供了土地权益的全面历史记录。其中有卖方购买土地时收到的契约记录，也有卖方购买土地时收到的契约记录，等等。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Every state has addressed this problem by enacting a recording act, which establishes a governmental repository of land records. Often the acts establish the Recorder of Deeds or Clerk of the Court in a county as the place where deeds, long-term leases, mortgages, and other documents pertaining to land transfers are maintained. Since in many states the recording acts have been in existence for centuries, the land records provide a comprehensive history of the recorded interests in land. There is a record of the deed the seller received when he bought the land, and a record of the deed the person who sold to the seller received when she bought the land, and so on back into history.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>登记法还规定了土地连续购买者之间的优先权。假设一个不道德的卖家将一块土地卖给了两个不同的人。这块土地的实际所有者是谁？在一些州，第一个登记契约的人胜诉，即使该人知道该房产之前已被出售给其他人。这种制度鼓励人们争先恐后地向法院起诉，因此很少使用。更常见的是，法律规定，只有在第二个购买者未事先通知先前的产权转让的情况下购买房产，她才拥有优先所有权；或者，如果第二个购买者没有在前一个购买者之前收到通知和登记，她才拥有优先权。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The recording acts also establish priority among successive purchasers of a piece of land. Suppose an unscrupulous seller sells a piece of land to two different people. Who actually owns the land? In a few states, the first person who records a deed wins, even if that person knows that the property was sold to someone else previously. This system encourages a race to the courthouse, so it is not much used. More common are statutes that specify that the second purchaser has superior title only if she purchases the property without notice of the prior conveyance, or that the second purchaser has priority if she has no notice and records before the prior purchaser.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>记录系统并不能解决所有产权问题。首先，除了契约记录办公室的记录外，还必须查阅其他记录，以确定所有财产权益。如果房地产<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_233" class="calibre4"></a>例如，如果税款尚未缴纳，政府可能对该房产拥有税收留置权，而该留置权只会出现在税务记录中。（留置权<em class="calibre8">是</em>针对该房产的一项权利，仅在房产出售时有效；在出售时，留置权持有人可以从出售所得中提取资金。）其他问题则根本不会出现在任何记录中；邻居可能获得了地役权，但这项权利只有在对房产本身进行检查时才会显现（如果有的话）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The recording system can’t prevent all title problems. First, there are records besides those in the recorder of deeds’ office that must be searched to establish all of the interests in the property. If real estate <a class="calibre4"></a>taxes have not been paid, for example, the government may have a tax lien on the property, and the lien will appear only in the tax records. (A <em class="calibre8">lien</em> is a claim against the property that has effect only when the property is sold; at the time of sale, the lien holder can get its funds out of the proceeds of sale.) Other problems don’t appear in any record at all; a neighbor may have acquired an easement, but that right will be apparent only (if at all) from an inspection of the property itself.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>处理产权问题的方法多种多样。主要有两种：产权摘要和产权保险。这两种方法都始于记录检索。律师或专业的产权摘要人员会查阅现有的公共记录，追溯产权链。他们还会查找税收留置权和其他潜在问题，并检查例如是否有前任业主两次转让该房产或未能支付抵押贷款。产权摘要完成后，买方的律师可以确定该产权是否可以转让，如果不能，则可以确定需要采取哪些措施来解决问题（例如，偿还留置权）。如果提供产权保险，产权保险公司将提供担保，以防出现最终可能影响买方产权甚至导致其失去土地的缺陷。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Different practices have grown up to deal with problems of title. The two main kinds are title abstracts and title insurance. Both begin with a search of the records. Lawyers or professional title abstracters examine the available public records to trace back the chain of title. They also look for tax liens and other potential problems, and they check to see if, for example, some prior owner conveyed the property twice or failed to pay a mortgage. When the title abstract is complete, the buyer’s attorney can determine if the title is marketable or, if it is not, what it would take to clear up the problems (for example, paying off a lien). When title insurance is provided, the title insurer provides a guarantee against defects that eventually may cloud the buyer’s title or even cause it to lose the land.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>很少有购房者能够负担得起如此昂贵的现金购房，因此许多购房者会借款支付大部分购房款。他们通常会从银行、抵押贷款公司或储蓄贷款机构等贷款机构借款，但也可能从亲戚或卖方借款。该交易包含两个要素：一是合同要素，二是基于房产的要素。由于购房款并非赠与，贷款方期望获得偿还。为了确保这一期望得到满足，贷款方会要求借款人承诺偿还贷款。通常，借款人会签署一份票据，即一份列明贷款条款和还款义务的文件。如果借款人未能按照贷款条款偿还贷款（例如，每月支付指定金额），贷款方可以就其违反还款承诺提起诉讼。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Few home buyers can afford to pay cash for such an expensive purchase, so many buyers borrow a large portion of the purchase price. Most often they borrow from a lending institution, such as a bank, mortgage company, or savings and loan, but they may also borrow from a relative or from the seller. The transaction has two elements, one contractual and one property based. Since the money to buy the house is not a gift, the lender expects to be repaid. To enforce that expectation, the lender makes the borrower promise to repay the money. Usually the borrower signs a note, a document that states the terms of the loan and the obligation to repay. If the borrower doesn’t repay the money according to the terms of the loan (such as by making monthly payments of specified amounts), the lender can sue for breach of the promise to pay.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，贷款人因借款人未能偿还贷款而采取的违约行动并不能为贷款人提供多少保障。借款人可能会出售房屋并挥霍所得，而贷款人则只能通过毫无意义的诉讼来追回资金。因此，贷款人通常会用财产权益来支持其合同权益。财产权益就是<em class="calibre8">抵押贷款</em>（在某些州称为<em class="calibre8">信托契约</em>）。抵押贷款文件包含许多与票据相同的条款，例如偿还承诺，但其关键在于以房屋作为抵押品，以确保贷款的偿还。如果借款人不偿还贷款，贷款人可以通过出售房屋并收取<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_234" class="calibre4"></a>从收益中扣除应得的金额。（财产担保权益也用于许多其他情况，包括个人财产。例如，当银行向企业提供信贷时，银行可能会对该企业的存货取得相当于抵押的担保权益。）</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The lender’s breach of contract action for the borrower’s failure to repay the loan does not provide much security for the lender though. The borrower could sell the house and squander the proceeds of the sale, and the lender would have nothing but a worthless lawsuit to recover its money. So lenders typically back up their contract interest with a property interest as well. The property interest is the <em class="calibre8">mortgage</em> (in some states called a <em class="calibre8">deed of trust</em>). The mortgage document contains many of the same terms as the note, such as the promise to repay, but its key is the pledge of the house as collateral to secure the repayment of the loan. If the borrower doesn’t repay the loan, the lender can pursue its property interest by selling the house and taking <a class="calibre4"></a>what it is owed out of the proceeds. (Security interests in property also are used in many other contexts, including personal property. When a bank extends credit to a business, for example, the bank may take a security interest equivalent to a mortgage in the inventory of the business.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>抵押贷款是财产共同利益的一个例子。只要房主（称为抵押人）继续偿还贷款，贷款人（抵押权人）就无法采取任何行动来主张其对财产的权益。但当借款人违约时，贷款人的财产权益将优先于抵押人，并可主张其对财产的份额。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The mortgage is an example of concurrent interests in property. As long as the homeowner (called the mortgagor) keeps up payments on the loan, the lender (the mortgagee) can’t do anything to assert its interest in the property. But when the borrower defaults, the lender’s property interest moves to the fore, and it can claim its share of the property.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>与其他财产共同利益一样，抵押贷款也存在借款人和贷款人的利益冲突。假设借款人已偿还一半债务，但随后又未能偿还部分债务。贷款人能否因违约而收回该房产？如果可以，贷款人将获得一笔意外之财，因为它拥有该房产和部分还款。在大多数州，如果贷款人在违约后想要追回其在该房产中的权益，则必须提起诉讼。借款人仍然可以通过偿还债务来保留该房产。如果借款人不偿还债务，法院将下令在法院官员的监督下出售该房产。如果出售所得少于借款人所欠金额，贷款人将获得差额赔偿。如果出售所得多于未偿债务，借款人将获得差额赔偿。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As with other concurrent interests in property, the mortgage presents conflicts between the interests of the borrower and lender. Suppose the borrower has paid off half of his debt and then fails to make some payments. Can the lender take the property because of the default? If so, the lender gets a windfall, since it has the property and partial repayment. In most states, if the lender wants to pursue its interest in the property after a default it has to bring a court action. The borrower can still keep the property by satisfying the debt. If he does not, the court will order the property sold under supervision of a court official. If the proceeds of the sale are less than the amount the borrower owes, the lender gets a deficiency judgment for the balance. If the proceeds are greater than the outstanding debt, the borrower gets the difference.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>那么反过来呢？假设借款人想停止还款，让贷款人收回房子；借款人能这样做吗？还是仍然欠着贷款余额？这在2008年开始的房地产危机中成为一个普遍存在的问题。许多房主的抵押贷款“入不敷出”——由于房地产市场崩溃，许多房主的抵押贷款余额超过了房屋价值。根据传统规则，在某些州，房主可以拖欠抵押贷款，放弃房屋，不再欠任何款项；在其他州，他们仍然欠着贷款余额。正如危机时期经常发生的那样，法律适应了经济现实，联邦政府制定了计划，允许至少部分房主以较低的还款额进行再融资，或者干脆放弃贷款。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>What about the reverse situation? Suppose the borrower wants to stop making payments and let the lender just take the house; can it do that, or does it still owe the balance of the loan? This became a widespread issue in the housing crisis that began in 2008. Many homeowners were “under water” on their mortgages—because of the collapsing real estate market, many homeowners owed more on their mortgage loans than their houses were worth. Under the traditional rules, in some states homeowners could default on their mortgages, walk away from the house, and owe nothing more; in other states, they still owed the balance of the loan. As often happens in times of crisis, the law accommodated economic reality, and the federal government developed plans that allowed at least some homeowners to refinance their loans with lower payments or to walk away altogether.</p>

<p class="noindent">财产法另有一门专门处理死亡后财产的处置。这门法律涉及遗嘱、无遗嘱继承和信托。许多财产在所有者去世后，在配偶之间或几代人之间转移，或通过规划机制进行转移，这些机制可以预测<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_235" class="calibre4"></a>所有者死亡，或在死亡时或通过信托用于慈善目的。</p><p class="noindent">A separate body of property law deals with the disposition of property on death. This is the law of wills, intestate succession, and trusts. Much property is transferred between spouses or between generations on the death of the owner, or through planning mechanisms that anticipate <a class="calibre4"></a>the owner’s death, or is dedicated to charitable purposes on death or through trusts.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>首先说明一下程序：每个州的法院系统都有一个单独的部门处理遗嘱和信托，一般称为<em class="calibre8">遗嘱认证法院</em>。当某人去世时，其遗嘱将提交给遗嘱认证法院，并指定一名<em class="calibre8">遗嘱执行人</em>管理该人的财产，收取所欠款项，偿还债务，并按照遗嘱中的指示处理财产。如果该人没有遗嘱，遗嘱认证法院将指定一名<em class="calibre8">管理人</em>处理该人的财产。遗嘱认证可能是一个繁琐的过程，并且由于它由法院管理，是公开的，因此出现了一种避免该过程的运动。有些人为此目的设立生前信托（这有其自身的问题），其他人使用人寿保险等非遗嘱认证手段，大多数州允许通过耗时较少、成本较低的简易程序来管理小额遗产。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>First a note about procedure: Every state has a separate division of its court system to deal with wills and trusts, called generically <em class="calibre8">probate courts</em>. When someone dies, his or her will is presented to the probate court and an <em class="calibre8">executor</em> is appointed to administer the person’s property, collecting amounts owed, paying debts, and disposing of the property as directed in the will. If the person has no will, the probate court appoints an <em class="calibre8">administrator</em> to dispose of the person’s property. Probate can be a cumbersome process and, because it is administered by a court, it is public, so there has been something of a movement to avoid the process. Some people establish living trusts for this purpose (which have their own problems), others use nonprobate devices such as life insurance, and most states permit small estates to be administered through a less time-consuming, less expensive, summary procedure.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法律规定，没有留下遗嘱而去世的人为无<em class="calibre8">遗嘱</em>死亡，法律规定了该人的财产将如何分配。在中世纪的英格兰，土地和个人财产的无遗嘱继承规则有所不同。土地是最重要的财富来源，并且与封建义务息息相关，因此人们非常希望将土地所有权掌握在少数人手中，以延续王朝的财富。根据继承法，儿子比女儿优先，年龄较大的孩子比年龄较小的孩子优先。因此，如果有最年长的儿子，他将根据长子继承制继承父亲的所有土地<em class="calibre8">。</em>美国独立战争时期的民主精神导致这些差别的废除，作为对传统土地贵族制的反对形式之一。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A person who dies without leaving a will is said by the law to have died <em class="calibre8">intestate</em>, and the law specifies how that person’s property will be distributed. In medieval England the rules of intestate succession differed for land and personal property. Land was the most important source of wealth and was tied to feudal obligations, so there was a considerable interest in maintaining landownership in a few hands to perpetuate dynastic wealth. Sons were favored over daughters under the inheritance law and older children over younger. Accordingly, the oldest surviving son, where there was one, would inherit all of his father’s land under the rule known as <em class="calibre8">primogeniture</em>. The democratic spirit in Revolutionary America led to the abolition of these distinctions, as one form of opposition to the traditional landed aristocracy.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如今，无遗嘱继承在所有司法管辖区均受成文法管辖。但如果我们不想通过这些法律延续传统的贵族制，我们又该如何实现呢？首要目标是按照大多数人的意愿处置财产。在构建这一假设时，法律还会考虑人们对财产分配方式的看法，以及他们通常希望如何分配财产。因此，法律假设大多数人希望将财产分配给最依赖其经济支持的家庭成员。如果死者（即逝者）身后留有配偶，没有后代（子女或孙子女），则配偶将获得全部遗产。如果死者身后留有后代，但没有配偶，则后代将获得遗产。如果配偶和一个或多个后代均在世，则财产将在他们之间分配，通常配偶将获得三分之一到一半的遗产（如果遗产不多，可能更多），后代将获得剩余的遗产。<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_236" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Today intestate succession is governed by statute in every jurisdiction. But if we do not want to perpetuate traditional aristocracies through these laws, what do we want to accomplish? The predominant purpose is to dispose of the property as most people would want. In constructing that assumption, the law also takes account of views about how people should want their property distributed, as well as how they generally do want it distributed. Therefore, the law assumes that most people would want their property to be distributed to those family members who most rely on them for economic support. If the decedent (the deceased person) is survived by a spouse and no descendants (children or grandchildren), the spouse receives the entire estate. If the decedent leaves descendants but no spouse, then the descendants get the estate. If both a spouse and one or more descendants survive, the property is divided among them, typically with the spouse receiving a third to a half of the estate (perhaps more if it is a small estate) and the descendants receiving the rest.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>无遗嘱继承的规则是一刀切的。与死者结婚五十年且无独立经济来源的配偶，其待遇与结婚仅一天且有自己职业的配偶相同。成年子女、未成年子女、爱子女以及疏远子女均享有同等待遇。为了规避无遗嘱继承法并以不同的方式处置财产，许多人会立遗嘱。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The rules of intestate succession are one-size-fits-all. A surviving spouse who was married to the decedent for fifty years and has no independent means of support is treated the same as a spouse who was married only for a day and has her or his own profession. Adult children, minor children, loving children, and estranged children all are treated the same. To avoid the intestacy laws and dispose of property in a different way, many people make wills.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>立遗嘱至少还有两个原因。首先，如果父母去世时未成年子女在世，子女及其财产需要得到妥善照顾。如果父母双亡，法院将为子女指定监护人，该监护人可能是父母原本会选择的人，也可能不是。父母可以在遗嘱中指定某人作为未成年子女的监护人，法院通常会确认该选择。即使只有父母一方去世，如果子女通过无遗嘱继承继承财产，也必须指定监护人，这需要一定程度的法院干预，并且可能不符合父母的意愿。其次，即使是中等规模的遗产，联邦遗产税法以及州遗产税和遗产税法也会对其造成不利影响。遗嘱中可以采用各种手段来减轻或最小化遗产的税收负担。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There also are at least two other reasons to make a will. First, if parents die with minor children, the children and their property have to be cared for. If both parents die, the court will appoint a guardian for the children, who may or may not be the person the parents would have chosen. In a will, a parent can appoint someone to be the guardian of minor children, and the court usually will confirm the choice. Even if only one parent dies, if the children inherit property by intestate succession then a guardian of the property must be appointed, which requires a degree of court intervention and again may not accord with the parents’ wishes. Second, the federal estate tax laws and state inheritance and estate tax laws can take a bite out of even moderately sized estates. Various devices can be used in a will to reduce or minimize the tax burden on the estate.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>因此，许多人会立遗嘱来处置自己的财产。通过遗嘱处置财产的权力是财产所有权所附带的基本权利之一。正如一个人在世时可以出售、赠予、销毁或以其他方式处置其财产一样，他也可以指定死后由谁来继承财产。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Therefore, many people make wills to dispose of their property. The power to dispose of one’s property by will is one of the basic bundle of rights that accompanies the ownership of property. Just as a person can sell, give away, destroy, or otherwise dispose of his property while he is alive, so, too, he can direct who is to receive it after his death.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>遗嘱处置财产自由原则有一个重要例外。一般而言，已婚人士不能通过遗嘱赠予其所有财产，不给配偶留下任何财产。婚姻被视为一种经济伙伴关系。配偶在世时，他们有互相扶持的义务，离婚时有权分享财产和收入，在某些情况下，还有权分享对方拥有的财产。经济伙伴关系的义务不会因配偶死亡而消失。法律有配偶已故财产的<em class="calibre8">选择份额</em>的概念。例如，如果丈夫在遗嘱中将其所有财产留给前妻所生的子女、情妇和防止虐待动物协会 (SPCA)，则尽管有遗嘱，其遗孀仍有法定权利索取部分遗产。尽管各个司法管辖区有所不同，但一些典型的法规赋予遗孀以继承丈夫三分之一遗产的权利，即使遗嘱中有相反的安排；而其他一些法规则根据配偶结婚的时间长短来决定其应得的份额，并在确定可分份额时将幸存者的资产考虑在内。<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_237" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There is an important exception to the principle of freedom to dispose of property by will. In general, a married person cannot give away all of his or her property by will, leaving nothing for a spouse. Marriage is seen as an economic partnership. While spouses are alive, they have a duty to support each other, a right to share property and income on divorce, and, in some cases, the right to share property owned by the other. The obligations of the economic partnership are not extinguished upon the death of a spouse. The law has the concept of an <em class="calibre8">elective share</em> in the property of a deceased spouse. If, for example, a husband’s will leaves all of his property to his children by a prior marriage, his mistress, and the SPCA, his widow has a statutory right to claim a portion of the estate despite the will. Although the jurisdictions vary somewhat, some typical statutes entitle the widow to take one-third of his estate despite a contrary disposition in the will, and others graduate the surviving spouse’s share according to how long they have been married and take the survivor’s assets into account in determining the elective share.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>关于选择性份额法规，请注意两点。首先，份额是可选的；在世的配偶可以要求或拒绝份额。如果寡妇自己有足够的钱，乐意看到丈夫的钱捐给防止虐待动物协会 (SPCA)，或者如果遗嘱设立了复杂的信托用于遗产规划，而她不想因此而感到不安，她可以拒绝要求自己的份额，让遗嘱继续执行。其次，选择性份额法规保证部分遗产归在世的配偶所有，却不保证死者的子女（他们更有可能在经济上依赖死者），这似乎有些奇怪。然而，该法规的假设是，在世的配偶将抚养夫妻的子女，将钱转给配偶可以避免指定监护人来管理子女财产的需要。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Note two things about the elective share statutes. First, the share is optional; the surviving spouse can claim or decline the share. If the widow has enough money of her own so that she is happy to see the husband’s money go to the SPCA, or if the will sets up elaborate trusts for estate planning purposes that she does not want to upset, she can refuse to claim her share and let the will operate. Second, it may seem odd that elective share statutes guarantee a portion of the estate to a surviving spouse but not to the decedent’s children, who are even more likely to be economically dependent. The assumption of the statute, however, is that the surviving spouse will support the couple’s children, and passing the money to the spouse avoids the need to have a guardian appointed to manage the children’s property.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>大多数中老年人和拥有大量财产的美国人都会立遗嘱，因此根据遗嘱条款进行财产分配是逝者去世后最常见的财产转移方式。遗嘱的基本形式必须以书面形式表达处置财产的意愿，由立遗嘱人签字，并由证人作证。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Most Americans who are middle-aged and older and most people with a substantial amount of property have a will, so devise of property according to the terms of a will is the most common means of transmission of property at death. The basic form of will must express the intent to dispose of property in a writing, signed by the testator, and attested to by witnesses.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>通过将正式遗嘱与可能的替代方案进行对比，可以看出所需手续的用途。假设 Jane Doe 去世后，她的侄子出庭，说他挚爱的姑妈告诉他，姑妈去世后他可以得到 10 万美元。我们怎么确定 Doe 确实说过这些话？如今姑妈已不在人世，侄子是唯一的证人，考虑到不择手段的倾向，他的证词令人怀疑。其次，我们怎么确定她是真心实意的？她真的明白自己要赠予一部分财产吗？还是只是在敷衍了事？第三，我们怎么确定她的意思？赠予附带任何条件吗？第四，我们怎么确定她没有改变主意，无论是否告知侄子？正式遗嘱可以证明赠予的意图，并向立遗嘱人和法院明确表明，赠予是经过认真考虑的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The purposes served by the required formalities can be seen by contrasting the formal will with a possible substitute. Suppose after Jane Doe dies her nephew comes into court and says that his beloved aunt told him that he could have $100,000 of her money after she died. How can we be sure that Doe actually said that? Now that she is no longer around, the nephew is the only witness, and, given the temptation to be unscrupulous, his testimony is suspect. Second, how can we be sure that she meant it? Did she really understand that she was giving away a portion of her property, or was she just making conversation? Third, how can we be sure what she meant? Were there any conditions attached to the gift? Fourth, how can we be sure she didn’t change her mind, with or without telling the nephew of the change? Formal wills provide evidence of the intent to make a gift and make clear to the testator and the court that a gift was seriously considered.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>问题在于，正式程度如何才算足够。长期以来，书写、签名和见证人的基本要求一直相对稳定。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The question is how formal is formal enough. Over time the essential requirements of writing, signature, and witnesses have remained relatively constant.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>书面遗嘱的要求为法院留下了永久的记录，使其更具严肃性。签名要求不仅体现了严肃性，也体现了最终性。（遗嘱的另一项功能——提供证据证明遗嘱确实是立遗嘱人本人——可能不像以前那么重要了。）法律规定，如果某人只是记录财产处置情况或起草遗嘱，那么该文件将不被<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_238" class="calibre4"></a>需要签名；通常只有最终的完整文件版本才会被签署，因此签名表明立遗嘱人已充分且最终地表达了自己的意愿。对证人的要求也起到了类似的作用。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The requirement of a written will establishes a permanent record for the court to consider and brings home the seriousness of the endeavor. The signature requirement demonstrates seriousness, and it also shows finality. (Another function—providing evidence that it actually was the testator who made the will—is probably less important than it used to be.) The law assumes that if someone is merely making notes about the disposition of property, or doing a draft of a will, the document will not <a class="calibre4"></a>be signed; only a final, complete version of a document is usually signed, so the signature shows that the testator has fully and finally expressed his or her wishes. The requirement of witnesses serves similar functions.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>每当法律要求某些手续时，就会出现一个问题：如果手续没有得到遵守，但手续背后的目的却得到了实现，该怎么办？例如，假设在遗嘱执行仪式上，立遗嘱人去洗手间，而其中一名证人正在签字。遗嘱不符合证人必须在立遗嘱人面前签字的法定要求；遗嘱认证法院是否应该以此为由拒绝执行？如果法院不执行遗嘱，就等于因技术细节而否定立遗嘱人的意愿。如果法院执行遗嘱，就会开始一点一点地削减手续，最终有可能完全取消手续。有些州的要求比其他州更严格，但近年来，对于这类无关紧要的错误，法院的要求有放松的趋势。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Whenever the law requires certain formalities, the question arises as to what happens in a case in which the formalities are not complied with but the purposes behind the formalities are served. Suppose, for example, during the execution ceremony of her will, the testator goes to the bathroom while one of the witnesses is signing. The will does not comply with the statutory requirement that the witnesses sign in the presence of the testator; should the probate court refuse to enforce it for that reason? If it doesn’t enforce the will, it will be denying effect to the wishes of the testator over a technicality. If the court does enforce the will, it begins the process of chipping away at the formalities, little by little, raising the possibility that eventually they will be cut away altogether. Some states are stricter than others, but there has been a tendency in recent years to relax the requirements for insignificant errors such as this.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>现在来看一个更极端的例子。1948年6月8日，一场事故将塞西尔·乔治·哈里斯压在了他的拖拉机下面。哈里斯的腿被压住了，但双手还自由，他在拖拉机的挡泥板上刻下了一句话：“如果我在这场混乱中死去，我会把一切都留给妻子。塞西尔·乔治·哈里斯。”</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now take a more extreme case. On June 8, 1948, an accident pinned Cecil George Harris underneath his tractor. With his leg trapped but his hands free, Harris scratched a message into the tractor’s fender: “In case I die in this mess, I leave all to the wife. Cecil Geo Harris.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这里有一份表达了立遗嘱意图但未经见证的文件。尽管缺乏正式手续，它是否应该被接受为遗嘱？法律再次面临艰难的选择。承认自<em class="calibre8">书遗嘱</em>（源于手写遗嘱，意为手写）的有效性，会破坏遗嘱所需的法定手续及其目的。但不承认其有效性，又会破坏哈里斯在本案中的明显意图，即让妻子成为其遗产的受益人。这还会使法律对那些无力聘请律师起草遗嘱的人产生偏见。大约一半的州承认自书遗嘱，其中一些州只承认由在海外服役的武装部队成员所立的遗嘱，因为他们认为在战斗中服役的军人不太可能获得律师的帮助。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Here we have a document that expresses a testamentary intent but is not witnessed. Should it be accepted as a will despite the lack of formality? Once again, the law faces a tough choice. Recognizing the validity of a <em class="calibre8">holographic will</em> (from holograph, meaning a handwriting) undermines the required statutory formalities for a will and the purposes those formalities serve. But failing to recognize its validity would undermine what in this case is the obvious intention of Harris, that his wife be the beneficiary of his estate. It also would introduce a bias in the law against people who can’t afford to hire a lawyer to draft a will. About half the states recognize holographic wills, with some of them recognizing such wills only if they are made by members of the Armed Forces serving overseas, under the assumption that service members in combat are less likely to have access to lawyers.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在遗嘱认证法庭程序中，持有遗嘱的人会将其提交遗嘱认证，以被认定为有效遗嘱。如果其他人认为该遗嘱不应生效，则可以对该遗嘱提出异议；异议者之所以这样做，是因为如果遗嘱不生效，他或她将通过无遗嘱继承或另一份遗嘱获得部分遗产。除了形式缺陷外，异议遗嘱的最常见依据（目前还不常见）是立遗嘱人缺乏足够的精神能力来立遗嘱或受到不当影响。<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_239" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In probate court procedure, someone in possession of a will submits it for probate, to be accepted as the effective will. Someone else who believes that the will that is proffered should not be effective can challenge the will; the challenger will do this because he or she stands to take part of the estate, either by intestate succession or under another will, if the will does not go into effect. Aside from a defect in form, the most common bases for challenging a will (which are still not very common) are because the testator lacked sufficient mental capacity to make a will or was subject to undue influence.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法律对心智能力的定义因用途而异。这里的问题是：立遗嘱人是否理解自己在遗嘱中的行为？这涉及理解所拥有财产的性质、将要继承或被排除在外的人，以及这些人与被赠予财产之间的关系。因此，即使立遗嘱人无法进行正常的商业活动，或患有被恶灵缠身的妄想，只要这些缺陷或妄想不影响其合理处置财产所需的理解能力，他仍然可能拥有立遗嘱能力。一些棘手的案例涉及立遗嘱人，他们因为子女或孙辈将他们送进医院、疗养院或精神病院而感到怨恨；即使立遗嘱人需要照顾，这种怨恨是否有合理的依据，还是仅仅是妄想？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The law uses different definitions of mental capacity for different purposes. Here the question is: Did the testator understand what he or she was doing with respect to the will? This involves understanding the nature of the property owned, the people who are to receive it or are being excluded from it, and the relationship among the people and the property being given away. Thus even if the testator is unable to carry out normal business affairs or suffers from the delusion that he is haunted by evil spirits, he still may have testamentary capacity if the deficiencies or delusions do not interfere with the understanding necessary to dispose of one’s property reasonably. Difficult cases concern testators who feel resentment because their children or grandchildren have placed them in hospitals, nursing homes, or psychiatric institutions; does this resentment have a reasonable basis, even though the testator needs the care, or is it delusional?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>有时会有人指控存在不当影响，无论是针对整份遗嘱还是某项特定遗赠。当遗嘱受益人的地位高于立遗嘱人时，尤其容易被推定存在不当影响，例如律师与其委托人、医生与其患者，或管理年迈亲属事务的人员。问题在于，遗嘱究竟是立遗嘱人自愿的产物，还是施加影响的人的自愿产物，这在很大程度上取决于事实。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Undue influence is sometimes alleged, either as to the entire will or as to a particular bequest. Undue influence is particularly likely to be presumed where the person who benefits from the will is in a position of superiority over the testator, such as an attorney and her client, a doctor and her patient, or someone who manages the affairs of an aged relative. The question, which depends heavily on the facts, is whether the will is actually the product of the testator’s volition or that of the person exerting the influence.</p>

<p class="noindent">信托是一种以特殊方式对财产权利束进行划分的方式。首先，财产的管理与财产的收益分离。财产由受托人管理，受托人通常有权投资财产、收取收益、出租或出售财产，但受托人会收取服务费，而不是从财产本身获得任何收入。信托受益人拥有从财产中获得收益的权利，例如其产生的收入。其次，受益人的权利在信托设立时由委托人（即赠予财产的人）定义，该财产将成为信托的本金（或主体）。例如，委托人可以指定受益人可以获得信托收益，但不能获得本金的支付；指定一位受益人​​终生获得收益，本金则归他人所有；或者，在慈善信托的情况下，指定收益应用于寻找癌症的治疗方法或流浪猫的照料和喂养。</p><p class="noindent">A trust is a division of the bundle of rights in property in an unusual way. First, the management of the property is separated from the benefit of the property. The property is managed by a trustee, who usually has the authority to invest the property, collect income, rent, or sell, but who is paid a fee for its services, rather than receiving any income from the property itself. The beneficiary of the trust owns the right to receive the benefit from the property, such as the income it produces. Second, the beneficiary’s rights are defined when the trust is established by the grantor, the person who gives the property that becomes the principal (or corpus, meaning body) of the trust. The grantor can, for example, specify that the beneficiary can receive the income from the trust but no payments from principal, that one beneficiary receives the income for life and then the principal goes to someone else, or, in the case of charitable trusts, that the income should be devoted to seeking a cure for cancer or the care and feeding of stray cats.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>正如最后的例子所示，一些信托致力于慈善目的，但在遗嘱和家庭财产的背景下，私人信托<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_240" class="calibre4"></a>更为重要。信托有多种用途。生前信托可用于避免财产被遗嘱认证，从而最大限度地减少公开性并节省费用，尽管生前信托的优势已被近期遗嘱认证法的改革所削弱。在委托人生前设立的信托（生前信托）或以遗嘱形式设立的信托（遗嘱信托）可以保护那些因法律上的无行为能力（例如未成年子女）或实际能力不足（不熟悉财务的人）而无法管理财产的人的财产。信托最普遍的用途可能是税收，尤其是在遗产规划中。目前，联邦遗产税法对超过一定最低限额的遗产征税。例如，当丈夫去世时，他的财产可以转给信托，而不是转给在世的妻子，以避免其遗产在日后去世时超过最低限额。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As the last examples suggest, some trusts are devoted to charitable purposes, but in the context of wills and family property, private trusts <a class="calibre4"></a>are more important. Trusts are used for many purposes. Living trusts can be used to keep property out of probate, which minimizes publicity and may save fees, although the advantages of a living trust have been lessened by recent reforms in probate laws. Trusts created either during the grantor’s lifetime (inter vivos trusts) or in a will (testamentary trusts) can protect the property of a person who is unable to manage the property, either because of a legal disability (a minor child, for example) or because of practical inability to do so (someone who is unsophisticated in financial matters). Probably the most prevalent use of trusts is for tax purposes, particularly in estate planning. Currently the federal estate tax law imposes a tax on the amount of an estate above a certain minimum amount. When the husband dies, for example, his property can pass to a trust, rather than to the surviving wife, to avoid having her estate exceed the minimum amount when she dies later.</p>

<p class="noindent">到目前为止，我们一直在思考一个人或一家公司拥有的财产。然而，在很多情况下，财产权益（权利束的不同组成部分）由不止一人持有。例如，财产权可以由多人共享，也可以随着时间的推移而分割。</p><p class="noindent">So far we have been thinking of property that one person or company owns. In many cases, though, property interests—different elements of the bundle of rights—are held by more than one person. For example, property rights can be shared by several people or divided over time.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在财产法中，有三种<em class="calibre8">同时存在的财产</em>或共同所有权形式：<em class="calibre8">联合共有、共同共有</em>和<em class="calibre8">整体共有</em>。在这三种共同所有权（或共同租赁）形式中，每个承租人都有权拥有和使用整块财产。整体共有的独特之处在于它只适用于已婚夫妇，因此整体共有只能有两个共同所有人；联合共有或共同共有可以有无限数量的共同所有人。联合共有和整体共有彼此相似，而与共同共有不同，因为共同承租人拥有幸存者享有<em class="calibre8">的权利</em>。当一个所有者去世时，财产会自动转移给幸存的承租人。相反，当共同承租人去世时，他或她对财产的权益归其继承人，而不是幸存的共同承租人。最后，联合共有人和整体共有人始终拥有平等的财产份额；共同租户的利益可以以不同的方式分割（例如，一个人拥有三分之一，另一个人拥有三分之二）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In property law, there are three kinds of <em class="calibre8">concurrent estates</em>, or forms of co-ownership at the same time: <em class="calibre8">joint tenancy, tenancy in common</em>, and <em class="calibre8">tenancy by the entirety</em>. In all three forms of co-ownership (or cotenancy), each tenant has the right to possess and use the entire piece of property. Tenancy by the entirety is unique in that it is available only to married couples, so there can only be two co-owners of a piece of tenancy by the entirety; a joint tenancy or tenancy in common can have an unlimited number of co-owners. Joint tenancy and tenancy by the entirety are like each other and unlike a tenancy in common because the cotenants have a <em class="calibre8">right of survivorship</em>. When one owner dies, the property automatically passes to the surviving tenant. When a tenant in common dies, by contrast, his or her interest in the property goes to his or her heirs, not to the surviving cotenant. Finally, joint tenants and tenants by the entirety always have equal shares in the property; the interests of tenants in common can be split up in different ways (with one owning one-third and the other owning two-thirds, for example).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如今，共同所有权在很多情况下都得到应用。妻子和丈夫可以拥有一个联名支票账户和一个共同基金账户，并且可以共同拥有他们的房子。（在允许整体租赁的司法管辖区（大约一半的州）中，这将是所有权的形式；否则，这些将是共同租赁。）两个兄弟姐妹可以共同拥有<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_241" class="calibre4"></a>全家一起种田。一首歌曲的版权可能由作词人和作曲人共同拥有。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Today concurrent ownership is used in many situations. A wife and husband may have a joint checking account and a mutual fund account and may own their house jointly. (In jurisdictions that allow tenancies by the entirety—about half the states—that would be the form of ownership; otherwise, these would be joint tenancies.) Two siblings may own <a class="calibre4"></a>the family farm together. The copyright in a song may be held by the person who wrote the lyrics and the one who wrote the music.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>让我们举一个例子来看看不同形式的共同所有权是如何运作的。这个例子关注的是联合租赁和共同租赁；在大多数情况下，整体租赁与联合租赁被视为相同。假设两个兄弟姐妹继承了他们父母曾经住过的房子。处理这些共同所有权情况的第一个问题是：这是什么类型的共同所有权？母亲是父母中较晚去世的，她的遗嘱中写道：“我把我的房子留给我的孩子们胡安和玛丽亚。”胡安和玛丽亚是联合租户还是共同租户？更一般地说，在没有原财产所有者指定的情况下，法律应该倾向于哪种形式的共同所有权？答案取决于财产法的结构和潜在的社会条件。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Let’s take one example to see how the different forms of co-ownership work. This example focuses on joint tenancies and tenancies in common; for most purposes, a tenancy by the entireties is treated the same as a joint tenancy. Assume that two siblings inherited the house their parents had lived in. The first question in dealing with these instances of co-ownership is: What kind of co-ownership is it? The mother was the later of the two parents to die, and her will said, “I leave my house to Juan and Maria, my children.” Are Juan and Maria joint tenants or tenants in common? Put more generally, in the absence of a designation by the original property owner, which form of co-ownership should the law prefer? The answer depends on the structure of property law and the underlying social conditions.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>从中世纪到近代，法律对共同财产的偏好从联合共有制转向了共同共有制。传统上对联合共有制的偏好，部分源于财产制度的逻辑，部分源于实际考虑。在财产制度下，联合共有人被视为拥有单一财产；当其中一人去世时，财产保持不变，只是由更少的所有者持有。或许更重要的是，传统的财产制度倾向于将所有权集中在少数大地主手中，而联合共有制恰好满足了这一目的。联合共有制也成为有效的遗产规划手段，避免了在遗产转让时应缴纳的一些封建税。然而，到了18世纪，情况发生了变化。随着市场经济的兴起，土地越来越被视为一种商品和财富，立法机关和法院更倾向于共同共有制，这使得财产更容易自由转让；共同所有人可以在去世后转让其财产份额，并将其用作债务抵押品，而债权人则可以放心，即使债务人去世，他们也不会失去利益。因此，如今胡安和玛丽亚被推定为共同共有人。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>From the Middle Ages to modern times the law shifted its preference for concurrent estates from joint tenancies to tenancies in common. The traditional preference for a joint tenancy arose partly from the logic of the property system and partly from practical concerns. Under the estates system, joint tenants were seen as owning a single estate; when one of them died, the estate remained unchanged, and it was simply held by one fewer owner. Probably more important, the traditional property system favored concentrating ownership in a smaller number of large landowners, a purpose that joint tenancy served well. Joint tenancies also became effective estate planning devices, avoiding some of the feudal taxes that otherwise would be due on the transfer of property at death. By the eighteenth century, though, the presumption was otherwise. With the rise of a market economy and land viewed increasingly as a commodity and an object of wealth like any other, it made more sense to the legislatures and courts to prefer tenancies in common, which made property more freely transferable; a co-owner could transfer his share in property at death, and he could use it as collateral for debts, with creditors secure in the knowledge that they would not lose their interest if the debtor died. Therefore, today Juan and Maria would be presumed to be tenants in common.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>当然，与许多法律情况一样，解决这个问题的最佳方法是通过提前规划来避免。法律允许人们明确规定要建立何种关系，优秀的律师通常会这样做。例如，如果你与家人一起开设银行账户，你会看到其中一个可以勾选以表明所有权形式的方框被标记为“共同共有人，享有生存者的权利”，这清楚地表明其意图并非建立共同共有关系。谨慎的律师可能会加上“并非作为共同共有人”<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_242" class="calibre4"></a>共同共有”，以消除任何疑问。如果母亲有此意愿，起草母亲遗嘱的律师同样可以明确规定共同共有。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Of course, as in many legal situations, the best approach to this problem is to avoid it by advance planning. The law permits people to specify what kind of relationship is being created, and good lawyers typically do so. If you open a bank account with a family member, for example, you will see that one of the boxes that can be checked to indicate the form of ownership is labeled “Joint tenant with right of survivorship,” a clear indication that the intention is not to create a tenancy in common. Scrupulous belt-and-suspenders lawyers may add “and not as tenants in <a class="calibre4"></a>common,” to remove any doubt. The attorney drafting the mother’s will likewise could have expressly provided for a joint tenancy, if that is what the mother intended.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>共同承租人拥有什么？共同承租人和分权承租人对房产拥有基本相同的权利。无论哪种情况，每位共同承租人都对整套房产拥有不可分割的权益。“不可分割”意味着胡安和玛丽亚各自拥有使用整栋房屋的权利；他们无需对房屋进行物理分割，胡安可以使用厨房，玛丽亚可以使用客厅。如果他们出租房屋而不是自己居住，则他们平均分配租金（如果他们是共同承租人），或者根据他们对房产的所有权权益（如果他们是分权承租人）分配租金。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>What is it that a cotenant owns? Joint tenants and tenants in common hold substantially the same bundle of rights in the property. In either case, each cotenant possesses an undivided interest in the entire property. “Undivided” means that Juan and Maria each have a right to use the entire house; they do not have to physically divide the house, so that Juan has use of the kitchen and Maria the living room. If they rent out the house rather than live in it, they share in the rent paid equally (if they are joint tenants) or according to their ownership interests in the property (if they are tenants in common).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如果胡安和玛丽亚是共同共有人，胡安去世后，他的继承人将继承其房产权益。但如果他们是共同共有人，胡安去世后，玛丽亚将拥有全部房产。例如，如果胡安想阻止这种情况发生，以便他的子女继承其应得的房产份额，他可以通过各种方式终止共同共有，将其转换为共同共有，从而剥夺玛丽亚的幸存权。然而，整体共有在这方面有所不同。由于这种共同所有权形式的目的之一是保护幸存的配偶，因此在整体共有中，幸存权不会被剥夺。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If Juan and Maria are tenants in common, on Juan’s death his heirs will inherit his interest in the property. If they are joint tenants, however, Maria owns the entire property on Juan’s death. If Juan wants to prevent this, so that his children can inherit his share of the property, for example, he can, by various means, sever the joint tenancy, converting it into a tenancy in common and thereby destroying Maria’s right of survivorship. Tenancies by the entirety are different in this respect, however. Because one of the purposes of this form of co-ownership is to protect the surviving spouse, the right of survivorship cannot be destroyed in a tenancy by the entirety.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>整体共有是夫妻之间财产所有权的一种形式。此外，历史上一直有一套特殊的规则适用于婚姻财产，而且这些规则会随着社会制度的变化而变化。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Tenancy by the entirety is one form of property ownership between a married couple. Beyond that, a special set of rules has been applied throughout history to marital property, and again the rules change as the social system changes.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在普通法中，夫妻在财产法上被视为一个人，而这个人就是丈夫。丈夫控制着他们任何一方拥有的所有财产，因此他可以出售妻子拥有的土地或控制其用途，而无需妻子同意。妻子唯一的保护是在丈夫去世后对其财产的权利。根据嫁妆制度<em class="calibre8">，</em>寡妇在世期间有权获得丈夫所有不动产的三分之一，否则这些不动产将由子女继承。鳏夫拥有一项平行且更大的权利，称为<em class="calibre8">“继承权”</em>，这项权利赋予他对妻子拥有的所有土地的终身权益。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At common law a husband and wife were treated as one person in the eyes of property law, and that person was the husband. The husband controlled all property owned by either of them, so he could sell land owned by the wife or control its use without her consent. The wife’s only protection was a right in the husband’s property on his death. Under the rule of <em class="calibre8">dower</em>, a widow had a claim for as long as she lived to one-third of all of her husband’s real property that otherwise would be inherited by the children. A widower had a parallel, and greater right, called <em class="calibre8">curtesy</em>, which granted him a life interest in all of the lands owned by the wife.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>十九世纪中叶，所有州都通过了《已婚妇女财产法》，赋予已婚妇女与单身女性和已婚男性同等的财产管理权。如今，婚姻财产受两种法律体系之一的管辖，即“<em class="calibre8">个人财产”</em>（在大多数州实际上如此）和<em class="calibre8">“共同财产”</em>（在少数州，主要是在少数州）管辖。<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_243" class="calibre4"></a>（殖民时期受民法管辖的州，例如加利福尼亚州、德克萨斯州和路易斯安那州）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the middle of the nineteenth century all of the states passed Married Womens’ Property Acts, which granted married women the same rights to manage their property as possessed by single women and married men. Today marital property is governed by one of two systems of law, called <em class="calibre8">separate property</em> (in effect in most states) and <em class="calibre8">community property</em> (which controls in a few states, mostly <a class="calibre4"></a>those which in colonial times were governed by the civil law, such as California, Texas, and Louisiana).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在实行财产分割的司法管辖区，丈夫和妻子的财产自然是各自独立的。如果妻子拥有一块土地或一些股票，她可以随意使用或处置，无需丈夫同意。在婚姻期间，妻子权利的唯一限制是一方有义务赡养另一方；妻子不能独享自己的财产而让丈夫陷入贫困（反之亦然）。当然，配偶可以选择共同拥有财产。离婚时，双方的财产应<em class="calibre8">公平</em>分配。准予离婚的法院拥有很大的自由裁量权，可以根据公平或公正的原则在配偶之间分割财产，同时考虑到谁对财产做出了贡献以及离婚后谁需要这些财产。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In separate property jurisdictions, the property of a husband and wife is, naturally, separate. If a wife owns a piece of land or some stock, she can use or dispose of it as she wishes, without the consent of her husband. During the marriage, the only limitation on her bundle of rights is the duty of one spouse to support another; the wife cannot enjoy her own property and leave her husband destitute (and vice versa). Spouses can, of course, choose to own property jointly. Upon divorce, the property of each spouse is subject to <em class="calibre8">equitable distribution</em>. The court granting the divorce has great discretion to divide the property between the spouses on an equitable, or fair, basis, taking into account who contributed to the property and who needs it after the divorce.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在夫妻共同财产管辖区，夫妻双方在婚前拥有的财产，或其中一方在婚姻期间通过赠与或继承获得的财产，均为各自配偶的单独财产，并与单独财产州的财产同等对待。但在婚姻期间获得的其他财产，包括来自任何一方配偶收入的财产，则属于夫妻共同财产。夫妻共同财产与共同共有的财产非常相似。每位配偶都拥有独立的权利，无需另一方配偶同意即可使用夫妻共同财产。任何一方配偶都可以转让财产，但土地和某些商业资产除外，这需要双方配偶的同意。离婚时，一些实行夫妻共同财产的州会将夫妻共同财产平均分配给双方配偶；其他一些州则采用公平分配原则来分割财产。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In community property jurisdictions, property owned by each spouse before the marriage, or property acquired during the marriage by one of them by gift or inheritance, is separate property of each spouse and is treated the same as property in a separate property state. Property otherwise acquired during the marriage, though, including property that is derived from the earnings of either spouse, is community property. Community property is much like property held in joint tenancy. Each spouse has an independent right to use the community property without the consent of the other spouse. Either spouse can also convey the property, except for land and certain business assets, which requires the consent of both spouses. Upon divorce, some community property states divide the community property evenly between the two spouses; others use equitable distribution principles to divide the property.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>配偶权利束的一项重要限制是对其死后财产处置能力的限制。在大多数州，配偶死后处置财产的能力受到“选择性份额”规则的限制，该规则已在上文关于死后财产转移的部分中讨论过。“选择性份额”的运作方式类似于普通法中的嫁妆和礼仪。无论遗嘱内容如何，​​在世的配偶都可以索取已故配偶资产的一定比例，以在一定程度上保护其免于被剥夺婚姻带来的经济利益。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>An important limitation on a spouse’s bundle of rights is a restriction on the ability to dispose of his or her property upon death. In most states, the ability of a spouse to dispose of property on death is limited by the rule of an elective share, discussed in the section above on property transfers on death. The elective share operates somewhat like dower and curtesy at common law. No matter what a will says, the surviving spouse may claim a certain portion of the deceased spouse’s assets to provide the surviving spouse a measure of protection against being deprived of the financial benefits of the marriage.</p>

<p class="noindent">在共同共有和共同共有中，每个人都是财产的所有者，尽管他或她与他人共享所有权。还有另一种方式可以分享财产权益，这属于<em class="calibre8">地役权</em>的法律范畴。这个概念最<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_244" class="calibre4"></a>举几个例子就很容易理解了。为了提供电话服务，电话公司必须将电缆铺设在许多居民的土地上，要么埋在地下，要么架设在电线杆上。两个邻居共用一堵墙，这堵墙横跨他们双方的房产，双方都承担了维护这堵墙的费用。在土地分割区，房主通过契约购买房产，禁止他们在自己的地块上建造超过一栋房屋，即使没有分区划分来阻止土地分割。电影院的观众在电影放映期间占用了影院老板的部分房产。</p><p class="noindent">In joint tenancy and tenancy in common, each person is the owner of the property, though he or she shares that ownership with someone else. There is another way in which people can share interests in property, which falls under the legal category of <em class="calibre8">servitude</em>. The concept is most <a class="calibre4"></a>easily understood with a few examples. To provide telephone service, the phone company has to run its cables across many people’s land, either underground or on poles. Two neighbors share a wall that straddles both their property at the border line, and each contributes to the cost of maintaining the wall. Homeowners in a subdivision purchase by deeds that prohibit them from building more than one home on their lot, even though there is no zoning that prevents subdividing. A patron at a movie theater occupies some of the theater owner’s property for the duration of the movie.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>所有这些例子的共同点是，一个人对他人财产拥有权益。这种权益可能因财产所有权而产生（例如，共用一堵墙的邻居），也可能不产生（例如，剧院观众）。这种权益可能允许一个人做某事（例如，在剧院就座），要求他人做某事（例如，帮助维护墙壁），或阻止他人做某事（例如，细分地块）。在每种情况下，承担义务的土地所有者都失去了其完全财产所有权权利束中的一项要素，并将其转让给另一个人。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>What all of these examples have in common is that one person has an interest in someone else’s property. The interest may attach as a result of property ownership (the neighbor who shares a wall) or not (the theatergoer). The interest may allow the person to do something (sit in the theater), require someone else to do something (help maintain the wall), or prevent someone else from doing something (subdividing a lot). In each case the landowner who is subject to the obligation has had one element of the bundle of rights of full property ownership taken away and transferred to the other person.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>从理论上讲，这些权利之间存在着重要的差异。我们说剧院观众拥有使用剧院所有者财产的<em class="calibre8">许可</em>，因为她被允许在有限的时间和目的下进入该财产。许可证是可撤销的；看看电影票根背面，你可能会看到这样的文字，大意是管理层可以随时撤销许可证。电话公司拥有地役<em class="calibre8">权</em>，即使用他人财产的持久权利。土地分割所有者拥有<em class="calibre8">真实契约</em>或<em class="calibre8">公平地役权</em>，以限制彼此对其地块的使用；这些手段赋予了对他人财产使用权的控制权，而不是自己使用的权利。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As a doctrinal matter there are important differences among these kinds of rights. We say that the theatergoer has a <em class="calibre8">license</em> to use the theater owner’s property because she has permission to enter the property for a limited time and purpose. Licenses are revocable; look on the back of a ticket stub for a movie and you may see language to the effect that the management can revoke the license at any time. The telephone company has an <em class="calibre8">easement</em>, a durable right to use someone else’s property. The subdivision owners have <em class="calibre8">real covenants</em> or <em class="calibre8">equitable servitudes</em> that restrict each other’s use of their lots; these are devices that grant control over the use of someone else’s property rather than the right to use it oneself.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>我们不会在此深入探讨地役权法。它被描述为“一个难以言喻的泥潭”，充斥着陈旧的术语、细微的区别和令人困惑的规则，即使是最勤奋的法学院学生也会感到困惑。但我们可以利用这个话题来阐述一些关于财产法的基本要点。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We won’t try to understand the law of servitudes in any great detail here. It has been described as “an unspeakable quagmire” full of archaic terms, fine distinctions, and confusing rules that bedevil even the most diligent law students. But we can use the topic to illustrate a few basic points about property law.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>首先，地役权是对财产和土地使用进行私人监管的一种形式。人们最初持有构成财产所有权的全部权利，然后以地役权、契约等形式转让其中一些权利。（有时地役权并非源于明示协议，而是源于默示协议，尽管这种情况并不常见。）这种行为能力既是财产所有权的要素，也是缔约能力的要素。两者都赋予个人一定的自主权来创造这种义务。<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_245" class="calibre4"></a>并界定其内容。地役权在控制土地开发和通过私人行动创造特定类型的居住环境方面发挥了重要作用，尤其是在郊区细分和规划社区中。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>First, servitudes are a form of private regulation of property and land use. People begin by holding the entire bundle of rights that constitute property ownership and then cede some of those rights in the form of easements, covenants, and so on. (Sometimes servitudes don’t arise from express agreements but from implication of an agreement, although that is less common.) The ability to act this way is an element of both the ownership of property and the ability to contract. Each gives the individual a sphere of autonomy to create this kind of obligation <a class="calibre4"></a>and to define its content. Servitudes have been valuable in controlling land development and creating particular types of residential environments through private action, particularly in suburban subdivisions and planned communities.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>其次，地役权法并非合同法。一套独立法律体系的发展，彰显了财产概念（尤其是不动产）的力量。由于这些义务并非当事人独有，而是依附于其土地，并可能使土地的后续所有者受益或负担，因此它们受到历史和财产法的束缚。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Second, the law of servitudes is not the law of contracts. The development of a distinct body of law illustrates the power of the concept of property, especially real property. Because these obligations are not unique to the parties but attach to their land, and may benefit or burden subsequent owners of the land, they are burdened by history and the trappings of property law.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第三，作为契约和财产，个人对其财产的处置权并非绝对。地役权受到直接和间接的公共政策限制。最著名的直接限制是禁止歧视性契约。在本世纪初，契约中常常包含禁止任何未来所有者将财产出售给非白人的契约。法院最终宣布执行此类限制违宪；私人所有者的财产权受到社会对种族歧视的首要关注的限制。关于地役权使用限制的诉讼至今仍屡见不鲜，例如业主协会强制执行严苛的建筑限制，或有人声称要求建造独栋住宅的契约是为了阻止为智障人士设立集体住宅。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Third, as contract and property, the ability to do what one wants with one’s property is not absolute. Servitudes are subject to direct and indirect public policy restrictions. The best-known direct restriction is the prohibition on discriminatory covenants. Earlier in the century it was common for deeds to contain covenants prohibiting any future owner from selling the property to nonwhites. The courts eventually declared the enforcement of that type of restriction unconstitutional; a private owner’s right of property was limited by the paramount social concern against racial discrimination. Limits on the use of servitudes are still frequently litigated, as in cases in which a homeowners’ association enforces draconian building restrictions, or a covenant requiring single-family houses is claimed to prevent the establishment of a group home for the mentally handicapped.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>财产所有权共享的另一种情况是，不同的人可以同时拥有同一财产的不同权益，但他们的权益会随着时间的推移而分化。这个问题根深蒂固地存在于中世纪的历史中，我们大可忽略其中的大部分，但它却是一个有趣的例证，展现了所有财产法背后存在的冲突。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One other way that property ownership can be shared occurs when different people can own different interests in a piece of property at the same time but their interests are divided over time. The issue is steeped in medieval history, most of which we can ignore, but it is an interesting illustration of the conflicts that underlie all of property law.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>假设杰拉尔德·奥哈拉想将塔拉保留为其家族祖传的种植园。他在遗嘱中将土地赠予斯嘉丽，终身有效；斯嘉丽去世后，财产将传给她的子女，然后是子女的子女，以此类推，直至奥哈拉有继承人为止。或者假设奥哈拉将他的种植园遗赠给佐治亚州，条件是州政府必须将该土地用作植物园，种植至少两种佐治亚州本土树种。如果州政府满足该条件99年，该种植园将直接归州政府所有；如果州政府未能满足该条件，所有权将归还给奥哈拉或其继承人。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Suppose that Gerald O’Hara wants to preserve Tara as his family’s ancestral plantation. In his will, he gives the land to Scarlett for her life, and then, on her death, the property would pass to her children, and then her children’s children, and so on as long as O’Hara had heirs. Or suppose that O’Hara bequeaths his plantation to the state of Georgia, on the condition that the state is to use the property as an arboretum, planting at least two of every variety of tree native to Georgia. If the state met the condition for 99 years, the property would go to the state outright; if it did not, ownership would revert to O’Hara or his heirs.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在这两个例子中，我们可以看到不同的人与财产有着不同的时间关系。在第一个例子中，当奥哈拉去世时，斯嘉丽终生拥有该财产的所有权，但这种所有权受到一个条件的限制：该财产在她去世后将传给她的孩子。在第二个假设中，他<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_246" class="calibre4"></a>虽然他将种植园的所有权交给了国家，但他仍然对它感兴趣：如果国家未能维护植物园，那么财产将归还给他。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In both of these examples we can see that different people have different temporal relationships to the property. In the first example, when O’Hara dies, Scarlett has ownership of the property for her life, but a kind of ownership that is limited by the condition that the property would pass to her child upon her death. In the second hypothetical, he <a class="calibre4"></a>gives up ownership of the plantation to the state, but he still has an interest in it : the possibility that, if the state fails to maintain the arboretum, the property will revert back to him.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这些例子关乎一个根本问题：随着时间的推移，我们将允许所有者在多大程度上控制他们的财产。奥哈拉拥有塔拉的<em class="calibre8">所有权</em>，这意味着他拥有所有人在该财产中所能拥有的尽可能多的权利。显然，他可以在生前或死后赠予他的土地，因此人们可能会认为，他可以做出更轻的赠予，附加条件（例如将其用于建造植物园），或者只赠予部分权益（例如赠予斯嘉丽终身，然后赠予她的孩子）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The examples are related to the fundamental issue of how much we will let owners control their property over time. O’Hara owns Tara in <em class="calibre8">fee simple</em>, which means that he owns as many of the rights as anyone can have in the property. Clearly he can give away his land, during his lifetime or upon his death, so one might think that he could perform the lesser act of giving it away with a condition attached (that it be used for an arboretum) or give away only a part interest (to Scarlett for her life, then to her child).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>但我们也希望当前的财产所有者能够有效地利用这些财产。我们应该在多大程度上让过去的亡灵控制当前的财产使用？想象一下，如果我们允许所有者对财产的使用或处置施加持久的限制，会发生什么。一些财产所有者会梦想家族王朝，并试图通过施加奥哈拉在遗嘱中所做的限制来将财产保留在家族手中。随着时间的推移，这往往会将财产集中在越来越少的人手中，而不是让更广泛的人群能够获得。或者可能会出现相反的情况：几代人之后，塔拉的一小部分土地可能由奥哈拉的数十个后代拥有。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But we want current owners of property to be able to use it productively, too. How much should we let the dead hand of the past control the present use of property? Imagine what might happen if we let owners impose lasting restrictions on the use or disposition of property. Some property owners would dream of family dynasties and would attempt to keep property in the family by imposing the kind of restriction O’Hara did in his will. Over time, this would tend to concentrate property in fewer and fewer hands, rather than making it available to a wider population. Or the opposite might occur; several generations down the line, tiny pieces of Tara might be owned by dozens of O’Hara’s descendants.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>同样的问题也出现在家庭以外的限制上。情况会随着时间推移而变化，遵守前任业主对房产的限制可能并不总是明智之举。二十年、五十年或七十年后，佐治亚州可能会认为塔拉更适合用作退伍军人之家、图书馆或医院，而不是植物园，但强制执行奥哈拉的限制将阻止这些用途。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The same problems arise with restrictions outside a family. Conditions change over time, and it may not always make sense to honor restrictions placed on property by a previous owner. After twenty or fifty or seventy years, the state of Georgia may decide that Tara could better be used as a home for veterans, a library, or a hospital instead of an arboretum, but enforcing O’Hara’s restriction would prevent such a use.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>因此，法院必须在允许人们对其财产为所欲为的愿望与强制执行所有此类限制可能带来的不良后果之间做出权衡。法院通过多种方式实现了这一目标。通常，授予人并不清楚正在产生何种权益或施加何种限制。在这种情况下，法院会做出推定，例如，假设授予人无意对其土地施加限制，除非他们明确表示如此。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Accordingly, courts have had to balance the desire to let people do whatever they want with their property against the unfortunate consequences that would result from enforcing all such restrictions. They have done so in a number of ways. Often a grantor will not be clear about what kind of interest is being created or what kind of restriction is being imposed. In those cases, courts develop presumptions, assuming for example, that grantors do not intend to encumber their land with restrictions unless they do so clearly.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>处理可能过时的限制的第二种方法是运用“尽可能接近”原则（ <em class="calibre8">cy pres</em> doctrine）。根据该原则，当慈善遗赠无法完全按照捐赠人的意愿完成时，法院将设法尽可能接近捐赠人的意愿进行执行。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A second technique of dealing with arguably outmoded restrictions is through the use of the <em class="calibre8">cy pres</em> doctrine (meaning “as near as”). Under the doctrine, when a charitable bequest cannot be fulfilled in exactly the way the donor intended, the court will find a way to carry it into effect as nearly as possible to effectuate the donor’s intention.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第三种技巧是使用某些实质性规则，简单地禁止某些类型的死手限制。例如<em class="calibre8">，<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_247" class="calibre4"></a>反对永久性财产权</em>，这是法律控制家族财富的重要一步。该规则规定，财产的未来权益必须在权益产生时在世的人死亡后 21 年内归属——必须成为最终权益。反对永久性财产权的规则困扰了几代法学院的学生；加州最高法院曾表示，该规则非常复杂，律师无法理解并不构成渎职，而且许多州已通过法令修改了其限制。但基本概念很简单。土地所有者不能通过产生几代人都不会产生的权益来永远束缚土地。根据该规则，奥哈拉试图让其继承人的每一代都只拥有塔拉终身权益的做法是无效的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A third technique is to use certain substantive rules that simply prohibit certain kinds of dead hand restrictions. An example is the <em class="calibre8">Rule <a class="calibre4"></a>against Perpetuities</em>, a major step in the law’s effort to control dynastic wealth. The Rule states that a future interest in property must vest—must become final—within twenty-one years of the death of someone who is alive at the time the interest is created. The Rule against Perpetuities has tormented law students for generations; the California Supreme Court once stated that the rule is so complicated that it is not malpractice for a lawyer to fail to understand it, and its strictures have been modified by statute in many states. But the basic concept is simple. A landowner cannot tie up the land forever by creating interests that will not arise for generations to come. Under the rule, O’Hara’s attempt to have successive generations of his heirs each hold only a life interest in Tara would be invalid.</p>

<p class="noindent">租赁是一种非常常见的财产持有形式，从公寓的短期租赁到商业办公空间的长期租赁。租赁是一种特殊的财产共享使用形式，其中所有者（称为房东或出租人）允许租户或承租人在一段时间内使用该财产。每个人都熟悉租赁的做法，但租赁的概念提出了一些特别有趣的财产法问题。房东和租户之间的关系是什么？这些关系在多大程度上是法律规定的？双方在多大程度上可以通过协议来规范这些关系？</p><p class="noindent">Leases are a very common form of holding property, from a short-term lease of an apartment to a long-term lease of commercial office space. A lease is a particular form of shared use of property in which the owner, known as the landlord or the lessor, permits the tenant or lessee to use the property for a period of time. Everyone is familiar with the practice of leasing, but the concept presents particularly interesting property law issues. What are the relations between landlord and tenant? How much are those relations prescribed by law? And to what degree can the parties direct those relations by agreement?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>房东与租客法在这些问题的答案方面经历了一些历史性的转变，其中一些最重要的转变是最近才发生的。让我们来探讨其中两个转变及其对现行法律的一些影响：从基于财产的租赁概念转变为包含合同要素的租赁概念，以及对房东与租客关系的日益监管。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Landlord and tenant law has seen some historic shifts concerning the answers to those questions, with some of the most important shifts occurring only recently. Let’s consider two of the shifts and some of their implications for current law: the change from a property-based conception of the lease to a conception that incorporates elements of contract, and the increasing regulation of the relationship between landlord and tenant.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>从英国法律的早期开始，租赁就被视为财产权益的转让。回想一下，财产制度建立在不动产的概念之上。根据这一观点，租赁是指在比房东拥有财产的期限更短的期限内设立不动产，并将该不动产转让给租户。实际上，房东会将一段时间的所有权让渡给租户，租户在某种意义上成为该段时间内的新“所有者”，但须承诺支付租金并履行某些其他有限的义务。虽然租赁关系源于房东和租户之间的协议，但它本质上是一种财产关系，而非合同。因此，房东的基本义务是转让财产。<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_248" class="calibre4"></a>租赁期限为规定期限，承租人的基本义务是在租赁期满时支付租金并归还房屋。法律几乎没有规定双方的其他义务。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>From an early point in English law, a lease was considered to be a conveyance of a property interest. Recall that the system of property was built on the idea of estates. Under this view, a lease was the creation of an estate for a shorter period of time than the landlord owned the property and the transfer of that estate to the tenant. The owner would, in effect, give up ownership for a period of years to the tenant, who became, in a sense, the new “owner” for that time, subject to the promise to pay rent and to perform certain other limited obligations. Although the lease relationship originated in the agreement between the landlord and tenant, it was essentially a property relationship, not a contract. Therefore, the basic duty of the landlord was to transfer the property <a class="calibre4"></a>for the specified time, and the basic duty of the tenant was to pay rent and return the property at the end of the lease. The law placed few other obligations on either party.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这种模式非常适合传统的农业用地租赁，但它已经过时了。从19世纪开始，住宅或商业地产的租赁变得比农田租赁更为普遍。在住宅租赁中，尤其是在拥挤的城市公寓中，租户依靠房东维护房屋状况、控制其他租户的行为以及提供供暖和热水等服务。在许多城市住房市场中，租户的选择和议价能力有限。商业租赁的双方越来越多地就租赁的具体条款进行协商，对各项义务的规定比以往的法律规定更为详细。这些变化促使法院和立法机构以不同的方式思考房东与租户的关系。20世纪60年代，由于穷人获得法律服务的便利、民权运动的积极性以及对住房危机的认知等社会因素，这些变化进一步加剧。因此，租赁的法律观点从纯粹的财产权益转让转变为具有许多合同方面的关系，并且至少对于住宅租赁而言，合同内容受到法律更严格的监管。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This model fit the traditional lease of agricultural land very well, but it became outmoded. Beginning in the nineteenth century, the renting of residential or commercial property became much more common than the lease of farmland. In a residential lease, especially in a crowded urban apartment, the tenant relied on the landlord for maintaining the condition of the premises, controlling the behavior of other tenants, and providing services such as heat and hot water. In many urban housing markets, the tenant’s options and bargaining power were limited. Parties to commercial leases increasingly negotiated the precise terms of the lease, spelling out the obligations in much greater detail than the law had previously. These changes encouraged courts and legislatures to think differently about the landlord–tenant relationship. The changes were furthered spurred in the 1960s by the availability of legal services to the poor, the activism of the civil rights movement, and the perception of a housing crisis, among other social factors. As a result, the legal view of a lease shifted from the pure transfer of a property interest to a relationship that had many contractual aspects, and, at least with respect to residential leases, the content of the contract was more closely regulated by the law.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>或许，这种观念转变最重要的方面在于房东对房屋状况的义务。传统上，租赁被视为财产权益的转让，因此，当房东将房屋所有权移交给房客时，转让即告完成。房东有义务将房屋移交给房客，但没有义务交付或维护房屋的适宜居住状态。例如，如果房东未能提供暖气或热水，房客就得承担责任。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Probably the most important area in which the changed thinking was felt concerned the landlord’s obligation concerning the condition of the premises. Traditionally, the lease was seen as a conveyance of a property interest, so the conveyance was complete when the landlord gave the tenant possession of the premises. The landlord was obligated to turn the premises over to the tenant but was not obligated to deliver or maintain them in a livable condition. If the landlord failed to provide heat or hot water, for example, the tenant was out of luck.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>改变房东和房客权利观念的典型案例是<em class="calibre8">贾文斯诉第一国民房地产公司案（Javins v. First National Realty Corp.</em>），该案于1970年由美国哥伦比亚特区上诉法院作出判决。该案是房客律师为维护房客权利而发起的诉讼活动的一部分。房东第一国民房地产公司试图以房租未付为由驱逐房客。房客承认他们没有支付租金，但回应称，他们公寓违反了住房法规，他们有权获得相当于应付租金的赔偿金。法院首先注意到了财产法面临的形势变化。在农业社会中，将租赁视为财产转让是合理的，但公寓居民寻求的不仅仅是农田转让：<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_249" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The leading case shifting the conception of landlord and tenant rights was <em class="calibre8">Javins v. First National Realty Corp</em>., a 1970 decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The case was part of a litigation campaign by tenants’ attorneys to advance tenants’ rights. First National, the landlord, sought to evict the tenants for nonpayment of rent. The tenants admitted that they had not paid rent but responded that housing code violations in their apartments entitled them to a set off in damages equal to the rent due. The court first noted the changes in the situation property law faced. Treating a lease as a conveyance of property made sense in an agrarian society, but the apartment-dwellers were seeking something more than a conveyance of farmland:<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如今，当美国城市居民，无论贫富，寻求“住所”时，他们寻求的是一套众所周知的商品和服务——这套服务不仅包括墙壁和天花板，还包括充足的暖气、光线和通风、可用的管道设施、安全的门窗、适当的卫生设施和适当的维护。</p><p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When American city-dwellers, both rich and poor, seek “shelter” today, they seek a well-known package of goods and services—a package which includes not merely walls and ceilings, but also adequate heat, light and ventilation, serviceable plumbing facilities, secure windows and doors, proper sanitation and proper maintenance.</p>
<p class="noindent">因此，将租赁更多地视为合同是恰当的。在合同案件中，消费者保护的范围已经扩大，例如，默示产品制造商保证其安全性和有效性。同样的原则也适用于住宅租赁。法院默示了适居性保证，要求房东保持房屋符合住房法规。</p><p class="noindent">Accordingly, it was appropriate to treat a lease more as a contract. In contracts cases, consumer protection had been expanded by, for example, implying that the manufacturer of a product guaranteed its safety and effectiveness. The same principle controlled with residential leases. The court implied a warranty of habitability, which required that the landlord keep the premises in compliance with the housing code.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>继<em class="calibre8">贾文斯案</em>之后，住宅适居性默示担保在大多数司法管辖区通过司法判决或立法得以确立。在一些州，该担保采用当地住房法规作为房东履行担保义务的标准；在其他情况下，该担保则更为笼统，可能要求住宅“适宜且适合人类居住”。有时，任何住宅都适用；而在其他地方，则仅涵盖多单元公寓楼。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Following <em class="calibre8">Javins</em>, the implied warranty of habitability in residential housing became well established in most jurisdictions, either through judicial decision or legislation. In some states the warranty adopts the local housing code as the standard for the landlord’s performance; in other cases the warranty is more general, requiring perhaps that the dwelling be “fit and suitable for human habitation.” Sometimes any residence is covered; in other places, only multiunit apartment buildings are covered.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>由于转向默示担保在一定程度上承认租赁既是一份合同，也是一项财产权益的转让，因此合乎逻辑的问题是，双方在定义其关系条款方面拥有多大的自由。租赁合同中是否可以包含租户放弃适居性默示担保的协议？根据现代合同和财产原则，答案通常是否定的。否则，房东可以通过在租赁合同中加入广泛的免责声明来抵消默示担保的效力，而很少有租户会具备足够的知识或议价能力来要求排除该免责声明。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Since the move to an implied warranty is in part a recognition that the lease is as much a contract as a transfer of a property interest, the logical question is how much freedom the parties have to define the terms of their relationship. Can the lease include an agreement by the tenant to waive the implied warranty of habitability? Under modern contract and property principles, the answer is usually no. Otherwise, landlords could negate the effect of the implied warranty by including a broad disclaimer in a form lease, and few tenants would be knowledgeable enough or have enough bargaining power to demand that the disclaimer be excluded.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>由于默示担保部分基于合同，租户可获得的救济措施已得到扩展。目前有多种救济措施可供选择。与任何合同一样，租户可以就违反担保提起诉讼，要求赔偿金钱损失。或者，租户可以先维修后扣款，即先修缮公寓以纠正房东的违规行为，然后将维修费用从租金中扣除。租户还可以将损害赔偿索赔用于防御性索赔，例如拒绝支付租金；如果房东提起诉讼，租户可以以违反担保为由进行抗辩；如果法院认定公寓不适合居住，租户可以继续免付租金，直至违规行为得到修复。<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_250" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Because the implied warranty is in part contract-based, the remedies available to the tenant have been expanded. Many remedies are available. As with any contract, the tenant can sue for money damages for breach of the warranty. Or the tenant can repair and deduct, fixing the apartment to correct the landlord’s violation and then deducting the cost of doing so from the rent. The tenant also can use the damage claim defensively, refusing to pay rent and, if sued by the landlord, asserting the breach of warranty as a defense; if the court agrees that the apartment is uninhabitable, the tenant can remain without paying rent until the violation is repaired.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>

Can you refuse to allow the highway to come through, causing the state to reroute it at great expense and inconvenience? No. If the state insists, it can build the highway through your property even over your objection, by taking the property from you. However, because it is your property, the state has to pay you for it.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>除了实际没收你的房产外，政府有权监管你对房产的使用。但权力究竟有多大呢？许多市政分区法规禁止在住宅区经营企业。一些郊区社区要求房主保持草坪修剪整齐。湿地、松林和海滨保护法规可能会完全禁止在环境敏感区域进行建设。政府能合法地将房产监管到这种程度吗？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Short of actually taking your property away from you, the government has the authority to regulate your use of the property. But how much? Many municipal zoning laws prevent the operation of a business in a residential area. Some suburban communities require homeowners to keep their grass neatly trimmed. Wetlands, pinelands, and beachfront preservation regulations may prevent construction altogether in environmentally sensitive areas. Can the government lawfully regulate property to this extent?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>让我们从对私有财产最极端的限制开始，即政府征用私有财产的权力。这种权力被称为<em class="calibre8">征用</em>权。当政府确定需要私有财产用于公共目的时，它可以征用该财产——实际上是从所有者那里购买它，不管所有者是否愿意出售。征用权是政府的固有权力；联邦和州政府拥有征用财产的权力，这是政府运作的重要组成部分。事实上，在早期共和国，人们通常认为私有财产可以被征用，甚至无需支付费用。然而，联邦和州宪法确实对这种权力进行了限制。美国宪法第五修正案规定：“非经公正补偿，不得将私有财产用于公共用途。”政府可以征用土地，但必须为此支付公平的价格。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Let’s begin with the most extreme limitation on private property, the government’s ability to take private property. This ability is known as the power of <em class="calibre8">eminent domain</em>. When the government determines that it needs private property for a public purpose, it can condemn the property—in effect purchasing it from the owner whether the owner wants to sell or not. The eminent domain power is an inherent power of government; the federal and state governments possess the power to condemn property as an essential part of being a government. Indeed, in the early Republic it was often held that private property could be taken without even paying for it. Federal and state constitutions do provide a limitation on the power, however. The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states: “Nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.” The government may condemn land, but it must pay a fair price for it.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>长期以来，征用权被广泛接受为政府的固有权力，这清楚地表明，财产并非完全私有。公共利益与财产所有权息息相关，但当公共利益要求征用财产时，征用并无任何障碍。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The degree to which eminent domain has long been accepted as an inherent power of government makes clear that property is never wholly private. There is a public interest in the ownership of property, but when the public interest requires that property be taken, there is no barrier to doing so.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>典型的征用案件——房主的院子将成为新高速公路的所在地——在法律上很简单。州政府提起征用程序，征用土地并确定公平的补偿。在特定案件中，确定公平补偿可能<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_251" class="calibre4"></a>事实复杂，但其基本含义是确定财产的市场价值。但其他一些案件则提出了棘手的问题。要行使征用权，被征用的财产必须用于公共目的。修建一条人人共享的高速公路显然服务于公共目的，但那些不太传统的政府活动呢？在一系列案件中，最高法院高度尊重立法机构对公共用途或目的的定义，并以此作为征用权的依据。在<em class="calibre8">伯曼诉帕克案</em>（1954年）中，由于重建计划对整个地区的有效性，最高法院允许哥伦比亚特区以征用权的形式征用位于衰败地区的一家百货商店，即使该商店本身具有经济可行性且并未衰败。在<em class="calibre8">夏威夷住房管理局诉米德基夫案</em>（1984年）中，最高法院支持夏威夷州的一项立法，该立法允许租户向住房管理局请愿，要求将他们租用的土地从私人房东手中收回并出售给他们，以促进更公平的分配和开放的土地市场。在这两起案件中，法院表示，“在特定的宪法限制下，当立法机关作出表态时，公众利益已被几乎确定无疑地宣布。”</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The typical condemnation case—the homeowner whose yard will be the site of a new highway—is legally simple. The state brings a condemnation proceeding to take the land and to establish the just compensation. Determining what is just compensation in a particular case may be <a class="calibre4"></a>factually complex, but it basically means establishing the market value of the property. But other cases present tough issues. To exercise the eminent domain power, the property taken must be used for a public purpose. Building a highway for everyone’s use obviously serves a public purpose, but what about less traditional activities of government? In a series of cases, the Supreme Court has shown great deference to the legislative determination of what is a public use or purpose justifying eminent domain. In <em class="calibre8">Berman v. Parker</em> (1954), the Court allowed the District of Columbia to take by eminent domain a department store located in a blighted area, even though the store itself was economically viable and not blighted, because of the validity of the redevelopment plan for the area as a whole. In <em class="calibre8">Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff</em> (1984), it upheld legislation by the state of Hawaii that allowed tenants to petition the housing authority to have the land they rented taken away from the private landlord and sold to them, in order to promote more equitable distribution and an open market for land. In both cases, the Court said, “Subject to specific constitutional limitations, when the legislature has spoken, the public interest has been declared in terms well-nigh conclusive.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>随着各州使用征用权的范围扩大，公共目的的延伸范围问题变得更具争议，法院在 2005 年备受争议的<em class="calibre8">Kelo v. City of New London</em>案中再次讨论了这一问题。康涅狄格州新伦敦市开始振兴其 Fort Trumbull 地区，这项工作由私营非营利性新伦敦发展公司 (NLDC) 管理。经过广泛的规划过程，NLDC 最终确定了该地区的发展计划，包括在“城市村庄”中建造酒店、商店和餐馆，建造一个海岸警卫队博物馆，建造新住宅、办公室和零售空间以及一个码头。该计划要求 NLDC 收购该地区 115 位业主的房产，其中大多数以协商价格出售。九位业主拒绝以 NLDC 提供的价格出售，或者根本不出售，其中包括像 Wilhelmina Dery 这样的长期居民，她于 1918 年出生在 Fort Trumbull 的房子里，并在此度过了她的一生。业主们对土地征用权的行使提出质疑，声称重建计划不构成公共用途，因为该地区并未遭到破坏，该计划只是将他们的财产从一个私人所有者转移到另一个私人所有者，而没有按照宪法要求向公众开放。法院驳回了他们的质疑，裁定社区经济发展是有效的公共目的。宪法中“公共用途”的要求并不意味着该财产必须向公众开放。相反，长期以来，这一要求一直被解释为立法机关<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_252" class="calibre4"></a>已经确定公众将从土地的新用途中受益，例如法院支持允许工厂水坝淹没上游土地所有者或采矿公司将矿桶运过其他所有者财产的法规，或者如<em class="calibre8">伯曼</em>和<em class="calibre8">夏威夷房屋管理局</em>案中所述，土地被重新开发或甚至只是转让给新所有者。根据法院的说法，界定什么是公共目的是立法机关的任务，而不是法院的任务：“一个多世纪以来，我们的公共用途法理学明智地避开了僵化的公式和侵入性审查，倾向于给予立法机关广泛的自由度来决定什么样的公众需求可以证明使用征用权的合理性。”四名大法官持不同意见，认为多数意见实际上从征用条款中删除了公共用途要求。正如奥康纳大法官所说：“现在，所有私有财产都可能被征用并转让给另一个私人所有者，只要这些财产可以得到升级——即将其转让给立法机构认为更有利于公众的所有者。” 超过40个州根据法院在<em class="calibre8">凯洛案</em>中的判决颁布了相关法律。大多数法律表面上禁止为经济发展而行使征用权或将财产转让给私人开发商，但许多法律也包含限制其效力的例外情况，例如允许征用“荒芜”的财产或妨碍“健康发展”的财产。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As states’ use of the eminent domain power expanded, the question of how far a public purpose extended became more controversial, and the Court returned to the issue in 2005 in the much-debated case of <em class="calibre8">Kelo v. City of New London</em>. New London, Connecticut, embarked on the economic revitalization of its Fort Trumbull area, with its efforts managed by the private, nonprofit New London Development Corporation (NLDC). After an extensive planning process, NLDC finalized a development plan for the area that included a hotel, shops, and restaurants in an “urban village,” a Coast Guard museum, new residences, office and retail space, and a marina. The plan required NLDC to acquire the property of 115 owners in the area, most of whom sold at negotiated prices. Nine owners refused to sell at the prices offered by NLDC, or perhaps at all, including such long-time residents as Wilhelmina Dery, who was born in her Fort Trumbull house in 1918 and had lived there her entire life. The owners challenged the exercise of eminent domain, claiming that the redevelopment plan did not constitute a public use because the area was not blighted and the plan would simply transfer their property from one private owner to another, without being open to a public use as constitutionally required. The Court rejected their challenge, holding that community economic development is a valid public purpose. The constitutional requirement of “public use” did not mean that the property physically be open to the public. Instead, the requirement long had been interpreted to mean that the legislature <a class="calibre4"></a>had determined that the public would benefit from the new use of the land, as when courts upheld statutes that allowed mill dams to flood upstream landowners or a mining company to transport ore buckets over other owners’ property, or, as in <em class="calibre8">Berman</em> and <em class="calibre8">Hawaii Housing Authority</em>, when land was redeveloped or even simply transferred to a new owner. According to the Court, it was the task of the legislature, not the courts, to draw the lines about what constitutes a public purpose: “For more than a century, our public use jurisprudence has wisely eschewed rigid formulas and intrusive scrutiny in favor of affording legislatures broad latitude in determining what public needs justify the use of the takings power.” Four justices dissented, arguing that the majority had effectively deleted the public use requirement from the takings clause. As Justice O’Connor stated, “All private property is now vulnerable to being taken and transferred to another private owner, so long as it might be upgraded—i.e., given to an owner who will use it in a way that the legislature deems more beneficial to the public—in the process.” More than forty states enacted legislation in response to the Court’s decision in <em class="calibre8">Kelo</em>. Most statutes ostensibly prevented the exercise of eminent domain for economic development or the transfer of property to private developers, but many contained exceptions that limited their effect, permitting, for example, takings of “blighted” property or those that are in the way of “sound growth.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>假设新伦敦市没有征用其中一位提出投诉的土地所有者的土地，而是通过了一项法令，规定该土地必须用作一些新零售商店的停车场。那么土地所有者就可以投诉政府实际上（即使形式上没有）征用了他们的土地，并且州政府应该为此支付合理的补偿。在这种情况下，土地所有者可以提起<em class="calibre8">逆向征收</em>诉讼，投诉<em class="calibre8">监管性征用</em>，并要求政府支付赔偿金。大多数情况下，情况并没有那么恶劣，但我们该如何划定界限呢？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Suppose that instead of taking the property of one of the complaining landowners, New London had passed an ordinance stating that the property had to be used as parking lots for some of the new retail shops. Then the landowners could complain that the government had taken their land in reality, if not in form, and the state should be required to pay just compensation for doing so. In that kind of case, the landowners could bring an <em class="calibre8">inverse condemnation</em> action complaining about a <em class="calibre8">regulatory taking</em> and require the government to pay. Most cases are less egregious than that, but where do we draw the line?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最高法院试图在二十世纪初的一系列案件中划定这一界限。其基本原则是，管制土地用途是警察权的有效行使；如果立法机关认定，即使管制到几乎消除土地价值的程度，对于防止公共损害也是必要的，其决定也应受到尊重；只有在没有相应公共利益的情况下剥夺土地的全部价值才构成征用。例如，在1978年的<em class="calibre8">宾夕法尼亚中央</em>铁路案中，法院允许纽约市阻止在中央车站顶部建造办公大楼，以保护车站的历史建筑（<em class="calibre8">宾夕法尼亚中央运输公司诉纽约市</em>）。<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_253" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Supreme Court has tried to draw the line in a series of cases from the early part of the twentieth century. Its basic principle was that regulating the use of land is a valid exercise of the police power; if the legislature determined that regulating even to the extent of practically eliminating its value was necessary to prevent public harm, its decision would be respected; only taking away all the value of land without a corresponding public benefit is a taking. In the <em class="calibre8">Penn Central</em> case in 1978, for example, the Court allowed New York City to prevent the construction of an office tower atop Grand Central Station in order to preserve the station’s historic architecture (<em class="calibre8">Penn Central Transportation Co. v. City of New York</em>).<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，从20世纪70年代末开始，保守派活动家开始提起诉讼，挑战长期存在的规则，而最高法院成员的变动有时也为这些诉讼提供了回应。随着保守派挑战环境保护立法，以及房屋建筑商和其他开发商挑战分区规划和其他土地使用法规，这些激进主义运动应运而生。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Beginning in the late 1970s, however, conservative activists pressed litigation that challenged the long-standing rules, and the changing membership of the Court sometimes provided a responsive audience. The activism arose as conservatives challenged environmental protection legislation and as home builders and other developers challenged zoning and other land-use regulations.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在<em class="calibre8">卢卡斯诉南卡罗来纳州海岸委员会案</em>（1992年）中，法院多数法官采纳了所谓的绝对规则：当财产所有者被剥夺其财产的经济效益用途时，即使该法规是由立法机关为防止公众受到损害而制定的，该法规也构成财产征用，除非其属于传统普通法中规定的妨害行为。因此，州政府颁布了一项法规，禁止在海岸线附近进行开发，以防止侵蚀和其他损害，从而征用了堰洲岛上拥有两块土地的所有者的财产。虽然该裁决引发的问题与它解答的问题一样多，但它确实表明了法院愿意将征用原则扩展到传统上有效的警察权力监管领域。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In <em class="calibre8">Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council</em> (1992), a majority of the Court adopted what it called a categorical rule: When a property owner is deprived of the economically beneficial use of his property, even if the regulation is crafted by the legislature to prevent harm to the public, the regulation constitutes a taking of property unless it falls within the traditional common law category of nuisance. Thus the state had taken the property of an owner of two lots on a barrier island when it enacted a statute that prevented development too close to the shoreline, in order to prevent erosion and other damage. While the decision raised as many questions as it answered, it did signal the Court’s willingness to expand the takings doctrine into the realm of what traditionally had been valid police power regulation.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法院还改变了定义哪些类型的征收可以对新开发项目征收的传统规则。通常，当土地所有者寻求新开发项目的批准时，政府会要求将一些土地奉献给公众或进行一些土地改良以支持开发项目，例如公园绿地或街道。传统上，只要征收与开发之间存在合理的关系，政府的行为就是警察权力的有效行使，而不是征用。然而，在<em class="calibre8">诺兰诉加州海岸委员会案</em>（1987年）和<em class="calibre8">多兰诉蒂加德市案</em>（1994年）中，法院裁定，除非开发项目带来的负担与征收之间存在密切的联系和大致的比例，否则该规定就构成征用。例如，在<em class="calibre8">多兰案</em>中，一位商店老板申请了建筑许可证以扩大其商店规模。市政府为该许可证设定了条件，要求店主将一块土地划为人行道和自行车道。法院裁定该条件无效，因为市政府未能证明该道路对于新建筑带来的额外客流量是必要的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Court also changed traditional rules defining what kind of exactions could be imposed on new development. Often when a landowner seeks approval for a new development, the government requires in return some dedication of land to the public or some land improvements to support the development, such as parkland or streets. Traditionally, as long as there is a reasonable relation between the exaction and the development, the government’s action is a valid exercise of the police power, not a taking. In <em class="calibre8">Nolan v. California Coastal Commission</em> (1987) and <em class="calibre8">Dolan v. City of Tigard</em> (1994), however, the Court held that unless there was a close link and a rough proportionality between the burden imposed by the development and the exaction, the regulation was a taking. In <em class="calibre8">Dolan</em>, for example, a store owner had applied for a building permit to expand the size of her store. The city conditioned the permit on the store owner’s dedicating a strip of land as a pedestrian and bicycle pathway. The Court invalidated the condition because the city had not demonstrated that the pathway would be needed for the additional customer traffic generated by the new construction.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">然而，自卢卡斯案</em>以来，最高法院对于应在多大程度上改变传统规则一直犹豫不决。例如，最高法院在推翻一项联邦法规时，扩展了其严格的原则，该法规规定烟煤公司必须为退休矿工的医疗福利做出贡献；四名法官裁定，该法规构成了对公司财产的征用，即使没有被征用的实物财产或任何其他可识别的财产；第五名法官裁定该法规无效。<a id="text/part0013_split_001.html.page_254" class="calibre4"></a>法令，基于正当程序理由（<em class="calibre8">Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel</em>，1998 年）。另一方面，激进主义者认为<em class="calibre8">卢卡斯</em>应该适用于财产权益的任何部分，因此，如果政府在一段时间内阻止财产的使用，那就是剥夺了该时间段内所有经济有益的使用，因此是一种征用，但在<em class="calibre8">Tahoe-Sierra 保护委员会诉 Tahoe 区域规划局</em>（2002 年）一案中，法院不同意这一观点，认为为规划目的而暂停土地开发的两年半禁令并不构成征用，因为这只是对财产所有权利的临时管制。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Since <em class="calibre8">Lucas</em>, however, the Court has been ambivalent about how far to alter the traditional rules. For example, the Court extended its strict doctrine in striking down a federal statute under which bituminous coal companies had to contribute to the health benefits of retired miners; four justices held that the statute constituted a taking of the company’s property, even though there was no physical property or any other identifiable property taken, and a fifth justice invalidated the <a class="calibre4"></a>statute on due process grounds (<em class="calibre8">Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel</em>, 1998). On the other hand, activists argued that <em class="calibre8">Lucas</em> should be applied to any part of an interest in property, so that if the government prevents the use of property for a period of time, that is a deprivation of all economically beneficial use for that time and therefore a taking, but in <em class="calibre8">Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency</em> (2002) the Court disagreed, holding that a two-and-a-half year moratorium on land development for planning purposes did not constitute a taking because it was only a temporary regulation of all of the rights in the property.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>假设三个青少年（分别叫他们汤姆、迪克和哈利）在商场里犯了些轻微的罪行，他们在一些商店里偷东西，在墙上涂鸦，还粗鲁地撞到其他顾客。他们犯了罪吗？想想为什么他们的行为可能构成犯罪，以及我们还能如何对其进行描述。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Suppose three teenagers (call them Tom, Dick, and Harry) go on a minor crime spree at the mall, shoplifting in some stores, writing graffiti on the walls, and rudely bumping into other customers. Have they committed any crimes? Think about why their conduct may be criminal and how else we might characterize it.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>商店行窃无疑是犯罪行为。州法律将盗窃大致定义为拿走不属于自己的东西。任何人均可因盗窃罪被起诉。“<em class="calibre8">被起诉”</em>是指州政府官员（通常是地方检察官）将提起诉讼，判定其有罪并对其行为进行处罚，通常是罚款或入狱。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Shoplifting is certainly a crime. A state statute defines theft as, roughly, taking something that doesn’t belong to you. Tom, Dick, and Harry can be prosecuted for the crime. By <em class="calibre8">prosecuted</em>, we mean that a state official (commonly the district attorney) will bring a proceeding in court to have them found guilty of criminal conduct and punished for their acts, typically by being fined or sent to jail.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，刑事诉讼并非唯一可以提起的诉讼程序。首先，店主可以提起民事诉讼，因为同样的行为构成侵占他人财产的侵权行为。在民事诉讼中，店主收到的钱<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_256" class="calibre4"></a>被告要求赔偿损失——不是罚款，而是赔偿她损失的财产。其次，如果汤姆只有14岁，地方检察官可能会决定以未成年人的身份起诉他。未成年人诉讼并非刑事诉讼。其主要目的并非惩罚汤姆，而是为了纠正他的行为；即使他被送进少年拘留所，法律也不认为这是刑事惩罚。第三，同样地，如果迪克被发现患有精神疾病，导致他无法控制地袭击商场顾客，他的家人或地方检察官可能会提起诉讼，要求将他送往精神病院接受治疗。在这种诉讼中，问题不在于迪克是否犯罪，而在于他是否对自己或他人构成危险。即使他可能被非自愿地剥夺了自由，他也没有被判有罪。所有这些都是非刑事制裁，因为只有刑法才涉及在国家提起的诉讼中确定有罪或刑事责任，并可施加法定的惩罚。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The criminal prosecution is not the only proceeding that can be brought, however. First, the store owner can bring a civil action because the same conduct constitutes the tort of conversion—taking someone else’s property. In the civil action, the store owner receives money <a class="calibre4"></a>damages from the defendants—not a fine, but compensation for her lost property. Second, if Tom is only fourteen years old, the district attorney might decide to proceed against him as a juvenile. A juvenile proceeding is not a criminal proceeding. It is not designed primarily to punish Tom but to provide for the correction of his behavior; even if he is sent to a juvenile detention facility, the law doesn’t think of that as criminal punishment. Third, and similarly, if Dick is found to be suffering from mental illness that causes him to uncontrollably assault mall patrons, a family member or the district attorney might bring an action to have him committed to a psychiatric institution for treatment. In this action, the question is not whether Dick has committed a crime but whether he is dangerous to himself or others. Even though he may be involuntarily deprived of his liberty, he has not been found guilty of a crime. All of these are noncriminal sanctions because only—and always—criminal law involves a determination of guilt, or criminal responsibility, in a proceeding brought by the state, for which legally defined punishment may be imposed.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如果哈利在去商场的路上收到一张超速罚单怎么办？这算犯罪吗？超速是哈利可以被起诉的违法行为，他可能会因违法而受到公开惩罚（罚款）。但我们通常会区分相对轻微的违法行为（例如超速）和更严重的违法行为（例如酒后驾驶），并且只将后者定义为犯罪。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>What if Harry receives a speeding ticket on his way to the mall? Is that a crime? Speeding is an offense for which Harry can be prosecuted, and he can receive a public punishment (a fine) for committing the offense. But we usually distinguish relatively minor violations of the law, like speeding, from more serious offenses, like drunk driving, and label only the latter as crimes.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>接下来，假设哈利因粗鲁撞倒商场顾客吉尔并将她撞倒在地而被控殴打罪。庭审中，吉尔作证说，虽然她不认识哈利，但她并不介意被撞倒，伤势也不算太重，而且她认为青少年应该找点乐子。这能让哈利脱身吗？不能；他仍然可能被定罪。哈利的行为与所有犯罪一样，构成犯罪，并非因为它侵犯了他人，而是因为它损害了公共利益。国家已经确定了哪些行为是违法的，即使受害者不在乎，国家也可以惩罚这种行为。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Next, suppose that Harry is prosecuted for the crime of battery for rudely bumping into Jill, a mall patron, and knocking her to the ground. At trial Jill testifies that although she didn’t know Harry she really didn’t mind being knocked down, she wasn’t hurt too badly, and she thought teenagers ought to be able to have some fun. Does that get Harry off the hook? No; he still can be convicted. Harry’s behavior, like all crimes, is criminal not because it is a wrong against another person but because it is a wrong against the public good. The state has determined what behavior is wrongful, and the state can punish that behavior even if the victim doesn’t care.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>现在假设地方检察官决定以成年人身份起诉14岁的汤姆，罪名是商店盗窃。（在大多数州，检察官都有这个选择权。）在庭审中，商店的监控录像显示，汤姆并非有意偷窃他被控偷窃的DVD。相反，他撞到了商店柜台，DVD在他不知情的情况下掉进了他随身携带的包里。汤姆将被宣告无罪——被判无罪。为什么？几乎在所有案件中，刑法都有一个<em class="calibre8">罪责</em>要求：犯罪者必须有犯罪意图，或者至少是极其粗心大意（例如撞到某人）。<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_257" class="calibre4"></a>（醉酒驾驶时）。刑法的一个显著特征是它体现了<em class="calibre8">可责性</em>的概念。一个人必须做了错事，做了值得道德谴责的事，才能受到刑事制裁。要受到谴责，仅仅犯下恶行是不够的；他或她还必须是在犯错时心态不良。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now suppose that the district attorney decides to prosecute Tom, the fourteen-year-old, as an adult for shoplifting. (In most states, the prosecutor has that choice.) At trial the store’s video security camera tape reveals that Tom didn’t actually mean to steal the DVD that he is accused of taking. Instead, he bumped into a store counter and, without his knowing it, the DVD fell into a bag he was carrying. Tom would be acquitted—found not to have committed a crime. Why? In nearly every case, criminal law has a <em class="calibre8">culpability</em> requirement: Someone must intend to commit a crime or at least be very careless (as in running someone <a class="calibre4"></a>over when driving drunk). One of the distinctive features of criminal law is that it embodies an idea of <em class="calibre8">blameworthiness</em>. Someone must have done something wrong, something that deserves moral condemnation, before a criminal sanction may be imposed. To deserve condemnation, it’s not enough that someone commit a bad act; he or she also must have done so with a bad state of mind.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>当我们将所有这些假设综合起来时，我们会发现，系统地界定刑法的范围实际上比乍一看要困难得多。违反刑法的行为会受到政府起诉，但政府也会采取其他类型的行动。违法行为会导致负面制裁，但民事诉讼、对轻微违法行为的起诉以及行政诉讼也会导致负面制裁，而且并非所有刑事案件中的负面制裁都会对受罚者造成如此大的伤害。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When we put all of these hypotheticals together, we see that it is actually harder to define the scope of criminal law in a systematic way than it first appears. Violations of criminal law are prosecuted by the government, but the government brings other types of actions as well. Violations result in negative sanctions but so do civil lawsuits, prosecution of minor infractions, and administrative proceedings, and not all negative sanctions in criminal cases are that harmful to the recipients.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>因此，刑法的核心是基于应受谴责程度的道德谴责和惩罚。犯罪是一种错误行为，由于犯罪者违反了公共道德标准，理应受到惩罚。即使这个定义并不完美，但它抓住了刑法区别于其他法律体系的本质。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The core of criminal law, then, is moral condemnation and punishment based on blameworthiness. A crime is a wrong that deserves punishment because the criminal has violated public standards of morality. Even this definition is not perfect, but it captures the essence of what distinguishes criminal law from other bodies of law.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这些假设也揭示了任何刑事案件中存在的问题。首先，被告是否实施了刑法所禁止的行为？盗窃罪要求某人拿走不属于他或她的财产。要判定汤姆犯有商店行窃罪，检察官必须证明汤姆确实实施了盗窃行为。如果他没有带着物品走出商店，或者他已经付款，他就没有实施被禁止的行为。其次，被告实施该行为时是否处于应受谴责的心理状态？盗窃不仅要求被告拿走他人财产，而且还要求他在这样做时明知该财产属于他人。如果汤姆相信一家音乐商店门口的垃圾箱里有免费的DVD，那么如果他拿走一张DVD而不付款，他就不构成盗窃。第三，如果被告实施犯罪行为时处于应受谴责的心理状态，他是否有辩护理由？迪克的精神疾病可能是一种辩护理由。第四，如果被告没有实施构成犯罪的违禁行为，他是否仍需承担刑事责任？假设汤姆、迪克和哈利同意一起去商店偷东西，但哈利实际上并没有偷任何东西。他是否仍然需要承担责任，因为他同意加入这个团伙？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The hypotheticals also suggest what the issues are in any criminal case. First, has the defendant committed an act that is prohibited by the criminal law? The crime of theft requires that someone take property that does not belong to him or her. To convict Tom of shoplifting, the prosecutor would have to prove that Tom did that. If he had not walked out of the store with an item, or if he had paid for it, he would not have performed the prohibited act. Second, has the defendant performed the act with a culpable state of mind? Theft requires not only that the defendant take someone else’s property but that he do so with knowledge that the property belongs to someone else. If Tom believes that a bin near the front of a music store contains free DVDs, he does not commit theft if he takes one without paying for it. Third, if the defendant has committed a criminal act with a culpable state of mind, does he have a defense? Dick’s mental illness might be a defense. Fourth, if the defendant has not committed a prohibited act with the requisite state of culpability, might he still be criminally liable? Suppose Tom, Dick, and Harry agree to go on a shoplifting spree but Harry doesn’t actually steal anything. Could he be liable anyway for agreeing to be part of the gang?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">实体刑法</em>（本章探讨的主题）与<em class="calibre8">刑事诉讼程序（</em><a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.n0124" href="#text/part0015_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-9" class="calibre4">第九章</a>将对此进行探讨）之间还有一个本质区别。刑法阐明了刑事责任的一般原则，并定义了哪些行为构成犯罪。它有助于回答诸如：谋杀和过失杀人之间有什么区别？<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_258" class="calibre4"></a>什么构成法律上的精神错乱？刑事诉讼程序涉及对犯罪行为进行调查和裁决的过程。警方何时必须向嫌疑人宣读<em class="calibre8">米兰达</em>权利？公平审判意味着什么？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There is one other essential distinction between <em class="calibre8">substantive criminal law</em> (which is the subject of this chapter) and <em class="calibre8">criminal procedure</em> (which is examined in <a href="#text/part0015_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-9" class="calibre4">Chapter 9</a>). Criminal law states general principles of criminal liability and defines what behavior is criminal. It helps answer questions such as: What’s the difference between murder and manslaughter? <a class="calibre4"></a>What constitutes legal insanity? Criminal procedure concerns the process by which criminal behavior is investigated and adjudicated. When must the police read a suspect his <em class="calibre8">Miranda</em> rights? What does it mean to have a fair trial?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>实体刑法通常分为两部分：刑事责任的一般原则和具体犯罪的定义。刑事责任的一般原则贯穿了所有具体犯罪的定义。首先，如果刑法禁止各种不法行为，那么我们所说的“行为”究竟指什么呢？具体犯罪禁止特定行为（例如，夺取他人财产），但构成犯罪的行为的基本条件是什么？其次，由于犯罪行为只有伴有应受谴责的心理状态时才构成有罪，那么我们如何定义会导致刑事责任的心理状态？法律定义了一系列相关的心理状态，法院在解释刑法时会运用这些定义。第三，在什么情况下，一个人实施一项原本构成犯罪的行为是正当的或可免责的？如果实施犯罪行为可以避免更大的损害，那么犯罪行为可能是正当的。例如，自卫就是一项正当性原则。同样，如果行为人在实施某一行为时由于某种原因无可指责，则该行为也可免责。患有精神疾病或精神缺陷的人可能意图杀害他人，但仍然缺乏将其行为定为犯罪所必需的可归责性。第四，在什么情况下，一个人可能对犯罪的初步行为或进一步犯罪的行为负责，但这些行为可能不符合特定犯罪的构成要件？企图犯罪但未遂的人通常要对犯罪未遂承担责任，但她在犯罪前夕到什么程度才构成犯罪？同样，如果一群罪犯参与了抢劫银行的阴谋，其中一人在抢劫过程中枪杀了一名警卫，其他人是否都要对谋杀行为负责？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The substantive criminal law often is divided into two parts: general principles of criminal liability and definition of specific crimes. The general principles of criminal liability cut across all of the definitions of specific crimes. First, if criminal law prohibits wrongful acts of various kinds, what do we mean by an “act”? Specific crimes prohibit specific acts (such as taking someone else’s property), but what are the basic requirements for the kind of conduct that is criminal? Second, because criminal acts are culpable only when accompanied by a blameworthy mental state, how do we define the mental states that will lead to criminal liability? The law defines a range of relevant mental states, and the courts apply those definitions in interpreting criminal statutes. Third, when is someone justified or excused in doing an act that otherwise would be criminal? A criminal act might be justified if doing the act avoids some greater harm. Self-defense, for example, is a principle of justification. Similarly, an act is excused when for some reason the actor is blameless in performing it. A person suffering from a mental disease or defect may intend to kill someone else but still lack the blameworthiness necessary to declare his behavior criminal. Fourth, when may someone be liable for acts that are preliminary to a crime, or further a crime, but may not fit the elements of a specific offense? One who attempts to commit a crime but fails is generally liable for the attempt, but how close does she have to come before she has committed a crime? Similarly, if a group of criminals participate in a conspiracy to rob a bank and one of them shoots a guard during the robbery, are all of the others liable for murder?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>具体刑事犯罪的定义显然涉及哪些行为和伴随的心理状态是定罪的必要条件。例如，谋杀、故意杀人和非故意杀人之间有什么区别？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The definition of specific criminal offenses obviously concerns what acts and accompanying mental states are necessary to convict a person of a crime. For example, what are the differences among murder, voluntary manslaughter, and involuntary manslaughter?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>制定刑法的一般原则并界定具体罪行曾是法院的职权范围。然而，到了20世纪，立法机构开始颁布全面的刑法典。20世纪50年代和60年代，由律师、法官和教授组成的私人机构美国法律协会起草了一部《示范刑法典》，作为各州立法机构制定刑事立法的指南。这项努力非常成功；大约四分之三的州都以该指南为基础制定了刑法典。每个州都在某些方面偏离了该示范法典，随着问题的不断出现，立法机构也不断地修改法律。<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_259" class="calibre4"></a>但《示范刑法典》为讨论刑法的总体状况提供了一个有用的起点。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Creating the general principles of criminal law and defining the specific offenses was once the province of the courts. In the twentieth century, however, legislatures began to enact comprehensive codes of criminal law. In the 1950s and 1960s the American Law Institute, a private body of lawyers, judges, and professors, drafted a Model Penal Code to serve as a guide to state legislatures in adopting criminal legislation. The effort was very successful; about three-fourths of the states have adopted codes based on this guide. Each state has departed from the model in some ways, and legislatures keep rewriting the law as issues continue to arise, <a class="calibre4"></a>but the Model Penal Code provides a useful takeoff point for discussion of the state of the criminal law generally.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>以下章节将讨论刑事责任的一般原则，以及一些最重要、最值得关注的具体罪行的定义。但在深入探讨细节之前，先来思考一个最根本的问题：我们为什么需要刑法？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The sections that follow discuss the general principles of criminal liability and the definition of some of the most important and most interesting specific offenses. But before getting into the details, consider the most fundamental issue of all: Why do we need criminal law?</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0014_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-8-div1-3"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0073" class="calibre1">为什么我们需要刑法？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0073" class="calibre1">Why Do We Need Criminal Law?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">这应该是显而易见的。我们需要刑法来惩罚罪犯，预防犯罪。但正如我们在本书其他法律概念中所看到的，事情并非如此简单。</p><p class="noindent">This should be obvious. We need criminal law to punish criminals and prevent crime. But as we’ve seen with the other legal concepts in this book, it’s not that simple.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>刑法的首要目的是界定社会认为不法行为。谋杀邻居、放火烧毁她的房子或偷窃她的割草机都是错误的。被定义为犯罪的行为通常（但并非总是）会给他人带来最严重的后果；谋杀和纵火危害极大，但偷窃邻居的割草机的社会危害性可能小于制造没有足够安全装置的割草机，后者仅是一种民事错误。刑事犯罪与其他不法行为的区别在于，作为一个类别，它们特别值得社会谴责。某种行为不构成犯罪并不意味着它不是不法的；我们以其他方式谴责其他行为，例如通过施加侵权责任或简单的社会非议。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The first purpose criminal law serves is to define what behavior society regards as wrongful. It is wrong to murder your neighbor, set fire to her house, or steal her lawnmower. The acts defined as criminal often (but not always) have the most serious consequences for others; murder and arson are very harmful, but stealing your neighbor’s lawnmower probably is less of a social evil than manufacturing lawnmowers without adequate safety devices, which is only a civil wrong. What distinguishes criminal offenses from other wrongful acts is that, as a class, they are particularly worthy of social condemnation. Just because an act is not criminal does not mean that it is not wrongful; we condemn other behavior in other ways, such as through the imposition of tort liability or simple social disapproval.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>对不法行为的谴责对刑法而言是不够的。犯罪行为的严重性如此之高，以至于当一个人犯下与其他类型不法行为不同的犯罪行为时，她不仅要赔偿损失或在乡村俱乐部受到冷遇，还要受到惩罚。因此，在思考我们为何有刑法时，真正的问题是我们为何有刑事处罚。回答这个问题对刑法至关重要；弄清楚我们为何要惩罚，也能告诉我们应该惩罚谁、如何惩罚以及惩罚到何种程度。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Condemnation of wrongful behavior isn’t enough for criminal law. Criminal acts are so wrongful that when someone commits a criminal act as distinguished from some other type of wrong, she is not just made to pay damages or snubbed at the country club; she is punished. So in considering why we have criminal law, the real question is why we have criminal punishment. Answering this question is supremely important for criminal law; figuring out why we punish will also tell us who we should punish, how, and to what degree.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>刑法理论家为惩罚罪犯提供了两种辩护，分别称为<em class="calibre8">功利主义</em>和<em class="calibre8">报应</em>主义。功利主义认为刑法是有用的，因为惩罚罪犯有益于社会。报应主义认为刑法的主要作用是报应；换句话说，罪犯受到惩罚是因为他们罪有应得。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Criminal law theorists offer two kinds of justification for punishing criminals, called the <em class="calibre8">utilitarian</em> and <em class="calibre8">retributivist</em> positions. Utilitarians view criminal law as useful, in that punishing criminals benefits society. Retributivists see the primary role of criminal law as retribution; in other words, criminals are punished because they deserve it.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>功利主义认为，社会应该以促进最大多数人的最大福祉为目标进行组织。在功利主义者看来，刑法主要通过预防犯罪来服务于社会福祉。惩罚罪犯可以通过多种方式预防犯罪。监禁罪犯可以防止其再次犯罪。<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_260" class="calibre4"></a>处决罪犯可以防止他再次犯罪。（这通常被称为<em class="calibre8">限制</em>或<em class="calibre8">无行为能力</em>。）<em class="calibre8">个人威慑</em>或<em class="calibre8">特定威慑</em>认为，一旦某人因犯罪受到惩罚，他或她就不太可能再次犯罪。一般惩罚的威胁——<em class="calibre8">一般威慑</em>——可以阻止人们犯罪。将罪犯置于一个可以接受治疗、咨询和教育的限制性环境中，可以使他们远离犯罪生活；可以使他们<em class="calibre8">改过自新。通过</em><em class="calibre8">谴责</em>，公众对刑事惩罚的了解可以加强人们对刑法行为标准重要性的认识。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Utilitarianism is the theory that society ought to be organized to promote the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Criminal law, in the view of the utilitarian, serves the social good primarily by preventing crime. Punishing criminals may prevent crime in several ways. Imprisoning a criminal prevents him from committing another crime <a class="calibre4"></a>while he is incarcerated; executing a criminal prevents him from ever committing another crime. (This is commonly called <em class="calibre8">restraint</em> or <em class="calibre8">incapacitation</em>.) <em class="calibre8">Individual deterrence</em> or <em class="calibre8">specific deterrence</em> assumes that once someone has been punished for a crime, he or she may be less likely to commit another crime. The threat of punishment in general—<em class="calibre8">general deterrence</em>—discourages people from committing crimes. Placing criminals in a restrictive environment where they can receive treatment, counseling, and education may lead them away from a life of crime; it may <em class="calibre8">rehabilitate</em> them. And public knowledge of criminal punishments reinforces people’s sense of the importance of the standards of behavior of the criminal law, by <em class="calibre8">denunciation</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>让我们先从“改造”说起。刑罚可以通过改变罪犯来预防犯罪。一旦一个人被判有罪，无论是在监狱还是缓刑期间，都可以为其提供咨询、心理治疗、教育或道德榜样，使其从犯罪生活中转变为守法的行为。在二十世纪的大部分时间里，改造理念在刑法中都极其重要，甚至占据主导地位。以改造为目标，刑法和刑罚的重点是罪犯本身，而不是犯罪本身。法官试图根据每个罪犯的改造需求量身定制刑罚，监狱提供了广泛的教育和改造机会，而假释则基于罪犯已经改造的证据。当然，监狱从来都不是真正的治疗中心，也从未提供实现改造理念所需的资源，但至少这一概念是该体系的重要组成部分。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Let’s begin with rehabilitation. Criminal punishment can prevent crime by changing criminals. Once someone has been convicted of a crime, he or she can be given counseling, psychological treatment, education, or moral examples, either in prison or while on probation, to turn the person from a life of crime to law-abiding behavior. The rehabilitative ideal was extremely important, perhaps dominant, in criminal law through most of the twentieth century. With rehabilitation as a goal, criminal law and punishment focused on the criminal, not the crime. Judges attempted to individualize sentences to meet the rehabilitative needs of an individual criminal, prisons offered a wide range of opportunities for education and reform, and release from prison on parole was based on evidence that the convict had been rehabilitated. Of course, prisons were never really treatment centers, and the resources that might have been needed to fulfill the rehabilitative ideal were never provided, but at least the concept was an important part of the system.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>近年来，康复作为刑法目标的地位有所下降，因为批评者认为我们并不清楚哪些措施有效。20世纪70年代一系列广为人知的研究断言，所有康复措施对再犯率（即罪犯重复犯罪的倾向）的影响甚微。某些康复项目在某些情况下可能有效，但我们缺乏确凿的证据来判断哪些项目有效，因此，构建以康复为基础的刑事惩罚体系，往好了说是武断的，往坏了说是缺乏理性的。面对这些证据，以及公众日益增长的对我们需要严厉打击犯罪的担忧，康复作为刑法目标的地位已逐渐下降。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Rehabilitation as a purpose of the criminal law has declined in recent years because its critics argued that we don’t have a good sense of what works. A series of widely publicized studies in the 1970s asserted that all of the efforts at rehabilitation had little effect on rates of recidivism, or criminals’ tendency to repeat their crimes. Some rehabilitative programs might work under some circumstances, but we have no firm basis for knowing which is which, so constructing a system of criminal punishment on rehabilitation is arbitrary at best and irrational at worst. In the face of that evidence and the growing public concern that we needed to get tough on crime, rehabilitation has faded as an objective of criminal law.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>丧失行为能力应该对犯罪有明显的影响：如果我们把罪犯关进监狱，让他们无法再犯罪，犯罪率就会下降。其基本假设是，至少有些罪犯更容易犯罪。我们可能无法改造这些罪犯。<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_261" class="calibre4"></a>惯犯，但我们可以通过将他们从社会中移除（至少在一段时间内）来防止他们犯罪。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Incapacitation ought to have an obvious effect on crime: If we put criminals in prison where they cannot commit more crimes, crime will be reduced. The underlying assumption is that at least some criminals are prone to commit more crimes. We may not be able to rehabilitate these <a class="calibre4"></a>repeat offenders, but we can prevent them from committing crimes by removing them from society, at least for a time.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>失能（incapacitation）的问题是一个类似于康复（viscourtication）的问题的经验问题。我们认为，仅仅因为一些罪犯会犯下更多罪行就判处所有罪犯长期监禁是不公正的，因此，失能需要能够预测哪些人可能成为累犯。法律曾一度试图将这种判断个性化；例如，法官在量刑时会考虑罪犯的背景、教育背景、社会环境，甚至心理特征，以确定其再次犯罪的可能性，从而制定适当的刑罚。近年来，人们开始尝试大规模或系统地预测未来的犯罪行为，更多地关注犯罪的性质和罪犯背景中的客观因素。但与康复一样，该系统的影响力可能超出其所能控制的范围。证据表明，我们无法很好地预测未来的行为；事实上，人们倾向于过度预测犯罪行为，以至于那些不太可能再次犯罪的人被不必要地长期监禁。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The problem with incapacitation is an empirical problem akin to the problem with rehabilitation. We would find it unjust to sentence all criminals to long prison terms just because some of them will commit more crimes, so incapacitation demands the ability to predict who is likely to be a repeat offender. For a time the law attempted to individualize this judgment; judges in sentencing, for example, would consider a criminal’s background, education, social circumstances, and even psychological profile in an attempt to determine how likely he was to commit another crime, and thus craft an appropriate sentence. More recently the attempt has been made to predict future criminality on a large-scale or systematic basis, focusing more on the nature of the crime and objective factors in the offender’s background. But as with rehabilitation, the system’s reach may exceed its grasp. The evidence suggests that we are not in a good position to predict future behavior; in fact, the tendency is to overpredict criminality, so that people who are not likely to commit future crimes are held in prison for unnecessarily long periods of time.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>举报通过强化人们对犯罪行为不法性的看法来减少犯罪。将某一行为定为犯罪并惩罚犯罪者不仅仅是做出道德声明，它还能增强公众守法的倾向。大多数人都希望做正确的事，而公众对刑事处罚的了解会强化他们对正确事物的认知。大多数人也希望得到公平对待；如果他们觉得许多其他人违法却逍遥法外，他们自己也更有可能违法。通过这种间接的方式，刑事程序降低了犯罪的发生率。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Denunciation reduces crime by reinforcing people’s views of the wrongfulness of criminal behavior. Declaring an act criminal and punishing an offender does more than make a moral statement; it strengthens the public’s tendency to be law-abiding. Most people want to do what is right, and public knowledge of criminal punishment reinforces the perception of what is right. Most people also want to be treated fairly; if they have the sense that many other people are getting away with breaking the law, they may be more likely to break the law themselves. In this indirect way, the criminal process reduces the incidence of crime.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>改造、无行为能力和谴责都有其拥护者，但刑法的主要功利主义依据是威慑。威慑假设人们理性行事，权衡其行为的潜在成本和收益。如果社会想要阻止人们采取某些行动，只需增加这些行动的成本即可。将抢劫定为可判处监禁的罪行，可以阻止人们抢劫。对于更严重的违法行为，我们只需加重刑罚即可增强威慑力——入室盗窃可能被判处五年监禁，抢劫可能被判处十年监禁，谋杀可能被判处死刑。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Rehabilitation, incapacitation, and denunciation have their adherents, but the main utilitarian justification of criminal law is deterrence. Deterrence assumes that people act rationally, weighing the potential costs and benefits of what they do. If society wants to prevent people from acting in certain ways, it only has to increase the cost of acting in those ways. Making robbery a crime punishable by imprisonment discourages people from robbing. For behavior that is more wrongful, we have only to increase the penalty to increase the deterrent—burglary may be punishable by five years in prison, robbery by ten years, and murder may involve capital punishment.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>惩罚的威胁具有普遍的威慑力。然而，有些人就是不明白这一点。如果惩罚的威胁不能阻止某人抢劫银行，那么实际入狱或许能起到作用。如果这不起作用，第二次加重刑罚或许能阻止第三次抢劫。这就是“三次”背后的逻辑。<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_262" class="calibre4"></a>“三振出局”法律规定，对犯有三项重罪的罪犯，可判处终身监禁。这种针对潜在惯犯的方式，正是具体的威慑。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The threat of punishment is general deterrence. Some people just don’t get the message, though. If the threat of punishment doesn’t deter someone from robbing a bank, actually spending time in prison for the crime might do so. And if that doesn’t work, increasing the punishment the second time might deter a third robbery. This is the logic behind “three <a class="calibre4"></a>strikes and you’re out” laws, mandating life terms for criminals convicted of three serious crimes. Focusing on the potential repeat offender in this way is specific deterrence.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>威慑作为刑法的基础，直观上是有道理的。如果一位母亲告诉她的孩子，如果他们不停止打架，她就把他们关进房间，惩罚的威胁可能足以阻止孩子们的行为。虽然整个世界更加复杂，但同样的原则似乎也适用；刑事惩罚的威胁具有威慑作用。但这种效果取决于许多因素。首先，虽然刑法通常可以震慑犯罪，但立法者的选择范围比是否制定刑法要窄。相反，他们的选择是是否将某一特定行为定为犯罪，惩罚的严厉程度，以及在执法方面投入多少。然后，这些选择的结果——犯罪的定义和惩罚的威胁——必须有效地传达给潜在的犯罪分子。其次，有些罪犯和某些犯罪行为难以被震慑：精神病患者、精神病患者、一时冲动犯罪者、自以为可以逃脱侦查的罪犯，以及几乎没有其他机会或将逮捕和惩罚视为其生活的一部分的帮派成员，都不太可能被震慑。第三，惩罚的可能性和严厉程度会影响震慑力。如果卖淫被定为犯罪，但警方认为是轻罪，从不逮捕妓女，或者警方执法但法官通常只对妓女处以轻微罚款，那么这项法律将收效甚微。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Deterrence as a basis of criminal law makes intuitive sense. If a mother tells her children that if they don’t stop fighting she will send them to their rooms, the threat of the punishment may be enough to deter the kids’ conduct. Although the world at large is more complicated, the same principle seems to hold; the threat of criminal punishment has a deterrent effect. But the effect depends on a number of factors. First, although criminal law in general deters crime, the choices that lawmakers have are narrower than whether or not to have a criminal law. Instead, the choices are whether to criminalize a particular act, how severely to punish it, and how much to invest in enforcement of the law. Then the results of those choices—the definition of crime and the threat of punishment—must be communicated effectively to potential criminals. Second, some criminals and some crimes cannot easily be deterred: psychopaths, mentally ill persons, people acting under the heat of the moment, criminals who think they can escape detection, and gang members who have few other opportunities or who regard arrest and punishment as an accepted part of their life cycle are not likely to be deterred. Third, the likelihood and severity of punishment affect deterrence. If prostitution is criminalized but the police regard it as a trivial offense and never arrest prostitutes, or if the police do enforce the law but judges routinely impose only a minor fine on prostitutes, the law will have little effect.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这些关于威慑的问题都是实证问题——什么有效，什么无效。威慑作为刑法存在的理由，也存在一个伦理问题，这个问题触及了功利主义方法的核心。刑法的功利主义目标是减少犯罪，它通过威慑犯罪行为来实现这一目标。但威慑也必须符合我们非功利主义的正义观。假设我们担心司机对行人不够谨慎。立法机关可能会颁布一项法规，要求司机在有标记的人行横道上礼让行人。（许多州都有这样的法律。）但如果我们真的想阻止司机粗心大意，我们可以将未礼让行人的刑罚定为20年至终身监禁。当然，这有些极端。我们想要威慑的愿望必须以分寸感来缓和。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These issues about deterrence are empirical questions—what works and what doesn’t. There is also an ethical question about deterrence as a reason for having criminal law that goes to the heart of the utilitarian approach. The utilitarian objective of criminal law is to reduce crime, and it does so by deterring criminal behavior. But deterrence also must accord with our nonutilitarian conceptions of justice. Suppose we are concerned that drivers aren’t being careful enough about pedestrians. The legislature might respond by enacting a statute requiring that drivers yield to pedestrians in marked crosswalks. (Many states have such a law.) But if we really want to deter drivers from being careless, we could make the penalty for failure to yield a prison term of twenty years to life. That’s extreme, of course. Our desire to deter has to be tempered by a sense of proportion.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>正如这一假设所表明的，尽管威慑一直是刑法最重要的功利主义依据，但这并非全部。另一个重要因素是报应主义方法，这种方法在近几十年来获得了越来越多的支持。报应主义者认为，通过刑法进行报应并非复仇，而是<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_263" class="calibre4"></a>正义。有人犯了错，错就应该受到惩罚。哲学家伊曼纽尔·康德曾提出一个著名的假设。想象一个即将解散的岛屿社会，所有居民都离开了家园。如果有人在离开前夕犯下谋杀罪，仍然应该受到惩罚。惩罚没有任何功利主义的正当性；岛民们永远不会再见面，所以惩罚并不能阻止未来的犯罪。但正义要求社会通过惩罚凶手来纠正错误。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As this hypothetical suggests, even though deterrence has been the most important utilitarian justification for criminal law, it is not the whole story. The other important element, which has gained increasing support in recent decades, is a retributivist approach. Retributivists argue that retribution through the criminal law is not vengeance but <a class="calibre4"></a>justice. Someone has committed a wrong, and wrongs should be punished. A famous hypothetical was posed by the philosopher Immanuel Kant. Imagine an island society that was about to disband, with all the inhabitants departing for other places. Someone who commits a murder on the eve of departure still ought to be punished. There is no utilitarian justification for punishment; the islanders never will see each other again, so punishment will not prevent a future crime. But justice demands that the society redress the wrong by punishing the murderer.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>报应主义理论要求我们知道哪些行为是错误的。在很多情况下，我们对此很有信心；没有正当理由或借口的故意杀人总是错误的。报应主义还要求我们对错误进行分级，以便根据犯罪的严重程度进行惩罚，这可能会更加复杂。纵火和持枪抢劫，哪个更严重？卖淫和酒后驾车？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Retributivist theory requires that we know which acts are wrong. In many cases we are confident about this; an intentional killing without justification or excuse is always wrong. Retribution also requires us to grade wrongs, so that a crime is punished in accordance with its severity, and that can be more complicated. Which is worse, arson or armed robbery? Prostitution or drunk driving?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>功利主义的威慑方法与报应主义方法在这一点上相互作用。威慑是将行为定为犯罪以预防犯罪的基础，但报应主义原则要求威慑是公正的。对未礼让行人的行为判处长期监禁，或许可以遏制不良驾驶，但从报应主义的角度来看，这是不公正的，因为它与试图预防的伤害不成比例。同样，如果不仅对罪犯本人，而且对其所有家庭成员都施加惩罚，这当然可以遏制犯罪，但这违反了报应主义的基本原则。正如违法者必须承担刑事责任一样，除非受罚者本身违法，否则不得追究责任。报应主义对威慑的制约也可以增强对法律的尊重，并鼓励守法行为；被认为公正的法律比不公正的法律更有可能被遵守。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The deterrent approach to utilitarianism and the retributivist approach interact at this point. Deterrence is a basis for criminalizing behavior to prevent crime, but retributivist principles require deterrence that is just. Imposing a long prison term for failing to yield to a pedestrian may deter bad driving, but it is unjust on a retributivist basis, in that it is out of proportion to the harm sought to be prevented. Similarly, it would certainly deter crime if punishment were imposed not only on the criminal but also on all members of his or her family, but that would violate a basic retributivist principle. Just as criminal liability is imposed if someone has violated the law, liability may not be imposed unless the person to be punished has violated the law. The retributivist check on deterrence may also enhance respect for the law and encourage law-abiding behavior; a law that is seen to be just is more likely to be obeyed than one that is unjust.</p>

<p class="noindent">每项刑事犯罪都需要犯罪行为（通常仍用拉丁语<em class="calibre8">“actus reus”</em>来指代）和伴随的心理状态（<em class="calibre8">mens rea</em>）。犯罪行为的要件很容易理解，仅在少数情况下受到质疑，但它对刑法的目的有着有趣的反映。要件中的<em class="calibre8">行为</em>要件指的是被告的自愿行为，而<em class="calibre8">犯罪性</em>要件指的是该行为造成的损害。</p><p class="noindent">Every criminal offense requires both a criminal act (often still referred to by the Latin phrase <em class="calibre8">actus reus</em>) and an accompanying state of mind (<em class="calibre8">mens rea</em>). The requirement of a criminal act is easily understood and is contested in only a few cases, but it reflects interestingly on the purposes of criminal law. The <em class="calibre8">act</em> element of the requirement refers to a voluntary action of the defendant, and the <em class="calibre8">criminality</em> element refers to the harm that ensues from the act.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>行为仅仅是身体某个部位的动作。罪犯的手指扣动了扳机，或者她的手从受害者的口袋里掏出了钱包。此时，我们关心的不是行为的后果——受害者的死亡或钱包的价值——而只是<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_264" class="calibre4"></a>与被告人的身体行为本身无关。只要有行为存在，且被告人自愿实施，就足够了。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>An act is simply a movement of a part of the body. The criminal’s finger pulls the trigger on the gun or her hand takes a wallet out of the victim’s pocket. At this point we are not concerned with the consequences of the act—the death of the victim or the value of the wallet—but only <a class="calibre4"></a>with the defendant’s physical act itself. It’s enough that there be an act and that the defendant voluntarily performed it.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>自愿性因素至关重要。假设约翰·多伊正在安静地削苹果，突然癫痫发作。癫痫发作期间，他不自主的肌肉收缩导致他握着刀的手猛地抽出，割断了坐在他旁边的简·罗的喉咙。或者假设多伊在某天晚上起床，在昏迷不醒、梦游的状态下，拿起一把刀，将妻子砍死。这两种情况，多伊都构成犯罪吗？法律说没有，因为多伊的意识并没有引导他做出自愿行为。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The element of voluntariness is essential. Suppose John Doe is quietly peeling an apple when he suddenly has an epileptic seizure. During the seizure, an involuntary muscle contraction causes his hand, which is holding the knife he was using, to jerk out, slashing the throat of Jane Roe, who was sitting next to him. Or suppose one night Doe gets out of bed and, in an unconscious, sleepwalking state, picks up a knife and slashes his wife to death. Has Doe committed a criminal act in either case? The law says no, because Doe’s conscious mind has not directed a voluntary act.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>要求自愿行为如何实现刑法的目的？有时有人认为，我们无法阻止非自愿行为，因此惩罚它们毫无意义；刑事制裁的威胁并不能阻止癫痫患者发作。但这不完全正确。我们无法阻止梦游者梦游，但我们可以阻止他进入可能出现危险的境地；或许，刑事惩罚的威胁会鼓励梦游者锁好卧室门，并将尖锐物品放在够不着的地方，甚至鼓励他们寻求治疗。要求自愿行为的一个更重要的原因是报应主义。刑事惩罚的实施是因为罪犯在道德上做了错事。只有当罪犯选择造成伤害——即自愿行为——时，惩罚他才是公正的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>How does requiring a voluntary act fulfill the purposes of criminal law? Sometimes it is argued that we can’t deter involuntary acts, so there is no point in punishing them; the threat of a criminal sanction cannot prevent the epileptic from having a seizure. But that’s not exactly right. We can’t prevent the somnambulist from sleepwalking, but we can provide a disincentive for him to be in potentially dangerous situations when he might do so; perhaps the threat of criminal punishment will encourage sleepwalkers to keep their bedroom doors locked and keep sharp objects out of reach, or even to seek treatment for the affliction. An even more important reason to require a voluntary act is retributivist. Criminal punishments are exacted because the criminal has done something wrong in a moral sense. Only where the criminal has chosen to commit harm—that is, has acted voluntarily—is it just to punish him.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>自愿性问题在一些比梦游更常见的案例中出现。许多法规惩罚简单的持有毒品或盗窃工具的行为。即使法规没有明确规定，这也意味着自愿持有或维持持有。如果有人把一包海洛因塞进你的口袋，警察随后立即找到了它，你就不会犯持有非法毒品的罪，因为你不是自愿持有的。然而，政府能够以持有毒品为由起诉人们是有用的，因为证明持有毒品通常比证明使用、购买或销售毒品更容易。如果你持有毒品，并且可以合理地推断你是自愿获得毒品的，或者知道自己持有毒品的时间足够长，并且有机会摆脱它们，那么以持有毒品为由惩罚你是合理的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Voluntariness as an issue arises in a few cases more common than sleepwalking. Many statutes punish simple possession, of drugs or of burglary tools, for example. Even if the statute doesn’t say so expressly, this means voluntarily coming into possession or maintaining possession. If someone slips a packet of heroin into your pocket and the police immediately thereafter find it, you are not guilty of possession of an illegal drug because you did not possess it voluntarily. It is useful for the government to be able to prosecute people for possession, though, because it is usually easier to prove possession than use, purchase, or sale. If you have the drugs and it is reasonable to infer that you either acquired them voluntarily or knew you had them for a sufficient period of time in which you had a chance to get rid of them, it makes sense to punish you for having them.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如果犯罪者自愿执行了部分（而非全部）犯罪所需的步骤，也可以满足自愿性要求。假设一名极度疲劳的卡车司机在漫长的一天结束后继续驾驶，在驾驶时睡着了，并撞倒了一名行人。该司机是否构成刑事杀人罪？撞倒了<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_265" class="calibre4"></a>撞倒行人并非自愿行为，但疲劳驾驶继续驾驶则属于自愿行为，因此满足了行为要求。接下来的问题在于杀人罪的程度。司机可能会辩称，他应该只承担过失杀人罪的责任，因为他并非有意撞倒行人，即使他一开始就可能鲁莽驾驶。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The voluntariness requirement can also be met if the criminal voluntarily performed some but not all of the steps necessary to complete the offense. Suppose a deeply fatigued truck driver continues to drive at the end of a very long day, falls asleep at the wheel, and runs over a pedestrian. Has the driver committed a criminal homicide? Running over the <a class="calibre4"></a>pedestrian was not a voluntary act, but continuing to drive while tired was, so the act requirement has been satisfied. The issue then becomes the degree of homicide. The driver might argue that he should only be liable for negligent homicide (manslaughter) because he didn’t intend to hit the pedestrian, even though he may have been reckless in driving in the first place.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>美国最高法院在20世纪60年代的两起案件中将自愿原则宪法化，即<em class="calibre8">罗宾逊诉加利福尼亚州案</em>（1962年）和<em class="calibre8">鲍威尔诉德克萨斯州案</em>（1968年）。加利福尼亚州颁布了一项法规，规定吸毒成瘾者构成刑事犯罪，但在<em class="calibre8">罗宾逊案</em>中，法院裁定该法规违反了第八修正案中关于残酷和不寻常惩罚的条款。州不能因为某人吸毒成瘾而对其进行宪法惩罚；成瘾是一种疾病，因此患有成瘾的人并非自愿行为。然而，<em class="calibre8">鲍威尔</em>提出了该原则的局限性。莱罗伊·鲍威尔因在公共场所醉酒而被定罪，并以酗酒为由进行辩护。法院表示，这次情况有所不同。鲍威尔实施了一项行为——在公共场所醉酒——因此他并非仅仅因为其身份而受到惩罚。尽管他是一名酗酒者，但他应该采取措施控制由其疾病引发的行为。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The U.S. Supreme Court constitutionalized the doctrine of voluntariness in pair of cases in the 1960s, <em class="calibre8">Robinson v. California</em> (1962) and <em class="calibre8">Powell v. Texas</em> (1968). California enacted a statute making it a criminal offense to be a narcotics addict, but in <em class="calibre8">Robinson</em> the Court held that the statute violated the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment. A state cannot constitutionally punish someone for having the status of being an addict; addiction is an illness, so one who suffers from it has not committed a voluntary act. <em class="calibre8">Powell</em> suggested the limit of the principle, however. Leroy Powell was convicted of being intoxicated in a public place and pleaded the disease of alcoholism as a defense. This was different, the Court said. Powell had committed an act—being drunk in a public place—so he was not simply being punished for his status. Although he was an alcoholic, he should take measures to control the conduct that flowed from his disease.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如果法律要求采取行动，那么不采取行动就足够了吗？1964年，纽约市发生了一起臭名昭著的事件，年轻女子凯蒂·吉诺维斯在半小时内遭到残忍袭击并被杀害，当时附近有38名居民在自家公寓的窗户外观看和聆听。没有一个人伸出援手，甚至没有报警。这些人是否应该因为没有伸出援手而承担刑事责任？法律的答案是否定的。传统上，支持这一观点的理由有两个。一个是实际原因。很难证明每个旁观者对吉诺维斯的死亡负有多大责任。另一个是原则原因，基于不受政府要求约束的权利。政府或许可以因为你做了坏事而惩罚你，但不应该因为你明显没有做好事而施加刑事制裁这种极端措施。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If the law requires an act, is failure to act enough? In a notorious incident in New York City in 1964, Kitty Genovese, a young woman, was brutally attacked and murdered over the course of a half hour as thirty-eight nearby residents watched and listened from their apartment windows. None of them came to her aid or even called the police. Are any of them criminally liable for failing to help? The law’s answer is no. Traditionally two reasons are offered for this position. One reason is practical. It’s hard to prove how much each of the bystanders contributed to Genovese’s death. The other reason is principled and is based on the right to be left alone from demands by the government. The government may be able to punish you for doing harm, but it should not apply the extreme measure of a criminal sanction for affirmatively failing to do good.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>不作为不承担责任这一规则也存在例外。最突出的是，一些法规规定了作为的义务。不缴纳税款或不停车在自己所涉及的交通事故现场，可能被定性为不作为而非作为，但仍然构成犯罪。此外，处于特定地位关系中的人必须履行这种关系中的责任。父母不能眼睁睁地看着孩子挨饿，然后又以自己只是没有作为为由，为刑事疏忽的起诉辩护。<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_266" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There are exceptions to the rule that one is not liable for failing to act. Most prominently, some statutes create duties to act. Failing to pay your taxes or to stop at the scene of a traffic accident in which you are involved may be characterized as inaction, not action, but it still is criminal. Also, people in certain status relationships have to fulfill the responsibilities of the relationship. A parent cannot allow his child to starve and then defend a prosecution of criminal neglect by saying all he did was fail to act.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“actus reus”中的“reus”部分要求行为具有犯罪性质。这将要求从行为和自愿扩展到伤害。法律不会惩罚所有行为，只惩罚那些构成犯罪的行为，即那些不法行为并对社会造成危害的行为。在某些情况下，伤害是直接且明显的；在凶杀案中，伤害是人员死亡。在其他情况下，伤害是潜在的，而不是直接的。醉酒驾驶者可能不会在第一次伤害他人，但其造成伤害的可能性足够大，因此在伤害发生之前对其进行惩罚是有益且公平的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The “reus” portion of “actus reus” requires that the act be of a criminal nature. This expands the requirement beyond act and voluntariness to include harm. The law doesn’t punish all acts, only those that are criminal in that they are wrongful and cause harm to society. In some cases the harm is immediate and obvious; in a homicide case, the harm is the death of a human being. In others the harm is potential rather than immediate. A driver who is intoxicated may not injure someone the first time, but the potential for harm is sufficiently great that it is useful and fair to punish the conduct before the harm occurs.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>假设一群猎人在鹿季的第一天在树林里打猎。猎人1（我们叫他该隐）正要射杀一只鹿，这时他看到他最大的敌人，受害者1，也在外面打猎。该隐将目标从鹿转移到受害者1，开枪将其击毙。与此同时，猎人2（亚伯）瞄准一头鹿，却射偏了；他的子弹掠过鹿，击中并击毙了受害者2。受害者2当时正在树林里靠近鹿的地方行走，但亚伯却看不见他。谋杀的经典定义是“预谋恶意地非法杀害人类”。该隐和亚伯犯了谋杀罪吗？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Suppose, for example, that a group of hunters are in the woods hunting on the first day of deer season. Hunter #1 (call him Cain) is about to shoot at a deer when he sees his worst enemy, Victim #1, also out hunting. Cain shifts his aim from the deer to Victim #1, shooting and killing her. Meanwhile Hunter #2 (Abel) aims, fires at a deer, and misses; his bullet travels past the deer and strikes and kills Victim #2, who was walking in the woods near the deer but out of sight of Abel. The classic definition of murder is “the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought.” Are Cain and Abel guilty of murder?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>该隐犯下了被禁止的行为——非法杀害他人。（该行为是非法的，因为他不是因公杀人的警察或士兵。）他还通过“预谋”的行为满足了犯罪的心理要件或犯罪<em class="calibre8">意图</em>。正如我们在讨论杀人罪时会看到的那样，预谋并不要求杀人有计划，只要求有意图，而该隐显然是故意杀害受害者。请注意，心理要件是意图，而不是动机。该隐有杀害受害者的动机——她是他最大的敌人——但如果他不认识受害者，只是一时兴起开枪打死了她，或者即使他杀人的动机是好的，他也会同样有罪，这就是为什么安乐死可以作为杀人罪来惩罚。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Cain has committed the prohibited act—the unlawful killing of another human being. (The act is unlawful because he wasn’t a police officer or soldier killing in the line of duty.) He has also satisfied the mental element of the crime, or the <em class="calibre8">mens rea</em>, by acting with “malice aforethought.” As we will see when we get to homicide, malice aforethought does not require that the killing be planned, only that it be intended, and Cain certainly intended to kill his victim. Note that the mental requirement is intention, not motive. Cain had a motive to kill his victim—she was his worst enemy—but he would have been just as guilty if he didn’t know the victim and had shot her on a whim, or even if he had killed with a good motive, which is why euthanasia can be punished as homicide.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>那么阿贝尔呢？他甚至不知道受害者在场。他同样犯下了非法杀害他人的违禁行为，但他缺乏所需的精神状态；他的行为并非“预谋恶意”。虽然预谋恶意是杀人罪的独有要求，但犯罪行为必须伴随某种精神状态，这几乎是所有犯罪的共同要求。<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_267" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>What about Abel, who didn’t even know his victim was there? He, too, has committed the prohibited act by unlawfully killing another human being, but he lacks the required mental state; he didn’t act “with malice aforethought.” Although the requirement of malice is unique to homicide, the requirement that a certain state of mind accompany the criminal act is common to almost all crimes.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>结合刑法的目的来思考罪责要求。要求一个人有“犯罪心理”才构成犯罪并不一定符合功利主义的目标，其中最重要的就是威慑力。有些人认为，法律不能也不应该威慑那些无意做错事的人；例如，我们无法阻止阿贝尔造成他从未想过的结果。但这并不完全正确。即使阿贝尔并非有意射杀受害者，他也可能只是疏忽了，而刑事处罚的威胁可以鼓励人们更加谨慎。此外，起诉阿贝尔通常可以震慑犯罪，因为被起诉杀人罪的人越多，杀人案可能就越少。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Think about the culpability requirement in light of the purposes of criminal law. Requiring that someone have a “guilty mind” to be a criminal does not necessarily serve utilitarian objectives, the most important of which is deterrence. Some people argue that the law cannot and should not deter people who didn’t mean to do anything wrong; we cannot deter Abel, for example, from causing a result that he never intended. But that’s not quite right. Even if Abel did not mean to shoot his victim he may have been careless, and the threat of a criminal penalty can encourage people to be more careful. Moreover, prosecuting Abel generally deters criminality in that the more people are prosecuted for homicide, the fewer homicides there are likely to be.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>但当亚伯并非有意为之时，惩罚他似乎并不公正。刑事定罪是一件严肃的事情，因为将某人贴上罪犯的标签会给他带来耻辱，并可能随之而来的是严厉的惩罚。我们希望在罪犯犯下道德错误的情况下保留这种耻辱和惩罚。即使惩罚无辜者可以震慑犯罪，报应理论也对震慑力进行了限制；即使我们出于功利主义和报应性的原因惩罚有罪者，惩罚无辜者也是被禁止的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But it seems unjust to punish Abel when he didn’t mean to do anything wrong. A criminal conviction is a serious thing, because a stigma attaches to labeling someone as criminal and a severe punishment is likely to follow. We want to preserve that stigma and punishment for situations in which the criminal has acted wrongly in a moral sense. Even if punishing the innocent would deter crime, retributive theory places a limit on deterrence; even if we punish the guilty for utilitarian and retributive reasons, punishing the innocent is prohibited.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>该隐有意杀死受害者，亚伯完全无罪，因为他不知道受害者在附近，但在许多情况下，确定一个人犯罪所需的精神状态是一件非常复杂的事情。传统上，对刑事犯罪的定义借鉴了一系列令人困惑的描述精神状态的词语：<em class="calibre8">预谋恶意、故意、故意、恶意</em>、粗心等等。许多司法管辖区都遵循《模范刑法典》的尝试，将精神状态的定义限制为四种：<em class="calibre8">故意</em>（有时称为<em class="calibre8">有意</em>）、<em class="calibre8">明知、鲁莽</em>和<em class="calibre8">疏忽</em>。一系列假设有助于我们探索这些差异。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Cain meant to kill his victim, and Abel was completely blameless because he didn’t know his victim was in the area, but in many cases determining the mental state that is required to make someone a criminal is a much more complicated thing. Definitions of criminal offenses traditionally drew on a confusing range of words describing mental states: <em class="calibre8">with malice aforethought, with intent to, willfully, maliciously, carelessly</em>, and so on. Many jurisdictions have followed the Model Penal Code’s attempt to clear up this confusion by limiting the definitions of mental states to four: <em class="calibre8">purposely</em> (sometimes called <em class="calibre8">intentionally</em>), <em class="calibre8">knowingly, recklessly</em>, and <em class="calibre8">negligently</em>. A series of hypotheticals helps us explore the differences.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>当某人“有意识地”以从事某种性质的行为或造成某种结果为目的时，他的行为就是故意的。该隐故意杀死受害者，因为他开枪就是为了达到这个目的。然而，假设他在一群旁观者中看到了他的敌人，于是他用自动武器开火，向人群中扫射，将他们全部杀死。该隐故意杀死了他的敌人，但只是明知故犯地杀死了其他人。明知故犯意味着该隐“几乎确信”他的行为会导致被禁止的结果，或者他意识到自己行为的性质或情况。即使杀死旁观者并非他的“有意识的目的”，但由于他具有正常的心智能力，他知道当他向人群开枪时，其中一些人会被杀死。故意和故意之间可能没有太大的区别。<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_268" class="calibre4"></a>或明知故犯，但它允许立法机关在定义犯罪时对想要实施犯罪行为的人进行更严厉的惩罚，而对仅仅知道其行为将导致犯罪损害的人则进行更严厉的惩罚。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Someone acts purposely when it is their “conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature or to cause such a result.” Cain kills his victim purposely because that is what he wants to accomplish by firing his gun. Suppose, though, that he sees his enemy among a group of bystanders and opens fire with an automatic weapon, spraying the group with bullets and killing them all. Cain has purposely killed his enemy but only knowingly killed the others. To act knowingly means that Cain is “practically certain” his conduct will cause a prohibited result, or that he is aware of the nature or circumstances of his conduct. Even though it is not his “conscious object” to kill the bystanders, since he is of normal mental faculties he knows that some of them will be killed when he fires on the group. There may not be much of a distinction between purposely <a class="calibre4"></a>or knowingly, but it permits the legislature in defining crimes to punish more severely someone who wants to accomplish a criminal act from someone who just knows that criminal harm will follow from his act.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在我们最初的假设中，阿贝尔在森林中一个著名的狩猎区，开枪前仔细地环顾四周，但仍然不知道他的受害者就在鹿附近。假设他看到受害者站在鹿附近，并且知道自己的枪法不太好，但还是开了枪。那么他的行动就是鲁莽的。鲁莽行事的人“有意识地忽视重大且不合理的风险”。他知道自己可能会击中受害者而不是鹿；因为他知道自己可能会击中，所以他有意识地忽视了风险，但因为他实际上并不确定自己会击中，所以他并没有明知故犯。这样做的风险很大，因为他的枪法不太好；这样做也是不合理的，因为没有令人信服的理由说明为什么他不能等一等再射击。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In our original hypothetical Abel was in a well-known hunting area in the woods, looked around carefully before he fired, but still did not know his victim was near the deer. Suppose instead that he saw the victim standing near the deer and knew he wasn’t a very good shot but fired anyway. Then he would have acted recklessly. Someone who acts recklessly “consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk.” He knew he might hit the victim and not the deer; because he knew he might, he consciously disregarded the risk, but because he wasn’t practically certain that he would, he did not act knowingly. The risk of doing so was substantial because he was not a good shot and unjustifiable because there was no compelling reason why he couldn’t have waited to shoot.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最后，假设阿贝尔冲进空地，没有看到受害者站在鹿附近。尽管他应该知道附近可能有其他猎人，但在射击前却没有环顾四周。他并没有刻意忽视击中他人的风险，因此他的行为并非鲁莽；但他应该意识到风险的存在，因此他的行为属于疏忽或粗心。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Finally, suppose Abel didn’t see the victim standing near the deer because he rushed into the clearing and, although he should have known that other hunters might be in the area, failed to look around before shooting. He did not consciously disregard the risk of hitting someone else, so he wasn’t reckless; he should have been aware of the risk, however, so he was negligent, or careless.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这四种心理状态按其需要预防的社会危害程度和行为的道德不正当性依次递减。从功利主义的角度来看，预防和惩罚蓄意杀人者比鲁莽杀人者更重要，而鲁莽杀人者比粗心杀人者更重要。从报应主义的角度来看，有意杀人的人比不顾他人风险而杀人的人更应受到道德谴责，而后者又比不了解自身风险的人更应受到谴责。区分这些心理状态使我们能够确定哪些行为比其他行为更具犯罪性，并对更严重的行为施以更严厉的惩罚。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The four mental states are in descending order in terms of the social harm to be prevented and the moral wrongfulness of the conduct. From the utilitarian perspective, it is more important to prevent and punish deliberate killers rather than reckless ones and reckless killers more than careless ones. From a retributivist perspective, someone who means to kill is more worthy of moral condemnation than someone who kills when disregarding the risk to others, who is in turn more blameworthy than someone who doesn’t know of the risk she is creating. Distinguishing these mental states allows us to define which behavior is more criminal than others and to punish more severely the more serious behavior.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>回到最初的假设，阿贝尔甚至没有因为看到被他射杀的人而疏忽大意。大多数人会说阿贝尔没有犯罪，因为他并非有意为之。假设在去狩猎的途中，阿贝尔因超速被拦下，在限速65英里/小时的区域以80英里/小时的速度行驶。阿贝尔向法院提起诉讼，以对抗超速​​罚单，理由是他不知道自己的车速表有缺陷，读数比原先低了15英里/小时。阿贝尔能否成功地辩称，由于他并非故意、明知、鲁莽或疏忽地行事，他缺乏构成超速罪所需的精神状态？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Return to Abel in the original hypothetical, in which he was not even careless in seeing the person he shot. Most people would say Abel has not committed a crime because he didn’t mean to do anything wrong. Suppose that en route to his hunting trip Abel was stopped for speeding, going 80 mph in a 65 mph zone. Abel goes to court to fight his speeding ticket on the basis that, unknown to him, his speedometer was defective so that it read 15 mph too low. Can Abel successfully argue that he lacked the required mental state for the crime of speeding, because he did not act purposely, knowingly, recklessly, or carelessly?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这是一个法律解释的问题。立法机关在制定交通法规时，究竟想要要求什么样的心理状态？一般来说，<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_269" class="calibre4"></a>如果判定某人超速行驶不需要证明上述四种心理状态中的一种，而不是判定某人有其他罪行（如杀人）的罪名，我们就不会感到太生气。虽然从报复性的角度看，阿贝尔没有注意到自己的车速表坏了可能并没有做错什么，但从功利主义的角度看，制裁这种行为还是有道理的。检察官不可能在每一个案件中都证明交通违法者知道自己在超速，他的车速表正常，或者他知道或应该知道车速表不工作。因此，我们可能会认定阿贝尔<em class="calibre8">负有严格责任</em>，或者无过错责任，因为他只涉及轻微违法行为，而不构成严重犯罪。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This is an issue of statutory interpretation. What mental state did the legislature intend to require when it enacted the traffic laws? Generally, <a class="calibre4"></a>we would be much less offended if proof of one of the four mental states was not required to convict someone of speeding than of some other crime, such as homicide. Although on retributive grounds Abel may not have done anything wrong by failing to notice that his speedometer was broken, on utilitarian grounds it makes sense to sanction that behavior anyway. It would be impossible for the prosecutor to prove in every case that a traffic offender knew he was speeding, that his speedometer was working, or that he knew or should have known it was not working. Accordingly, we might find Abel <em class="calibre8">strictly liable</em>, or liable without being at fault, because only a minor violation is involved and not a serious crime.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>严格刑事责任的另一种形式是<em class="calibre8">替代责任</em>，即一个人要为另一个人犯下的罪行负责。企业主通常要为其雇员在工作范围内实施的行为承担替代责任。如果雇员贴错包装肉类的标签、向未成年人出售香烟或倾倒有毒废物，雇主可能不仅要受到刑事处罚，还要承担刑事处罚。（请注意，雇主承担替代责任这一事实并不能免除雇员的主要责任。从法律上讲，雇主和雇员都有责任，但实际上，通常只有雇主被起诉。）同样，汽车的车主要对收到的任何停车罚单负责，无论当时她是否在驾驶汽车。与严格责任一样，替代责任更多是针对相对较轻的监管违法行为，而不是重大违法行为。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Another form of strict criminal liability is <em class="calibre8">vicarious liability</em>, in which one person is liable for a crime committed by another person. The owner of a business often is vicariously liable for acts committed by her employees in the scope of their employment. If an employee mislabels packaged meat, sells cigarettes to a minor, or dumps toxic waste, the employer may be subject to the criminal penalty as well as the employee. (Note that the fact that the employer is vicariously liable does not relieve the employee of primary responsibility. As a matter of law, both employer and employee are liable, but as a practical matter, often the employer is the only one prosecuted.) Similarly, the owner of a car is liable for any parking tickets it receives, whether she was operating the car at the time or not. As with strict liability, vicarious liability is more often imposed for relatively minor, regulatory offenses than for major crimes.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>公司是否要为犯罪行为承担责任？在早期普通法中，答案是否定的。用一句老话说，公司“无灵魂可诅咒，无肉体可踢”，因此缺乏人类的属性，它既不能形成犯罪意图，也不会受到惩罚。随着时间的推移，法院越来越认识到，公司刑事责任是一种特殊的替代责任。由于大公司权力分散，对于某些犯罪行为，只有公司本身需要承担责任，而不是任何个别员工，而将多人参与的行为单挑出一名员工是不公平的。将公司定为罪犯还会激励高层管理人员控制下属的行为，并给适当的实体——即代表其实施犯罪行为的公司——蒙上污名。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Can a corporation be liable for a crime? In the early common law, the answer was no. In an old phrase, the corporation had “no soul to damn, no body to kick,” and therefore lacking the attributes of a human being, it could neither form criminal intent nor be punished. Over time the courts have increasingly recognized that corporate criminal liability is a special form of vicarious liability. Because authority is so diffused in a large corporation, for some crimes only the corporation itself is liable, not any individual employees, and it would be unfair to single out one employee for an act participated in by many. Making the corporation the criminal also provides an incentive to top management to control the actions of their underlings, and it stigmatizes the proper entity—the corporation on whose behalf the criminal acts were carried out.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>假设被告辩称，他对事态的判断存在错误，从而否定了犯罪的心理因素。律师通常会将两者区分为法律错误和事实错误。法律错误规则可以用一句著名的格言来概括：“不知法不免责”。如果酒吧老板安装了一台视频扑克机，认为它是合法的常规电子游戏，但实际上它是一种非法赌博设备，那么他仍然违反了法律。从<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_270" class="calibre4"></a>从报应性角度来看，他并没有做错任何事；他不知道自己的行为是违法的，所以他不应该受到惩罚。但允许以对法律的无知作为辩护，可能会引发许多复杂的问题和虚假的辩护，而且也不会激励人们去了解哪些行为是违法的。因此，不知道该行为是犯罪行为通常并不能成为借口。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Suppose that a defendant argues that he has made a mistake about the state of affairs that negates the mental element of the crime. Often lawyers separate these into mistake of law and mistake of fact. The rule on mistake of law is summed up in the well-known maxim “Ignorance of the law is no excuse.” If the owner of a bar installs a video poker machine believing that it is permitted as a regular video game, but it is actually an illegal gambling device, he has still violated the law. From a <a class="calibre4"></a>retributive perspective he hasn’t done anything wrong here; he did not know that his conduct was wrongful, so he doesn’t deserve to be punished. But permitting ignorance of the law as a defense might open up the floodgates to many complicated issues and spurious defenses, and it would not provide an incentive for people to find out what behavior is illegal. So not knowing that behavior is criminal ordinarily does not provide an excuse.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>假设错误并非关于行为本身的合法性，而是关于导致行为非法的事实之一。如果错误的结果是被告不具备违反犯罪构成要件之一所需的精神状态，则被告不构成犯罪。如果阿贝尔在打猎时误以为一个穿棕色外套的人是鹿并射杀了他，那么阿贝尔并不构成故意杀人罪，因为他并非有意杀人。在这种情况下，即使他的信念不合理，他也没有犯下需要故意或明知的罪行；唯一的问题是他的主观​​精神状态。但是，他可能粗心地认为那个人是鹿，在这种情况下他可能被判过失杀人罪。而他信念的合理性与确定他当时的真实精神状态有关。如果阿贝尔作证说他认为穿着亮橙色外套的人是一只鹿，陪审团很可能会对他的证词持高度怀疑态度——尤其是如果受害者原来是阿贝尔最大的敌人。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Suppose that the mistake is not about the legality of the act itself but about one of the facts that renders the act illegal. Where the effect of the mistake is that the defendant did not have the mental state required to violate one of the elements of the offense, the defendant has not committed the offense. If Abel is hunting and shoots a person in a brown coat, mistakenly thinking the person is a deer, Abel has not committed intentional homicide because he did not intend to kill a human being. Here even if his belief is unreasonable, he has not committed a crime that requires intent or knowledge; the only issue is his subjective mental state. However, he may have been careless in thinking the person was a deer, in which case he could be convicted of negligent homicide. And the reasonableness of his belief is relevant to determining what his state of mind really was. If Abel testifies that he thought the person wearing a bright orange coat was a deer, the jury may well be highly skeptical of his testimony—especially if the victim turns out to be Abel’s worst enemy.</p>

<p class="noindent">当某人因犯罪受审时，控方首先会陈述其观点。在控方陈述过程中，被告有机会通过盘问控方证人来找出控方论点中的漏洞。然后，被告有机会陈述自己的观点。简而言之，控方就像在说：“是你干的。” 被告可以用两种方式回应：“不”或“是的，但是”。（正如我们将在<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.n0125" href="#text/part0015_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-9" class="calibre4">第九章</a>中看到的，如果控方未能排除合理怀疑地证明被告有罪，被告无需提供任何证据即可被宣告无罪，而这正是我们对抗式程序及其无罪推定原则的要求。）</p><p class="noindent">When someone is put on trial for a crime, the prosecution presents its side of the case first. During the presentation of the prosecution’s case, the defendant has a chance to poke holes in the prosecution’s case by cross-examining the prosecution’s witnesses. Then the defendant has the opportunity to present her own side of the story. In short, the prosecution is saying, “You did it.” The defendant can respond in one of two ways: By saying “No” or by saying “Yes, but.” (As we will see in <a href="#text/part0015_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-9" class="calibre4">Chapter 9</a>, the defendant can be acquitted without offering any evidence if the prosecution has failed to prove her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, which is a requirement of our adversary process with its presumption of innocence.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>被告对控方指控的“否”回应，本质上意味着被告没有犯下被指控的罪行。“是的，但是”的回应则有所不同。辩方不是反驳控方的指控，而是引入一些新的因素来为被告开脱。刑法规定了两种“是的，但是”的辩护，或理由<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_271" class="calibre4"></a>我们可能不想惩罚那些已经满足犯罪要素的人：<em class="calibre8">理由</em>和<em class="calibre8">借口</em>。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The defendant’s “No” in response to the prosecution case essentially means that the defendant didn’t commit the crime charged. “Yes, but” responses are different. Instead of rebutting the prosecution’s claims, the defense introduces some new factor that exonerates the defendant. Criminal law has identified two types of “Yes, but” defenses, or reasons <a class="calibre4"></a>that we might not want to punish someone who has satisfied the elements of an offense: <em class="calibre8">justifications</em> and <em class="calibre8">excuses</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>刑法将某种行为定义为犯罪，是因为该行为在道德过错和社会危害方面都是错误的。但有时犯罪行为看似无罪；由于特殊情况，我们愿意容忍甚至鼓励那些原本构成犯罪的行为。当这种情况发生时，我们会说该行为是正当的，被告无罪。通常，正当性涉及在两种罪恶之间做出选择，当一个人选择两种罪恶中较轻的一种时，她不应该因此受到惩罚。正当性包括自卫、根据官方授权行事以及其他涉及两种罪恶选择的情况。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Criminal law defines an act as criminal because it is wrong, both in terms of moral fault and social harm. But sometimes committing a crime doesn’t seem wrong; because of special circumstances, doing something that otherwise would be criminal is an act that we are willing to tolerate or even want to encourage. When this occurs, we say that the act is justified and the defendant is not guilty of a crime. Usually justifications involve a choice among evils, and when someone chooses the lesser of two evils, she should not be punished for doing so. Justifications include self-defense, acting under official authority, and other circumstances that involve a choice of evils.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>有时，犯罪行为本身并无正当理由，但案件中仍有一些因素令我们难以追究刑事责任。罪犯的行为本身并不正确，但某些特殊情况表明，她不可能做得更好。在这种情况下，罪犯可以免责。这些免责理由包括精神障碍、醉酒和胁迫。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At other times a criminal act is not justified, but there is still something about the case that makes us uneasy about imposing criminal liability. What the offender did was not the right thing to do, but some special circumstances suggest that she couldn’t be expected to do any better. In those circumstances the offender is excused.

<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>要了解何时自卫是正当的，请考虑一下“地铁治安维持者”伯恩哈德·戈茨的故事。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To understand when self-defense is justified, consider the story of the “subway vigilante,” Bernhard Goetz.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>圣诞节前夕的一个周六下午，四个年轻人——达里尔·卡贝、特洛伊·坎蒂、詹姆斯·拉姆瑟和巴里·艾伦——登上了纽约的一列地铁。这四个人可不是什么乖巧的孩子；拉姆瑟和卡贝手里拿着螺丝刀，他们用螺丝刀撬开了电子游戏的投币箱。戈茨在第十四街站登上了地铁。他也不是完全无辜的；他的腰带上挂着一把上了膛的.38口径手枪，而且他没有持枪证。自从在一次抢劫中受伤后，他已经非法持枪三年了。此前，他曾两次仅仅通过展示枪支就成功击退了袭击者。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On a Saturday afternoon just before Christmas four youths—Darryl Cabey, Troy Canty, James Ramseur, and Barry Allen—boarded a New York City subway train. The four were not sweet young boys; Ramseur and Cabey had screwdrivers with them, which they used to break into the coin boxes of video games. Goetz boarded the train at the 14th Street Station. He was not a complete innocent, either; he was carrying a loaded.38 caliber pistol in a waistband holster, and he did not have a license for the gun, which he had been carrying illegally for three years since he had been injured in a mugging. Twice before he had successfully warded off attackers simply by displaying the gun.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>坎蒂和艾伦走到戈茨面前说：“给我五美元。”坎蒂和其他人都没拿出武器。戈茨说，他从坎蒂脸上的笑容“知道”他们想“跟我玩”。（所有这些都来自戈茨后来的供词。）戈茨知道他们都没有枪，但之前的抢劫经历让他害怕被“致残”。坎蒂再次要钱时，戈茨站起身，拔出枪，从左到右“划出一道弧线”。他打算“杀死他们，伤害他们，让他们尽可能地受苦”。他依次向每个年轻人开枪，瞄准他们的身体中心。达里尔·卡贝假装自己不和其他人在一起，站着不动，手里抓着地铁手带，但戈茨还是朝他开了枪。戈茨一枪打完每个年轻人后，检查了一下他们的状况。<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_272" class="calibre4"></a>看到卡贝伤势似乎不重，戈茨说：“你看起来没事，再来一枪。” 然后又开了一枪，卡贝的脊髓被打断了。戈茨在供词中补充道，如果他当时“更有自制力”，他“就会把枪管抵在卡贝的额头上开枪”，如果不是子弹用完，他“会一次又一次地开枪”。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Canty and Allen approached Goetz and said, “Give me five dollars.” Neither Canty nor any of the others displayed a weapon. Goetz said that he “knew” from the smile on Canty’s face that they wanted to “play with me.” (All of this is from Goetz’s subsequent confession.) Goetz knew none of them had a gun, but his prior mugging made him afraid of being “maimed.” When Canty asked for money again, Goetz stood up, pulled his gun, and established “a pattern of fire” from left to right. He intended to “murder them, to hurt them, to make them suffer as much as possible.” He shot each youth in turn, aiming for the center of their bodies. Darryl Cabey pretended that he wasn’t with the others and stood still, holding on to one of the subway hand straps, but Goetz fired at him anyway. After Goetz had shot each one, he checked on their condition. <a class="calibre4"></a>Seeing that Cabey seemed not seriously hurt, Goetz said “[You] seem to be all right, here’s another,” and fired another shot that severed Cabey’s spinal cord. In his confession Goetz added that if he had had more “self-control,” he “would have put the barrel against Cabey’s forehead and fired,” and had he not run out of bullets, he “would have shot them again, and again, and again.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>戈茨被指控谋杀未遂、袭击、鲁莽危害和非法持有枪支，并以自卫为由进行辩护（<em class="calibre8">人民诉戈茨案</em>，1986 年）。让我们首先考虑一组假设的事实。首先假设其中一个年轻人从口袋里掏出一把枪，指着戈茨，喊道：“我要打爆你的头！”戈茨迅速做出反应，掏出自己的左轮手枪，开枪打死了袭击者。戈茨满足了犯罪的所有要件；他故意杀害了他人。然而，基于这些事实，我们会说戈茨是正当的，因为他的行为明显是出于自卫。允许人们保护自己可能是有用的，因为它可以阻止小混混袭击地铁乘客。从道德角度来看，这似乎也是正确的。戈茨有权享有人身安全，并且当这项权利受到威胁时，他应该能够保护这项权利。他面临的威胁迫在眉睫，而且十分严重，除了自卫或死亡，他别无选择。如果威胁的伤害不那么严重（“把钱给我，不然我就打你”），或者不那么迫在眉睫（“下次我在地铁上看到你，我就杀了你”），戈茨使用致命武力就不正当了。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Goetz was charged with attempted murder, assault, reckless endangerment, and illegal possession of a firearm and defended on the basis of self-defense (<em class="calibre8">People v. Goetz</em>, 1986). Let’s first consider a hypothetical set of facts. Suppose first that one of the youths had pulled a gun out of his pocket, pointed it at Goetz, and shouted, “I’m going to blow your head off!” Reacting quickly, Goetz pulls out his own revolver and shoots and kills the attacker. Goetz has satisfied all of the elements of the crime; he has purposely killed another human being. On these facts, however, we would say that Goetz was justified because he acted in obvious self-defense. It may be useful to allow people to protect themselves because it could deter punks from assaulting subway riders. It also seems right from a moral point of view. Goetz has a right to personal safety, and he should be able to protect that right when it is threatened. The threat to him was imminent and serious, and he had no reasonable alternative except to defend himself or die. If the threatened harm had been less severe (“Give me your money or I’ll slap you”) or less imminent (“The next time I see you on this subway, I’ll kill you”), Goetz’s use of deadly force would not have been justified.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，戈茨案的案情要复杂得多。该案中第一个棘手的问题是，评估戈茨自卫主张的标准是什么。自卫要求戈茨相信这四个人即将袭击他，并且开枪是阻止袭击的必要条件。问题是戈茨的信念，还是他信念是否合理？戈茨认为自己即将遭到袭击，而阻止袭击的唯一方法就是开枪，这是否足够？还是我们应该通过判断一个理性的人是否会这样认为来评估他的信念？如果是后者，那么戈茨的过度反应并不能使他拥有有效的自卫主张。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The facts of Goetz’s case were much more complicated, however. The first troubling issue in the case concerns the standard to be applied in evaluating Goetz’s claim of self-defense. Self-defense requires that Goetz believe that the four were going to imminently attack him and that shooting them was necessary to prevent that. Is the issue Goetz’s belief, or whether his belief was reasonable? Is it enough that Goetz thought he was going to be attacked and the only way to prevent that was to fire, or are we going to evaluate his beliefs by determining whether a reasonable person would have thought that? If the latter, then Goetz’s overreaction would not give him a valid claim of self-defense.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>《模范刑法典》运用其关于心理状态的一般原则，并侧重于行为人的主观信念。如果戈茨认为自己有正当理由，那么他并非故意非法杀害四人，因此他不构成谋杀未遂罪。如果他的信念不合理，他可能犯有过失杀人罪，甚至鲁莽杀人罪，但他不具备构成更严重谋杀未遂罪的故意。即使信念不合理，但出于自卫必要性的信念，戈茨的罪责也会减轻。<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_273" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Model Penal Code applies its general principles concerning state of mind and focuses on the actor’s subjective belief. If Goetz believed that he was justified, then he did not purposefully attempt the unlawful killing of the four, so he is not guilty of attempted murder. If his belief was unreasonable, he may be guilty of negligent homicide or even reckless homicide, but he did not have the intent required for the more serious offense of attempted murder. A belief in the necessity of self-defense, even an unreasonable belief, rendered Goetz less culpable.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，纽约州的法律有所不同，它要求戈茨的信念必须合理。如果标准完全主观，那么异常恐惧或脾气暴躁的人或许可以主张自卫，而普通人则不能。根据这种观点，刑法旨在阻止这些人鲁莽行事，因此它要求每个人都遵守相同的标准——理性人的标准。基于这一观点，法院维持了对戈茨谋杀未遂的起诉。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The New York law was different, though, requiring that Goetz’s belief be reasonable. If the standard were wholly subjective, then someone who is unusually fearful or hot-tempered might have a claim of self-defense where an ordinary person would not. Under this view, criminal law wants to discourage those people from acting rashly, so it holds everyone to the same standard—the standard of the reasonable person. Applying this view, the court upheld the indictment for attempted murder against Goetz.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如果我们要求自卫者的行为像一个理性的人，那么理性的人应该具备哪些特质？通常我们会考虑行为人的一些身体状况，但不会考虑他的精神状态。一个弱者或许会理所当然地认为，他必须使用致命武力来抵御一个比他更强大的人的攻击，但一个心怀恐惧的人不可能在每一次不愉快的遭遇中都声称自己是自卫。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If we are going to require that someone acting in self-defense act like a reasonable person, what characteristics does the reasonable person have? Ordinarily we take into account some of the actor’s physical conditions but not his mental state. A weak person reasonably may believe that he has to use deadly force to repel the attack of a much stronger person, but a fearful person cannot claim self-defense in every unpleasant encounter.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在戈茨一案中，合理性问题非常尖锐。戈茨以前被抢过，这是否重要？戈茨是白人，而四名青少年是黑人，以及许多白人城市居民认为所有长相凶悍的黑人青少年都是潜在的抢劫犯，这是否重要？陪审团显然是这么认为的，因为除了持有未注册枪支这一几乎无可争议的指控外，他们宣告戈茨所有罪名不成立。在陪审团看来，或许这些普遍的因素使得戈茨的信念可以理解，甚至具有典型性。但典型性合理吗？如果许多人害怕犯罪，刑法是否应该屈从于这些信念或试图塑造它们？如果白人地铁乘客害怕黑人青少年是典型现象，那么法律是否应该规定针对这种恐惧采取行动是合理的？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the Goetz case the issues of reasonableness were very pointed. Is it relevant that Goetz had been mugged before? Is it relevant that Goetz was white and the four youths were black, and that many white city-dwellers think that all tough-looking black teenagers are potential muggers? The jury obviously thought so, because it acquitted Goetz of all charges except possession of an unregistered firearm, which was practically impossible to dispute. In the jury’s view, perhaps, those generalized factors made Goetz’s belief understandable and even typical. But is typical reasonable? If many people are afraid of crime, should criminal law bend to those beliefs or try to shape them? If it is typical for a white subway rider to be afraid of black teenagers, should the law say that it is reasonable to act on that fear?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这些关于自卫及其种族歧视的问题在2012年乔治·齐默尔曼（George Zimmerman）杀害特雷沃恩·马丁（Trayvon Martin）的案件中也得到了体现。齐默尔曼是一名社区巡逻志愿者，他在佛罗里达州桑福德拨打了911报警，举报“一个非常可疑的家伙”，“他看起来像是在搞阴谋，或者吸毒之类的”。这个“家伙”就是特雷沃恩·马丁，一个17岁的少年，他去当地一家7-11便利店买了一袋彩虹糖。齐默尔曼跟踪马丁，随后发生了争执和搏斗，最终齐默尔曼开枪打死了马丁。在被控谋杀罪时，齐默尔曼辩称是自卫，称马丁殴打了他并将他的头捶向地面；尽管控方对齐默尔曼的说法提出异议，但陪审团得出结论，齐默尔曼有理由相信他必须射杀马丁，并宣告他出于自卫而无罪。即使齐默尔曼在 911 调度员警告马丁不要这样做之后跟踪他，并接近马丁，从而引发了一系列悲剧事件，<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_274" class="calibre4"></a>在他使用致命武力的那一刻，他满足了自卫的条件。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These issues about self-defense and its racial overtones also played out in the killing of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman in 2012. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, called 911 in Sanford, Florida, to report “a real suspicious guy” who “looks like he is up to no good or he is on drugs or something.” The “guy” was Trayvon Martin, a seventeen-year-old who had gone to a local 7-Eleven to buy a bag of Skittles. Zimmerman followed Martin and an altercation and struggle ensued, during which Zimmerman shot and killed Martin. When tried for homicide, Zimmerman pleaded self-defense, arguing that Martin had punched him and was hammering his head to the ground; although the prosecution disputed Zimmerman’s account, the jury concluded that Zimmerman reasonably believed that he had to shoot Martin and acquitted him as acting in self-defense. Even if Zimmerman started the tragic chain of events by following Martin after the 911 dispatcher told him not to and then approaching Martin, <a class="calibre4"></a>at the moment he used deadly force, he met the requirements of self-defense.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>齐默尔曼案也引发了关于佛罗里达州“不退让法”的讨论，尽管齐默尔曼的辩护最终并未依赖该法。根据普通法，能够安全撤离危险境地的人不能使用致命武力进行自卫，因为在那种情况下使用致命武力并非真正必要。因此，如果齐默尔曼能够逃离争吵，他就没有理由为了自卫而射杀马丁。（根据“家是城堡”的格言，撤退原则不适用于在家中受到袭击的人。）但佛罗里达州与其他许多州一样，已经废除了撤退规则，允许即使可以撤退，也可以使用致命武力应对袭击，只要行为人没有从事非法活动，并且处于其有权待的地方。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Zimmerman’s case also provoked discussion about Florida’s “Stand Your Ground” law, even though Zimmerman’s defense ultimately did not rely on it. Under the common law, the use of deadly force in self-defense was not available to someone who could retreat safely from a dangerous situation, because the use of deadly force was not really necessary in that situation. Therefore, if Zimmerman could have run away from the altercation, he would not have been justified in shooting Martin in self-defense. (Following the maxim that “a man’s home is his castle,” the retreat doctrine does not apply to someone attacked in his own home.) But Florida, like a number other states, had abolished the retreat rule to allow the use of deadly force to meet an attack even if retreat is possible, as long as the actor is not engaged in an unlawful activity and is in a place where he or she has a right to be.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0014_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-8-div1-7"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0077" class="calibre1">在什么情况下，一个人犯罪是正当的？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0077" class="calibre1">In What Other Circumstances Is Someone Justified in Committing a Crime?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">还有两种情况，某人犯罪行为可能是正当的。一种情况相当常见。如果一名警察制服了一名逃跑的银行劫匪，他是否构成袭击？当然不是。政府权力的行使使原本属于犯罪的行为合法化。假设这名警察无法接近劫匪，反而大喊：“拦住那个人！”如果附近的一名普通公民制服了劫匪，她是否构成袭击？同样，不是。协助警察是应该鼓励的，这当然不是违法行为，因此她也有辩护理由。如果在没有警察在场的情况下，普通公民自行采取行动，该怎么办？在这种情况下，公民面临的风险更大；在某些司法管辖区，即使有合理的理由相信被袭击的人实际上没有犯罪，也无法保护她。如果逃跑的人实际上不是银行劫匪，而是一名银行顾客，他带着一袋取走的钱离开，被抢劫吓跑了，该怎么办？警察可以合理地相信被他制服的人是劫匪，从而受到保护，但在某些司法管辖区，普通公民可能不会受到保护。最后，警察可以射杀逃跑的劫匪吗？劫匪显然犯了重罪，但这是否足以成为使用致命武力的理由？传统上，警察对任何逃跑的重罪犯使用致命武力都是正当的，但最近大多数州都限制了这种辩护。如果罪犯对警察使用致命武力，警察可以予以回击。但是，如果罪犯逃跑，警察只有在合理地认为有必要逮捕罪犯的情况下才能使用致命武力。<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_275" class="calibre4"></a>威胁生命或造成严重伤害的人。因此，警察可以射杀持枪抢劫银行的劫匪，但不能射杀欺骗银行出纳员给钱的窃贼。</p><p class="noindent">There are two other situations in which someone might be justified in committing a crime. One is quite common. If a police officer tackles a fleeing bank robber, has he committed an assault? Of course not. The exercise of government authority makes lawful what otherwise would be a criminal act. Suppose the police officer can’t reach the robber and instead yells, “Stop that man!” If a private citizen nearby tackles the robber, has she committed an assault? Again, no. Aiding a police officer is to be encouraged and is certainly not wrongful, so she has a defense, too. What if the private citizen acts on her own when no police officer is present? Here the citizen is more at risk; in some jurisdictions even a reasonable belief will not protect her if the person she assaults has not in fact committed a crime. What if the fleeing person is not really a bank robber but rather a bank customer, leaving with a sack of money he had withdrawn, who was frightened by the robbery and ran away? The police officer would be protected by his reasonable belief that the person he tackled was a robber, but in some jurisdictions the private citizen might not. Finally, can the police officer shoot the fleeing robber? The robber apparently has committed a serious crime, but does it justify the use of deadly force? Traditionally the officer was justified in using deadly force against any fleeing felon, but recently the defense has been restricted in most states. If the criminal uses deadly force against a police officer, the officer can respond in kind. If the criminal flees, though, the officer can only use deadly force if he reasonably believes it to be necessary to arrest <a class="calibre4"></a>a person who threatens life or serious injury. Thus the officer can shoot an armed bank robber but not a thief who has tricked the bank teller into giving him money.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第二种涉及正当性的情况发生得少得多，但却将我们对刑法的理解推向了极限。自卫和行使执法权之所以被正当化，是因为行为人选择了两害相权取其轻。杀死袭击你的人固然不好，但总比被杀要好。是否存在一个普遍的<em class="calibre8">择恶</em>原则或<em class="calibre8">紧急避险原则，可以用来为其他类型的行为辩护？刑法中最著名的案例之一——</em><em class="calibre8">里贾纳诉达德利和斯蒂芬斯案，</em>提出了这个问题。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The second situation involving justification occurs much less frequently but pushes our understanding of criminal law to the limit. Self-defense and the exercise of law enforcement authority are justified because the actor is choosing the lesser of two evils. It’s not good to kill someone who attacks you, but it is better than being killed yourself. Is there a general principle of <em class="calibre8">choice of evils</em> or <em class="calibre8">necessity</em> that justifies other kinds of conduct? The issue is posed by one of the most famous cases in criminal law, <em class="calibre8">Regina v. Dudley and Stephens</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>1884年7月，一艘英国游艇的船员达德利、斯蒂芬斯、布鲁克斯和帕克遭遇暴风雨，被迫跳进一艘敞篷小船，船上没有水，也没有食物，只有两磅萝卜。达德利、斯蒂芬斯和布鲁克斯是水手，帕克是船上服务员。他们连续三天只靠萝卜充饥。第四天，他们抓到了一只小乌龟。除了用雨衣接的雨水，他们没有水喝。第十八天，他们已经七天没吃东西，五天没喝水了。达德利和斯蒂芬斯向布鲁克斯提议，应该牺牲其中一人——也就是帕克——来拯救其他人。布鲁克斯没有同意，但第二天，达德利和斯蒂芬斯先是祈祷宽恕，然后告诉帕克他的死期到了，并割断了他的喉咙。三名水手靠着帕克的血和尸体存活了四天，直到他们被一艘过往的船只救起，奄奄一息。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In July of 1884, Dudley, Stephens, Brooks, and Parker, the crew of an English yacht, were caught in a storm and forced to cast themselves off in an open boat containing no water and no food except for two pounds of turnips. Dudley, Stephens, and Brooks were seamen; Parker was the cabin boy. For three days they had only the turnips to eat. On the fourth day they caught a small turtle. They had no water except for rainwater they caught in their raincoats. On the eighteenth day they had been without food for seven days and without water for five, and Dudley and Stephens proposed to Brooks that one of them—meaning Parker—should be sacrificed to save the rest. Brooks did not agree, but on the next day Dudley and Stephens, first offering a prayer for forgiveness, told Parker that his time had come and slit his throat. The three sailors survived on Parker’s blood and body for four days, until they were rescued, barely alive, by a passing ship.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>回到港口后，达德利和斯蒂芬斯因谋杀帕克而受审。如果他们没有杀死并吃掉帕克，他们很可能在获救之前就死了，而帕克体质最弱，很可能早就死在他们之前了。面对这种必要性，达德利和斯蒂芬斯谋杀帕克是否合理？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When they returned to port Dudley and Stephens were put on trial for Parker’s murder. If they had not killed and eaten Parker they probably would have died before being rescued, and Parker, being the weakest, was likely to have died before them anyway. In the face of this necessity, was the murder of Parker by Dudley and Stephens justified?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法院认为并非如此。首先，维护生命具有崇高的价值，但并非至高无上的价值：</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The court held that it was not. First, preservation of life is a high value but not a supreme value:</p>
<p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>一般来说，保全生命是一种责任，但牺牲生命或许才是最简单、最崇高的责任。战争中充满了这样的例子：一个人的责任不是生存，而是死亡。在海难发生时，船长对船员的责任，船员对乘客的责任，所有这些责任都赋予人们道德上的义务，不是保全生命，而是为他人牺牲生命。在任何一个国家，尤其是在英国，人们都不会对此退缩。</p><p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To preserve one’s life is generally speaking a duty but it may be the plainest and highest duty to sacrifice it. War is full of instances in which it is a man’s duty not to live, but die. The duty, in case of shipwreck, of a captain to his crew, of the crew to the passengers, all these duties impose on men the moral necessity, not of the preservation, but of the sacrifice of their lives for others, from which in no country least of all, it is to be hoped, in England, will men ever shrink.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_276" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="noindent"><a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="noindent">其次，建立必要性原则将打开闸门：</p><p class="noindent">And second, establishing a principle of necessity would open the floodgates:</p>
<p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>无需指出承认这一争议原则的巨大危险。谁来评判这种必要性？生命的相对价值该以什么标准来衡量？是力量、智力还是其他？显然，该原则留给受益者去决定，在何种必要性下，他才有理由为了自保而故意夺走他人的生命。</p><p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is not needful to point out the awful danger of admitting the principle which has been contended for. Who is to be the judge of this sort of necessity? By what measure is comparative value of lives to be measured? Is it to be strength, or intellect or what? It is plain that the principle leaves to him who is to profit by it to determine the necessity which will justify him in deliberately taking another’s life to save his own.</p>
<p class="noindent">这对达德利和斯蒂芬斯来说是不是期望过高了？法院认为并非如此：“我们常常被迫设立自己无法达到的标准，制定自己无法满足的规则。” 因此，尽管任何普通人都无法抵挡像被告那样行事的诱惑，但法律要求他们无论如何都要抵制。</p><p class="noindent">Is this expecting too much of Dudley and Stephens? The court thought it was not: “We are often compelled to set up standards we cannot reach ourselves, and to lay down rules which we could not ourselves satisfy.” Thus even though no ordinary person would be able to resist the temptation to act as the defendants did, the law required them to resist anyway.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>一些现代司法管辖区背离了<em class="calibre8">达德利和斯蒂芬斯</em>的规则，允许在“试图避免的伤害或邪恶大于界定所指控罪行的法律试图阻止的伤害或邪恶”（《模范刑法典》）或“为避免即将发生的公共或私人伤害……且该伤害的严重性，根据一般的智力和道德标准，避免此类伤害的可取性和紧迫性明显超过避免界定所指控罪行的法律试图阻止的伤害的可取性”（纽约州法律）的情况下，以选择邪恶作为辩护理由。这些标准将关于行为必要性和邪恶相对重要性的最终决策权赋予法院，而非行为人。即使达德利和斯蒂芬斯认为吃掉帕克是必要且正确的，法院随后也可能驳回他们的辩护，例如，如果法院发现及时获救的机会足够大，或者作为海员，他们负有更高的责任。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Some modern jurisdictions depart from the rule of <em class="calibre8">Dudley and Stephens</em> and permit a defense of choice of evils where “the harm or evil sought to be avoided is greater than that sought to be prevented by the law defining the offense charged” (Model Penal Code) or where the action is necessary to “avoid an imminent public or private injury...which is of such gravity that, according to ordinary standards of intelligence and morality, the desirability and urgency of avoiding such injury clearly outweigh the desirability of avoiding the injury sought to be prevented by the statute defining the offense in issue” (New York law). These standards vest the ultimate decision-making authority about the necessity of acting and the relative weight of the evils in the court, not the actor. Even if Dudley and Stephens believe it is necessary and right to eat Parker, the court subsequently may reject their defense if, for example, the court finds that the chances of rescue in time were sufficiently great, or that, as seamen, they owed a higher duty.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>选择邪恶辩护也适用于其他情况。1994年7月29日，前牧师、反堕胎狂热分子保罗·希尔枪杀了实施堕胎手术的约翰·贝亚德·布里顿医生及其保镖。被捕后不久，希尔告诉警方：“我知道一件事；今天不会有无辜的婴儿在那家诊所被杀害。”希尔是否应该在审判中辩称，为了防止未出生婴儿被杀害，杀戮是正当的？希尔案的法官说不能；由于堕胎合法，这个问题已被排除。希尔被判有罪并被判处死刑，但他至死不悔；在行刑时被绑在轮床上。<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_277" class="calibre4"></a>他在议会中宣称：“如果你认为堕胎是一种致命的力量，你就应该反对这种力量，并尽你所能阻止它。”</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The choice of evils defense also arises in other circumstances. On July 29, 1994, former minister and antiabortion zealot Paul Hill shot and killed Dr. John Bayard Britton, a physician who performed abortions, and Britton’s bodyguard. Moments after he was arrested, Hill told police, “I know one thing; no innocent babies are going to be killed in that clinic today.” Should Hill have been able to argue at his trial that the killings were justified in order to prevent the murder of unborn babies? The judge at Hill’s trial said no; the issue had been foreclosed because abortion was legal. Hill was convicted and sentenced to death, but he was unrepentant to the end; strapped to the gurney in the execution <a class="calibre4"></a>chamber, he proclaimed, “If you believe abortion is a lethal force, you should oppose the force and do what you have to do to stop it.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>或者想想布什政府在关塔那摩等地对在押人员实施“强化审讯”计划所引发的争议。酷刑是联邦犯罪。如果水刑和其他严酷手段构成酷刑，那么实施这些手段的特工会被起诉吗？在2002年8月一份臭名昭著的备忘录中，司法部法律顾问办公室建议，为防止美国遭受恐怖袭击，使用酷刑是正当的。（该备忘录的作者还创造性地提出，出于自卫——即保护国家免受潜在的恐怖袭击——使用酷刑也是正当的。）司法部随后撤回了备忘录，迄今为止，由于涉案人员均未受到起诉，因此这个问题尚未被正视。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Or consider the controversy surrounding the Bush administration’s program of “enhanced interrogation” of detainees at Guantanamo and elsewhere. Torture is a federal crime. If waterboarding and other harsh techniques are torture, could the agents who engaged in them be prosecuted? In an infamous memorandum in August 2002, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel advised that torture would be justified to prevent a terrorist attack on the United States. (The authors of the memo also creatively argued that torture could be justified as a matter of self-defense—the defense of the nation itself from a potential terrorist attack.) The Justice Department subsequently withdrew the memorandum, and to date the question has not been faced because none of the individuals involved have been prosecuted.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>此类案件引发了关于刑事责任以及刑法目的的最具挑战性的问题。在某些情况下，法律或许能够起到震慑作用，阻止除最坚定的堕胎抗议者之外的所有人从事非法活动。但在极端情况下，这现实吗？达德利和斯蒂芬斯会因为害怕刑事处罚，或因为法院判决错误而牺牲自己的生命，不去吃帕克的肉吗？可能不会。法律似乎也承认其局限性。达德利和斯蒂芬斯被判处死刑，但后来被减刑为六个月监禁。刑法的一个重要功能是宣告是非对错，培养和强化人们的道德品质，而这些案件可能比其他任何案件都更能达到这一目的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Cases like these raise the most challenging issues about criminal responsibility and about the purpose of the criminal law. In some cases the law might deter, discouraging all but the most committed abortion protestors from illegal activity. But in extreme situations, is that realistic? Would Dudley and Stephens sacrifice their own lives and refrain from dining on Parker for fear of criminal punishment, or because a court had pronounced it wrong to do so? Probably not. The law seems to recognize its limits, too. Dudley and Stephens were sentenced to death, but the sentence subsequently was commuted to six months imprisonment. An important function of the criminal law is to declare what is right and wrong, to develop and reinforce people’s moral fiber, and these cases may serve this purpose more than any other.</p>

<p class="noindent">几个世纪以来，精神错乱辩护一直是刑法的一部分，一个经典的假设解释了为什么这种辩护是合理的。一个男人在精神错乱的妄想下勒死了他的妻子，却一直以为自己在榨柠檬。一个连自己行为的生理本质都不懂的人，怎么能为此承担刑事责任呢？</p><p class="noindent">The insanity defense has been part of the criminal law for centuries, and a classic hypothetical explains why the defense makes sense. A man acting under an insane delusion strangles his wife, all the time thinking that he is squeezing a lemon. How can someone who did not even understand the physical nature of his act be held criminally responsible for it?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，近年来，精神错乱辩护已引发巨大争议，因为它在许多备受瞩目、往往匪夷所思的案件中被更广泛地使用。约翰·W·欣克利二世（John W. Hinckley Jr.）在一次刺杀行动中枪杀了罗纳德·里根总统和其他三人，却因精神错乱被判无罪。安德烈娅·耶茨（Andrea Yates）在家中的浴缸里溺死了五个年龄在六个月到七岁之间的孩子，她的第一次定罪在上诉中被推翻，在重审中，她因精神错乱被判无罪，因为她<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_278" class="calibre4"></a>她患有严重的产后精神病和妄想症，以至于她相信自己是在拯救孩子们免于地狱之苦。约翰·杜邦是一位古怪的千万富翁，他自称是达赖喇嘛、耶稣和罗曼诺夫王朝的最后一位成员。他枪杀了奥运摔跤运动员、杜邦私人摔跤队成员戴夫·舒尔茨，最终被判有罪，但精神失常。刑事司法系统应该如何对待在精神疾病影响下犯下可怕罪行的人？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In recent years, though, the insanity defense has become enormously controversial as it has become more widely used in a number of high-profile, often bizarre cases. John W. Hinckley Jr., who shot and wounded President Ronald Reagan and three other people in an assassination attempt, was found not guilty by reason of insanity. Andrea Yates drowned her five children, ages six months to seven years, in the bathtub of their home, had her first conviction reversed on appeal, and was found not guilty by reason of insanity at her retrial because she was <a class="calibre4"></a>suffering from severe postpartum psychosis and delusions that made her believe she was saving her children from hell. John DuPont, an eccentric multimillionaire who proclaimed that he was the Dalai Lama, Jesus, and the last of the Romanovs, shot Dave Schultz, an Olympic wrestler and member of DuPont’s personal wrestling team, and was found guilty but mentally ill. What should the criminal justice system do with people who commit horrific crimes under the influence of mental illness?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>被告的精神健康状况与多种情况相关。首先，如果某人患有精神疾病，并被发现具有严重伤害自身或他人的危险，可以通过一种名为“<em class="calibre8">民事监禁</em>”的非刑事程序，被强制送入精神病院。被民事监禁的人并未被判定犯有刑事行为（事实上，精神疾病可能涉及非刑事行为），并且只能在其精神疾病构成持续危险的期间被拘留。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The defendant’s mental health is relevant for several purposes. First, someone who is mentally ill and is found to present a serious danger of causing injury to himself or other people can be involuntarily confined to a mental institution through a noncriminal process known as <em class="calibre8">civil commitment</em>. A person who has been civilly committed has not been found guilty of a criminal act (indeed, the mental illness may involve noncriminal behavior) and can be held only as long as his mental illness presents a continuing danger.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>其次，受审时患有精神疾病的刑事被告人可能被判定<em class="calibre8">无行为能力出庭受审</em>。此处的精神疾病问题与犯罪本身无关。问题在于被告人是否能够理解针对她的指控并参与辩护。如果被告人无法理解正在发生的事情或无法协助其律师进行辩护，则将剥夺其宪法赋予的正当法律程序权利。当某人被判定无行为能力出庭受审时，州政府必须确定她是否有可能恢复行为能力，并为其提供治疗或启动民事拘留程序。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Second, a criminal defendant who is mentally ill at the time of trial may be found <em class="calibre8">incompetent to stand trial</em>. Here the issue of mental illness is unrelated to the crime itself. Instead, the question is whether the defendant is able to understand the charges against her and to participate in her defense. It would deprive a defendant of the constitutional right of due process of law to try her when she could not understand what was happening or aid her attorney in presenting a defense. When someone has been found incompetent to stand trial, the state must determine whether she probably will become competent and either provide treatment or begin civil commitment proceedings.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第三，在程序的另一端，被判死罪的被告如果精神上无行为能力，则不得被处决。法院一直拒绝处决无法理解自己已被判有罪并被判处死刑的人，最高法院裁定，处决精神病患者违反了第八修正案禁止残酷和非常惩罚的规定。支持这一立场的理由多种多样，但很可能归结于这样一种信念：处死一个无法理解为何要处死自己的人是不公平的，甚至是不人道的。然而，这种人道本能却造成了一种异常现象。死囚牢房里的精神病患者可以接受治疗以恢复其精神能力——此时，他将被处死。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Third, at the other end of the process, a defendant convicted of a capital crime may not be executed if he is mentally incompetent. Courts have always refused to allow the execution of a person who cannot understand that he has been convicted of a crime and sentenced to death, and the Supreme Court has held that it would violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment to execute an insane person. Various reasons have been offered for this position, but it likely comes down to the belief that it is unfair and even inhumane to put to death someone who cannot comprehend why it is being done to him. This humane instinct creates an anomaly, however. The mentally ill person on death row can be given treatment to restore his mental competence—at which point he is killed.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>精神错乱辩护不同于民事监禁、无能力接受审判或无能力被处决。刑法中的精神错乱是一种借口。某人故意实施刑事法规禁止的行为——例如，企图暗杀总统。他满足了该罪行的所有构成要件：向总统开枪，明知……<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_279" class="calibre4"></a>他正在这样做，并且意识到这很可能导致总统死亡。然而，他的律师辩称，由于他在犯罪时患有精神疾病，因此不应为其行为承担刑事责任。如果他们的辩护成功，就像约翰·欣克利的辩护一样，他将不会被定罪，也不会受到惩罚，尽管他将被拘留进行精神评估，并且只有在被认定不会构成持续危险的情况下才会被释放——这一过程可能仍会使被告在精神病院被监禁多年。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The insanity defense is different from civil commitment, incompetence to stand trial, or incompetence to be executed. Insanity in criminal law is an excuse. Someone intentionally commits an act prohibited by a criminal statute—say, attempting to assassinate the president. He has satisfied all of the elements of the crime: firing a gun at the president, knowing <a class="calibre4"></a>that he is doing so, and realizing that it will likely result in the president’s death. Nevertheless, his lawyers argue, he should not be held criminally responsible for his act because he was mentally ill at the time of the crime. If their argument is successful, as John Hinckley’s was, he will not be convicted of the crime and cannot be punished, although he will be held for psychiatric evaluation and released only if he is found not to pose a continuing danger—a process that may still keep the defendant in psychiatric confinement for many years.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>为什么罪犯可以因为精神疾病而逍遥法外？想想刑法和刑罚的目的。刑法的一个主要目标是报应，即对犯下严重不法行为的人进行道德谴责和惩罚。精神错乱辩护区分了那些对自己的行为负责的人和那些不负责的人。用一句老话来说，精神错乱辩护区分了“疯子和坏人，病人和恶人”。如果一个人因为心理疾病而犯下原本会构成犯罪的行为，那么他不应该受到刑法通常判处的谴责或惩罚。罪犯可能需要接受治疗，如果没有治疗，甚至需要被监禁，但这是作为病人而不是罪犯。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Why are criminals allowed to get off because of mental illness? Think about the purposes of criminal law and criminal punishment. A major objective of criminal law is retribution, the moral condemnation and punishment of those who are responsible for committing seriously wrongful acts. The insanity defense distinguishes between those people who are responsible for their acts and those who are not. In a well-worn phrase, the insanity defense distinguishes “the mad from the bad, the sick from the wicked.” Someone who commits an act that otherwise would be criminal because he is psychologically ill does not deserve the condemnation or punishment that criminal law usually metes out. The offender may need to be treated or even confined if no treatment is available, but as a sick person, not as a criminal.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>刑法也旨在震慑犯罪，使犯罪者丧失行为能力。符合精神错乱法律定义的精神病患者通常不会考虑其行为可能造成的后果，因此威胁刑事制裁毫无意义。由于因精神错乱而无罪判决的结果，是只要犯罪者构成危险，就必须送去接受治疗，因此犯罪者被剥夺了行为能力，并在必要的范围内无法再次犯罪。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Criminal law also aims to deter crime and incapacitate offenders. The mentally ill person who meets the legal definition of insanity typically does not engage in a calculation of the consequences of his acts that can be deterred, so the threat of a criminal sanction is useless. And because the result of a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity is to commit the offender for treatment as long as he presents a danger, the offender is incapacitated and prevented from committing another crime to the extent it is necessary to do so.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>虽然庭审中医学证词对于确立精神错乱是必不可少的，但精神错乱是一个法律概念，而非医学概念。精神错乱的问题在于，根据刑法的目的和原则，被告的精神状态是否足以使其对其行为承担刑事责任。在大多数精神错乱辩护案件中，被告的精神状态符合罪行中所定义的，但他的精神状态非常模糊，以至于我们认为无论如何追究他的刑事责任都是不明智的。随着时间的推移，尤其是自欣克利判决以来，用于确定法律精神错乱的定义已经发生了变化。基本问题是我们能否制定一种既能满足这些目的和原则，又能符合我们对精神疾病及其对行为的影响的理解的精神错乱测试。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Although medical testimony at trial is necessary to establish insanity, insanity is a legal concept, not a medical one. The issue of insanity is whether, according to the purposes and principles of criminal law, the defendant had a mental state that is appropriate to hold him criminally responsible for his acts. In most cases of the insanity defense, the defendant had the mental state defined in the offense, but his mental state was so clouded as well that we think it unwise to hold him criminally responsible anyway. Over time, and especially since the Hinckley verdict, the definition used to determine legal insanity has changed. The basic question is whether we can formulate a test for insanity that satisfies those purposes and principles and is attuned to our understanding of mental illness and its effect on behavior.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第一个重大的精神错乱案件是1843 年英国的<em class="calibre8">麦克纳顿案</em>。丹尼尔·麦克纳顿开枪打死了爱德华·德拉蒙德。<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_280" class="calibre4"></a>麦克诺顿是首相罗伯特·皮尔爵士的私人秘书。他误以为皮尔参与了谋杀他的阴谋，于是开枪打死了不幸的德拉蒙德（德拉蒙德当时穿着皮尔的大衣），并以为德拉蒙德是在朝皮尔开枪。陪审团因麦克诺顿的妄想症（如今被称为偏执型精神分裂症的产物）而宣判他无罪，由此引发的轩然大波堪比欣克利案判决。上议院就此问题展开辩论，并向女王法庭的法官寻求咨询意见。该咨询意见包括后来被称为“<em class="calibre8">麦克诺顿</em>规则”的内容：</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The first great insanity case was <em class="calibre8">M’Naghten’s Case</em>, a British decision from 1843. Daniel M’Naghten shot and killed Edward Drummond, <a class="calibre4"></a>private secretary to Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel. M’Naghten was under the delusion that Peel was involved in a conspiracy to kill him, so he shot the unfortunate Drummond (who was wearing Peel’s overcoat) thinking that he was shooting at Peel. The jury acquitted M’Naghten because of his delusion (which today would be described as the product of paranoid schizophrenia), and the resulting uproar matched that which followed the Hinckley verdict. The House of Lords debated the issue and sought an advisory opinion from the justices of the Court of Queen’s Bench. That advisory opinion included what became known as the <em class="calibre8">M’Naghten</em> rule:</p>
<p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>为了以精神错乱为由进行辩护，必须清楚地证明，在实施犯罪时，被告方由于精神疾病而理智缺陷，不知道自己所实施行为的性质和性质，或者即使他知道，他也不知道自己在做错事。</p><p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>[T]‌o establish defense on the ground of insanity, it must clearly be proved that, at the time of committing the act, the party accused was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em class="calibre8">麦克诺顿</em>规则被广泛采用，并以各种形式在大多数美国司法管辖区生效。该规则侧重于认知：认识、理解和思考自身行为的能力。作为一项门槛要求，被告必须患有精神疾病或缺陷，尽管很少有人明确界定哪种疾病足以构成构成要件。由于患有疾病，被告必须无法理解行为的性质或行为的不法性。人们可以在理智层面上了解某事，也可以对其有更深刻的理解；有人可能知道杀人是错误的，能够理解这一事实，但仍然缺乏对杀人不法性的任何情感意识。法院通常未能指示陪审团这些含义究竟是哪种，尽管现代联邦法律要求被告“无法理解”其行为的性质。</p><p class="noindent">The <em class="calibre8">M’Naghten</em> rule was widely adopted and is in effect in one form or another in most American jurisdictions. The rule focuses on cognition: the ability to know, understand, and think about one’s actions. As a threshold requirement, the defendant must suffer from a mental disease or defect, although what type of disease is sufficient is seldom defined. As a result of the disease, the defendant must fail to comprehend either the nature of the act or that it was wrong. One can either know something at an intellectual level or can have a deeper appreciation of it; someone might know that killing is wrong, in the sense of being able to relate that fact, but still lack any emotional awareness of the wrongness of killing. Courts often fail to instruct the jury on which of these meanings is intended, although modern federal law requires that the defendant have been “unable to appreciate” the nature of his acts.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>同样，未能理解某一行为的“性质和性质”，或认为该行为是错误的，也存在不同的定义。通常，性质和性质是指某一行为的实际后果——被告是在勒死一个人，而不是在榨柠檬汁，并且勒死会导致该人死亡。而错误可能意味着它在法律上是错误的，也可能意味着它在道德上是错误的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Similarly, failing to understand the “nature and quality” of an act, or that it is wrong, are subject to differing definitions. Usually nature and quality is taken to refer to the physical consequences of an act—that the defendant was strangling a person rather than squeezing a lemon and that strangling will result in that person’s death. And wrong may mean either that it is a legal wrong or that it is wrong in a moral sense.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">从刑法的目的来看，麦克纳顿</em>规则是有道理的。那些不理解自己在做什么或不知道自己在做什么是错的人，无法阻止他们的行为，因此不承担道德责任。但心理健康专家抱怨说，该规则基于对人们心理过程的过时观念，侧重于<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_281" class="calibre4"></a>认知缺陷时，精神病理往往会影响一个人的整个人格。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The <em class="calibre8">M’Naghten</em> rule makes sense in light of the purposes of criminal law. People who do not understand what they are doing or that it is wrong cannot be deterred from their conduct and are therefore not morally culpable for it. But mental health professionals complain that it is based on outmoded ideas about people’s mental processes, focusing on <a class="calibre4"></a>cognitive defects when mental pathology often affects a person’s entire personality.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>麦克<em class="calibre8">诺顿</em>规则在一个重要方面受到限制。假设约翰·欣克利知道枪杀罗纳德·里根会致其死亡，也知道这在法律和道德上都是错误的，但他听到脑海里有声音命令他开枪，而欣克利由于精神疾病无法抗拒这个命令。根据<em class="calibre8">麦克诺顿</em>规则，欣克利不能因为意识到其行为的性质和不法性而被免除罪责。针对这一限制，一些州采用了<em class="calibre8">不可抗拒冲动测试作为</em><em class="calibre8">麦克诺顿</em>规则的补充。如果被告患有精神疾病，无法控制自己的行为，那么他就不会被阻止，也不应承担责任，因此他应该因精神错乱而被判无罪。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The <em class="calibre8">M’Naghten</em> rule is limited in an important respect. Suppose John Hinckley knew that shooting Ronald Reagan would kill him, knew that it was legally and morally wrong, but heard voices in his head commanding him to shoot, commands that Hinckley was unable to resist because of his mental illness. Under the <em class="calibre8">M’Naghten</em> rule, Hinckley would not be excused because he appreciated the nature and wrongfulness of his act. In response to this limitation, some states have adopted an <em class="calibre8">irresistible impulse</em> test as a supplement to <em class="calibre8">M’Naghten</em>. If a defendant had a mental disease that prevented him from controlling his conduct, he could not be deterred and was not culpable, so he should be found not guilty by reason of insanity.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>不可抗拒冲动测试尚未被广泛采用，主要有两个原因。首先，它试图划出一条很难界定的界限——<em class="calibre8">无法</em>抗拒的冲动和根本<em class="calibre8">无法</em>抗拒的冲动之间的界限。其次，我们可能不想在这里划出这条界限；施加刑事处​​罚可能会对增强受此类冲动影响的人的决心起到重要的威慑作用。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The irresistible impulse test has not been widely adopted for two main reasons. First, it attempts to draw a line that is very hard to draw—the line between an impulse that <em class="calibre8">could not</em> be resisted and one that simply <em class="calibre8">was not</em> resisted. Second, we may not want to draw the line here; providing a criminal penalty may serve an important deterrent effect in strengthening the resolve of someone who is subject to such impulses.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">麦克诺顿</em>规则的主要竞争对手是《模范刑法典》。《模范刑法典》修订了<em class="calibre8">麦克诺顿</em>规则和不可抗拒冲动测试，以便提供更广泛的证据来证明精神疾病对行为的影响：</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The major competitor to the <em class="calibre8">M’Naghten</em> rule has been the Model Penal Code formulation. The Model Penal Code revises the <em class="calibre8">M’Naghten</em> rule and the irresistible impulse test to allow broader evidence of the effect of mental illness on conduct:</p>
<p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如果一个人在实施犯罪行为时，由于精神疾病或精神缺陷，缺乏实质性能力去认识其行为的犯罪性[不法性]或使自己的行为符合法律的要求，则该人不应对犯罪行为负责。</p><p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality [wrongfulness] of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em class="calibre8">《模范刑法典》在麦克纳顿</em>强调认知（理解自身行为）的基础上，补充了不可抗拒冲动测试对意志（控制自身行为的能力）重要性的认识。此外，该法典对精神疾病的作用采取了更为灵活的处理方式，允许在精神疾病导致被告缺乏实质行为能力的情况下，而非在被告缺乏对其行为的性质或不法性的完整理解或无法控制自身冲动的情况下，为其提供辩护。</p><p class="noindent">The Model Penal Code adds the irresistible impulse test’s awareness of the importance of volition (the ability to control one’s behavior) to <em class="calibre8">M’Naghten</em>’s emphasis on cognition (understanding one’s behavior). And it takes a more flexible approach to the role of mental illness, allowing an excuse where the mental illness causes the defendant to lack substantial capacity, rather than lack an entire understanding of the nature or wrongfulness of his acts or lack any control over his impulses.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>《模范刑法典》还将“精神疾病或缺陷”的定义排除在外，“仅表现为反复犯罪或其他反社会行为的异常”。根据这条规则，患有某种疾病导致犯下可怕罪行的反社会人格者——例如杰弗里·达默，他反复杀人，然后将尸体部位冷藏并食用。<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_282" class="calibre4"></a>受害者——不能因精神错乱而被无罪释放。这项规定的出台是为了防止精神错乱辩护压倒犯罪概念。惯犯能否声称他缺乏使自身行为符合法律要求的实质能力，并以他继续犯罪的事实作为证据？然而，《模范刑法典》的条款受到了批评，因为真正的反社会人格者实际上可能缺乏罪责，而允许他辩护也无济于事，因为通常除了犯罪之外，这种疾病还会有一些其他症状。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Model Penal Code also defines “mental disease or defect” to exclude “an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct.” Under this rule, a sociopath who suffered from a disease that caused him to commit horrible crimes—such as a Jeffrey Dahmer, who killed repeatedly, then refrigerated and ate the body parts <a class="calibre4"></a>of his victims—could not be acquitted because of insanity. This provision was adopted to prevent the insanity defense from overwhelming the concept of criminality. Could a repeat offender claim that he lacked substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, presenting as evidence the fact that he continued to commit crimes? The Model Penal Code provision has been criticized, though, because a true sociopath may in fact lack culpability, and allowing him a defense would give little away anyway, since typically there are some symptoms of the disease other than the crimes.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>《模范刑法典》影响深远，大约一半的州都采用了该法，直到欣克利案的出现。<em class="calibre8">欣克利案</em>促使人们重新审视精神错乱辩护。美国律师协会和美国精神病学协会建议缩小该辩护的范围，而美国医学协会则呼吁彻底废除该辩护。几年之内，国会和超过半数的州改变了对精神错乱的立场，大多数州都转向了<em class="calibre8">麦克诺顿</em>规则的版本，还有一些州则彻底废除了该辩护。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Model Penal Code was very influential, being adopted in about half the states, until the Hinckley case came along. <em class="calibre8">Hinckley</em> spurred a reexamination of the insanity defense. The American Bar Association and the American Psychiatric Association recommended that the defense be narrowed, and the American Medical Association called for its abolition altogether. Within a few years Congress and more than half the states changed their positions on insanity, most moving toward a version of the <em class="calibre8">M’Naghten</em> rule and a few abolishing the defense altogether.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>因精神错乱而无罪判决的“是”或“否”性质可能会令人不安，因此法院和立法机构采取了两项措施对其进行补充。一个问题是，明显犯有严重罪行的被告可能会因精神错乱而被判无罪，暂时被关押进行精神病评估和治疗，然后在审判后相对较短的时间内释放。密歇根州是第一个提出中间立场的州：即<em class="calibre8">“有罪但患有精神病”</em>的判决，即陪审团认定被告在犯罪时患有精神病，尽管在法律上不属于精神病。该判决的结果是被告被判有罪，而不是无罪释放，因此法官可以判处被告监禁。但是，法律规定，被告在狱中必须接受针对其精神疾病的适当治疗。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The yes or no quality of the verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity can be troubling, so courts and legislatures have taken two steps to supplement it. One problem is that a defendant who obviously committed a serious crime could be found not guilty by reason of insanity, temporarily held for psychiatric evaluation and treatment, and then released in a relatively short period of time after trial. Michigan was the first state to respond with a middle-ground alternative: the verdict of <em class="calibre8">guilty but mentally ill</em>, when the jury finds that the defendant was mentally ill at the time he committed the offense, though not legally insane. The effect of the verdict is that the defendant is found guilty, not acquitted, so the judge can sentence the defendant to incarceration. The statute provides, however, that while in prison the defendant be given appropriate treatment for his mental illness.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>有罪但精神病的判决颇具争议。辩护律师和一些心理健康专家批评这种判决，因为它让陪审团在棘手案件中轻易脱身。被告可能确实符合精神错乱的认定标准，因此根据刑法标准无需承担责任，但陪审团可能担心，如果被判无罪，危险的罪犯会被释放。认为被判有罪但精神病的罪犯在监狱系统中的待遇会与仅仅被定罪的罪犯截然不同，这种想法也是不切实际的。通常，法律并不要求对罪犯进行适当的治疗，罪犯通常接受的治疗与其他囚犯所能获得的治疗并无二致。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The guilty but mentally ill verdict is controversial. Defense advocates and some mental health professionals criticize it because it gives the jury an easy out in hard cases. A defendant may really meet the test of insanity and therefore not be responsible under the standards of criminal law, but the jury may be afraid that a dangerous offender will be released if found not guilty. The idea that the offender found guilty but mentally ill will be treated much differently by the prison system from an offender who is simply convicted is also illusory. Generally there is no legal requirement of appropriate treatment, and the offender often receives nothing more than the medical treatment available to any other prisoner.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>精神错乱辩护的另一个问题是，它只针对最极端的精神异常。许多罪犯<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_283" class="calibre4"></a>某种程度的精神疾病，但并不至于无法辨别是非或实质上控制自身行为。我们应该考虑这种程度的精神疾病或精神障碍吗？如果我们愿意考虑，我们是否应该允许专家就被告的精神状况提供证词，并非为了证明其精神错乱，而是为了表明被告对其行为的责任较小？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A different problem of the insanity defense is that it is designed only for the most extreme kinds of mental abnormality. Many criminals have <a class="calibre4"></a>some degree of mental illness but not to such a degree that they cannot distinguish right from wrong or substantially control their conduct. Should we take account of this degree of mental illness or impairment? And if we are willing to take account of it, should we allow the presentation of expert testimony on the defendant’s mental condition not to establish insanity but to suggest that the defendant is less responsible for his act?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这个问题一直存在争议，但法院和立法机构尝试了几种解决方案。首先，法院可以在判定有罪或无罪时排除被告精神状态的证据，并将其视为与量刑相关的因素。如果法官在量刑方面拥有自由裁量权，那么减轻严厉刑罚的因素之一是，被告在犯罪时的精神状态使其责任感低于正常人。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The issue has been controversial, but courts and legislatures have attempted several solutions. First, the court can exclude evidence of the defendant’s mental condition in the determination of guilt or innocence and then consider it as relevant to sentencing. Where a judge has discretion in sentencing, one of the factors that might mitigate a harsh sentence is that the defendant’s mental state at the time of the crime rendered him less responsible than a normal person might be.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>其次，被告的精神状况可能被认为否定了犯罪所需的某个精神要素。这尤其适用于需要<em class="calibre8">特定意图的</em>精神要素，例如一级谋杀的杀人意图，但有些司法管辖区将其更广泛地应用于任何犯罪。如果被告知道自己在杀人，但缺乏策划犯罪的精神能力，他仍然犯有杀人罪，但程度较轻，例如过失杀人而不是谋杀。一方面，这种<em class="calibre8">能力减弱</em>辩护允许陪审团根据每个案件的责任程度做出更加个性化的罪责判断。另一方面，它使他们陷入令人困惑的精神病学证词迷宫中。再次，心理健康专业人员难以区分“正常”行为和“异常”行为，陪审团更容易被证词所困扰而不是得到帮助。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Second, the defendant’s mental condition might be considered to negate one of the required mental elements of the crime. This applies especially to mental elements that require <em class="calibre8">specific intent</em>, such as the intent to kill for first-degree murder, but some jurisdictions apply it more broadly to any crime. If a defendant knew he was killing someone but lacked the mental ability to plan the crime, he would still be guilty of homicide but of a lesser degree, such as manslaughter instead of murder. On the one hand, this <em class="calibre8">diminished capacity</em> defense allows the jury to make more individualized culpability judgments, attuned to the degree of responsibility in each case. On the other hand, it immerses them in a confusing maze of psychiatric testimony. Once again, the mental health professionals have difficulty distinguishing “normal” from “abnormal” behavior, and the jury is more likely to be confused than aided by the testimony.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0014_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-8-div1-9"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0079" class="calibre1">还有什么其他防御措施？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0079" class="calibre1">What Other Defenses Are Available?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">为了完成我们对辩护的研究，我们来考虑一下醉酒和胁迫。醉酒有点像暂时性精神失常，但它可以作为辩护吗？在很多情况下，可以。假设Doc Holiday因在OK Corral枪杀Billy Clanton而被控一级谋杀罪。在庭审中，Doc作证说，枪击案发生时他在场，想要射杀Billy，但当时他醉得无法从枪套中拔出枪，所以他没有犯罪。如果陪审团相信Doc的说法，那么他显然无罪，因为他没有实施该罪行所禁止的行为（即杀死Billy）。但假设Doc的辩护是，他确实射杀了Billy，但他当时醉得厉害，以至于……<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_284" class="calibre4"></a>没意识到自己在做什么。如果陪审团相信Doc的说法，他醉酒还能作为辩护理由吗？</p><p class="noindent">To complete our study of defenses, consider intoxication and duress. Being drunk is something like being temporarily insane, but can it be used as a defense? In many cases, it can. Suppose Doc Holiday is charged with first-degree murder for shooting Billy Clanton at the OK Corral. At trial Doc testifies that he was present at the time of the shooting, wanted to shoot Billy, but was so drunk that he couldn’t get his gun out of his holster, so he did not commit the crime. If the jury believes Doc’s story, obviously he is not guilty, because he had not committed the act prohibited by the offense (i.e., killing Billy). But suppose instead that Doc’s defense is that he did in fact shoot Billy, but he was so drunk he <a class="calibre4"></a>didn’t realize what he was doing. If the jury believes Doc’s story, is his intoxication still a defense?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>虽然有些州拒绝承认醉酒作为辩护理由，但大多数州都会给予Doc辩护，至少是一级谋杀的辩护理由。当他醉得无法拔枪时，他的醉酒状态否定了犯罪的行为要件。当他醉得不知道自己在做什么时，他的醉酒状态否定了犯罪的精神要件。一级谋杀要求他有杀害Billy的意图。如果他没有这个意图，他就不构成犯罪，即使他没有意图的原因是醉酒。刑事犯罪的定义是为了惩罚应受谴责的罪犯。Doc可能因醉酒而应受一些谴责，但不应受到与一级谋杀相关的谴责程度的谴责。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Although some states refuse to recognize intoxication as a defense, most states would give Doc a defense, at least to first-degree murder. When he is too drunk to pull out his gun, his intoxication negates the act element of the offense. When he is too drunk to know what he is doing, his intoxication negates the mental element of the offense. First-degree murder requires that he have intended to kill Billy. If he does not have that intent, he has not committed the crime, even if the reason he does not have the intent is because he was drunk. Criminal offenses are defined to punish offenders who deserve blame. Doc may deserve some blame for getting drunk but not the degree of blame that is associated with first-degree murder.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Doc 能否完全脱罪取决于是否存在其他不能以醉酒作为辩护理由的罪行。如果 Doc 被控偷马，但他的辩护理由是自己当时醉酒到不知道自己骑的马是别人的，那么他的醉酒行为完全可以作为辩护理由。然而，在杀害 Billy 的案件中，醉酒行为或许可以免除一级谋杀的故意要求，但他仍然可能犯下较轻的杀人罪，这只需要 Doc 存在鲁莽行为即可。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Whether Doc gets off the hook altogether depends on whether there is some other offense available for which intoxication would not be a defense. If Doc is charged with stealing a horse but his defense is that he was too drunk to know that the horse on which he rode away was someone else’s, his intoxication is a complete defense. In the case of killing Billy, however, the intoxication may negate the intent requirement of first-degree murder, but he may still be guilty of a lesser degree of homicide, which only requires that Doc have been reckless.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>但为什么会这样呢？鲁莽需要有意识地忽视重大且不合理的风险——例如，朝着人群疯狂射击就是鲁莽行为。如果 Doc 喝醉了，他可能没有意识到自己正在造成的风险。不过，许多法院在这一点上划清了界限。即使 Doc 没有意识到自己射击造成的风险，他也意识到（或被推定意识到）自己醉酒造成的风险。从政策上讲，对醉酒行为承担刑事处罚的可能性可能会阻止人们过度饮酒；从公平的角度来看，让人们为他们醉酒时产生的风险负责并非不合理。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But why is this so? Recklessness requires a conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk—for example, wildly shooting in the direction of a crowd is reckless. If Doc was very drunk, he may not have been conscious of the risk he was creating. Many courts draw the line at this point, though. Even if Doc was not aware of the risk he was creating by shooting, he was (or is presumed to be) aware of the risk he was creating by getting drunk. As a matter of policy, the possibility of criminal penalties for acts committed while intoxicated may discourage people from drinking excessively; as a matter of fairness, it is not unreasonable to hold people responsible for the risk they incur when they get drunk.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>接下来，考虑胁迫。假设三个持枪男子闯入一辆出租车，威胁司机，除非司机把他们送到他们打算抢劫的银行，并等待他们协助逃跑，否则就开枪打死他们。严格来说，司机已经满足了抢劫罪的所有构成要件：他参与抢劫构成了抢劫罪，并且具备了抢劫所需的精神状态；即使他并非自愿参与，但他是故意的（也就是说，他有参与的意图）。但他似乎对抢劫不负道德责任。或者换句话说，他似乎应该被免除责任，因为他犯了一个不法行为——协助抢劫——只是为了避免犯下一个更不法的行为——被三名银行劫匪杀害。<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_285" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Next, consider duress. Suppose three men brandishing guns enter a taxi and threaten to shoot the driver unless he drives them to a bank they intend to rob and waits for them to aid in their getaway. The driver has technically satisfied all of the elements of the offense of robbery: He has committed the act by participating in the robbery, and he had the required mental state; even though he didn’t want to take part, he did so purposely (that is, he meant to participate.) But he doesn’t seem morally responsible for the robbery. Or, put another way, it seems as if he ought to be excused from responsibility because he was committing one wrongful act—aiding a robbery—only to avoid a more wrongful act—being killed by the three bank robbers.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这种借口被称为<em class="calibre8">胁迫</em>。如果人们只是因为合理地认为这样做是避免迫在眉睫的死亡或严重身体伤害的唯一方法而犯罪，那么他们就有借口而不构成犯罪。法律承认一个人可能被迫在两害中做出选择，如果他或她选择了两害中较轻的一种，法律就不会惩罚他或她。如果行为人做了错事，则可以免除他的罪责，但我们可以理解他这样做的原因并原谅他；司机协助银行抢劫犯并不好，但我们很难说他应该牺牲自己的生命。他参与抢劫只是因为抢劫犯说如果他不杀了他就会杀了他，而抢劫犯显然已经准备好、愿意并且能够实施这一威胁。惩罚他的行为是没有用的，因为我们无法阻止任何人这样做；即使意味着刑事处罚，任何人都会同意抢劫，因为受罚的可能性远不及即将面临的死亡威胁那么可怕。他的行为虽然有错，但错得也不算太离谱；如果司机在抢劫过程中被迫开枪打死了人，情况就不同了。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This excuse is known as <em class="calibre8">duress</em>. Where people commit a crime only because they reasonably believe that doing so is the only way to avoid imminent death or serious bodily injury, they have an excuse and are not guilty of the crime. The law recognizes that a person may be forced to choose between two evils and it does not punish someone if he or she chooses the lesser of the two evils. An actor is excused if he does something that is wrong, but we can understand the reasons for doing so and forgive him for it; it wasn’t good that the driver aided the bank robbers, but we would be hard-pressed to say he should have sacrificed his life instead. He only participated in the robbery because the robbers said they would kill him if he didn’t, a threat they were apparently ready, willing, and able to carry out. It would do no good to punish his action because we couldn’t deter anyone from acting this way; any person would go along with the robbery even if it meant criminal punishment, because the possibility of punishment is not as bad as the imminent threat of being killed. And what he did was wrong but not too wrong; it would be a different case if the driver, under duress, had shot someone during the course of the robbery.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>诸如精神错乱、醉酒和胁迫等辩护早已被认可，但诸如此类的辩护理由远不止于此。随着我们对影响犯罪行为的社会、生物和心理因素的理解不断加深，律师们认为，新的辩护理由应该得到认可。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Defenses such as insanity, intoxication, and duress have been recognized for a long time, but the list of excuses is not closed. As our understanding of the social, biological, and psychological factors that influence criminal behavior expands, lawyers argue that new defenses should be recognized.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>百万富翁女继承人帕蒂·赫斯特被激进组织“共生解放军”绑架，随后参与了一起银行抢劫案。被捕受审后，她声称抢劫案的不是她，而是“塔尼娅”，一个被绑架者洗脑后成为革命者的她。退伍军人认为，战争造成的心理创伤——一种美国精神病学协会认可的创伤后应激障碍——导致他们失去控制，犯下谋杀和强奸等罪行。十几岁的兄弟莱尔和埃里克·梅内德斯一天晚上在自家客厅用猎枪打死了他们的父母，最终声称多年的虐待导致了杀戮。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Millionaire heiress Patty Hearst was kidnapped by the militant group Symbionese Liberation Army; subsequently she participated with the group in a bank robbery. When she was arrested and tried, she claimed that it was not she, Patty Hearst, who had committed the robbery, but “Tanya,” the revolutionary she had become after being brainwashed by her captors. Veterans have argued that psychological trauma induced by war—a form of posttraumatic stress disorder, which is recognized by the American Psychiatric Association—caused them to lose control and commit crimes including murder and rape. Teenage brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez shotgunned their parents to death in the family’s living room one night and eventually claimed that years of abuse had led to the killings.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>批评者嘲笑这类辩护，认为它们否认个人责任，是那些喜欢玩弄垃圾科学的律师们孤注一掷的伎俩。哈佛法学院教授艾伦·德肖维茨列举并批评了五十多种“虐待借口”。支持者认为，至少其中一些辩护是合理的，因为刑法传统的区分过于僵化：精神正常或精神失常，是否受到直接挑衅。随着我们逐渐理解导致……的复杂因素，<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_286" class="calibre4"></a>他们表示，对于犯罪行为，法律需要对自由意志和应受谴责性做出更细致的判断。其中一些辩护已被接受，另一些则尚未被接受，但这场争论肯定还会继续。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Critics deride defenses like these as a denial of personal responsibility and the desperate tactic of creative lawyers using junk science. Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz cataloged and criticized over fifty types of the “abuse excuse.” Advocates argue that at least some of these defenses are legitimate, because the criminal law’s traditional distinctions are too rigid: sane or insane, subject to immediate provocation or not. As we come to understand the complex factors that contribute to <a class="calibre4"></a>criminal acts, they say, the law needs to make more nuanced judgments about free will and blameworthiness. Some of these defenses have been accepted and others have not, but the debate is certain to continue.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0014_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-8-div1-10"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0080" class="calibre1">某人会因几乎犯罪而被定罪吗？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0080" class="calibre1">Can Someone Be Convicted for Almost Committing a Crime?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">大多数情况下，一个人只有满足犯罪定义的所有要素才会被定罪。例如，谋杀就是故意杀人。想一想<em class="calibre8">《教父》</em>中对维托·柯里昂先生暗杀的案例。暴发户萨拉佐和塔塔利亚家族派两名杀手在柯里昂先生买水果时向他开枪。如果柯里昂先生死了，杀手们就犯了谋杀罪；但是既然他没有死，杀手们是否只犯了加重殴打罪？或者他们是否可以因打算完成但未完成的事情（即谋杀未遂）而被起诉？此外，如果柯里昂先生死了，萨拉佐和塔塔利亚家族怎么办？他们没有开枪，但他们是这次行动的幕后策划者和资金提供者。他们是否可以因其所扮演的角色（即教唆犯罪或密谋犯罪）而被定罪？</p><p class="noindent">Most of the time a person can be convicted of a crime only if he or she has satisfied all of the elements of the definition of the crime. Murder, for example, is an intentional killing. Think about the attempt on Don Vito Corleone’s life in <em class="calibre8">The Godfather</em>. The upstart mobster Salazzo and the Tattaglia family have two hit men shoot Don Corleone while he is buying fruit. If the Don dies, the hit men have committed murder; but since he doesn’t, have the hit men only committed an aggravated battery? Or can they be prosecuted for what they intended to accomplish but failed to do—that is, for the attempted murder? Furthermore, if the Don dies, what about Salazzo and the Tattaglias? They didn’t do the shooting, but they were the brains and the money behind the operation. Can they be convicted for their role—that is, for soliciting the crime or conspiring to commit it?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这些问题涉及所谓的<em class="calibre8">未遂犯罪</em>，因为犯罪行为尚未完成或尚未完成。杀手的谋杀罪是不完整的，因为唐并没有死；而萨拉佐和塔塔利亚斯的犯罪也是不完美的，因为他们实际上并没有杀死任何人。刑法惩处三种未遂犯罪：<em class="calibre8">未遂、教唆</em>和<em class="calibre8">共谋</em>。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These issues involve what are known as <em class="calibre8">inchoate crimes</em>, because the criminal acts are incomplete or imperfect. The hit men’s crime of murder is incomplete because the Don did not die, and Salazzo and the Tattaglias’ crime is imperfect because they did not actually kill anyone. Criminal law punishes three inchoate crimes: <em class="calibre8">attempt, solicitation</em>, and <em class="calibre8">conspiracy</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>刑法惩罚未遂犯罪有两个简单的原因。首先，参与未遂、教唆或共谋的人与实际犯罪的人一样危险。射击不准的杀手、策划袭击的头目以及雇佣杀手的中间人，都与真正成功的杀手一样应受谴责。“一样”应受谴责是一个必要的条件，因为关于未遂犯罪者是否应与完成任务的人受到同样严厉的惩罚存在很多争议。一方面，他们具有相同程度的道德责任；一个开枪但瞄准不准的枪手在道德上与瞄准更好的枪手一样有责任。另一方面，他们造成的伤害程度不同，法律通常不会仅仅因为人们的意图程度而惩罚他们，即使他们没有造成伤害。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Criminal law punishes inchoate offenses for two simple reasons. First, people who engage in attempts, solicitations, or conspiracies are about as dangerous as those who actually commit the crimes. The hit men who don’t shoot accurately, the bosses who plan the hit, and the intermediaries who hire the hit men all are about as culpable as a hit man who actually succeeds. “About” as culpable is a necessary qualification, because there is much debate about whether someone who commits an inchoate offense should be punished as severely as someone who finishes the job. On the one hand, they have the same degree of moral culpability; a gunman who shoots but has bad aim is morally as responsible as one with better aim. On the other hand, they have not caused the same degree of harm, and the law usually doesn’t punish people just for the level of their intent without resulting harm.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>其次，确立犯罪未遂对执法部门而言至关重要。如果谋杀未遂不构成犯罪，那么目睹杀手拔枪接近唐·科里昂的警察就无法在开枪前逮捕他们。许多犯罪，包括所谓的<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_287" class="calibre4"></a>无受害人犯罪的起诉取决于未遂和引诱罪的起诉。警方通常无法证明卖淫行为，因为抓获妓女及其嫖客极其困难，但他们可以使用诱饵和卧底特工与妓女或嫖客达成协议，然后他们可能因引诱罪被起诉。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Second, establishing inchoate crimes is necessary for law enforcement. If attempted murder was not a crime, a police officer who observed the hit men pulling out their guns and approaching Don Corleone could not arrest them until shots were fired. And many crimes, including so-called <a class="calibre4"></a>victimless crimes, depend on attempt and solicitation prosecutions. The police usually cannot prove prostitution because it is extraordinarily difficult to catch a prostitute and her customer in the act, but they can use decoys and undercover agents to reach agreement with the prostitute or the customer, who then may be prosecuted for solicitation.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>将未遂犯罪用作执法工具，引发了该领域的核心问题。一个人尚未满足犯罪构成要件，例如谋杀或卖淫，但她做了其他事，表明她应该受到惩罚。但“其他事”究竟是什么？如果我们对“其他事”的定义过于狭隘，未遂犯罪就会失去效力。如果我们对“其他事”的定义过于宽泛，我们就会将那些远未造成伤害的行为定为犯罪。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The use of inchoate crimes as a law enforcement tool raises the central problem in this area. A person has not satisfied the elements of an offense, such as murder or prostitution, but she has done something else that suggests that she ought to be punished. But what exactly is that something else? If we define the something else too narrowly, the inchoate crimes will lose their effect. If we define it too broadly, we will criminalize behavior that is far removed from causing harm.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>先从犯罪未遂律入手，看看这个问题是如何解决的。刑法中的犯罪未遂定义与其他意义上的犯罪未遂非常相似：当某人试图完成某事时，即为犯罪未遂。因此，犯罪未遂的心理要件是指犯罪的意图。行为要件则更为复杂。大多数犯罪都涉及一系列事件，从形成犯罪意图开始，到犯罪准备，再到犯罪本身。<em class="calibre8">《教父》</em>中的杀手们首先同意谋杀教父，然后监视他几天，找出他最容易受到攻击的时间；他们弄到枪，在水果店外等候，看到教父过来时下车，拔枪，最后向他开枪。在这些环节中，他们哪个阶段已经进展到足以以谋杀未遂的罪名受到惩罚呢？假设警方发现了他们的计划，他们要等多久才能逮捕他们，并以谋杀未遂的罪名定罪？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Begin with the law of attempt to see how this problem works out. An attempt in criminal law is defined much like an attempt in any other sense of the word: Someone attempts something when he or she tries to accomplish it. Therefore, the mental element of an attempted crime is the intent to commit the crime. The complications arise with the act element. Most crimes involve a chain of events, beginning with formulating the intention to commit the crime through getting ready for it to committing the act itself. The hit men in <em class="calibre8">The Godfather</em> first agree to murder the Don, then they stake him out for several days to find a time in his schedule when he is most vulnerable; they obtain guns, wait outside the fruit store, get out of their car when they see the Don coming, pull their guns, and finally fire at him. At which of those points have they gone far enough along to punish them for attempted murder? Suppose the police catch wind of the plan. How long do they have to wait before they can arrest them and get a conviction for attempted murder?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法院和立法机构构建了各种各样的测试标准，以确定潜在犯罪者的行为是否足以构成犯罪未遂。这些测试标准揭示了法律中一个重要且普遍存在的规律。如果测试标准相对清晰易行，那么在很多情况下，它会产生错误的结果——这种错误体现在未能充分平衡预防犯罪行为的需要和只惩罚犯罪者的意愿之间。为了平衡这些政策，需要一种更模糊、更开放的测试标准，但任何类似的测试标准都难以应用，而且难以预测。不妨考虑其中一种测试标准。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Courts and legislatures have constructed a variety of tests to determine when a would-be criminal has done enough so that a criminal attempt has been committed. The tests illustrate something important and ubiquitous in law. If the test is relatively clear and easy to apply, it produces wrong results in many cases—wrong in the sense of not adequately balancing the need to prevent criminal behavior and the desire to only punish the guilty. To balance those policies, it takes a vaguer, more open-ended test, but any test like that becomes difficult and unpredictable to apply. Consider just one of the tests.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>《模范刑法典》规定，如果被告实施的行为是“计划最终导致犯罪的行为过程中的实质性步骤”，且该实质性步骤“强烈证实了行为人的犯罪目的”，则将对犯罪未遂进行惩罚。这允许陪审团评估所有事实，并确定被告是否以某种有意义的方式企图犯罪，但这需要高度的<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_288" class="calibre4"></a>个体化、不可预测的判决取决于每个案件的具体事实。为了使判决更具可预测性，《刑法典》列出了一些构成实质性步骤的行为，例如等待受害人或在犯罪现场附近持有犯罪工具。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Model Penal Code punishes an attempt if the defendant has committed an act that is “a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in...commission of the crime” if the substantial step “is strongly corroborative of the actor’s criminal purpose.” This allows the jury to assess all the facts and determine whether the defendant in some meaningful way attempted the crime, but it requires a highly <a class="calibre4"></a>individualized, unpredictable determination on the facts of each case. To make things more predictable, the Code lists some actions that constitute substantial steps, such as lying in wait for the victim or possessing near the crime scene the tools to be used.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第二种未遂罪是教唆。教唆是指试图引诱他人犯罪。与未遂罪类似，如果犯罪已成，则教唆罪与实质犯罪合并。如果塔塔利亚家族让杀手刺杀唐·科里昂，他们可能都应对这起谋杀案承担某种责任。如果杀手拒绝执行任务，那么塔塔利亚可能仍需承担教唆罪的责任。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A second inchoate crime is solicitation. Solicitation involves trying to get someone else to commit a crime. Like attempt, if the crime is completed, the solicitation merges with the substantive offense. If the Tattaglia family gets the hit men to kill Don Corleone, they may all be liable in some way for the murder. If the hit men refuse the job, then Tattaglia may still be liable for solicitation.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>定义教唆犯罪与定义犯罪未遂存在同样的问题。要求或诱导他人犯罪的人是危险人物，警方理应有权在犯罪发生前介入，法院也应有权予以惩罚。但要求他人犯罪与犯罪本身造成的危害之间存在一定距离，因此，如果教唆犯罪的标准过于宽泛，我们几乎等于惩罚那些考虑犯罪或仅仅实施了犯罪准备行为的人。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Defining solicitation presents the same problem as defining attempts. Someone who asks or induces someone else to commit a crime is a dangerous person, and the police ought to be able to intervene and the courts able to punish before the crime is committed. But asking someone to commit a crime lies at some distance from the harm caused by the crime itself, so if the standard for solicitation is too broad, we come close to punishing someone for thinking about a crime or only engaging in preliminary acts.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>未遂和教唆针对的是几乎犯罪，即危险但尚未构成明确犯罪的行为。然而，未遂和教唆也有其限度，立法机构通过设立新的犯罪类别来应对这些限制，旨在在行为尚未构成犯罪之前就将其定为犯罪。跟踪就是一个例子。假设一个男人对他的前妻感到愤怒，他坐在车里，在她家门外，跟踪她上班，并在她约会时闲逛。这些行为本身并不构成犯罪，但可能会导致构成犯罪的行为；前妻担心他会攻击她。一些立法机构对此作出了回应，将跟踪定为犯罪。例如，加利福尼亚州的一项法规规定，“任何故意、恶意和反复跟踪或骚扰他人，并制造可信威胁，意图使该人对其安全产生合理担忧的人”都将受到惩罚。这类法规引发了所有未遂犯罪的问题。在一个人明显实施犯罪行为之前，我们什么时候才能惩罚他？如果我们等得太久，可能来不及阻止伤害的发生；如果我们行动得太早，我们可能将太多行为定为犯罪，包括那些无害的行为。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Attempt and solicitation aim at almost-crimes, acts that are dangerous but that have not yet culminated in a defined offense. Attempt and solicitation have their limits, though, and legislatures have responded to those limits by creating new classes of offenses, designed to make conduct criminal even before it comes to fruition. An example is stalking. Suppose a man is angry at his ex-wife and sits in his car outside her house, follows her to work, and hangs around when she goes out on dates. None of this behavior is criminal, but it might result in actions that are; the ex-wife is afraid that he might attack her. Some legislatures have responded by criminalizing stalking. A California statute, for example, punishes “Any person who willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly follows or harasses another person and who makes a credible threat with the intent to place that person in reasonable fear for his or her safety.” Such statutes raise all the problems of inchoate crimes. How early can we punish someone before he has committed a clearly criminal act? If we wait too long, we may be too late to prevent the harm from occurring; if we act too early, we may criminalize too much behavior, including behavior that isn’t harmful.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>共谋是第三种未完成罪，也是检察官最常用的罪名。共谋是指两人或两人以上达成协议，意图实施非法行为。塔塔利亚家族的头目雇佣杀手，他们自己并没有杀死唐·科里昂，但他们可能要为杀手的行为承担责任，因为他们都是同一阴谋的一部分。更广泛地说，所有成员<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_289" class="calibre4"></a>塔塔利亚家族可能被认定为共谋者，因为他们参与了更广泛的犯罪活动，包括赌博、贩毒、卖淫和一般暴力行为。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Conspiracy is the third inchoate offense, and the one that is most widely used by prosecutors. A conspiracy is an agreement among two or more persons with the purpose of committing an unlawful act. The bosses of the Tattaglia family hire the hit men and don’t themselves kill Don Corleone, but they can be liable for the hit men’s acts because they are all part of the same scheme. More broadly, all of the members of the <a class="calibre4"></a>Tattaglia family might be liable as conspirators because they engage in a broader criminal enterprise that involves gambling, drug dealing, prostitution, and general thuggery.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>共谋不仅惩罚类似未遂和教唆等近似犯罪，还涉及更广泛的群体犯罪问题。无论是塔塔利亚家族还是贩毒集团，犯罪集团的危险性远不止其成员实际犯下的罪行累积；该集团有可能在更长的时间内犯下更多罪行，并通过成员之间的分工（例如，头目和杀手各司其职）提高犯罪效率，并相互支持和鼓励成员的犯罪活动。与此同时，共谋是一种比未遂或教唆更具问题的早期犯罪。同意犯罪意味着什么？同意犯罪的一方在多大程度上要为他人的行为承担责任？塔塔利亚家族中地位最低的士兵是否要为家族任何成员犯下的所有犯罪和暴力行为承担刑事责任？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Conspiracy not only punishes near-crimes, like attempt and solicitation, but it also deals with the broader problem of group criminality. A criminal group, whether the Tattaglia family or a drug cartel, is more dangerous than just the cumulation of the crimes that its members actually commit; the group holds the potential of committing more crimes over a longer period of time, becoming more effective at crime through the division of labor among its members (bosses and hit men using their respective talents, for example) and providing mutual support and encouragement for criminal activity by its members. At the same time, conspiracy is an even more problematic inchoate crime than attempt or solicitation. What does it mean to agree to commit a crime, and to what extent is one of the agreeing parties liable for the acts of others? Is the lowliest soldier in the Tattaglia family criminally responsible for all of the acts of crime and violence committed by any member of the family?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>共谋被称为“检察官的宠儿”，正是因为它的潜在范围之广。共谋的实体法和审判程序为检方带来了诸多优势。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Conspiracy has been called “the darling of the prosecutor’s nursery” precisely because of its potential breadth. The substantive law of conspiracy and the procedures at trial carry a number of advantages for the prosecution.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>首先，共谋的本质是合谋，因此，共谋者可以因一些行为被定罪，这些行为与实际犯罪后果的距离远超未遂法所规定的范围。但仅仅惩罚合谋，就如同惩罚没有行为的故意一样，而刑法从未这样做过。大多数司法管辖区对此问题的回应是，除了合谋之外，还要求证明一名同谋者为推进共谋而采取了明显的行动，但这对检察官来说负担不大，因为几乎任何行为都可以。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>First, the essence of conspiracy is agreement, so conspirators can be convicted for acts that are much more remote from actual criminal consequences than are required for the law of attempts. But punishing the agreement alone is very much like punishing an intention without an act, which criminal law never does. Most jurisdictions have responded to this problem by requiring proof of an overt act by one co-conspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy in addition to the agreement, but that is not much of a burden for prosecutors, for almost any act will do.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>其次，与其他未遂罪不同，在大多数司法管辖区，共谋并不并入既遂犯罪。如果杀手得逞，他们可以被指控谋杀，但不能同时被指控谋杀未遂。然而，如果袭击成功，他们和其他所有涉案人员都可以被指控谋杀和共谋谋杀，并分别就每项罪名分别判刑。因此，共谋会加重犯罪的刑罚。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Second, unlike other inchoate offenses, in most jurisdictions conspiracy does not merge into the completed crime. If the hit men succeed, they can be charged with murder but not also with attempted murder. However, if the hit succeeds, they and everyone else involved can be charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder and sentenced independently for each. Conspiracy therefore has the effect of increasing the punishment for the crime.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第三，共谋中的每个参与者都可能对该团伙中任何其他成员实施的犯罪行为承担责任。这极大地扩大了任何特定参与者的责任范围，不仅会导致更多人被定罪，还使检察官能够对其中一名参与者施加相当大的影响力，使其与其他人达成协议，作证指控他们，尽管他可能要为这些行为承担责任。<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_290" class="calibre4"></a>并未参与。传统规则对责任规定较为宽泛：共谋者应对其同谋者为进一步实施共谋而实施的任何合理可预见的犯罪行为负责。如今，大多数司法管辖区遵循《模范刑法典》，适用更为狭窄的规则，被告仅对其唆使、协助或同意实施的犯罪行为负责。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Third, every participant in a conspiracy is potentially liable for a criminal act committed by any other member of the group. This dramatically expands the scope of liability of any particular participant, which not only leads to more convictions but also allows prosecutors to exert considerable leverage on one participant to cut a deal to testify against others, at the risk of being liable for far-flung acts in which he <a class="calibre4"></a>did not take part. A traditional rule imposed liability broadly: A conspirator is responsible for any reasonably foreseeable crime committed by a co-conspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy. Today most jurisdictions, following the Model Penal Code, apply a narrower rule, making defendants responsible only for crimes which they solicited, aided, or agreed to.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第四，共谋案不同于其他任何犯罪，因为正常的程序规则会放宽，有利于控方。所有共谋者可以一并受审。这看似高效；针对所有人的证据大多相同。但这也造成了庭审规模庞大、程序复杂，不利于被告。当针对某一被告的证据与针对所有被告的证据相混淆时，存在因案关联而定罪的危险。辩护律师也面临一个问题：如果犯罪行为明显存在，每个被告都试图通过指控其他被告来脱罪，这样做的结果是所有被告最终都会受到牵连。此外，传闻证据通常不予采纳，除非被告本人做出有罪陈述。然而，在共谋案中，通常只针对一名被告的传闻证据，却可以采纳针对所有被告的传闻证据。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Fourth, a conspiracy case is different from any other crime in that normal procedural rules are relaxed in favor of the prosecution. All the conspirators can be tried together. This seems efficient; much of the evidence will be the same against all of them. But it also creates massive, complex trials that disadvantage the defendants. There is the danger of guilt by association, when evidence against one blends into an inference of evidence of all. Defense lawyers also have a problem: If it is apparent that a crime has been committed, it may make sense for each defendant to try to get off by accusing the others, with the consequence that all end up being implicated. Moreover, hearsay evidence normally is not admissible, except for an incriminating statement made by the defendant. In a conspiracy case, though, hearsay that ordinarily would be admissible only against one defendant can be admitted against all the defendants.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>还有一种情况，一个人可能需要为自己没有犯下的罪行承担责任。这种情况称为<em class="calibre8">共犯责任</em>，即共犯没有实施犯罪行为，但帮助了犯罪分子实施犯罪行为。共犯责任有点像共谋，但它侧重于行为本身而不是协议。将杀手送到犯罪现场并帮助他们逃跑的汽车司机并没有杀死唐·科里昂，但他仍然要对谋杀负法律责任。根据刑事责任的基本原则，司机参与了杀人行为，并且是故意杀人。在犯罪分子犯罪后帮助罪犯掩盖罪行或逃避起诉的人也应作为共犯承担法律责任。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There is one other circumstance in which someone can be liable for a crime she didn’t commit. This is called <em class="calibre8">accomplice liability</em>, when the accomplice doesn’t perform the criminal act but helps the criminal do so. Accomplice liability is somewhat like conspiracy, but it focuses on the act rather than the agreement. The driver of the car who takes the hit men to the scene of the crime and helps them with their getaway afterward has not killed Don Corleone, but he still is liable for the murder. On basic principles of criminal responsibility, the driver has participated in the act of killing with the intent that it occur. Someone who helps a criminal conceal the crime or escape prosecution after it has been committed also is liable as an accomplice.</p>

<p class="noindent">一本入门书籍只能定义和讨论几种罪行。例如，新泽西州的法规定义了200多种不同的罪行，从谋杀到操纵棒球比赛。立法机构不断扩充清单，将某些行为定为犯罪，以应对特定的社会问题或政治诉求。因此，我们将探讨几种非常重要且能阐明刑法普遍问题的罪行，首先从最严重的罪行开始：<em class="calibre8">杀人罪</em>，即杀害他人。</p><p class="noindent">An introductory book can only define and discuss a few crimes. New Jersey statutes, for example, define more than 200 separate offenses, from murder to fixing a baseball game. The legislatures keep adding to the list, making some conduct criminal in response to a particular social problem or political demand. So we consider a few crimes that are very important and that illustrate general issues about criminal law, starting with the most serious crime: <em class="calibre8">homicide</em>, or the killing of a person.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>凶杀案是完美的起点，不仅因为犯罪的重要性，还因为<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_291" class="calibre4"></a>杀人案体现了刑法史上的基本运作原则：各种罪行之间的区分日益精细，而区分的难度也日益加大。五百年前，英国普通法只定义了一种杀人罪——谋杀，以及一种惩罚——死刑。自那时起，法院和立法机构区分了多种不同类型的杀人罪，并规定了每种罪名适用的惩罚程度。每一步，他们都必须根据刑法的目的，区分严重程度较轻的罪行。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Homicide is the perfect place to start not only because of the importance of the crime but also because the development of the law of <a class="calibre4"></a>homicide exemplifies the basic operating principle in the history of criminal law: the drawing of increasingly fine distinctions between crimes and the difficulty of doing so. Five hundred years ago English common law defined only one kind of homicide—murder—and only one punishment—death. Since then courts and legislatures have separated many different kinds of homicide and defined the degrees of punishment that are appropriate to each. At each step they have to distinguish more serious from less serious crimes, based on the purposes of criminal law.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>首先，先说一个初步问题：杀人罪是指杀害人类的行为。一些案件一直在探讨人类生命何时开始和结束的问题，而这个问题在现代争议中再次浮现。普通法规则规定，胎儿在活着出生时即成为人类。一些立法机构也将胎儿发育的后期阶段纳入定义，或颁布了专门的法律来处理杀害胎儿的行为（当然，宪法保护了妇女堕胎的权利）。2004年，针对当时怀孕的拉西·彼得森被谋杀案（该案备受关注），国会颁布了《拉西和康纳法》，将杀害或伤害胎儿定为联邦犯罪。在生命的另一端，医疗技术的发展使得判断濒死者是否仍然活着变得更加复杂。大多数州都采用了以脑功能死亡为重点的定义，因此从严重、不可逆昏迷状态的人身上摘除呼吸机并不属于谋杀。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>First, a preliminary matter: Homicide entails the killing of a human being. A few cases have grappled with the question of when a human’s life begins and ends, and the issue resurfaces in modern controversies. The common law rule was that a fetus becomes a human being for this purpose when it is born alive. Some legislatures also have defined late stages of fetal development as within the definition or have enacted special statutes to deal with the killing of a fetus (subject, of course, to the constitutional protection of a woman’s decision to have an abortion). In 2004, Congress, in response to the highly publicized murder of Laci Peterson, who was pregnant at the time, enacted Laci and Connor’s Law, which made the killing or injury of a fetus a federal crime. At the other end of life, developments in medical technology have complicated the decision of whether someone near death is still alive. Most states have adopted a definition that focuses on the death of brain function, so that removing a respirator from a person in a severe, irreversible coma is not murder.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>杀人罪等级的扩散大致以以下方式进行。首先，过失杀人罪与谋杀罪区分开来。许多州仍在使用的传统谋杀定义是预谋恶意杀人。预谋恶意的法律定义与其字面含义大相径庭，与恶意或预谋都无关。相反，随着法律的发展，它变成了一部法典，代表一系列心理状态，其中一种状态是判定被告谋杀罪的必要条件。过失杀人罪涵盖所有其他类型的杀人罪。接下来，谋杀罪被划分为不同等级，通常是一级谋杀和二级谋杀。一级谋杀主要包括故意杀人；二级谋杀包括其他类型。最后，区分了故意杀人罪和非故意杀人罪。应激杀人是故意杀人的典型例子，而鲁莽或疏忽杀人则是非故意杀人罪。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The proliferation of degrees of homicide proceeded in roughly the following manner. First, manslaughter was distinguished from murder. The traditional definition of murder, still used in many states, is the killing of a human being with malice aforethought. The legal definition of malice aforethought is quite different from the obvious meaning of the words and has nothing to do either with malice or forethought. Instead, as the law developed it became a code, standing for a list of states of mind, one of which was required to convict a defendant of murder. Manslaughter includes every other type of homicide. Next, murder was separated into degrees, commonly first-degree and second-degree murder. First-degree murder basically included willful killings; second-degree included other kinds. Finally, voluntary and involuntary manslaughter were distinguished. Manslaughter under provocation is the typical instance of voluntary manslaughter, and reckless or negligent killing is involuntary manslaughter.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>让我们先从1995年俄克拉荷马城默拉联邦大楼爆炸案的一些假设开始。反政府恐怖分子蒂莫西·麦克维被判犯有该罪行。在检方的<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_292" class="calibre4"></a>据称，麦克维获取了制造巨型自制炸弹的材料，在一辆租来的卡车上制造了炸弹，并在德克萨斯州韦科惨案周年纪念日那天将卡车停在大楼外面，在那场惨案中，政府特工与麦克维同情的反政府邪教组织成员发生了战斗。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Let’s start with some hypotheticals based on the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995. Timothy McVeigh, an antigovernment terrorist, was convicted of the crime. In the prosecution’s <a class="calibre4"></a>account, McVeigh acquired the materials for a huge homemade bomb, constructed the bomb in a rental truck, and parked the truck outside the building on the anniversary of the tragedy in Waco, Texas, in which government agents battled the members of an antigovernment cult to which McVeigh was sympathetic.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>首先，假设麦克维杀害数十名政府工作人员以发表政治声明。这体现了第一类预谋恶意，即<em class="calibre8">故意杀人</em>。麦克维有意杀害政府工作人员，因此这是最严重的杀人罪。注意，我们不关心他的动机——他为什么要杀他们——而只关心他的意图——他想杀死他们。如果凶手的动机值得称赞，他仍然有杀人的意图；如果一个男人枪杀了身患绝症、痛苦不堪的老妻子，那么他只是想结束她的痛苦这一事实与他有罪的认定无关，尽管这可能与对他的惩罚有关。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>First take the facts as presented, and assume further that McVeigh wanted to kill scores of government workers to make a political statement. This exemplifies the first category of malice aforethought, known as <em class="calibre8">intent to kill</em>. McVeigh meant to bring about the deaths of government workers, so this is the most serious kind of homicide. Note that we do not care about his motive—why he wanted to kill them—but only his intention—that he wanted to kill them. If a killer acts out of a laudable motive, he still has the intent to kill; if a man shoots his aged wife who is suffering from a painful, terminal disease, the fact that he only wanted to end her misery is irrelevant to the determination of his guilt, although it may be relevant to his punishment.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>假设麦克维想通过破坏默拉大厦来表达他的政治立场，但并不特别在意杀人。他将装满炸弹的卡车停在大楼对面的街道上。即使大楼里有人遇害，麦克维仍然被认为有预谋的恶意，这有两种理论可供选择。如果他确信会有人丧生，因为他知道自己制造了一枚会引发巨大爆炸的炸弹，那么他同样有罪；他不一定想杀人，但他知道这会发生。如果他不知道爆炸的威力，也不在乎，那么他并非故意杀人，因为他知道自己的行为会导致他人死亡，但他仍然被认为有预谋的恶意，因为他的行为极其鲁莽，漠视人命——普通法中对此进行了生动的描述，称之为“堕落之心”。 （类似于同样的原则，只有以造成严重身体伤害为目的的杀人行为才属于谋杀；试图严重伤害他人则是鲁莽行为。）这体现了对人类生命的重视，也表明预谋恶意与预谋杀人实际上毫无关系。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Suppose that McVeigh wants to make his political statement by damaging the Murrah Building but doesn’t particularly care about killing anyone. He parks the bomb-laden truck across the street from the building. When people in the building are killed, McVeigh is still held to have acted with malice aforethought, under either of two theories. If he was substantially certain that some people would die, because he knew he had constructed a bomb that would cause a huge blast, he is just as guilty; he didn’t necessarily want to kill anyone, but he knew it was going to happen. If he didn’t know how strong the blast was going to be and didn’t care, either, then he didn’t intend to kill in the sense that he knew his actions would result in someone’s death, but he is still regarded as acting with malice aforethought because he acted with extremely reckless disregard for human life—what the common law colorfully called a “depraved heart.” (Something like the same principle made homicide committed only with the intent to commit serious bodily injury murder; it is reckless to attempt to injure someone so severely.) This reflects the value placed on human life, and it also shows that malice aforethought really has nothing to do with premeditated murder.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>假设，让我们回到过去，来说明预谋恶意的最后一个分支。麦克维用化肥、燃油和雷管引爆的化学物质制造了炸弹。假设他通过抢劫建筑工地获得了雷​​管。一名建筑工人在抢劫过程中惊慌失措，意外引爆了雷管，导致其死亡。根据谋杀的一般规则，麦克维的行为并不构成预谋恶意，因为他并非有意杀害该工人，而抢劫建筑工地本身并不构成预谋恶意。<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_293" class="calibre4"></a>漠视人命，不顾后果。然而，传统上，根据<em class="calibre8">重罪谋杀规则，</em>麦克维应承担谋杀罪。在实施重罪（例如抢劫）过程中造成的死亡，无论凶手是否有杀人意图，均自动构成谋杀。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hypothetically, let’s go back in time to illustrate the final branch of malice aforethought. McVeigh constructed his bomb of fertilizer, fuel oil, and chemicals triggered by blasting caps. Suppose he obtained the blasting caps by robbing a construction site. A construction worker, alarmed during the robbery, accidentally triggers a blasting cap, which explodes, killing her. Under the ordinary rules of murder, McVeigh has not acted with malice aforethought because he did not intend to kill the worker and robbing a construction site does not in itself display a <a class="calibre4"></a>reckless indifference to human life. Nevertheless, traditionally McVeigh would be responsible for murder under the <em class="calibre8">felony murder rule</em>. A death caused in the course of committing a felony (such as robbery) automatically becomes murder whether or not the killer intends to kill.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>重罪谋杀规则将重罪执行过程中的杀人行为定为严格责任犯罪。即使罪犯并非故意杀人，甚至并非疏忽大意，他仍然要承担谋杀罪的责任。该规则的主要依据在于，为可能犯下严重罪行的人提供额外的震慑，并使其认识到即使没有明确的杀人意图，后果的严重性。但法院对这种逻辑感到不安，尤其是在该规则扩展到不那么明显的案件之后。假设麦克维试图伪造购买炸药所需的联邦许可证来获取雷管。当他将伪造的许可证出示给制造商时，制造商的库存管理员掉落了雷管，导致其爆炸身亡。假设伪造联邦许可证构成重罪，那么麦克维是否构成重罪谋杀？这似乎有些过分，所以现在大多数司法管辖区将重罪谋杀规则的适用范围限制在危及生命的暴力重罪，甚至仅限于一些特定的最严重重罪，例如强奸、抢劫、绑架、纵火和入室盗窃。许多司法管辖区限制在重罪过程中发生的杀人行为是否构成重罪谋杀；如果麦克维和同伙在建筑工地抢劫，而一名赶到现场的警察开枪打死了正在逃跑的同伙，麦克维就不会被判重罪谋杀。而《模范刑法典》关于重罪谋杀的规定只是推定在危险重罪过程中的杀人行为是鲁莽的（因此构成谋杀），允许被告试图反驳这一推定。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The felony murder rule makes a killing in the course of a felony a strict liability crime. Even if the criminal did not intend to kill, or was not even careless in that respect, he is still liable for murder. The principal justifications for the rule are to provide an added deterrent for those who might commit serious crimes and to recognize the seriousness of the consequence even in the absence of the specific intent to kill. But the courts have been uneasy with that logic, particularly as the doctrine was extended to less obvious cases. Suppose that McVeigh attempts to secure the blasting caps by forging the federal license that is required to purchase explosives. When he presents that forged license to a manufacturer, the manufacturer’s stock clerk drops the blasting caps, which explode, killing him. Assuming it is a felony to forge the federal certificate, has McVeigh committed felony murder? This seems to go too far, so most jurisdictions now limit the application of the felony murder rule either to violent felonies that are dangerous to life or even a specified list of the most serious felonies, such as rape, robbery, kidnapping, arson, and burglary. Many jurisdictions limit which killings in the course of a felony count as felony murders; if McVeigh and an accomplice were robbing a construction site and a police officer coming upon the crime shot the accomplice, who was fleeing, McVeigh would not be guilty of felony murder. And the Model Penal Code’s provision on felony murder only creates a presumption that a killing in the course of a dangerous felony is reckless (and therefore murder), allowing the defendant to try to rebut the presumption.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>从故意杀人到实质确定性杀人，再到极度鲁莽，最后到重罪谋杀，以此作为将杀人行为纳入谋杀定义的基础，通过类比过程扩大了责任范围。极度鲁莽的行为与故意杀人行为并不完全相同，但仍然相当严重，因此法院将其定为谋杀。然而，下一步是区分不同类型的谋杀。有些谋杀比其他谋杀更严重，因此应该受到更严厉的惩罚吗？特别是，应该对所有类型的谋杀判处死刑，还是只对其中一些最严重的谋杀判处死刑？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Moving from intent to kill to substantial certainty to extreme recklessness to felony murder as a basis for including a killing within the definition of murder expands the scope of responsibility by a process of analogy. Acting with extreme recklessness isn’t quite the same thing as acting with intent, but it is still pretty serious, so the courts made it punishable as murder. The next step, though, is to make distinctions among the different kinds of murder. Are some more serious than others, and therefore deserving of more serious punishment? In particular, should the death penalty be imposed for all types of murder or only for some of the most serious?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>经典的谋杀罪名分为一级谋杀和二级谋杀，只有一级谋杀者才可被判处死刑。根据1794年宾夕法尼亚州的一项法律，一级谋杀必须是“故意、蓄意和有预谋的”；<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_294" class="calibre4"></a>也就是说，凶手必须冷静且有意识地做出杀人决定。宾夕法尼亚州的法规列出了符合该定义的谋杀类型：“所有以毒药或埋伏手段实施的谋杀。”该法规还将在最严重重罪过程中犯下的杀人罪定为一级谋杀。所有其他类型的谋杀均归为二级谋杀。因此，没有预谋和深思熟虑的故意杀人、极其鲁莽的谋杀以及其他形式的重罪谋杀都属于二级谋杀，历史上，二级谋杀不会被判处死刑。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The classic formulation separated murder into first-degree and second-degree murder, with only first-degree murderers capable of being sentenced to death. Based on a 1794 Pennsylvania statute, first-degree murder had to be “willful, deliberate, and premeditated”; <a class="calibre4"></a>that is, the killer must have coolly and consciously arrived at the decision to kill. The Pennsylvania statute suggested the kinds of murder that would fall within the definition: “all murder which shall be perpetrated by means of poison, or by lying in wait.” The statute also punished as first-degree murder killings committed in the course of the most serious felonies. All other kinds of murder are classified as second degree. Thus intentional killings without premeditation and deliberation, extremely reckless murder, and other forms of felony murder would be murders of the second degree, which, historically, were not punishable by death.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>下毒或埋伏杀人的人显然是经过深思熟虑的，比那些蓄意杀人但缺乏同等程度思考的人更应受到谴责。然而，一旦这种蓄意和预谋的模式确立，其界限就变得难以界定。一位妻子想毒死丈夫，以便领取人寿保险并与情人结婚，她可能会策划这场谋杀数周，包括计算合适的剂量、非法获取毒药、设法掩盖其味道，以及寻找机会下毒。假设同一位妻子，之前从未考虑过这个计划，正准备做晚饭时，她意识到只要在丈夫的肉饼里放点老鼠药，就能轻易置他于死地。她是否经过深思熟虑和预谋？大多数法院会给出肯定的答案。假设她正准备把食物端上餐桌时，她意识到如果把错误的盘子递给他，可能会害死他，因为她的食物中含有一种他高度过敏的成分。法院越来越要求经过一段时间的计划和审议才能判定一级谋杀罪。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Someone who kills by poison or lying in wait obviously has calculated his act and deserves a special kind of condemnation, more so than one who kills intentionally but without the same degree of reflection. Once the deliberate and premeditated formula was established, however, its limits became hard to define. A wife who wishes to poison her husband so she can collect life insurance and marry her lover might plan the murder for weeks by calculating the proper dosage, illegally obtaining the poison, figuring out how to disguise its taste, and looking for an opportunity to administer the fatal potion. Suppose instead that the same wife, who has not previously considered the scheme, is about to make supper when she realizes she could easily do away with her husband by slipping some rat poison into his meatloaf. Has she deliberated and premeditated? Most courts would say yes. Suppose she is about to place the food on the table when she realizes she could kill her husband by handing him the wrong plate, since her food contains an ingredient to which he is highly allergic. Increasingly, courts have required planning and deliberation over a period of time to find first-degree murder.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>《模范刑法典》通过废除一级谋杀和二级谋杀之间的区别，解决了区分一级谋杀和二级谋杀的难题。它首先将谋杀定义为“在极端漠视人类生命价值的情况下”故意、明知或鲁莽地实施的杀人行为。然后，它规定了在确定是否应判处死刑时应考虑的<em class="calibre8">加重和减轻处罚因素</em>。加重和减轻处罚因素涉及犯罪的性质——是“为了金钱利益而实施”还是“特别令人发指、残暴或残酷，表现出极度堕落”，还是“是在被告认为为其行为提供道德正当性或减轻处罚的情况下实施的”。它们还会考虑罪犯的事实，例如他是否有过犯罪前科、年龄以及他对其行为不法性的认知能力。在这方面，《模范刑法典》进一步细化了犯罪类别，将……<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_295" class="calibre4"></a>不仅要区分一般犯罪，还要区分个别犯罪情况和犯罪者。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Model Penal Code addressed the difficulty of distinguishing between first- and second-degree murder by abolishing the distinction. It first defines murder as a killing caused purposely, knowingly, or recklessly “under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.” It then states <em class="calibre8">aggravating and mitigating factors</em> that are to be taken into account in determining whether the death penalty should be imposed. The aggravating and mitigating factors address the nature of the crime—whether it was “committed for pecuniary gain” or was “especially heinous, atrocious or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity,” or “was committed under circumstances which the defendant believed to provide a moral justification or extenuation for his conduct.” They also consider facts about the criminal, such as whether he has committed previous crimes, his age, and his capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his act. In this respect, the Code exemplifies a further extension of the refinement of criminal categories, drawing <a class="calibre4"></a>distinctions not only among crimes in general but also among their individual circumstances and the persons who commit them.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>刑事杀人罪的下一个层次的区别是谋杀和<em class="calibre8">过失杀人</em>。有些杀人行为严重到应受惩罚，但又不至于被归类为谋杀。这些杀人行为并非出于预谋恶意。正如我们所见，这个术语涵盖了各种极其恶劣的行为，而过失杀人也包含多种不同类型的杀人行为。在过失杀人罪中，还有<em class="calibre8">故意杀人罪</em>和<em class="calibre8">非故意</em>杀人罪的区别。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The next level of distinction among criminal homicides is between murder and <em class="calibre8">manslaughter</em>. Some killings are severe enough to merit punishment but not so severe that they deserve to be classified as murder. These are killings without malice aforethought. As we saw, that phrase is a catchall for various types of extremely bad acts, and manslaughter, too, comprises a number of different types of killings. And within manslaughter there is a further distinction between <em class="calibre8">voluntary</em> and <em class="calibre8">involuntary</em> manslaughter.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>属于故意杀人罪的主要杀人类型是，在受到足够刺激后，在激情之下杀人——这是在热血中杀人，而不是在冷血情况下杀人。故意杀人罪的一个典型例子是，一个男人回家后发现妻子和另一个男人上床，他妒火中烧，开枪打死了情妇。传统的法官理解丈夫如何因妻子的不忠而震惊不已，或因尊严受到侮辱而怒火中烧，最终失去控制；虽然杀死情妇并非值得称赞的行为，但至少可以理解，因此即使存在杀人意图，其犯罪程度也比谋杀要轻。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The major type of killing falling within voluntary manslaughter is killing under the heat of passion caused by a sufficient provocation—killing in hot blood, rather than the cold blood required for murder. One of the classic illustrations of voluntary manslaughter is the man who comes home, finds his wife in bed with another man, and, in a jealous rage, shoots the paramour. Traditional judges understood how the husband could be so shocked by his wife’s infidelity or inflamed by the affront to his dignity that he lost control; though killing the paramour is not a praiseworthy act, it is at least understandable and so constitutes a lesser degree of criminality than murder, even though there was an intent to kill.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>从本质上讲，允许因挑衅而将谋杀罪降为过失杀人罪，承认了人性的弱点；在极端情况下，人们根本无法指望自己的行为符合法律的要求。然而，一旦我们沿着这条路走下去，许多杀人行为或许可以被宽恕，因此刑法只承认合理的挑衅。我们再次看到了关注个案情况与制定涵盖各类案件的规则之间的冲突。在普通法中，法院倾向于制定合理的挑衅类别。发现妻子出轨的丈夫就是一个典型例子。其他情况还包括争吵的人和遭受严重袭击的受害者。传统上，“仅仅是言语”并不构成合理的挑衅；例如，被妻子侮辱、威胁或告知其出轨的人不能以杀人作为回应。近年来，出现了一种将调查个体化的趋势；《模范刑法典》允许将谋杀降为过失杀人罪，前提是被告因“合理的解释或借口”而导致“极度情绪失控”。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Essentially, allowing provocation to reduce a crime from murder to manslaughter recognizes human frailty; under extreme circumstances, people simply cannot be expected to conform their conduct to the requirements of the law. Once we start down this path, though, many killings might be excused, so criminal law recognizes only reasonable provocation. Once again we see the conflict between attending to individual circumstances and making rules that cover classes of cases. At common law, the courts tended to develop categories of provocation that were reasonable. The husband who discovers his wife’s infidelity was a classic instance. Other groups included people engaged in a fight and the victim of a serious assault. Traditionally, “mere words” did not constitute a reasonable provocation; someone insulted, threatened, or told by his wife of her infidelity could not kill in response, for example. More recently there has been a tendency to individualize the inquiry; the Model Penal Code permits murder to be reduced to manslaughter if the defendant killed under an “extreme emotional disturbance” caused by a “reasonable explanation or excuse.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">非故意杀人</em>是杀人罪的最后一类。预谋谋杀可以通过对生命安全造成的危险极度漠视来满足——例如，在拥挤的人行道上疯狂驾驶汽车。在侵权法中，民事责任适用于<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_296" class="calibre4"></a>一般疏忽或粗心大意——上班途中吃了麦满分而没有足够注意路况，从而导致事故。在极度鲁莽和一般疏忽之间，还有另一种鲁莽和刑事疏忽，这就导致了过失杀人罪。在导致死亡的车祸案件中，这个问题尤其具有争议。历史上，法院和陪审团不愿判处鲁莽驾驶者谋杀罪，也许是出于“要不是上帝的恩典，我也会这样”的本能，所以立法机关设立了交通杀人罪，作为独立的罪行或过失杀人罪的一种。最近的反酒驾运动增加了将酒驾定为犯罪的意愿，将其定为过失杀人罪甚至二级谋杀罪。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">Involuntary manslaughter</em> is the final category of homicide. Malice aforethought for murder can be satisfied by extreme reckless indifference to the risk created to human life—such as driving a car wildly onto a crowded sidewalk. In tort law, civil liability is imposed for <a class="calibre4"></a>ordinary negligence or carelessness—causing an accident by eating your Egg McMuffin on the way to work and not paying sufficient attention to the road. Somewhere in between extreme recklessness and ordinary negligence lies another type of recklessness and criminal negligence, and this gives rise to involuntary manslaughter. The issue is particularly controversial in cases involving car accidents that result in death. Historically courts and juries were reluctant to convict reckless drivers of murder, perhaps under the instinct that “there but for the grace of God go I,” so legislatures created a crime of vehicular homicide, either as a free-standing offense or a variety of involuntary manslaughter. The recent activism against drunk driving has increased the willingness to criminalize drunk driving, as involuntary manslaughter or even second-degree murder.</p>

<p class="noindent">近年来，强奸一直是刑法中最受关注、争议最大的领域之一，也是变化最大的领域。备受瞩目的案件吸引了媒体和公众的关注。男性、女性以及刑法如何应对不断变化的性行为模式和性别角色观念？“不”是否永远意味着“不”，还是女性应该表现出一定程度的不情愿甚至反抗？</p><p class="noindent">Rape has been one of the most highly publicized and controversial areas of criminal law in recent years and an area that has seen the greatest transformation. High-profile cases capture the media’s and the public’s attention. How are men, women, and criminal law to cope with changing patterns and perceptions of sexual behavior and gender roles? Does “no” always mean “no,” or is a degree of reluctance and even resistance expected from a woman?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>关于强奸的法律涉及诸多方面，从犯罪构成要件到庭审中可采纳的证据类型，每个要素都处于不断变化的状态。与任何其他法律问题一样，特定案件的判决往往取决于法规的确切措辞或司法管辖权的权威。在我们探讨法律的过去、现在和未来走向等更普遍的问题时，请记住这一点。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The law on rape has many dimensions, from the elements of the crime to the kind of proof admissible at trial, and every element has been in a state of flux. As with any other legal issue, the decision in a particular case often turns on the precise wording of a statute or the authority in the jurisdiction. Keep that in mind as we examine here more general questions about where the law has been, where it is now, and where it might be going.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>我们从 1994 年宾夕法尼亚州一个极具争议的案件开始，即<em class="calibre8">Commonwealth v. Berkowitz</em>。申诉人是一名女大学生，她离开教室，去宿舍喝了一杯马提尼，然后去休息室等她的男朋友。当她的男朋友没有出现时，她去了另一个宿舍找朋友 Earl Hassel。她敲门，但没有人回应。她试了试门把手，发现门没有锁，于是走进房间，发现一个男人躺在床上。申诉人起初以为那个男人是 Hassel，但后来发现是 Hassel 的室友 Robert Berkowitz。Berkowitz 让她留下来待一会儿，她同意了，因为她“有时间消磨”。他建议她坐在床上，但她拒绝了，坐在了地板上。<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_297" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We begin with an extremely controversial Pennsylvania case from 1994, <em class="calibre8">Commonwealth v. Berkowitz</em>. The complainant, a female college student, left her class, went to her dormitory room where she drank a martini, and then went to a lounge to await her boyfriend. When her boyfriend failed to appear, she went to another dormitory to find a friend, Earl Hassel. She knocked on the door but received no answer. She tried the doorknob and, finding it unlocked, entered the room and discovered a man lying on the bed. The complainant at first thought the man was Hassel, but it turned out to be Hassel’s roommate, Robert Berkowitz. Berkowitz asked her to stay for a while and she agreed because she “had time to kill.” He suggested that she sit on the bed, but she declined and sat on the floor.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>随后，伯科维茨移到她身旁的地板上，掀起她的衬衫和胸罩，抚摸她的乳房。然后他解开裤子，试图将阴茎放入她的嘴里，但没有成功。伯科维茨锁上门，将她推倒在床上。原告描述道：“他把我放在床上……他没有把我扔到床上……有点像推，但又不是。”然后，他脱下她的运动裤，将她的内裤从一条腿上扯下来。伯科维茨除了趴在她身上之外，没有以任何方式束缚她，也没有威胁她。随后，伯科维茨用阴茎插入了她的阴道。原告在整个过程中都说“不”。在抽出阴茎并射精在她腹部后，他说：“哇，我想我们只是有点得意忘形了。” 原告回答说：“不，我们没有得意忘形，是你得意忘形了。”</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Berkowitz then moved to the floor beside her, lifted up her shirt and bra and fondled her breasts. He then unfastened his pants and unsuccessfully attempted to put his penis in her mouth. Berkowitz locked the door and pushed her onto the bed, and the complainant described this as, “He put me down on the bed....He didn’t throw me on the bed....It was kind of like a push but not.” Then he removed her sweatpants and pulled her underpants off one leg. Berkowitz did not restrain her in any way, other than lying on top of her, nor did he threaten her. Berkowitz then penetrated her vagina with his penis. The complainant said “no” throughout the encounter. After withdrawing and ejaculating on her stomach, he stated, “Wow, I guess we just got carried away,” to which she responded, “No, we didn’t get carried away, you got carried away.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>强奸？宾夕法尼亚州最高法院遵循传统法律，驳斥了这一说法。宾夕法尼亚州的强奸法规定，男性“以暴力手段”与配偶以外的女性发生性关系构成犯罪。法院认为，原告的证词并未证明其使用了武力或威胁使用武力。伯科维茨没有将她击倒或进行身体约束。在整个事件过程中一直说“不”或许表明她未同意，但这并不表明伯科维茨使用了武力。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Rape? The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, following the traditional law, said no. The Pennsylvania rape statute made it a crime for a man to engage in sexual intercourse with a woman other than his spouse “by forcible compulsion.” In the court’s view, the complainant’s testimony did not establish the use of force or the threat of force. Berkowitz had not knocked her down or physically restrained her. Saying “no” throughout the incident may show lack of consent, but it does not show that Berkowitz used force.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在类似的案件<em class="calibre8">“MTS 利益陈述案”</em>（1992 年）中，新泽西州最高法院不同意这一观点。15 岁的 CG 与她的母亲、兄弟姐妹以及其他几个人（包括 MTS）住在一栋联排别墅里（在涉及青少年的案件中，通常使用首字母缩写来避免识别当事人。）每个人都对发生的事情提出异议，但审判法院得出结论，一天清晨，CG 同意与 MTS 接吻和爱抚，但没有同意性交，当 MTS 将阴茎插入她的阴道时，她将他拉开并说“停，放开”。新泽西州法院的关键问题是同意，而不是强迫。在没有“肯定和自由给予的许可”的情况下，未经同意的性插入行为本身满足身体暴力的要件。许可不必是口头的或宣布的，但证据必须足以向理性的人证明已经给予了同意。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In a similar case, <em class="calibre8">State in the Interest of M.T.S</em>. (1992), the New Jersey Supreme Court disagreed. Fifteen-year-old C.G. lived in a townhouse with her mother, her siblings, and several other people, including M.T.S. (Initials are often used in cases involving juveniles to avoid identifying the parties.) Each disputed exactly what had happened, but the trial court concluded that early one morning C.G. had consented to kissing and heavy petting with M.T.S. but had not consented to intercourse and, when M.T.S. thrust his penis into her vagina, she pulled him off of her and said “Stop, get off.” The key issue for the New Jersey court was consent, not force. Without “affirmative and freely given permission,” the act of unconsented sexual penetration itself satisfies the requirement of physical force. Permission does not have to be verbal or announced, but the evidence must be sufficient to demonstrate to the reasonable person that consent has been given.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如何解释这两种结果之间的差异？宾夕法尼亚州和新泽西州的法规措辞有所不同，但差异并不大，不足以对结果造成如此大的差异。理解这种差异的一种方式是，宾夕法尼亚州法院采用了传统的强奸罪概念，而新泽西州法院则采用了更现代的概念。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>How do we explain the difference between the two results? The wording of the Pennsylvania and New Jersey statutes differed, but not so significantly that it should have made such a difference in the result. One way of understanding the difference is that the Pennsylvania court applied a traditional conception of the crime of rape and the New Jersey court applied a more modern one.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>传统意义上的强奸，是指在实施强奸时使用暴力或威胁使用暴力。通过引诱、欺诈或非暴力手段获得的性行为<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_298" class="calibre4"></a>威胁并非强奸。如果一名男子以永恒的爱之承诺说服一名女子发生性关系，或者一名假医生告诉一名女子，性交对于治疗罕见血液病是必要的，这种行为令人憎恶，但如果构成犯罪，则不构成强奸。如果老板告诉员工，如果她不顺从他的要求，就会被解雇，这种行为构成性骚扰，但不是强奸。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The traditional conception of rape requires force or the threat of force in its commission. Sex procured by seduction, fraud, or nonviolent <a class="calibre4"></a>threats is not rape. If a man persuades a woman to have intercourse by making promises of undying love, or if a phony doctor tells a woman that intercourse is necessary to treat a rare blood disease, the behavior is abhorrent but the crime, if any, is not rape. If a boss tells an employee she will be fired if she doesn’t submit to his advances, the conduct is sexual harassment but not rape.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>强奸的强制性定义与未经同意的构成要件相关，并由此引出了受害者必须“竭尽全力”抵抗施暴者的要求。然而，如果在压倒性威胁面前抵抗显然徒劳无功，则抵抗要求不适用。如果强奸犯用枪指着受害者的头部，受害者无需抵抗。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The definition of rape as forcible is related to the element of lack of consent and gave rise to a requirement that the victim had to resist her attacker “to the utmost.” The resistance requirement did not apply, however, where resistance would be obviously futile in the face of an overwhelming threat. If the rapist holds a gun to the victim’s head, she is not required to resist.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>近年来，抵抗的要求已被淡化，尽管在许多地方它仍然是法律。在仍然要求抵抗的地方，更有可能被表述为“合理抵抗”或“认真抵抗”，而不是“极力抵抗”。正如夏威夷最高法院所言，</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>More recently the requirement of resistance has been watered down, though it is still the law in many places. Where resistance is still a requirement, it is more likely to be stated as “reasonable resistance” or “earnest resistance” rather than resistance to the utmost. As the Hawaii Supreme Court stated the rule,</p>
<p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>我们认为，投诉人必须根据具体案件情况，展现出真正的身体抵抗力。需要考虑的因素包括双方的相对实力、投诉人的年龄、投诉人的精神和身体状况，以及攻击者所使用武力的性质和程度。</p><p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>[W]‌e believe a complainant must only exhibit a genuine physical effort to resist as judged by the circumstances of the particular case. Among the factors to be considered are the relative strength of the parties, the age of the complainant, the complainant’s mental and physical condition, and the nature and degree of the force used by the assailant.</p>
<p class="noindent">一些司法管辖区已经完全放弃了抵抗规则，其原因源于对强奸罪更现代的解读。持传统观点的法院可能要求提供抵抗证据，因为受害者的抵抗伴随着强奸犯的暴力行为，而强奸的定义就是强迫性交。但更现代的观点关注的是被告的行为，而不是受害者的抵抗。根据这种观点，强奸是指使用暴力或未经同意进行的性交（广义）。受害者的抵抗可以证明性接触是在暴力下且未经同意的情况下发生的，但并非必要证据；受害者未能抵抗的事实并不能最终证明被告未使用暴力或受害者确实同意。</p><p class="noindent">Some jurisdictions have abandoned the resistance rule altogether, and their reasons for doing so grow out of a more modern approach to the crime of rape. A court with a traditional view might require proof of resistance because resistance by the victim goes along with force by the rapist, and forcible sexual intercourse is the definition of rape. But a more modern view focuses on the defendant’s conduct, not the victim’s resistance. Under that view, rape is sexual intercourse (broadly defined) by force or without consent. The victim’s resistance may be evidence that the sexual contact was accomplished by force and without consent, but it is not necessary evidence; the fact that she failed to resist does not prove conclusively that the defendant did not use force or that the victim did consent.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>两种强奸罪的解读方式背后，是对男性、女性和性行为复杂且相互冲突的认知。我们都理解法律学者苏珊·埃斯特里奇所说的“真正的强奸”：“陌生人用枪指着受害者的头，威胁要杀死或殴打她，然后与其发生性关系。” 但大多数强奸案件在某些方面有所不同。<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_299" class="calibre4"></a>正如埃斯特里奇所解释的那样，这种模式值得尊重：“在以下情况下，性侵犯行为不需使用武力或未造成任何其他身体伤害，威胁不需言语，双方彼此认识，场景不是小巷而是卧室，初次接触不是绑架而是约会，女性说不但没有反抗。” 在这些情况下，对于所发生的事情是否应被称为强奸，取决于个人的看法。传统法律基于这样的看法：男性在性方面具有侵略性，女性在性方面处于被动地位；女性有责任在不想发生性关系时避免刺激男性或制造不愉快的局面；女性对男性性暗示的抵抗是性行为的常规；“不”并不总是意味着“不”。现代法律更多地基于这样的看法：女性有权享有个人自主权，男性有责任确保女性同意性交。 （传统上，强奸只能由男性对女性实施，但最近的一些法规不分性别，也保护男性免受暴力性侵犯。）</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Lying behind the two approaches to the crime of rape are complex and conflicting perceptions about men, women, and sexual behavior. We all understand what legal scholar Susan Estrich labeled “real rape”: “A stranger puts a gun to the head of his victim, threatens to kill or beat her, and then engages in intercourse.” But most rape cases differ in some <a class="calibre4"></a>respect from this model, as Estrich explains: “Where less force is used or no other physical injury is inflicted, where threats are inarticulate, where the two know each other, where the setting is not an alley but a bedroom, where the initial contact is not a kidnapping but a date, where the woman says no but does not fight.” In those cases the decision about whether what has happened deserves to be called rape depends on one’s perceptions. The traditional law is motivated by perceptions such as men are sexually aggressive and women are passive, women have a responsibility to avoid stimulating men or creating compromising situations if they do not wish to have intercourse, a woman’s resistance to a man’s sexual overtures is part of the routine of sexual behavior, and “no” doesn’t always mean “no.” The modern law is motivated more by the perception that a woman has a right to personal autonomy, and a man has the responsibility to be sure that a woman consents to a sexual encounter. (Traditionally rape could only be committed by a man against a woman, but some recent statutes are gender neutral, protecting men from forcible sexual assault, too.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这种观念冲突也体现在强奸所需的精神状态问题上。既然强奸是非自愿性交，如果施暴者错误地认为女性是自愿的，他是否有辩护理由？不妨考虑备受争议的<em class="calibre8">雷吉娜诉摩根</em>案（1975年）。摩根是皇家空军的一名成员，他与其他三名飞行员一起喝酒。当晚他们没能找到一些女性，摩根便建议她们都去他家，并暗示他的妻子愿意与她们所有人发生性关系。他告诉其他人，他的妻子可能会表现出反抗和挣扎，因为她“性欲旺盛”，而这是她“性唤起”的方式。不顾妻子的强烈反抗，三名飞行员与她发生了性交和其他性行为。事后，她立即前往当地一家医院，并声称自己被强奸了。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This clash of perceptions also manifests itself in the issue of the mental state required for rape. Since rape is nonconsensual intercourse, does the assailant have a defense if he wrongly believes that the woman is consenting? Consider the much-discussed case of <em class="calibre8">Regina v. Morgan</em> (1975). Morgan, a member of the Royal Air Force, went drinking with three other airmen. When they failed to pick up some women for the evening, Morgan suggested they all go to his house and implied that his wife would be willing to have sex with all of them. He told the others that his wife might show resistance and struggle because she was “kinky” and this was her way of getting “turned on.” Over the wife’s vigorous resistance, the three airmen performed intercourse and other sexual acts with her. When they had finished, she immediately went to a local hospital and declared she had been raped.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如果飞行员相信摩根的说法，即他的妻子只是假装反抗，他们是否犯有强奸罪？考虑一下各种可能性。首先，如果强奸要求被告明知自己在未经同意的情况下发生性交，那么飞行员的信念是一种很好的辩护，因为所需的特定意图尚未得到满足。但许多人认为这个标准太宽容了。如果被告对受害人缺乏同意是鲁莽或疏忽的，那么故意要件就可以得到满足。那么，合理地相信妇女是同意的可能会为被告开脱——或许就像在<em class="calibre8">Berkowitz 案</em>中一样——但不合理的信念则不会；在<em class="calibre8">Morgan 案</em>中，即使飞行员相信摩根先生关于他妻子的故事，他们这样做也是错误的。<a id="text/part0014_split_001.html.page_300" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If the airmen believed Morgan’s statement that his wife was only feigning resistance, are they guilty of rape? Consider the possibilities. First, if rape requires that the defendant knowingly have intercourse and know that he is doing so without consent, then the airmen’s belief is a good defense because the specific intent required has not been satisfied. Many think this is too forgiving a standard, though. The intent element can be satisfied if the defendant was reckless or perhaps negligent as to the victim’s lack of consent. Then a reasonable belief that the woman was consenting might exculpate the defendant—perhaps as in <em class="calibre8">Berkowitz</em>—but an unreasonable belief would not; in <em class="calibre8">Morgan</em>, even if the airmen believed Mr. Morgan’s story about his wife it was wrong for them to do so.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>关于错误的问题，部分取决于当事人对刑法的看法，以及构成特定犯罪要素所需的心理状态。但在实际操作中，它也反映了上述性观念的差异。如果法院或陪审团认为女性在性交中经常假装抵抗——“不”通常意味着“是”——那么他们倾向于更加宽容被告关于同意的错误，无论是基于法律规定还是基于具体案件的事实。另一方面，如果当事人更关心性自主权，那么要求被告至少在评估非同意证据时保持理性的标准更为合适。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This issue about mistake turns in part on one’s view of the criminal law and what state of mind is required for particular elements of offenses. But as a practical matter it also reflects the differences in sexual attitudes noted above. If a court or jury believes that women often fake resistance in sexual encounters—that “no” often means “yes”—then they are inclined to be much more forgiving of a defendant’s mistake about consent, either as a matter of law or on the facts of a particular case. If, on the other hand, one is more concerned with sexual autonomy, the standard that requires that the defendant at least be reasonable in evaluating evidence of nonconsent is more appropriate.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">在法定强奸</em>案中，错误也是个问题。法定强奸将与未满一定年龄的女孩发生的性行为定为犯罪，尤其是在被告年龄较大的情况下。如果一名成年男子认为与他发生性关系的女性年满18岁，而实际上她只有14岁，他是否违反了该法规？传统上，答案是肯定的。法定强奸法是严格责任犯罪，旨在保护那些尚未成熟到同意发生性关系的无辜女孩，对女孩年龄的错误判断并不能成为有效辩护。近年来，一些司法管辖区修改了法律，允许以合理错误作为辩护理由。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mistakes are also an issue in cases of <em class="calibre8">statutory rape</em>. Statutory rape criminalizes sexual conduct with girls under a certain age, particularly where the defendant is older. If an adult man believes the woman with whom he has intercourse is eighteen when she is actually only fourteen, has he violated the statute? Traditionally the rule was yes. Statutory rape laws were strict liability offenses enacted to protect innocent girls who were not mature enough to consent to sex, and a mistake about the girl’s age was not a valid defense. More recently a number of jurisdictions have changed the law to allow a defense of reasonable mistake.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>对性行为的不同理解也影响了强奸案的证据问题。传统观念对强奸投诉持怀疑态度，这种怀疑体现在三条规则中，使得此类投诉的起诉更加困难。首先是“<em class="calibre8">新投诉</em>规则”，该规则要求受害者在强奸发生后必须立即报案。其次是<em class="calibre8">“佐证</em>规则”，该规则要求被告不能仅凭受害者未经佐证的证词就被定罪。第三是受害者先前性行为史证据的可采性。这些规则反映出人们对虚假强奸投诉的强烈怀疑，因此备受争议，并已在许多司法管辖区废除。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The different perceptions of sexual behavior have also colored evidentiary issues in rape cases. The traditional conception was suspicious of rape complaints and reflected that suspicion in three rules that made the prosecution of such complaints more difficult. First was the <em class="calibre8">fresh complaint</em> rule, which required that the victim had to report a rape promptly after its occurrence. Second was the <em class="calibre8">corroboration</em> rule, which required that the defendant could not be convicted solely on the uncorroborated testimony of the victim. Third was the admissibility of evidence of the victim’s prior sexual history. These rules, reflecting a profound suspicion of false complaints of rape, are controversial and have been abolished in many jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>简单考虑一下第三条规则，现在这条规则常常被所谓的<em class="calibre8">强奸盾法</em>所推翻。在审判中，辩方可能想要提出两种关于受害者性史的证据：她和被告之间之前发生过的性行为，以及她之前与其他男性发生过的性行为以及她总体上缺乏贞洁。第一条与同意的问题有关；如果他们之前发生过性行为，那么这次接触更有可能是双方自愿的。第二条只在人们认为之前发生过性行为的女性更有可能同意未来的事件时才有意义。这种方法的效果是将受害者送上审判台，从而阻止投诉，因此许多司法管辖区已经废除了这种方法。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Consider briefly the third rule, now often reversed by what are known as <em class="calibre8">rape shield laws</em>. At trial the defense may want to introduce two kinds of evidence about the victim’s sexual history: prior sexual acts between her and the defendant and prior sexual acts between her and other men and her general lack of chastity. The first is relevant to the issue of consent; if they have had sex before, it is more likely that the encounter in question was consensual. The second is relevant only if one takes the view that a woman who has had sex previously is more likely to consent to a future incident. The effect of this approach is to put the victim on trial, thereby discouraging complaints, and therefore many jurisdictions have abolished it.</p>

<p class="noindent">你可能对刑事诉讼程序和刑事司法系统的了解程度，远超其他任何法律部门。臭名昭著的审判和警匪闹剧的新闻报道，每晚都将刑事诉讼程序带入美国人的客厅。就连小孩子都能背诵<em class="calibre8">米兰达</em>警告，几乎意识不到自己是在解释美国最高法院的判决：“你有权保持沉默。你所说的任何话都可能、而且将会在法庭上成为对你不利的证据。”</p><p class="noindent">You may know more about criminal procedure and the criminal justice system than any other branch of the law.

Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>刑事诉讼已成为法律中最受关注的领域，也是最重要的领域之一。《权利法案》列举的权利中有一半都与刑事诉讼程序有关，因为这是国家能够行使最大权力的领域：剥夺他人自由甚至生命的权力。本章将探讨这一程序，并探讨如何规范这种权力。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Criminal procedure has become the most-discussed area of the law, and it also is one of the most important. Half of the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights are directed at the criminal process because it is the area in which the greatest power of the state can be brought to bear: the power to take a person’s liberty or even life. This chapter explores that process and comes to grips with how that power is regulated.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0015_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-9-div1-2"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0084" class="calibre1">什么是刑事诉讼程序？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0084" class="calibre1">What Is Criminal Procedure?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent"><em class="calibre8">刑事诉讼程序</em>，也称为<em class="calibre8">刑事程序</em>或<em class="calibre8">刑事司法系统</em>，是调查犯罪、裁定罪犯罪并施加惩罚的机制。它包括警察、检察官、辩护律师和法院；他们遵循的实践和程序；以及表面上规范他们的法律规则。在刑事诉讼程序中，个人与拥有所有资源和权力的政府对抗，并且只有通过刑事诉讼程序，才能实施国家最严厉的制裁——监禁甚至死刑。</p><p class="noindent"><em class="calibre8">Criminal procedure</em>, also called the <em class="calibre8">criminal process</em> or the <em class="calibre8">criminal justice system</em>, is the mechanism through which crimes are investigated, the guilt of criminals adjudicated, and punishment imposed. It includes the police, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and courts; the practices and procedures observed by them; and the legal rules that ostensibly govern them. In the criminal process an individual is pitted against the government, with all of its resources and authority, and only through the criminal process can the state’s most serious sanctions—imprisonment or even death—be applied.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>上一章讨论的刑法定义了哪些行为构成犯罪，并规定了对犯罪行为的惩罚。刑事诉讼程序使刑法得以发挥作用；制裁规定<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_302" class="calibre4"></a>刑法所规定的制裁之所以有效，是因为刑事程序能够对违法者施加制裁。同时，刑事诉讼程序旨在确保刑事制裁只适用于有罪者，并且只能通过公认的公正程序实施。刑事程序的目标之一是惩罚有罪者，但其他目标还包括保护无辜者，并确保即使是有罪者也能免受政府的虐待。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Criminal law, discussed in the previous chapter, defines what conduct is criminal and prescribes the punishment for criminal conduct. Criminal procedure makes the criminal law work; the sanctions defined <a class="calibre4"></a>by criminal law are effective only because the criminal process can bring the sanctions to bear on individuals who violate the law. At the same time, criminal procedure aims to make sure that criminal sanctions are applied only to those who are guilty and only through procedures that are recognized as fair. One goal of the criminal process is to punish the guilty, but other goals are to protect the innocent and to ensure that even the guilty are protected from abuse by the government.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>虽然我们谈论的是“刑事”程序，但各州和联邦法院都实行不同的体系。每个体系都由几套相互重叠的法律体系控制。大多数州都颁布了全面的刑事诉讼法典，构建了从逮捕到上诉的整个程序。为了补充这些法典，州最高法院通常会行使权力，制定刑事诉讼规则，进一步明确刑事诉讼程序的进行方式。同样，联邦法院的刑事案件也根据国会制定的法定要求和美国最高法院通过的《联邦刑事诉讼规则》进行审理。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Although we talk about “the” criminal process, different systems are in place in each state and in the federal courts. Each system is controlled by several overlapping bodies of law. Most states have enacted comprehensive codes of criminal procedure that structure the process from arrest through appeal. To supplement these codes, the state supreme courts often exercise their authority to adopt rules of criminal procedure that further specify how the criminal process is to be conducted. Similarly, criminal cases in the federal courts are conducted in accordance with statutory requirements set by Congress and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，在一个最重要的方面，所有州和联邦刑事司法系统都是相同的：它们都必须遵守联邦宪法的要求。当然，联邦法院始终受宪法要求的约束，但尤其自20世纪60年代以来，刑事诉讼法已被宪法化。这场刑事诉讼革命包​​含两个步骤：最高法院将《权利法案》中的正当程序保障应用于各州，并在此过程中以比以往更为广泛的方式对这些保障进行了解释。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In a most important respect, however, all state and federal criminal justice systems are alike: They all are required to adhere to the requirements of the federal Constitution. The federal courts have always been subject to constitutional requirements, of course, but especially since the 1960s the law of criminal procedure has been constitutionalized. This criminal procedure revolution involved two steps: The Supreme Court applied the due process guarantees of the Bill of Rights to the states and, in the process, interpreted those guarantees in a more expansive manner than it had done previously.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最高法院最初认为，《权利法案》限制的是联邦政府的权力，而非各州的权力。重建修正案，尤其是第十四修正案，彻底改变了这一局面。除了赋予前奴隶公民权和平等权利外，第十四修正案还明确禁止“任何州”剥夺“任何人的生命、自由或财产，未经正当法律程序”或“法律的平等保护”。当时，最高法院面临的任务是确定这些模糊的命令中究竟包含了哪些《权利法案》的保护措施。随着时间的推移，最高法院最终确定了<em class="calibre8">选择性纳入</em>的标准。第十四修正案并未纳入《权利法案》的所有保障；它选择性地纳入了那些“对英美有序自由政体必不可少”的保护措施。一项保护措施被纳入《权利法案》这一事实，有力地证明了它具有这种地位。事实上，选择性纳入也并非完全是选择性的。权利法案中几乎所有的保护措施都<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_303" class="calibre4"></a>根据这一标准，这些权利被认为是基本权利，但大陪审团起诉的权利除外。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Supreme Court originally had held that the Bill of Rights was a restriction on the powers of the federal government, not the states. The Reconstruction Amendments, particularly the Fourteenth Amendment, radically changed the situation. In addition to granting citizenship and equal rights to former slaves, the Fourteenth Amendment expressly prohibited “any state” from depriving “any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law” or “the equal protection of the laws.” The task that then faced the Court was to determine which of the protections of the Bill of Rights were included within these vague commands. Over time, the Court settled on a standard of <em class="calibre8">selective incorporation</em>. The Fourteenth Amendment did not incorporate all of the guarantees of the Bill of Rights; it selectively incorporated those protections that are “necessary to an Anglo-American regime of ordered liberty.” The fact that a protection is included in the Bill of Rights is strong evidence that it has that status. In fact, selective incorporation has not been all that selective. Virtually all of the protections in the Bill of Rights have been <a class="calibre4"></a>held to be fundamental under this standard, with the notable exception of the right to indictment by a grand jury.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>将《权利法案》的保障应用于各州，除非这些保障具有广泛的含义，否则意义并不重大。在1886年<em class="calibre8">的博伊德诉美国案</em>中，最高法院承认其有义务“宽泛地解释”宪法保护，例如第四修正案和第五修正案，以确保“人身和财产安全”。超越对刑事诉讼权利狭义解释的运动在20世纪20年代发展壮大，并在20世纪60年代迅速加速。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Applying the Bill of Rights guarantees to the states would not be particularly significant unless those guarantees had broad meaning. In <em class="calibre8">Boyd v. United States</em> (1886) the Court recognized its obligation to “liberally construe” constitutional protections such as the Fourth and Fifth Amendments in order to ensure “the security of person and property.” The movement beyond a narrow interpretation of criminal procedure rights gained strength in the 1920s and accelerated rapidly in the 1960s.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>州宪法在刑事诉讼中也发挥着日益重要的作用。州法院通常会对其宪法进行解读，赋予公民和刑事被告比联邦宪法所保障的更广泛的权利。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>State constitutions have also played an increasingly important role in criminal procedure. State courts often interpret their constitutions to provide more extensive rights for citizens and criminal defendants than are guaranteed by the federal Constitution.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，刑事诉讼法典和宪法只是刑事司法程序的一个维度。参与者的行为和当地体系的文化对于确定该程序的实际运作方式至关重要。谁被选为警察？警察在交通拦截、被叫去处理家庭纠纷，或与毒贩、青少年和被讯问者互动时会如何表现？检察官在指控轻罪、保释和辩诉交易方面的做法是什么？法官是谁？他们的背景如何？公设辩护人办公室的资金充足吗？其积极性如何？这些问题的答案至少与最高法院的最新裁决一样，能告诉我们该体系是如何运作的。刑事诉讼法旨在规范这些行为主体的行为，但法律控制行为的能力是有限的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Criminal procedure codes and constitutional law make up only one dimension of the criminal justice process, however. The actions of the participants and the culture of the local system are crucial in determining how the process will actually work. Who is selected to be a police officer? How does the officer act during a traffic stop, when called to a domestic dispute, or when interacting with drug dealers, teenagers, and persons being interrogated? What are prosecutors’ practices about charging minor offenses, bail, and plea bargaining? Who are the judges and what are their backgrounds? How well-funded and aggressive is the public defender’s office? The answers to questions like these tell us at least as much about how the system works as does the latest Supreme Court decision. The law of criminal procedure is designed to regulate the behavior of these actors, but there are limits to the law’s ability to control conduct.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0015_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-9-div1-3"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0085" class="calibre1">为什么需要刑事诉讼程序？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0085" class="calibre1">Why Do We Need Criminal Procedure?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">假设我们有法律规定某些行为构成犯罪，但却没有警察、检察官或法院来执行这些法律。如果罪犯不怕被抓获和起诉，这几乎无法阻止他们犯罪，反而会发出一个强烈的信号：作为一个社会，我们并没有认真对待惩罚不法分子。</p><p class="noindent">Suppose that we had statutes that proclaimed certain conduct to be criminal but no police, prosecutors, or courts to implement the statutes. If criminals were not afraid of being caught and prosecuted, it would hardly deter them from committing crimes, and it would send a powerful message that, as a society, we were not serious about punishing wrongdoers.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>相反，假设我们决心打击犯罪。我们可以建立一个尽可能深入地调查犯罪和惩罚罪犯的刑事程序。警察可以窃听每个人的电话，拦截并搜查任何在街上行走的可疑人员，不敲门就进入任何住宅或办公室，并逼迫嫌疑人认罪。在法庭上，被告<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_304" class="calibre4"></a>不允许聘请律师，只有检察官可以提出案件，法官可以根据薄弱的证据判处被告有罪。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Suppose, by contrast, that we were determined to crack down on crime. We could establish a criminal process that would go as far as possible in investigating crimes and punishing criminals. The police could wiretap everyone’s phone, stop and search anyone walking down the street who looked suspicious, come into any home or office without knocking, and beat confessions out of suspects. In court, the defendant <a class="calibre4"></a>would not be allowed a lawyer, only the prosecutor could present a case, and a judge could convict the defendant on flimsy evidence.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>显然，这两种情况都是不可容忍的。我们需要一个刑事程序来调查和逮捕可能犯罪的人，并裁定他们有罪或无罪，以控制犯罪，但这一程序必须符合我们作为一个自由社会的价值观和传统。这种目标冲突引发了关于法律内容的巨大争议。我们应该允许警察、检察官和法院在多大程度上采取行动？要思考这个问题，我们需要更详细地阐明刑事诉讼程序中固有的相互冲突的价值观。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Obviously, neither of these situations would be tolerable. We need a criminal process to investigate and apprehend people who may have committed crimes and to adjudicate their guilt or innocence in order to control crime, but the process has to be consistent with our values and traditions as a free society. This conflict of objectives produces great controversy about the content of the law. How far should we allow the police, prosecutors, and courts to go? To think about that question, we need to spell out in more detail the conflicting values inherent in criminal procedure.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>刑事诉讼的首要价值是寻求真相。刑事诉讼程序应识别、逮捕并惩罚犯罪者，但也应为未犯罪者开脱。寻求真相在刑事诉讼的每个阶段都具有重要价值。它在审判中最终裁定有罪或无罪时无疑至关重要，但它也适用于诉讼程序的早期阶段。警方需要准确判断何时有充分理由调查犯罪或逮捕特定人员，检察官需要正确判断何时应对某人提出指控。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A first value of criminal procedure is truth-seeking. The criminal process should identify, apprehend, and punish persons who have committed crimes, but it also should exonerate those who have not committed crimes. Truth-seeking is an important value at every stage of the criminal process. It certainly is important in the final determination of guilt or innocence at trial, but it also applies at earlier stages of the process. Police need to make accurate determinations of when there is sufficient reason to investigate a crime or arrest a particular person, and prosecutors need to decide correctly when charges should be brought against someone.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>该系统还需要高效地寻求真相。鉴于资源有限且错误难免，我们希望该系统在执行刑法方面能够合理有效。由于资源有限，我们不可能拥有一个完美的系统，但警方必须破获合理数量的犯罪案件，法院在定罪时也不能犯太多错误。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The system also needs to seek the truth efficiently. We want the system to work reasonably well in implementing the criminal law, given that resources are limited and mistakes inevitable. Because resources are limited, we cannot have a perfect system, but the police have to solve a reasonable number of crimes and the courts cannot make too many mistakes in convicting those who are brought to trial.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>注重效率意味着警察和检察官应在程序早期确定哪些被告可能没有犯罪，并将这些人排除在程序之外。这样，其他人就可以迅速通过程序直至最终定罪。假设警察、检察官和法院非常擅长区分无辜者和有罪者，那么大多数卷入该程序的被告实际上都是有罪的。因此，让程序人员通过非正式和常规的程序来履行职责是合理的。例如，警察不应该被繁琐的程序或过于技术性的要求所束缚，这些要求决定了他们在调查犯罪、扣押证据或审讯嫌疑人时必须做什么，这些负担只会削弱系统查明真相的能力。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A focus on efficiency suggests that police and prosecutors should determine early in the process which accused persons probably did not commit a crime and screen those people out of the process. Everyone else can then be passed through the process expeditiously to ultimate conviction. Assuming that police, prosecutors, and courts are pretty good at separating the innocent from the guilty, most of the accused who become involved in the process are in fact guilty. It makes sense, therefore, to let the agents of the process do their job through procedures that are informal and routine. Police, for example, should not be burdened with cumbersome procedures or hypertechnical requirements about what they must do in investigating crimes, seizing evidence, or interrogating suspects, burdens that would only diminish the system’s ability to determine the truth.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>但这个系统不能太高效。寻求真相本身就不完美，而高效的寻求真相也可能是一个危险的过程。<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_305" class="calibre4"></a>资源是有限的，而警察、调查人员、律师和法官的资源有限意味着难免会犯错。事实上，即使是设计最完善、资金最充足的系统也难免会犯错。如果一定要犯错，那也应该朝着确保无辜者不被定罪的方向去犯，这必然意味着一些有罪的人也会被释放。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But the system must not be too efficient. Truth-seeking is an imperfect process, and efficient truth-seeking can be a dangerous process. <a class="calibre4"></a>Resources are limited, and limited resources for police, investigators, lawyers, and judges means that mistakes will be made. Indeed, even the best-designed and most fully funded system will produce mistakes. If mistakes are to be made, they should be made in the direction of making sure that an innocent person is not convicted, which necessarily means that some guilty persons will be set free, too.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>从这个角度来看，非正式的常规程序尤其危险。警察、检察官和刑事法庭法官目睹了许许多多的犯罪，所以他们往往认为犯罪无处不在。我们需要规则来规范他们的行为，需要法官谨慎地运用这些规则，也需要其他法官来审查这些判决。这种观点促使我们重视对抗制，它拥有坚实的法律保障，可以用来纠正错误和滥用，即使这些保障最终会导致真正犯罪的人被释放。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>From this perspective, informal, routine procedures are particularly dangerous. Police, prosecutors, and criminal court judges see a lot of crime, so they tend to see crime everywhere. We need rules to control their conduct, judges to carefully apply those rules, and other judges to review those decisions. This perspective leads us to value an adversarial system, with substantial legal protections that can be applied to correct errors and abuses, even if those protections lead to the release of persons who actually have committed crimes.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这场冲突不仅仅关乎寻求真相与效率。在刑事司法体系中，政府运用权力对付个人。但人并非仅仅是需要通过官僚程序处理的犯罪控制问题。个人的尊严和地位是刑事诉讼的核心价值。只有经过尊重个人尊严和地位的程序，才能施加刑事制裁，即使该程序缓慢、繁琐，并且可能偏向个人。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This conflict is not only about truth-seeking and efficiency. In the criminal justice system, the government brings its power to bear against an individual. But people are not simply problems of crime control to be dealt with by bureaucratic procedures. The dignity and the status of the individual are essential values of criminal procedure. A criminal sanction can be imposed only after a process that respects that dignity and status, even if the process is slow, cumbersome, and likely to err on the side of the individual.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>为了防止误判并尊重个人尊严，我们推定无罪。事实上，被警方调查逮捕并被检察官指控的人很可能有罪，但这种可能性在法律上无关紧要。恰恰相反，在整个过程中，直到定罪之前，被告在法律上都被推定为无罪。国家必须承担沉重的负担才能克服这种推定，并且必须遵守所有相关规则。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To prevent mistaken convictions and to respect the dignity of the individual we have a presumption of innocence. It may be factually true that someone who has been investigated and arrested by the police and charged by the prosecutor is probably guilty, but that probability is legally irrelevant. Just the opposite; all through the process, up to the moment of conviction, the accused is presumed to be legally innocent. The state must meet a heavy burden to overcome this presumption, and it must follow all the rules in doing so.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>对抗制程序和无罪推定原则还有另一个目的。我们理所当然地担心政府在刑事诉讼中滥用其强大权力，尤其担心这种权力会被不公平地运用。警察、检察官和法院在行使权力方面拥有很大的自由裁量权，而美国历史上充斥着滥用权力损害穷人、少数族裔或其他不受欢迎群体利益的事件。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The adversary process and presumption of innocence serve another purpose. We are justifiably afraid of the wrongful exercise of the great government power in the criminal process, and there is a particular concern that the power will be applied unequally. Police, prosecutors, and courts have a great deal of discretion in how they exercise their power, and American history is full of incidents in which the power has been exercised to the disadvantage of the poor, minorities, or other unpopular groups.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>我们该如何在刑事诉讼中平衡这些相互冲突的目标？我们想让整个程序看起来更像流水线，还是像障碍赛？这些目标之间的冲突引发了关于我们应该采用何种刑事诉讼程序的种种争论。<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_306" class="calibre4"></a>正如它产生了我们现有的法律体系一样。该体系的参与者和刑事诉讼学者普遍认为，情况一团糟。这种冲突造就了一套前后矛盾、难以预测的法律体系。在本章中，当你思考规则应该是什么时，也请思考，鉴于刑事诉讼目标的相互冲突，是否有可能制定清晰的规则。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>How do we balance these conflicting objectives in criminal procedure? Do we want the process to look more like an assembly line or an obstacle course? The conflict between these objectives generates all of the arguments about what kind of criminal procedure we should have, <a class="calibre4"></a>just as it generates the body of law we do have. There is widespread agreement among participants in the system and scholars of criminal procedure that things are a mess. The conflict has created a body of law that is inconsistent and unpredictable. In this chapter, as you think about what the rules should be, consider as well whether, given the conflicting objectives of the criminal process, it is possible to have clear rules at all.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0015_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-9-div1-4"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0086" class="calibre1">刑事诉讼程序有哪些步骤？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0086" class="calibre1">What Are the Steps in the Criminal Process?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">在探讨刑事诉讼程序的细节之前，我们先来快速概述一下该程序的各个步骤。不同州和联邦的刑事诉讼程序有所不同，并非所有案件的审理方式都相同，但以下描述大致概括了典型案件的审理流程。</p><p class="noindent">Before exploring the details of criminal procedure, let’s look at a quick overview of the steps of the process. The process works differently in different states and the federal system, and not every case proceeds through the system in the same way, but this description is a good approximation of the path of a typical case.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>当然，刑事诉讼始于犯罪，或者更准确地说，始于当局对犯罪的怀疑。一家7-Eleven便利店被抢劫，要么是警察目击了犯罪过程，要么更常见的是受害者（这里指的是店主）向警方报案。警方的第一步是调查犯罪：采访潜在证人，查看监控录像，收集犯罪现场的其他证据，并将此案与类似事件进行比较。调查可能会将怀疑的焦点集中在一个人身上——比如Buggsy——警方可能会对他进行讯问。他们可能会在街上拦下他，或者去他家，暂时拘留他进行讯问。如果7-Eleven便利店被武装劫匪抢劫，或者警方有其他理由怀疑Buggsy可能持有枪支，警方可能会对他进行搜身——搜查他的衣服，以确保他没有藏匿可能立即危及他们安全的武器。与警察的此类冲突可能会令人烦恼、侵扰甚至骚扰，但作为逮捕或拘留某人之前的措施，它们是被允许的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The criminal process begins, of course, with a crime, or, more accurately, the suspicion of a crime by the authorities. A 7-Eleven convenience store is robbed, and either a police officer witnesses the crime or, more commonly, the victim (here the owner) reports the crime to the police. The first step is for the police to investigate the crime: interview potential witnesses, look at the security camera videotape, collect other evidence from the crime scene, and compare this crime to similar incidents. The investigation may focus suspicion on an individual—call him Buggsy—and the police might question him. They might stop him on the street, or go to his home, and temporarily detain him to conduct the questioning. If the 7-Eleven was held up by an armed robber, or if they have other reasons to suspect Buggsy might have a gun, the police might frisk him—pat down his clothing to make sure he is not concealing a weapon that could immediately endanger them. These kinds of encounters with the police can be annoying, intrusive, or even harassing, but they are permitted as steps short of arrest or taking someone into custody.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在其他类型的案件中，调查可能更为复杂。例如，在凶杀案中，对犯罪现场的科学调查可能更为广泛，并且需要对受害者进行尸检。在调查更复杂的犯罪活动时，可能会使用线人、窃听甚至诱捕行动。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In other types of cases the investigation may be more complex. In a homicide, for example, the scientific investigation of the crime scene may be more extensive, and an autopsy will be performed on the victim. Informants, wiretaps, and even sting operations may be used in investigating more complex criminal enterprises.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>从此时起，警方将进行多项审查，以确定巴格西是否会被正式纳入刑事诉讼程序，以及一旦纳入，他是否能够脱离刑事诉讼程序。（只要巴格西仍在刑事诉讼系统中，犯罪调查就可能持续进行；警方和检察官可能会收集更多证据，以便在审判中对他不利。）一旦调查人员确信存在合理的理由，<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_307" class="calibre4"></a>如果Buggsy认为他抢劫了7-Eleven便利店，他就会逮捕他。Buggsy将被拘留（轻微犯罪除外），并被<em class="calibre8">登记</em>，包括记录他的姓名和其他信息、采集指纹和照片、进行搜身和关押（同样，某些轻微犯罪除外，这些轻微犯罪将被释放，并被要求在特定时间出庭受审）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>From this point on, several screens are applied to determine whether Buggsy will be formally brought into the criminal process and, once he is in it, whether he will be able to get out. (As long as Buggsy remains in the system, the investigation of the crime may be ongoing; the police and prosecutors may gather further evidence to be used against him at trial.) Once the investigating officer is satisfied that there is probable cause to <a class="calibre4"></a>believe that Buggsy held up the 7-Eleven, he will arrest him. Buggsy will be taken into custody (except in the case of very minor offenses) and <em class="calibre8">booked</em> by having his name and other information recorded, being fingerprinted and photographed, searched, and locked up (again, except for certain minor offenses, for which he will be released and told to appear before a judge at a certain time).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>下一步是确定是否正式指控 Buggsy 犯有罪行，如果是，则指控哪项罪行。指控通常通过提交<em class="calibre8">诉状</em>来完成，诉状是一份文件，列明 Buggsy 被指控的罪行以及指控的事实。指控决定通常由高级警官、检察官或两者共同做出。做出指控决定的人可能会因为多种原因决定不起诉 Buggsy 或以其他罪行起诉 Buggsy。他可能会认为其他方式处理此事效果更好；例如，如果 Buggsy 是一个从 7-Eleven 偷了一块糖果的孩子，警察可能只会严厉训斥他一顿就将他释放给他的父母。或者他可能会认为逮捕他的警官对指控的认定是错误的；根据 Buggsy 所持武器的种类和偷窃数量，指控可能会相应增加或减少。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The next step is to determine whether to formally charge Buggsy with a crime, and, if so, which crime. Charging is normally done through the filing of a <em class="calibre8">complaint</em>, a document that sets forth what offense Buggsy has been charged with and the facts underlying the charge. The charging decision is typically made by a higher-ranking police officer, a prosecutor, or both. The person making the charging decision might decide not to charge or to charge Buggsy with a different crime for a number of reasons. He might decide that the matter can be better handled in another way; if Buggsy is a kid who has stolen a candy bar from the 7-Eleven, for example, the police may release him to his parents with only a stern lecture. Or he might decide that the arresting officer’s determination of the charges was incorrect; depending on what kind of weapon Buggsy had and how much he stole, the charges might be increased or reduced accordingly.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>巴格西被指控后，其身份从被捕者变为被告，焦点也从警察局转移到法院系统。指控提出后不久，被告将被带到法官（通常是下级地方法官）面前进行首次出庭。大多数司法管辖区对被告在被带到法官面前之前的拘留时间（通常为24小时）设有时间限制。首次出庭时，法官会告知巴格西对他的指控，并告知他的基本权利，例如保持沉默的权利和获得律师辩护的权利。如果巴格西贫困，法官将采取措施为其提供免费律师；最高法院已对《宪法第六修正案》作出解释，要求在诉讼的关键阶段（从审讯、预审到上诉）为贫困被告指定律师。法官还将设定保释金。保释金额将取决于犯罪的严重程度、巴格西的背景以及他可能不出庭受审的风险。如果被告无法缴纳保释金，他将继续被关押在监狱等待审判。在许多情况下，法官会将被告释放，无需缴纳任何保释金。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After Buggsy is charged, his status changes from arrestee to defendant, and the focus shifts from the police station to the court system. Shortly after the charge is filed, the defendant is brought before a judge (often a lower-level magistrate) for an initial appearance. Most jurisdictions impose a time limit on how long a defendant can be held (often 24 hours) before being brought before a judge. At the first appearance, the judge will inform Buggsy of the charges against him and will advise him of his basic rights, such as the right to remain silent and the right to counsel. If Buggsy is indigent, the judge will take steps to have a free attorney provided for him; the Supreme Court has interpreted the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution to require the appointment of counsel for an indigent defendant at critical stages of the proceedings, from interrogation and pretrial through an appeal. The judge will also set bail. The amount set will depend on the seriousness of the crime, Buggsy’s background, and the perceived risk that he will fail to appear for trial. If the defendant cannot make bail, he remains in jail awaiting trial. In many cases, the judge will release the defendant on his own recognizance, not requiring any bail at all.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>重罪案件的被告在首次出庭后可能有权获得初步听证。轻罪（轻微犯罪）通常无需进行初步听证和其他一些中间步骤。初步听证是法官对指控进行的首次独立审查，法官必须确定是否存在合理依据。<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_308" class="calibre4"></a>被告犯有被指控的罪行，这是事实。检察官会传唤证人来确立案件的基本要素，而Buggsy的辩护律师可以对这些证人进行交叉质询，甚至传唤辩护方证人，尽管出于策略原因，他们很少利用这个机会。如果法官认定有充分理由拘留被告，案件将继续进行；否则，案件可能会被驳回，除非检察官能够提出证据支持的减轻指控。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Following the initial appearance, a defendant in a felony case may be entitled to a preliminary hearing. In misdemeanors (minor crimes) the preliminary hearing and some other intermediate steps usually are not necessary. The preliminary hearing is the first independent review of the charges by a judge, who must determine whether probable cause <a class="calibre4"></a>exists that the defendant committed the crime charged. The prosecutor presents witnesses to establish the basic elements of its case, and Buggsy’s defense attorney can cross-examine those witnesses and even present defense witnesses, although for tactical reasons that opportunity is seldom taken. If the judge determines that there is sufficient cause to hold the defendant, the case proceeds; if not, the case may be dismissed, unless the prosecutor is able to file reduced charges that are supported by the evidence.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>对重罪指控进行进一步审查的传统方式是由<em class="calibre8">大陪审团进行，大陪审团</em>将决定是否有足够证据<em class="calibre8">起诉</em>被告。检察官在提起指控之前也可以将大陪审团用作调查机构。大陪审团与审判（或<em class="calibre8">小</em>陪审团）一样，将外行人带入刑事诉讼程序作为决策者。大陪审团的审理是秘密的，只有检察官出示证据。被带到大陪审团面前的证人在作证期间不得由律师协助。因此，大陪审团审查检察官的案件并筛选出没有根据的案件的历史职能已大大减弱。俗话说，一个称职的检察官可以说服大陪审团起诉一个火腿三明治。在许多司法管辖区，不再要求大陪审团审查指控。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The traditional means of giving further review to felony charges is by the <em class="calibre8">grand jury</em>, which decides whether there is sufficient evidence to <em class="calibre8">indict</em> the defendant. The prosecutor can also use the grand jury as an investigatory body before bringing charges. The grand jury, like the trial (or <em class="calibre8">petit</em>) jury, brings laypeople into the criminal process as decision makers. The grand jury proceeding is secret, and only the prosecutor presents evidence. Witnesses brought before the grand jury are not allowed to be assisted by counsel during their testimony. Accordingly, the grand jury’s historic function of reviewing the prosecutor’s case and screening out unsupported cases has significantly declined. As the saying goes, a competent prosecutor can persuade a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich. In many jurisdictions, there is no longer a requirement that the grand jury review the charges.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>如果大陪审团已提起诉讼，则起诉书将提交法院。如果大陪审团未进行审查，检察官将提交一份类似的文件，称为“<em class="calibre8">信息文件”</em>。与起诉状类似，起诉书或信息文件列出了对被告的指控及其事实依据。Buggsy将被带回法庭，并根据起诉书或信息文件<em class="calibre8">进行提审</em>。在提审时，他会再次被告知指控，并被要求认罪或不认罪。此时（有时更早，有时更晚），<em class="calibre8">辩诉交易</em>开始发挥作用；Buggsy可能会决定认罪，以换取减轻指控或获得有利的判决。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If the grand jury has indicted, the indictment is filed with the court. Where grand jury review has not occurred, the prosecutor files a comparable document known as an <em class="calibre8">information</em>. Like the complaint, the indictment or information lays out the charges against the defendant and the factual basis for them. Buggsy is brought back to court and <em class="calibre8">arraigned</em> on the indictment or information. At the arraignment, he is again informed of the charges and asked to plead either guilty or not guilty. Here (or sometimes earlier, sometimes later) <em class="calibre8">plea bargaining</em> enters the picture; Buggsy may decide to plead guilty in exchange for reduced charges or favorable sentencing.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>被告拒不不认罪，意味着要提前考虑审判。然而，在审判之前，辩护律师可能会向法院提出一系列程序性或实质性动议。典型的程序性动议将质疑起诉程序中的某些缺陷。最重要的实质性动议涉及检方案件的开示和证据的压制。巴格西有权在审判前了解检察官掌握的对他有利和不利的证据，以便辩方更好地准备。如果证据收集过程存在缺陷，例如在未充分告知巴格西其宪法权利的情况下对其进行讯问，辩方可以提出动议，要求将该证据排除在审判之外。<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_309" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A defendant who pleads not guilty looks ahead to the trial. Before the trial, however, the defense attorney may make a series of procedural or substantive motions to the court. Typical procedural motions will challenge some defect in the charging process. The most important substantive motions concern discovery of the prosecution’s case and suppression of evidence. Buggsy has a right to know what evidence, favorable and unfavorable, the prosecutor has against him prior to trial, so that a defense can be better prepared. If there were defects in the process of collecting evidence, such as an interrogation of Buggsy without adequate warning of his constitutional rights, the defense can make a motion to have the evidence excluded from the trial.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>刑事诉讼程序的正式核心是审判。被告在重罪和严重轻罪中有权接受陪审团审判，但被告可以放弃这项权利，将案件交由法官审理（称为“<em class="calibre8">法庭审判”</em>）。如果被告被判无罪，案件就结束了。如果被告被判有罪，法官或陪审团将根据法律规定确定刑罚，即应适用的惩罚。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The formal centerpiece of the criminal process is the trial. The defendant has a right to a jury trial in felonies and in serious misdemeanors, although the right can be waived so the case will be tried to a judge (called a <em class="calibre8">bench trial</em>). If the defendant is acquitted, the case is over. If he is convicted, the judge or jury, as directed by statute, will determine the sentence—the punishment that is to be applied.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>审判并非故事的结束。被告有权上诉，请求上级法院复核审判是否存在错误。（如果被告被判无罪，检方不能上诉，因为宪法禁止<em class="calibre8">双重危险</em>，即对同一罪行进行两次审判。）如果发现错误，被告可能有权获得重新审判。即使在正常的上诉程序结束后，被定罪的被告仍可寻求定罪后的附带救济。有时，即使最初是在州法院进行的审判，被告也会向联邦法院提出申诉，指控审判中存在宪法错误。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The trial is hardly the end of the story. The defendant has a right to appeal, to ask a higher court to review the trial for errors. (If the defendant is acquitted, the prosecution cannot appeal, because of the constitutional prohibition on <em class="calibre8">double jeopardy</em>, or being tried twice for the same crime.) If errors are found, the defendant may be entitled to a new trial. Even after the normal appeals are concluded, the convicted defendant can pursue collateral postconviction remedies. Sometimes the defendant will petition a federal court, alleging some constitutional error in the trial, even if the trial initially was in state court.</p>

<p class="noindent"><em class="calibre8">搜查和扣押</em>法管辖一些最基本的警方调查手段，包括电话窃听和其他电子监控、商业记录审查以及翻找人们的垃圾，此外还包括一些更传统的手段，例如拦截犯罪嫌疑人并搜查其衣物、汽车或其他物品。如果刑事诉讼程序完全专注于查明真相和破案，警方将拥有广泛的搜查和扣押自由。但赋予他们这种自由将侵犯人们的财产权、隐私权和人身安全权。因此，警方从事这些活动的能力受美国宪法第四修正案的约束：</p><p class="noindent">The law of <em class="calibre8">search and seizure</em> governs some of the most basic police investigative techniques, including wiretapping and other electronic surveillance, examination of business records, and going through people’s trash, in addition to more traditional techniques such as stopping suspected criminals and searching their clothes, cars, or other belongings. If criminal procedure was focused entirely on finding the truth and solving crimes, the police would be given wide latitude to engage in searches and seizures. But giving them that latitude would infringe on people’s rights of property, privacy, and personal security. Therefore, the police’s ability to engage in these activities is regulated by the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution:</p>
<p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>人民享有人身、住宅、文件和财产不受无理搜查和扣押的权利，这一权利不得侵犯。非有正当理由，以宣誓或声明为证，并具体说明搜查地点和扣押的人或物，不得签发搜查令。</p><p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</p>
<p class="noindent">第四修正案适用于任何政府官员（而非仅限于警察）进行的搜查和扣押。公立学校校长想要搜查学生储物柜，或食品药品监督管理局肉类检查员想要检查包装厂，都必须遵守第四修正案，尽管在这些情况下构成不合理搜查的标准与……有所不同。<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_310" class="calibre4"></a>比如警察在街上拦住某人。相反，宪法保障措施仅针对政府官员的行为。私人雇主想要监控员工的电子邮件，或者百货公司在更衣室安装监控摄像头，则不受宪法限制。（在某些情况下，法律或普通法中的隐私权提供了一些保护。）</p><p class="noindent">The Fourth Amendment applies to searches and seizures conducted by any government official, not just a police officer. A public school principal who wants to search a student’s locker or a Food and Drug Administration meat inspector who wants to inspect a packing plant has to abide by the Fourth Amendment, although the standards of what constitutes an unreasonable search are different in those contexts than <a class="calibre4"></a>with a police officer stopping someone on the street. Conversely, the constitutional safeguards only protect against actions by government officials. A private employer who wants to monitor employees’ email or a department store that installs security cameras in its dressing rooms is not subject to constitutional restrictions. (In some cases, statutes or the common law right of privacy provide some protection.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>尽管《第四修正案》适用于所有政府活动，但在涉及国家安全的调查案件中，其适用范围尚不明确。一系列法规将政府的调查权力扩展至普通刑事调查所允许的范围之外。例如，根据《外国情报监视法》（FISA），联邦特工可以向秘密开会的特别法庭申请批准窃听、搜查令和其他调查手段。《美国爱国者法案》是在“9·11”袭击事件后颁布并随后修订的，引入了诸如“<em class="calibre8">偷窥搜查</em>令”等新措施。根据这些措施，特工可以在不通知搜查对象的情况下进行搜查，并有权在调查过程中要求查阅图书馆和书店的记录，而无需通知被调查者。正如2013年美国国家安全局数据大规模泄露事件所揭示的那样，《外国情报监视法》法院已授权美国国家安全局无需获得搜查令即可收集数百万通电话和电子邮件的信息。本节中关于搜查和扣押法的其余讨论仅涉及传统的刑事诉讼。 （有关政府在反恐战争中采取的行动是否符合宪法的更多信息，请参阅<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.n0126" href="#text/part0008_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-2" class="calibre4">第 2 章</a>。）</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Although the Fourth Amendment applies to all government activities, how it applies is less clear in cases of investigations involving national security. A series of statutes have expanded the government’s investigatory powers beyond what is permitted in ordinary criminal investigations. Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), for example, federal agents can apply to a special court that meets in secret to approve wiretaps, search warrants, and other investigative tools. The USA PATRIOT Act, enacted in the wake of the September 11 attacks and amended since then, introduced new measures such as <em class="calibre8">sneak and peek</em> warrants, under which agents conduct a search without notifying the subject of the search and have the power to demand library and bookstore records in the course of an investigation without notice to the person being investigated. As was revealed by massive leaks of National Security Agency data in 2013, the FISA court has authorized the NSA to collect information on millions of telephone calls and e-mails without obtaining warrants. The rest of the discussion of search and seizure law in this section only concerns traditional criminal prosecutions. (For more on the constitutionality of government actions taken in the war on terror, see <a href="#text/part0008_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-2" class="calibre4">Chapter 2</a>.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这一法律领域的第一个问题是：什么是搜查或扣押？我们先来讨论一下搜查。如果警察窥视你的车内，发现烟灰缸里有大麻烟的痕迹，这算搜查吗？如果她翻遍了你的垃圾桶，这算搜查吗？如果训练有素的警犬嗅过你的行李，这算嗅探吗？如果窃听你的电话，听你谈论大麻，这算搜查吗？什么是搜查？这个问题很重要，因为第四修正案只在搜查或扣押的情况下才提供保护。如果是搜查，法院将继续裁定该修正案的其他要求是否得到满足。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The first question in this area of law is: What is a search or a seizure? Let’s focus on searches first. Is it a search if a police officer peers inside your car to see traces of marijuana cigarettes in the ashtray? If she goes through your garbage? Has a trained dog sniff your luggage? Taps your telephone to hear if you talk about marijuana? The question of what is a search is an important one because the Fourth Amendment provides protection only when there has been a search or seizure. If it is a search, then the court goes on to determine whether the amendment’s other requirements have been satisfied.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最高法院最初裁定，只有对第四修正案所列举的领域之一（人身、住宅、文件和财物）进行物理入侵才构成搜查。在1967年的<em class="calibre8">卡茨诉美国案</em>中，法院扩大了保护范围，使其涵盖了对搜查范围和方式的合理隐私预期，而无需特定类型的物理入侵。如今，法院同时采用了这两种方法。斯卡利亚大法官在两份多数意见中裁定，对财产的物理入侵——通过<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_311" class="calibre4"></a>在嫌疑人的汽车上安装 GPS 跟踪装置（<em class="calibre8">美国诉琼斯案</em>，2012 年）以及将缉毒犬带到嫌疑人家的门廊（<em class="calibre8">佛罗里达诉贾丁斯案</em>，2013 年）——违反了第四修正案；在每起案件中，其他法官都同意这一判决，但认为侵犯隐私，而不仅仅是身体侵犯，才是判决的关键。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Originally the Supreme Court held that only a physical intrusion into one of the areas enumerated in the Fourth Amendment—persons, houses, papers, and effects—counted as a search. In <em class="calibre8">Katz v. United States</em> (1967), the Court broadened the scope of protection to encompass a justified expectation of privacy with respect to the scope and manner of the search, without the necessity of a physical intrusion of a particular kind. Today the Court uses both approaches. In two majority opinions Justice Scalia held that physical invasion of property—by <a class="calibre4"></a>installing a GPS tracking device on a suspect’s car (<em class="calibre8">United States v. Jones</em>, 2012) and bringing a drug-sniffing dog onto the porch of a suspect’s house (<em class="calibre8">Florida v. Jardines</em>, 2013)—violated the Fourth Amendment; in each case other justices concurred in the result but argued a violation of privacy, not just a physical trespass, was key to the decision.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在隐私预期标准下，有些案件很容易判决。一个人在街上公开吸食大麻烟，就等于将其非法活动暴露于公众，因此警察对该活动的观察不构成搜查。一个人在家中吸食大麻，关上门，拉上窗帘，则享有合法的隐私预期，警察无法通过钥匙孔窥视或破门而入发现犯罪活动。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Under the expectation of privacy standard, some cases are easy to decide. A person who walks down the street openly smoking a marijuana cigarette is exposing his illegal activity to the public, so a police officer’s observation of the activity is not a search. A person who smokes marijuana at home, behind closed doors with the curtains drawn, has a legitimate expectation of privacy and the police cannot peer through the keyhole or break in to discover the criminal activity.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>除了这些简单的案例之外，定义隐私预期变得非常令人困惑，法院的许多判决也显得有些奇怪。例如，房屋内部受到保护，以防止警察通过钥匙孔窥视或使用热成像设备扫描以检测用于种植大麻的高强度灯，但后院或温室却不受保护，以防止空中摄影检测到大麻植株，因为任何碰巧飞过的人都会看到这些植株。如果有人遗弃财产，就不存在隐私预期，这一概念也适用于个人垃圾，即使在垃圾清运日被“遗弃”在人行道上的不透明容器中。因此，根据最高法院的判决，信用卡账单、情书或其他留在垃圾桶里的个人或暴露物品不存在隐私预期。 （州宪法比联邦宪法保护范围更广的一个例子是，一些州法院裁定，人们确实期望自己丢弃的垃圾能够得到隐私保护，因此警方在搜查之前需要搜查令。）最后，从银行获取某人的银行记录或从电话公司获取其通话记录不属于搜查。由于银行或电话公司可以获取这些信息，因此人们并不期望这些信息会被保密。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Beyond those easy cases, defining the expectation of privacy becomes very confusing, and many of the Court’s decisions seem odd. For example, the interior of a house is protected from a police officer peeping through a keyhole or scanning by a thermal imaging device to detect high-intensity lamps used for growing marijuana, but the backyard or a greenhouse is not protected from aerial photography that detects marijuana plants, because the plants would be evident to anyone who happened to be flying over. If someone abandons property, no expectation of privacy exists, and the concept extends to one’s garbage, even if it has been “abandoned” by being left in opaque containers on the sidewalk on garbage pickup day. So, according to the Supreme Court, there is no expectation of privacy in credit card bills, love letters, or other personal or revealing items left in the trash. (In an example of broader protection under a state constitution than under the federal Constitution, several state courts have held that people do have an expectation of privacy in their abandoned garbage, so the police need a warrant before searching it.) Finally, obtaining a person’s bank records from the bank or a record of telephone calls made from the phone company is not a search. Because the information is available to the bank or phone company, there is no expectation that the information will be kept private.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>即使发生了搜查，也不意味着警方违反了《第四修正案》。请注意，该修正案包含两个独立条款。第一条款禁止不合理的搜查，第二条款规定了搜查令必须满足的条件，尤其是搜查必须有<em class="calibre8">正当理由</em>。但该修正案并未告诉我们，哪一条是主要条款。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Even if a search has occurred, it does not mean that the police have violated the Fourth Amendment. Notice that the amendment contains two independent clauses. The first clause prohibits unreasonable searches, and the second prescribes requirements that search warrants must meet, notably the requirement that there be <em class="calibre8">probable cause</em> for the search. What the amendment does not tell us is which of these clauses is primary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>长期以来，法院一直认为搜查令的要求是首要的。要获得搜查令，警方必须确定<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_312" class="calibre4"></a>搜查有充分理由证明，搜查能够在中立法官面前有序进行，从而发现犯罪证据。要求搜查令可以有效制约警方行动，从而为个人自由提供强有力的保障。当然，有时由于需要迅速采取行动，找到否则可能被转移或销毁的证据，因此获得搜查令并不切实际。因此，某些搜查可以在没有搜查令的情况下进行，但仅限于特定情况，以确保搜查不至于不合理。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For a long time the Court has considered the warrant requirement to be primary. To obtain a search warrant, the police have to establish <a class="calibre4"></a>probable cause that the search would turn up evidence of criminality, in an orderly procedure before a neutral magistrate. Requiring a warrant places a significant check on police activity and so provides considerable protection for personal liberty. Of course, sometimes it is impractical to obtain a warrant because of the need to act quickly to find evidence that otherwise would be removed or destroyed. Therefore, some searches can be made without warrants, but only in narrowly defined circumstances so that the search is not unreasonable.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法院还表达了对该修正案的第二种解读，即颠倒了要求的顺序。根据这种观点，第四修正案的核心命令是搜查不得不合理。搜查可能因多种原因而不合理，其中之一就是未根据搜查令进行。搜查令条款规定了获得有效搜查令的条件，但这并不意味着无搜查令进行的搜查是不合理的。相反，法院必须构建一个通用标准来评估无搜查令搜查的合理性。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Court also has expressed a second approach to the amendment that inverts the order of the requirements. In this view, the essential command of the Fourth Amendment is that searches not be unreasonable. A search may be unreasonable for a number of reasons, only one of which is that it was not conducted pursuant to a warrant. The warrant clause states what is required to get a valid warrant, but it does not render unreasonable searches conducted without a warrant. Instead, the Court has to construct a general standard to evaluate the reasonableness of warrantless searches.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>人们很容易认为第一种理论更符合注重权利保护的刑事诉讼方法，而第二种理论则与注重让警察履行职责的方法相一致。逮捕令要求的优先性可能被解读为严格限制了警察搜查的情形，而合理性则是一个更为灵活的标准。但案例法并非如此。相反，刑事诉讼背后的价值观冲突在两种观点中都有所体现。逮捕令要求的例外情况激增，合理性标准也并非完全开放。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is tempting to regard the first theory as more consistent with an approach to criminal procedure that focuses on the protection of rights and the second theory as allied with one that focuses on letting the police do their job. The primacy of the warrant requirement might be read to severely limit the situations in which police will be able to search, while reasonableness is a more flexible standard. But the case law has not come out that way. Instead, the conflict of values that underlies criminal procedure is expressed in each view. The exceptions to the warrant requirement have proliferated, and standards of reasonableness have not been completely open-ended.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>首先从搜查令要求说起。搜查令是法官或同等官员授权警方搜查和扣押犯罪证据的授权。搜查令要求将搜查是否合适的决定权与执行搜查的人员分离开来；据推测，独立的地方法官可以更冷静地评估涉嫌犯罪的证据，并决定其是否符合宪法标准。但在许多司法管辖区，实际执行的搜查令程序却自相矛盾。法官很少会花超过几分钟的时间来审查支持申请的证据，大多数搜查令申请都会获得批准，警方甚至可以通过电话申请搜查令，只需简单陈述其申请背后的事实即可。鉴于这种情况，搜查令要求能否有效制约警方的行为？在某种程度上，它仍然有效；申请必须提交给法官，这促使警方和检察官更加严格地遵守法律标准。<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_313" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Begin with the warrant requirement. A warrant is an authorization from a judge or comparable official to the police to search for and seize evidence of a crime. Requiring a warrant separates the decision of whether a search is appropriate from the person whose job it is to do the search; presumably, an independent magistrate can more coolly assess the evidence of alleged criminality and decide whether it meets constitutional standards. But the warrant process as actually conducted in many jurisdictions is paradoxical. The judge seldom takes more than a few minutes to review the evidence in support of an application, most warrant applications are granted, and the police can even request a warrant by telephone, simply reciting the facts underlying their request. Given this situation, can the warrant requirement act as an effective check on police behavior? To some extent, it still does; the knowledge that the request will have to be submitted to the judge disciplines police and prosecutors to adhere more closely to legal standards.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>签发搜查令的治安法官的关键任务是确定是否有合理的理由相信搜查将在指定地点找到特定的犯罪证据。理由的合理性决定了警方在打击犯罪的自由裁量权和保护第四修正案赋予的人们的隐私权之间的平衡。例如，在沃伦法院时代的两起案件中，最高法院裁定，在警方将从线人处获得的信息作为搜查令依据的常见情况下，治安法官必须获得关于线人的可靠性及其结论依据的充分事实，以便治安法官能够就是否存在合理的理由做出明智的判断（<em class="calibre8">阿吉拉尔诉德克萨斯州案，</em> 1964 年；<em class="calibre8">斯皮内利诉美国案，</em> 1969 年）。伯格法院的一项裁决，<em class="calibre8">伊利诺斯州诉盖茨案</em>（1983 年），明确放弃了这一检验标准。如果根据“全部情况”，地方法官能够得出存在合理原因的常识性判断，那么即使地方法官既不能确定匿名举报人的可信度，也不能确定举报人知情的依据，也可以签发逮捕令。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The key task for the magistrate issuing the warrant is to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the search will find particular evidence of a crime at the place indicated. How probable the cause must be sets the balance between allowing police the discretion to fight crime and protecting people’s privacy interests entailed in the Fourth Amendment. For example, in two cases during the Warren Court era, the Supreme Court held that in the common situation in which the police present information obtained from an informant as the basis for a warrant, the magistrate must be provided with sufficient facts about the reliability of the informant and the basis for the informant’s conclusions so that the magistrate can make an informed judgment about whether probable cause exists (<em class="calibre8">Aguilar v. Texas,</em> 1964, and <em class="calibre8">Spinelli v. United States,</em> 1969). A Burger Court decision, <em class="calibre8">Illinois v. Gates</em> (1983), explicitly abandoned this test. If, looking at the “totality of the circumstances,” the magistrate could arrive at a commonsense judgment that probable cause existed, a warrant could be issued even if the magistrate could determine neither the credibility of the anonymous informant nor the basis for the informant’s knowledge.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>即使认为第四修正案的搜查令条款是首要的，某些搜查也无需搜查令。当然，如果第四修正案的合理性要求是首要的，那么搜查可以在没有搜查令的情况下进行，前提是搜查合理；合理性的关键指标是合理的理由，足以相信会找到犯罪证据。一般而言，我们可以说，当停车获取搜查令会过度阻碍控制犯罪的目标，或者搜查不会严重侵犯受第四修正案保护的隐私权益时，无证搜查是有效的。但这一普遍性主张背后隐藏着许多关于我们应该让警方走多远的争议。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Even under the view that the warrant clause of the Fourth Amendment is primary, some searches do not require a warrant. Under the view that the reasonableness requirement of the Fourth Amendment is primary, of course, searches can be conducted without warrants if they are reasonable; the key indicator of reasonableness is probable cause to believe that evidence of crime will be found. In general, we might say that warrantless searches are valid when stopping to get a warrant would unduly frustrate the goal of controlling crime or when the privacy interests protected by the Fourth Amendment are not seriously infringed by the search. But that general proposition hides much controversy about how far we should let the police go.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>考虑一下关于扣押显而易见物品的例外情况<em class="calibre8">。</em>例如，如果一名警察合法进入房屋或拦截汽车，突然发现地板上有一袋毒品，即使他没有搜查令，也没有合理理由怀疑毒品在那里，他也可以扣押该袋。如果一名警察在执行合法行为时，无法扣押他注意到的犯罪证据，这将违背执法目的。但这一例外情况给警察带来了两种诱惑：一是，他们可能会以拦截、获取搜查令或进行搜查为借口，期望在显而易见的地方找到他们怀疑存在但缺乏合理理由的物品；二是，他们可能会谎称物品是在显而易见的地方发现的，而实际上这些物品是在超出授权搜查范围后发现的。最高法院最初回应了<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_314" class="calibre4"></a>第一种诱惑是，只有在物品无意发现的情况下，才允许一览无余的例外。然而，法院最终驳回了这一要求；法院指出，一旦警官合法进行任何搜查，允许其扣押在搜查过程中发现的、一览无余的物品，几乎不会侵犯受保护的隐私权，法院可以通过考虑客观标准（物品是否在一览无余）来评估搜查的合理性，而这些标准并不取决于警官的意图。第二种诱惑仍然存在，一些辩护律师认为，警官经常会作伪证，称搜查结果是在一览无余的情况下发现的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Consider the exception for the seizure of items that are discovered in <em class="calibre8">plain view</em>. If a police officer has lawfully entered a house or stopped a car, for example, and suddenly notices a bag of drugs on the floor, he may seize the bag even if he lacks a warrant and did not have probable cause to suspect the drugs were there. It would frustrate the purposes of law enforcement if an officer, while engaged in a permissible act, was unable to seize the evidence of criminality that came to his attention. But the exception creates two temptations for the police: to make stops, obtain warrants, or conduct searches under a pretext, with the expectation of finding in plain view items that they suspect are present but for which they do not have probable cause, and to testify falsely that items were found in plain view when they were actually discovered by going beyond the authorized search. The Supreme Court initially responded to <a class="calibre4"></a>the first temptation by permitting the plain-view exception only when the discovery of the items was inadvertent. Ultimately, however, the Court rejected that requirement; once the officer is lawfully conducting any search, the Court stated, there is little more invasion of a protected privacy interest by allowing him to seize items found in plain view in the course of the search, and the court can evaluate the reasonableness of the search by considering objective standards (whether the item was in plain view) that do not depend on the officer’s intention. The second temptation still exists, and some defense attorneys suggest that police officers routinely testify falsely that the product of a search was discovered in plain view.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法院越来越倾向于使用客观标准来评估合理性，认为这为在允许警察履行职责和保护第四修正案赋予的自由之间取得平衡提供了基础。例如，如果警察有合理的理由相信发生了犯罪，他们可以拦截犯罪者；根据第四修正案，这是对犯罪者的合理扣押。但假设犯罪仅仅是交通违法，而拦截是为了在高犯罪率地区搜寻非裔美国司机贩毒的证据。那么不合理的威胁是真实存在的，但法院认为，只要存在合理的理由，即使轻微交通违法的合理理由仅基于警官的证词，拦截也是合理的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The use of objective standards for assessing reasonableness has become increasingly favored by the Court as providing a basis for striking the balance between allowing the police to do their job and protecting Fourth Amendment liberties. For example, if the police have probable cause to believe a crime has occurred, they may stop the person who committed the crime; this is a reasonable seizure of the person under the Fourth Amendment. But suppose the crime is only a traffic offense and the stop is a pretext for searching for evidence of drug dealing by an African American driver in a high crime area. Then the threat of unreasonableness is real, but the Court has held that as long as probable cause exists, even if the probable cause of a minor traffic violation is established only on the testimony of the officer, the stop is reasonable.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在一种情况下，警察无需搜查令或正当理由即可进行搜查和扣押。这就是<em class="calibre8">拦截搜身的</em>情况，警察会短暂拘留一个人，与其交谈，通常是谈论一些可疑活动，并搜查此人的衣服，以确保此人没有可能对警察构成直接威胁的武器。在<em class="calibre8">特里诉俄亥俄州案</em>（1968 年）中，法院承认“警察可以在适当的情况下以适当的方式接近某人，以调查可能的犯罪行为”，然后可以“对此人的外衣进行谨慎有限的搜查，以试图发现可能用于袭击他的武器”。随后，法院裁定，要求嫌疑人在<em class="calibre8">特里</em>拦截期间表明身份既不违反其第四修正案赋予的不得无理搜查和扣押的权利，也不违反其第五修正案赋予的不得自证其罪的权利（<em class="calibre8">希贝尔诉第六司法地区法院</em>，2004 年）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In one type of situation, police do not need either a warrant or probable cause to engage in search and seizure. This is the <em class="calibre8">stop and frisk</em> situation, where an officer detains a person briefly to talk to the person, usually about some suspicious activity, and pats down the person’s clothing to make sure that the person has no weapons that might pose an immediate threat to the officer. In <em class="calibre8">Terry v. Ohio</em> (1968) the Court recognized that “a police officer may in appropriate circumstances in an appropriate manner approach a person for purposes of investigating possible criminal behavior,” and then may “conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing of such persons in an attempt to discover weapons which might be used to assault him.” Subsequently the Court held that requiring a suspect to identify himself during a <em class="calibre8">Terry</em> stop violates neither his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure nor his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination (<em class="calibre8">Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court</em>, 2004).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>哪些情况适合被拦截？关键在于让警方履行职责，同时避免任意行使自由裁量权。被拦截人员必须有事实依据才能怀疑其涉嫌犯罪，但什么构成了……<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_315" class="calibre4"></a>客观依据不明确，法院往往尊重警官的判断。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>What are the appropriate circumstances that permit a stop? The key here is letting the police do their job while avoiding the arbitrary exercise of discretion. There must be some factual basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity, but what constitutes an <a class="calibre4"></a>objective basis is not clear, and the courts often give deference to the officer’s judgment.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最后，有些警察与个人之间的冲突甚至不及<em class="calibre8">特里案中那种拦截的程度，因此不涉及第四修正案的争议。在</em><em class="calibre8">特里案</em>中，法院权衡了“当警官以武力或展示权威的方式，以某种方式限制了公民的自由”时。因此，法院认为，当警察登上公交车，要求查看每位乘客的车票和身份证件并搜查其行李时，或者当警察追捕一名因看到巡逻车到来而惊慌失措逃跑的年轻人时，都未发生扣押事件。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Finally, there are some encounters between police and individuals that do not even rise to the level of a <em class="calibre8">Terry</em> stop, so no Fourth Amendment concerns are implicated. The Court in <em class="calibre8">Terry</em> struck the balance “when the officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen.” In the Court’s view, therefore, when police board a bus and ask to see each passenger’s ticket and identification and to search his or her luggage, or when the police chase a youth who panicked and fled at seeing the arrival of a patrol car, no seizures have occurred.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0015_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-9-div1-6"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0088" class="calibre1">不自证其罪的特权是什么？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0088" class="calibre1">What Is the Privilege Against Self-Incrimination?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">宪法第五修正案部分规定：“任何人……在任何刑事案件中，不得被迫自证其罪。” 这项<em class="calibre8">不自证其罪的特权</em>是我们刑事司法制度的基石。在我们的控辩式司法制度中，控方有责任通过自身努力而非通过讯问被告来证明其案件。如果被告被迫开口，她将面临所谓的“残酷的自证、作伪证或藐视法庭的三难困境”——被迫在认罪、撒谎并因作伪证而受到惩罚，以及保持沉默并因藐视法庭而受到惩罚之间做出选择。这违背了公平竞争的理念、个人与政府之间的平衡以及个人尊严。这项特权也保护了个人隐私，并反映出人们对警方可能用于逼供的手段的不信任。</p><p class="noindent">The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution provides in part that “No person...shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.” This <em class="calibre8">privilege against self-incrimination</em> is fundamental to our criminal justice system. In our accusatorial system, the prosecution has the burden of proving its case through its own efforts, not through an inquisition of the accused. If a defendant was compelled to speak, she would be faced with what has been called the “cruel trilemma of self-accusation, perjury, or contempt”—being forced to choose among confessing to a crime, lying and being punished for perjury, or keeping silent and being punished for contempt. This violates our notions of fair play, the balance between the individual and the government, and the dignity of the individual. The privilege also protects an individual’s privacy and reflects a mistrust of the police practices that may be used to extract confessions.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>但这项特权是有代价的。在许多情况下，供词，或从被告处获得的、能引出其他证据的信息，是证明被告有罪的唯一可信手段。在没有证人且物证很少或根本没有的情况下，只有对嫌疑人进行深入的讯问才能提供有罪证据。因此，排除被告的证词意味着许多犯罪行为将逍遥法外。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But there is a cost to the privilege. In many cases a confession, or information obtained from the defendant that will lead to other evidence, is the only plausible means of proving the defendant’s guilt. In cases in which there are no witnesses and little or no physical evidence, only intense questioning of a suspect will provide evidence of guilt. Excluding the defendant’s testimony, therefore, means that many crimes will go unpunished.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在刑事诉讼中，一个人被迫自证其罪意味着什么？这项特权涉及被告的证人证言，而非其他类型的证据。只要遵循适当的程序，检方可以强制被告出庭，提供声音或笔迹样本，甚至提供可能构成罪证的DNA样本。检方还可以强制出示为其他案件准备的记录。<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_316" class="calibre4"></a>目的，例如在税务欺诈起诉过程中的商业记录。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>What does it mean for a person to be compelled to be a witness against himself in a criminal proceeding? The privilege relates to testimonial evidence from a defendant, not to other types of evidence. As long as proper procedures are followed, the prosecution can force a defendant to appear in a lineup, give a voice or handwriting sample, or even give a DNA sample that may be incriminating. The prosecution also can compel the production of records that were prepared for other <a class="calibre4"></a>purposes, such as business records in the course of a prosecution for tax fraud.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>从字面上理解，第五修正案的措辞可能仅禁止政府强迫被告在审判中作证，但允许任何其他形式的政府强制措施，从而产生对被告不利的证据。但最高法院一直以来对这一特权的解读更为宽泛。如果警方可以强迫认罪，或者检察官可以强迫大陪审团作证，然后在审判中使用证据，那么这将削弱特权背后的政策。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Read literally, the language of the Fifth Amendment might only prevent the government from forcing a defendant to testify at his trial but permit any other kind of government compulsion that produces evidence against the defendant. But the Supreme Court always has read the privilege more broadly. It would undercut the policies behind the privilege if the police could coerce a confession or the prosecutor could compel grand jury testimony and then use the evidence at the trial.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>试想一下，如果检察官利用大陪审团收集证据，并传唤调查对象之一作为证人，会发生什么情况。证人收到传票，要求其出庭作证。如果她未能出庭或未能回答问题，她可能被判藐视法庭并入狱。如果她作伪证，她可能被控作伪证罪。如果她想避免这两种后果，并如实作证，而她的证词后来在审判中被用来对她不利，那么她实际上就是被迫作证自证其罪。关键在于强制作证的用途，而不是作证的地点。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Consider what happens when the prosecutor is using the grand jury to gather evidence and calls one of the targets of the investigation as a witness. The witness is given a subpoena that requires her to testify. If she fails to appear or fails to answer questions put to her, she can be held in contempt of court and sent to jail. If she testifies falsely, she can be prosecuted for perjury. If she wants to avoid either of those consequences and testifies truthfully, and her testimony is later used against her at her trial, she has, in effect, been compelled to testify against herself. The key is the use of the compelled testimony, not the place where it is given.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>检察官只有保证证词不会在随后的刑事诉讼中使用，才能避免在大陪审团或其他地方行使不自证其罪特权。这通常是通过根据证词授予起诉豁免权来实现的。豁免分为两种。<em class="calibre8">使用豁免</em>意味着检方不能在后续审判中使用证人的证词或从中得出的任何证据。但是，如果检察官掌握了针对证人的、不是来自证人证词的证据，则可以使用这些证据。<em class="calibre8">交易豁免</em>意味着检方不得随后以证人证词中讨论的任何罪行起诉证人，即使检察官独立发现了证人有罪的证据。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The prosecutor can avoid the exercise of the privilege against self-incrimination, at the grand jury or elsewhere, only by guaranteeing that the testimony will not be used in a subsequent criminal prosecution. This is commonly done by granting immunity from prosecution on the basis of the testimony. Immunity can be of two kinds. <em class="calibre8">Use immunity</em> means that the prosecution cannot use the witness’s testimony or any evidence derived from it in a subsequent trial. If the prosecutor has evidence against the witness that is not the product of the witness’s testimony, though, that evidence can be used. <em class="calibre8">Transactional immunity</em> means that the prosecution may not subsequently prosecute the witness for any crime that is discussed in the witness’s testimony, even if the prosecutor independently discovers evidence of the witness’s guilt.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>一个更常见且更具争议的问题是，在正式司法程序之外，尤其是在警方审讯中，如何适用不自证其罪的特权。在许多情况下，对被告最重要的审讯并非在法庭或大陪审团审讯室进行，而是在警察局进行。最高法院已认识到，在警察局审讯嫌疑人具有足够的恐吓性，可能会损害不自证其罪的特权。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A more common and controversial issue is how the privilege against self-incrimination applies outside of formal judicial proceedings, particularly to police interrogations. In many cases, the most important questioning of the defendant does not take place in the courtroom or the grand jury room but rather in the police station. The Supreme Court has recognized that interrogating a suspect in the police station is sufficiently intimidating that it threatens to undermine the privilege against self-incrimination.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">在 1964 年的米兰达诉亚利桑那州</em>案中，法院在审查了警方审讯嫌疑人的做法，包括其认为常用的技巧和其他心理手段后，得出结论：“羁押审讯这一事实本身就对个人造成了沉重的打击<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_317" class="calibre4"></a>自由和利用个人弱点进行交易。”必须使用“足够的保护措施……以消除监禁环境中固有的强制性。”这些保护措施必须在每种情况下使用，包括如今著名的<em class="calibre8">米兰达</em>警告。首先，在对被拘留的嫌疑人进行讯问之前，必须告知他“他有权保持沉默……所说的任何话都可能而且将会在法庭上作为对他不利的证据……他有权咨询律师并在讯问期间有律师陪同……[并且]如果他贫困，将会为其指定一名律师。”其次，如果嫌疑人“在讯问之前或讯问期间的任何时候以任何方式表示他希望保持沉默，则讯问必须停止……[并且如果他]声明他需要律师，则讯问必须停止，直到律师到场为止。”</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In <em class="calibre8">Miranda v. Arizona</em> (1964), after examining police practices about interrogating suspects, including the tricks and other psychological devices it believed were commonly used, the Court concluded that “the very fact of custodial interrogation exacts a heavy toll on individual <a class="calibre4"></a>liberty and trades on the weaknesses of individuals.” It is necessary to use “adequate protective devices...to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings.” These protective devices must be used in every case and include the now-famous <em class="calibre8">Miranda</em> warnings. First, before a suspect in custody can be questioned, he must be informed “that he has the right to remain silent...that anything said can and will be used against the individual in court...that he has the right to consult with a lawyer and to have the lawyer with him during interrogation...[and] that if he is indigent a lawyer will be appointed to represent him.” Second, if the suspect “indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during the questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease...[and if he] states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>尽管法院建议其他能够有效保护嫌疑人权利的程序可以取代<em class="calibre8">米兰达</em>保障措施，但目前尚未提出或批准其他程序，因此<em class="calibre8">米兰达保障</em>措施至今仍是审讯程序的控制依据。有趣的是，尽管警方调整了审讯程序，将这些易于执行的警告纳入其中，但认罪率并未下降。然而，该裁决仍然存在争议，因为在某些情况下，警方未能遵守其要求，导致认罪证据被排除。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Although the Court suggested that other procedures that would effectively protect a suspect’s rights could substitute for the <em class="calibre8">Miranda</em> safeguards, no other procedures have been offered or approved, so <em class="calibre8">Miranda</em> remains the controlling authority for interrogation procedures today. Interestingly, as police have adapted their procedures to include these easily administered warnings, the incidence of confessions has not declined. Nevertheless, the decision remains controversial because in some cases, the failure of the police to adhere to its requirements leads to the exclusion of confessions from evidence.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">米兰达</em>原则下的自证其罪特权在警方进行<em class="calibre8">羁押审讯</em>时生效。羁押意味着嫌疑人被以任何造成恐吓局面的重大方式剥夺了行动自由，即使嫌疑人尚未被正式逮捕。因此，当国税局特工在嫌疑人家中或办公室审讯他时，他并没有被羁押，除非情况特别令人感到恐吓；在客厅提问本身并不令人感到恐吓，但凌晨 4 点在卧室被四名警察审讯则带有强迫的成分。当警方要求嫌疑人到警察局并明确告诉他他没有被捕时，他并没有被羁押。如果他在这种情况下不明智地承认犯罪，则不违反不自证其罪特权。但当他们用警车把他接走，带到警察局，却没有告诉他可以自由离开时，即使他没有被逮捕，他也受到了强制。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The privilege of self-incrimination under <em class="calibre8">Miranda</em> attaches when police conduct a <em class="calibre8">custodial interrogation</em>. Custody means that the suspect has been deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way that creates an intimidating situation, even if the suspect has not been formally arrested. Thus when IRS agents interview a suspect in his home or office, he is not in custody, unless something about the situation is particularly intimidating; asking questions in the living room is not inherently intimidating, but being questioned by four police officers in one’s bedroom at 4:00 a.m. has elements of compulsion. When the police ask a suspect to come to the police station and specifically tell him that he is not under arrest, he is not in custody. If he unwisely confesses to a crime in those circumstances, the privilege against self-incrimination is not violated. But when they pick him up in a police car, take him to the station, and do not tell him that he is free to go, he is subject to compulsion, even if he is not arrested.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>关于什么构成审讯的问题也可能导致案件棘手。显然，当警官讯问嫌疑人时，这就是审讯。此外，<em class="calibre8">米兰达</em>规则的目的是防止违宪强制，因此警方应该知道的其他可能引发定罪反应的言语或行为也应该被考虑。<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_318" class="calibre4"></a>被视为审讯。但将特权扩大到这种程度将排除可信证据。例如，有时警方可能会在被告面前进行谈话，其意图或效果是诱导被告认罪。在<em class="calibre8">罗德岛诉伊尼斯案</em>（1980）中，被告因使用猎枪谋杀和抢劫而被捕。当警察用巡逻车将他带到警察局时，他们谈到找到枪的重要性，以免被附近残疾儿童学校的孩子发现并伤害。被告自愿向警方指出枪的位置，法院裁定该陈述和证据可用于对付被告，因为警方没有审讯他。另一方面，在<em class="calibre8">布鲁尔诉威廉姆斯案</em>（1977）中，该案涉及第六修正案赋予律师辩护权的审讯构成，威廉姆斯因谋杀被捕。在警车从达文波特前往得梅因的途中，一名警官表示，由于天气恶化，很难找到受害者的尸体并为其举行“基督教葬礼”。威廉姆斯随后指示警方前往尸体所在地。法院裁定，本案存在审讯，因为该警官的言论是专门针对威廉姆斯的，而众所周知威廉姆斯是一位虔诚的宗教信徒。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The question of what constitutes an interrogation also can produce difficult cases. Obviously, when officers question a suspect, that is interrogation. Further, the intent of <em class="calibre8">Miranda</em> is to prevent unconstitutional compulsion, so other kinds of words or conduct by the police that they should know are likely to elicit an incriminating response also should <a class="calibre4"></a>be considered to be interrogation. But extending the privilege that far will exclude credible evidence. For example, sometimes police may carry on a conversation in the presence of the accused, which has the intent or effect of inducing the accused to confess. In <em class="calibre8">Rhode Island v. Innis</em> (1980) the defendant was arrested for murder and robbery with a shotgun. As the police were taking him to the station in their cruiser, they talked about how important it was to find the gun, lest it be found by a child from a nearby school for handicapped children who might be injured by it. The defendant volunteered to show the police where the gun was, and the Court ruled that the statement and the evidence could be used against the defendant, since the police had not interrogated him. On the other hand, in <em class="calibre8">Brewer v. Williams</em> (1977), a case concerning what constitutes an interrogation for purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, Williams was arrested for murder. During a trip from Davenport to Des Moines in a police car, an officer said that because the weather was worsening, it would be difficult to find the victim’s body and give her a “Christian burial.” Williams then directed the police to the body. Here the Court held that there was an interrogation because the officer’s remarks were directed specifically at Williams, who was known to be deeply religious.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>嫌疑人可以放弃不自证其罪特权及其相关的获得律师辩护的权利。<em class="calibre8">米兰达规则</em>本身规定，放弃特权必须是自愿的、知情的和明智的，并且不能从嫌疑人收到警告后的沉默或自白本身推断出放弃特权。然而，法院最近裁定，如果没有明确援引该特权，则可以放弃该特权。例如，在<em class="calibre8">Berghuis v. Thompkins</em> (2010) 案中，Thompkins 被判没有援引该特权，因为他在宣读他的权利时没有回应，并且在随后三个小时的讯问中保持沉默；当他最终对警官的问题“你是否向上帝祈祷击落那个男孩？”回答“是”时，该陈述在审判中可以被采纳。在本案中，法院自相矛盾地裁定，沉默不足以援引沉默权。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Suspects can waive the privilege against self-incrimination and its associated right to counsel. <em class="calibre8">Miranda</em> itself states that the waiver must be voluntary, knowing, and intelligent and that a waiver cannot be presumed from a suspect’s silence after receiving the warning or from a confession itself. More recently, however the Court has held that the privilege can be waived if not unambiguously invoked. In <em class="calibre8">Berghuis v. Thompkins</em> (2010), for example, Thompkins was held not to have invoked the privilege by failing to respond when read his rights and staying silent during three hours of subsequent questioning; when he finally answered “yes” to an officer’s question, “Do you pray to God for shooting that boy down?”, the statement was admissible at trial. Here the Court held paradoxically that being silent is not enough to invoke the right to silence.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0015_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-9-div1-7"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0089" class="calibre1">如果警察侵犯被告的权利会发生什么？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0089" class="calibre1">What Happens if Police Violate a Defendant’s Rights?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">第四、第五和第六修正案的宪法保护并非自动生效。例如，尽管第四修正案禁止不合理的搜查和扣押，但它并未明确规定如果发生不合理的搜查将会发生什么。最高法院在该领域的裁决引发的争议大多集中在侵犯宪法权利的救济问题上。自1914年<em class="calibre8">“威克斯诉美国案”（Weeks v. United States</em>）以来，最高法院制定了<em class="calibre8">排除规则</em>，<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_319" class="calibre4"></a>该法规定，政府违反宪法获取的证据不得用于指控权利受到侵犯的被告。如果警方在非法搜查过程中发现有罪证据，或违反<em class="calibre8">米兰达</em>原则获取供词，则该证据或供词不得用于定罪被告。</p><p class="noindent">The constitutional protections of the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments are not self-executing. Although the Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, for example, it does not tell us what happens if an unreasonable search occurs. Much of the controversy about the Supreme Court’s decisions in this area have come on this issue of the remedy for violations of constitutional rights. Beginning in <em class="calibre8">Weeks v. United States</em> (1914), the Court has formulated the <em class="calibre8">exclusionary rule</em>, <a class="calibre4"></a>which states that evidence obtained by the government in violation of the Constitution may not be used against the defendant whose rights have been violated. If the police find incriminating evidence during the course of an illegal search or obtain a confession in violation of <em class="calibre8">Miranda</em>, the evidence or confession may not be used to convict the defendant.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>人们对排除规则的批评声浪甚嚣尘上，因为它似乎损害了执法目标。卡多佐大法官写道，“罪犯因为警员犯错而逍遥法外”这说得通吗？排除规则有利于罪犯，因为它赋予他们行使宪法权利排除其有罪证据的能力。由于它阻止了有罪证据在审判中被采纳，它破坏了对真相的探求和刑事处罚的执行。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There has been vociferous criticism of the exclusionary rule because it appears to undermine the objectives of law enforcement. Does it make sense, as Justice Cardozo wrote, that “the criminal is to go free because the constable has blundered”? The exclusionary rule favors the guilty, by putting in their hands the ability to exclude evidence of their guilt through the assertion of constitutional rights. To the extent that it prevents evidence of guilt from being admitted at trial, it subverts the search for truth and the imposition of criminal punishment.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>排除规则的背后有几个原因。如果法院允许使用非法获得的证据，那么实际上就是认可了警方的违宪行为。正如克拉克大法官在1961 年的<em class="calibre8">马普诉俄亥俄州</em>案中所写，他承认卡多佐的名言：“罪犯如果愿意可以逍遥法外，但真正让他自由的是法律。没有什么比政府不遵守自己的法律更能迅速地摧毁一个政府了。”在<em class="calibre8">马普案</em>中，法院使该规则对所有州的起诉都具有约束力，并增加了该规则的威慑作用的理由，这一理由自那时起就越来越受到强调。该规则阻止警察进行非法搜查或非法获取供词，因为这样做是徒劳的，因为这样获得的证据不能用来给被告定罪。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Several reasons lie behind the exclusionary rule. If the courts allow the use of illegally obtained evidence, they are in effect approving the unconstitutional conduct of the police. As Justice Clark wrote in <em class="calibre8">Mapp v. Ohio</em> (1961), acknowledging Cardozo’s epigram, “The criminal goes free if he must, but it is the law that sets him free. Nothing can destroy a government more quickly than its failure to observe its own law.” In <em class="calibre8">Mapp</em>, which made the rule binding in all state prosecutions, the Court also added the rationale of the rule’s deterrent effect, a rationale that has been emphasized increasingly since then. The rule discourages police from conducting illegal searches or illegally obtaining confessions because it would be fruitless to do so, since the evidence so obtained could not be used to convict the defendant.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">自马普案</em>以来，关于排除规则的大部分争论都集中在其威慑作用上。这项规则是否具有显著的威慑作用？对违宪警察行为的威慑是否大于执法成本？该规则的支持者指出，通过威慑，看似有利于有罪者的规则实际上保护了无辜者。该规则的作用远不止在个案中作为防止警察非法行为的保障措施。它还对所有警察起到了警示作用，鼓励警察部门改进培训和监督；结果，侵犯我们所有人宪法权利的行为减少了。这种威慑的成本并不太高。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Since <em class="calibre8">Mapp</em>, much of the debate about the exclusionary rule has focused on its deterrent effect. Does the rule have a significant deterrent effect, and does the deterrence of unconstitutional police behavior outweigh the cost to law enforcement? Supporters of the rule point out that through deterrence, the rule that seems to favor the guilty actually protects the innocent. The rule does much more than serve as a safeguard against unlawful police action in an individual case. It also serves as a warning to all police officers and encourages police departments to improve training and supervision; as a result, there are fewer invasions of constitutional rights of all of us. The costs of this deterrence are not too great.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，批评人士认为，这项规则基本上没有必要。与<em class="calibre8">米兰达</em>警告一样，在警察滥权的时代，排除非法扣押的证据或许是一种有效的预防措施，但如今，打击犯罪的需要才是更令人担忧的。排除证据会过度奖励犯罪分子，并破坏执法。如果发生非法警察行为，可以通过其他方式处理，<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_320" class="calibre4"></a>例如侵权救济或针对警察的民权诉讼。无辜者和有罪者都将获得宪法权利的保护；任何一方都可以对警察提起诉讼，并追回非法搜查造成的损失。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Critics suggest, however, that the rule is largely unnecessary. Like the <em class="calibre8">Miranda</em> warnings, the exclusion of illegally seized evidence may have been a useful prophylactic in an era of abusive police practices, but today a greater concern is the need to fight crime. Exclusion of evidence unduly rewards the criminal and sabotages law enforcement. To the extent that illegal police practices occur, they can be dealt with by other means, <a class="calibre4"></a>such as a tort remedy or civil rights actions against the police. Both the innocent and the guilty would have their constitutional rights protected; either could bring an action against the police and recover damages for an illegal search.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>但该规则的支持者质疑这种补救措施是否有效。对于轻微的宪法权利侵犯，受害者几乎没有起诉的动机；例如，警察进行随机交通拦截和非法搜查车辆，这种做法可能带来巨大的不便、烦恼和挫败感，但其损害赔偿很少值得经历一场旷日持久的诉讼。更严重的违法行为，如果发现了犯罪证据，理论上可以带来更大的损害赔偿，但将理论付诸实践却很困难。陪审团可能非常不赞同已定罪的罪犯向警察提起侵权损害赔偿诉讼。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But proponents of the rule question whether such a remedy would be effective. For modest violations of constitutional rights, the victim would have little incentive to sue; where the police conduct random traffic stops and illegally search cars, for example, the inconvenience, annoyance, and frustration at the practice might be great, but the damages would seldom be worth going through a protracted lawsuit. More serious violations that turned up evidence of criminality could theoretically bring larger damages, but it would be hard to translate the theory into reality. Juries might be very unsympathetic to the convicted criminal bringing a tort claim for damages against a police officer.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>围绕排除规则的冲突也体现在法院判决中。其中一个发展是“毒树之果”原则，起源于<em class="calibre8">Silverthorne Lumber Co. 诉美国案</em>（1920 年）。联邦探员非法从被告手中扣押了有罪文件。在法院下令归还文件后，检察官让大陪审团向被告发出传票，要求其出示相同的文件。最高法院宣布传票无效，因为它是非法扣押的最终产物。随后，费利克斯·法兰克福大法官创造了生动的“毒树之果”语言，以表示非法搜查的结果不能作为证据。该原则扩展了排除规则，阻止警方进行非法搜查，以期获得随后可以合法获取的证据线索。但法院也限制了该原则；如果成果与原始违法行为之间的联系减弱，或者对成果的了解来自独立来源，或者即使没有违法行为，成果也必然会被发现，则可以采纳。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This conflict over the exclusionary rule has played out in court decisions as well. One development is the “fruit of the poisonous tree” doctrine, originating in <em class="calibre8">Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States</em> (1920). Federal agents unlawfully seized incriminating documents from the defendant. After the court ordered that the documents be returned, the prosecutor had the grand jury issue a subpoena to the defendant to produce the same documents. The Supreme Court invalidated the subpoena because it was the ultimate product of the illegal seizure. Justice Felix Frankfurter subsequently coined the colorful “fruit of the poisonous tree” language to indicate that the result of an illegal search could not be admitted into evidence. The doctrine extends the exclusionary rule by discouraging the police from making an illegal search in the expectation that it will produce leads to evidence that subsequently could be legally obtained. But the Court has limited the doctrine as well; where the link between the fruit and the original illegal action is attenuated, where knowledge of the fruit came from an independent source, or where it would have been the subject of an inevitable discovery even without the illegal activity, it may be admitted.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第二个发展涉及排除规则适用的程序。显然，它禁止在审判中使用非法获取的证据作为控方陈述的一部分。为了获得最大的威慑效果，警方应该被禁止使用任何此类证据。但这并没有发生。相反，法院在排除非法证据在审判以外的场合产生的渐进式威慑效果与寻求真相和定罪罪犯的成本之间进行了权衡。因此，法院裁定，非法证据可以作为大陪审团起诉书的依据，用于在审判、量刑听证会以及囚犯的人身保护令程序中弹劾被告的证词。<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_321" class="calibre4"></a>对定罪提出质疑，并参与国税局对非法所得资金的征税程序。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A second development concerns the proceedings to which the exclusionary rule applies. Obviously, it bars use of illegally obtained evidence as part of the prosecution’s case at trial. To obtain the maximum deterrent effect, the police should be denied all use of the evidence. But that has not happened. Instead, the Court has balanced the incremental deterrent effect of the exclusion of illegal evidence in settings other than the trial against the cost to truth-seeking and conviction of criminals. Therefore, it has held, illegal evidence may be used as the basis of a grand jury indictment, to impeach the defendant’s testimony at trial, in a sentencing hearing, in a prisoner’s habeas corpus proceedings <a class="calibre4"></a>challenging a conviction, and in a proceeding by the IRS to levy against illegally obtained funds.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第三个发展，也是最重要的发展，是排除规则的<em class="calibre8">善意例外</em>。该规则的主要目的是阻止违宪的警察行为，法院得出结论，如果警察没有故意侵犯被告的宪法权利，该规则就不能产生这种效果。如果他们善意地认为其行为符合宪法规定，并进行非法搜查，那么刑事诉讼程序就不应该被剥夺使用该证据的权利，即使该证据是通过非法途径获取的。假设一名警察因交通违规拦停一名司机，其巡逻车上的电脑终端显示，针对该司机的逮捕令尚未执行。该警察逮捕了司机，搜查了他本人和车辆，并发现了毒品和一把手枪。该逮捕令实际上已被撤销，但由于在将信息输入计算机系统时存在疏忽，该信息并未出现在计算机终端上。毒品和枪支是非法搜查的产物，因为这次搜查不是有效逮捕令的附带行为，但法院裁定，由于警官是善意依赖计算机系统行事，因此这些毒品和枪支并未被排除在证据之外。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A third development, and the most important, is the <em class="calibre8">good faith exception</em> to the exclusionary rule. The rule is primarily intended to deter unconstitutional police conduct, and, the Court has concluded, it cannot have that effect where the police do not intentionally violate a defendant’s constitutional rights. Where they conduct an illegal search in a good faith belief that their acts are constitutionally permissible, the criminal process should not be denied the benefits of using the evidence, even though it was illegally obtained. Suppose when a police officer stops a driver for a traffic violation, the computer terminal in his patrol car indicates that there is an arrest warrant outstanding for the driver. The officer arrests the driver, searches him and the car, and discovers drugs and a handgun. The warrant had actually been quashed but, due to negligence in entering information into the computer system, that information did not appear on the computer terminal. The drugs and guns are the products of an illegal search because the search was not incident to a valid arrest warrant, but, the Court ruled, it was not excluded from evidence because the officer acted in good faith in relying on the computer system.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>善意例外对排除规则产生了重大影响。它降低了警方在获得搜查令的案件中谨慎行事的动力，也降低了地方法官仔细审查搜查令依据的动力；无论哪种情况，错误都会因警察执行搜查令的善意而得到纠正。在涉及无证搜查的案件中，它进一步削弱了该规则；善意例外鼓励警方犯侵犯宪法权利的错误，因为它允许使用通过善意侵犯获得的证据。法院得出结论，当警方的错误是出于善意且仅仅是疏忽而非故意时，排除规则在阻止警方不当行为方面的益处有限；而这种有限的益处将被释放罪犯的成本所抵消（Herring <em class="calibre8">v. United States</em>，2009）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The good faith exception makes significant inroads to the exclusionary rule. It gives police less incentive to exercise caution in cases in which they obtain warrants, and it gives magistrates little incentive to closely scrutinize the basis for the warrant; in either case, error is cured by the police officer’s good faith in carrying out the warrant. In cases involving warrantless searches, it has further eroded the rule; a good faith exception encourages police to err on the side of invading constitutional rights because it permits the use of evidence obtained through good faith invasions. The Court concluded that the benefit of the exclusionary rule in deterring improper police behavior was modest when their error was in good faith and only negligent, not intentional; that modest benefit would be outweighed by the cost of setting a criminal free (<em class="calibre8">Herring v. United States</em>, 2009).</p>

<p class="noindent">电视节目将审判以及控辩双方的较量描绘成刑事诉讼的核心。实际上，90%到95%的刑事案件无需审判即可结案，被告通常会通过认罪协议（pleas bargain）认罪。认罪协议是一种交易：被告（通过其律师）与检察官达成协议，被告将认罪，以换取检察官降低对被告的指控的严重性。<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_322" class="calibre4"></a>被告人，撤销对被告人的部分指控，不提起其他指控，或者帮助被告人获得宽大处理。</p><p class="noindent">Television programs portray the trial, with its battle between prosecution and defense, as the central feature of the criminal process. Actually, 90 to 95 percent of criminal cases are disposed of without a trial when the defendant pleads guilty, often through a plea bargain. A plea bargain is a deal: an agreement between the defendant (through her attorney) and the prosecutor that the defendant will plead guilty in exchange for the prosecutor’s reducing the seriousness of the charges against the <a class="calibre4"></a>defendant, dismissing some of the charges pending against the defendant, refraining from bringing other charges, or helping the defendant obtain a lenient sentence.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>假设萨拉在一次缉毒行动中被捕，被发现持有十袋可卡因和一把未注册的手枪。她试图逃离现场，并与一名警察发生扭打。检察官指控萨拉持有毒品意图分销（因为涉及数量庞大）、持有非法枪支、拒捕、重罪袭击，以及（因为她将其中一个袋子扔到街上）乱扔垃圾。这是典型的检察官行为；检察官在提出所有可能的指控时不会承担更大的责任，而且这在协商认罪协议时增强了他的筹码。考虑到萨拉被定罪的可能性，她的律师与她协商了一项认罪协议。作为萨拉同意认罪的交换条件，检察官同意将分销指控降为单纯持有，撤销武器、袭击和乱扔垃圾的指控，并建议法官将她转入戒毒治疗项目，而不是送进监狱。此外，尽管检察官有证据表明萨拉参与了其他毒品交易，但他没有对这些事项提出任何指控。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Suppose Sara is arrested in a drug bust in which she is found in possession of ten bags of cocaine and an unregistered handgun. Attempting to flee the site of the bust, she tussles with a police officer. The prosecutor charges Sara with possession of drugs with intent to distribute (because of the quantity involved), possession of an illegal firearm, resisting arrest, felonious assault, and, because she threw one of the bags onto the street, littering. This is typical prosecutorial behavior; the prosecutor incurs no greater burden in bringing every charge imaginable, and it improves his leverage at the time of negotiating a plea agreement. Given the likelihood of conviction, Sara’s attorney negotiates a plea bargain. In exchange for her agreement to plead guilty, the prosecutor agrees to reduce the distribution charge to simple possession, dismiss the weapons, assault, and littering charges, and recommend to the judge that she be diverted into a drug treatment program rather than be sent to jail. In addition, although the prosecutor has evidence that Sara has been involved in other drug transactions, he refrains from bringing any charges in those matters.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>从这个简单的假设中，我们可以看出为什么辩诉交易是该制度如此重要的组成部分。对于检察官来说，萨拉的案子只是例行公事，他手头有太多类似的案件，无法全部开庭审理。即使他能做到，他所面对的法官也无法全部审理；资金不足的法院面临着大量积压案件。此外，尽管萨拉的案子看起来无懈可击，但没有哪个案子是万无一失的。因此，辩诉交易能让检察官高效、可靠地处理她的案件。萨拉或许也愿意为了达成辩诉交易而牵连她的毒品供应商，这样检察官就可以利用对她的指控，将更严重的罪犯定罪。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>From this simple hypothetical we can see why plea bargaining is such an important part of the system. For the prosecutor, Sara’s case is routine, and he has too many such cases to be able to bring them all to trial. Even if he could, the judges before whom he practices would be unable to try them all; underfunded courts face a huge backlog of cases. Moreover, even though Sara’s case looks airtight, no case is a sure thing. So a plea bargain gives the prosecutor an efficient and certain disposition of her case. Sara may also be willing to implicate her drug supplier in exchange for a plea bargain, so the prosecutor can leverage the charge against her into a conviction of an even worse criminal.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>认罪协议对萨拉来说也有利。检察官提出的一系列指控，一旦定罪，她将面临长期监禁。无论她认为自己在审判中胜诉的可能性有多大（对许多被告来说，胜诉的可能性并不大），如果败诉，她都将面临重罚。根据指控和她的犯罪记录，减刑对她来说可能尤为重要；如果她是前科犯，第三次重罪定罪可能会使她根据“三振出局”法被判处强制徒刑，而她可以通过承认轻罪来避免这种情况。如果她无法支付保释金，她也不必在监狱里待上几个月等待审判。而且，她也大大减少了刑事诉讼带来的麻烦和压力。<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_323" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A plea bargain works to Sara’s advantage, too. The panoply of charges brought by the prosecutor threatens her with a lengthy prison term if she is convicted. No matter how good she thinks her chances are at trial (and for many defendants, the chances are not very good), if she loses she faces a heavy penalty. Depending on the charges and her criminal history, a charge reduction might be particularly important to her; if she is a prior offender, a third felony conviction might subject her to a mandatory sentence under a “three strikes and you’re out” law, which she can avoid by pleading guilty to a misdemeanor. If she cannot make bail, she does not have to stay in jail for several months waiting for a trial. And she dramatically reduces the hassle and aggravation of being subject to the criminal process.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在某些情况下，通常涉及白领犯罪，被告甚至不必认罪来履行她的义务。她可以提出<em class="calibre8">不抗辩</em>或<em class="calibre8">不抗辩</em>的请求，这表明她不对针对她的指控提出抗辩，但严格来说并不等于认罪。这种请求与被告案件中的认罪具有相同的效果；法院将把它视为认罪并据此判刑。但在后续程序中有一个重要的区别。与认罪不同，不抗辩不能在民事诉讼中用作对被告的承认。例如，当一家公司因违反反垄断法而被政府起诉时，它可能会同意提出不抗辩，以避免在随后由其伤害的企业或消费者提起的民事诉讼中确定其责任。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In some cases, usually involving white-collar crimes, the defendant doesn’t even have to plead guilty to fulfill her part of the bargain. She instead may enter a plea of <em class="calibre8">no contest</em> or <em class="calibre8">nolo contendere</em>, which is a statement that she does not contest the charges against her but is not technically an admission of guilt. This plea has the same effect as a guilty plea in the defendant’s case; the court will treat it as a plea of guilty and sentence accordingly. But there is an important difference in subsequent proceedings. Unlike a guilty plea, nolo contendere cannot be used as an admission against the defendant in civil litigation. When a company is prosecuted by the government for criminal antitrust violations, for example, it may agree to plead nolo contendere to prevent establishing its liability in subsequent civil suits by businesses or consumers it has injured.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>辩诉交易通常被视为对法院拥挤和刑事诉讼程序长期拖延的一种应对措施；检察官有大量案件需要处理，被告不愿等待审判，而法官则乐于让案件脱离审判程序。但辩诉交易至少一个世纪以来一直是刑事司法系统的一个显著特征，在小城镇和农村地区以及拥挤的大都市审判法院中都很常见。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Plea bargaining is usually seen to be a response to congested courts and long delays in the criminal process; the prosecutors have a huge caseload to move, the defendant doesn’t want to wait for a trial, and the judges are happy to have the cases out of the system. But plea bargaining has been a prominent feature of the criminal justice system for at least a century, and it commonly occurs in small towns and rural areas as well in crowded metropolitan trial courts.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>辩诉交易作为我们刑事司法系统的核心特征，这多少有些不妥。难道伸张正义不应该与为二手车讨价还价不同吗？整个过程滋生了对法律的不尊重，并带来了非常实际的后果。批评人士指出，辩诉交易会产生不公正的结果，有时过于宽容，有时又过于严厉。犯罪受害者和犯罪控制倡导者抱怨辩诉交易过于轻易地放过了罪犯；被告获得减刑并非因为他们表现出悔意并承担了自身行为的责任，而是因为他们在帮司法系统一个忙。与此同时，辩诉交易会向那些无辜或至少不值得被定罪的被告施加压力，迫使他们认罪。这样做意味着被告可以更快地退出司法系统，因为法官会更严厉地判处那些坚持争取审判权的被告人更重的刑罚，从而减轻处罚，并避免在审判中遭受更重的处罚。而且由于这是一个低可见度的过程，它削弱了法院监督警察和检察官行为的能力。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There is something unseemly about plea bargaining being a central feature of our criminal justice system. Isn’t achieving justice supposed to be different from haggling over the price of a used car? The whole process breeds disrespect for the law, and it has very practical consequences. Critics point out that plea bargaining produces unjust results, results that are sometimes too lenient and sometimes too severe. Victims of crime and crime control advocates complain that plea bargaining lets criminals off too easily; defendants get a discount on their punishment not because they show remorse and accept responsibility for their conduct but because they are doing the system a favor. At the same time, plea bargaining places pressure on defendants who are innocent or at least not deserving of conviction on the charges against them to plead guilty. Doing so means a quicker exit out of the system, lighter punishment because judges sentence more harshly those defendants who insist on their right to trial, and avoidance of the risk of doing worse at trial. And because it is a low visibility process, it diminishes the ability of the courts to supervise the behavior of police and prosecutors.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>辩诉交易也有其支持者。他们认为，大多数被告都有罪——即使没有完全符合指控，至少也犯了某些罪行。辩诉交易确保了有罪者受到惩罚，并使那些可能最了解案件的人——检察官和辩护律师——能够就适当的……达成一致。<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_324" class="calibre4"></a>考虑到所有变量，量刑是关键。尤其是在强制量刑制度日益普遍的情况下，辩诉交易保留了必要的自由裁量权，使量刑与罪行相符。实际上，如果所有案件都进入庭审阶段，整个体系就会陷入停滞。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Plea bargaining has its defenders, too. They argue that most defendants are guilty—if not guilty of all they have been charged with, then at least guilty of something. Plea bargaining ensures that the guilty will be punished, and it enables those who may know the most about the case—the prosecutor and the defense attorney—to agree on an appropriate <a class="calibre4"></a>punishment, given all the variables involved. Particularly as mandatory sentencing schemes have become more common, plea bargaining preserves a necessary element of discretion in fitting the punishment to the crime. And just as a practical matter, the system would grind to a halt if all cases went to trial.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>无论关于辩诉交易的争论如何，它都将继续存在。最高法院不仅批准了辩诉交易制度，还对其表示赞赏（在1971年的<em class="calibre8">桑托贝洛诉纽约案</em>中）：</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Whatever the debate about plea bargaining, it is here to stay. The Supreme Court has not only sanctioned the system of plea bargaining; it has applauded it (in <em class="calibre8">Santobello v. New York</em>, 1971):</p>
<p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>检察官与被告人之间通过协议处理刑事指控，有时也被笼统地称为“辩诉交易”，是司法公正的重要组成部分。如果得到妥善实施，这种做法应予鼓励。</p><p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The disposition of criminal charges by agreement between the prosecutor and the accused, sometimes loosely called “plea bargaining,” is an essential component of the administration of justice. Properly administered, it is to be encouraged.</p>
<p class="noindent">宪法在有限的范围内规范了辩诉交易的实践。首先，第六修正案保障了由律师代理的权利。这项权利适用于辩诉交易阶段以及庭审阶段。除非被告放弃该权利，否则必须允许其聘请律师为其进行辩诉交易；如果被告无力聘请律师，则必须为其提供一名律师。</p><p class="noindent">The Constitution regulates the practice of plea bargaining to a limited extent. First, the Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to be represented by an attorney. This right applies at the plea bargaining stage as well as at trial. Unless the defendant waives the right, she must be allowed to have her attorney bargain for her and must be provided an attorney if she cannot afford to hire her own.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>其次，被告不能被迫认罪，但运用只有律师才会喜欢的那种区分，她可以被<em class="calibre8">诱导</em>。诱导当然是辩诉交易的关键，但问题在于诱导何时变成胁迫。基本上，只要被告有选择权，即使这些选择令人难以接受，她也不会被迫认罪。例如，在支票伪造案中，如果检察官威胁要根据惯犯法提起诉讼，而定罪将导致终身监禁，但建议以五年徒刑换取认罪，法律认为被告是被诱导的，而不是被强迫的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Second, the defendant cannot be coerced into pleading guilty but, applying the kind of distinction only lawyers can love, she can be <em class="calibre8">induced</em>. Inducement, of course, is the key to plea bargaining, but the question is when inducement turns into coercion. Basically, as long as the defendant has a choice among alternatives, unpalatable though they may be, she is not compelled to plead guilty. For example, when the prosecutor in a check forgery case threatens to prosecute under a habitual criminal statute when a conviction would result in life imprisonment but offers instead to recommend a sentence of five years in exchange for a plea, the law sees the defendant as induced but not compelled.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第三，被告的抗辩必须是<em class="calibre8">明智且自愿的</em>。这并不意味着被告必须做出正确的选择，而只是要求她被告知其选择的依据和后果，包括针对她的指控以及她放弃的权利。通常，明智且自愿的要求是通过法官和被告进行一场照本宣科、程式化、往往超现实的对话来满足的。法官询问被告是否理解正在发生的事情，被告简短而肯定地回答。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Third, the defendant’s plea must be <em class="calibre8">intelligent and voluntary</em>. This does not mean that the defendant must make a good choice, but only that she be informed about the basis and consequences of her choice, including the charges against her and the rights she is waiving. Typically the intelligent and voluntary requirement is satisfied by the judge and the defendant engaging in a scripted, formulaic, often surreal colloquy, in which the judge inquires whether the defendant understands what is going on and the defendant responds briefly and affirmatively.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第四，被告的认罪必须有事实依据，但奇怪的是，被告实际上不必有罪，法院才能接受其认罪。在1970年的<em class="calibre8">北卡罗来纳诉阿尔福德</em>案中，阿尔福德达成了认罪协议，他同意认罪<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_325" class="calibre4"></a>二级谋杀罪，以避免可能被判处死刑。然而，在提审时，他作证说自己无罪，只是为了逃避死刑的风险才认罪。尽管如此，由于有证据可能支持定罪，因此允许他认罪但否认有罪。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Fourth, there must be some factual basis for the defendant’s plea but, strangely, the defendant does not actually have to be guilty in order for the court to accept her plea of guilty. In <em class="calibre8">North Carolina v. Alford</em> (1970), Alford entered into a plea bargain whereby he would plead guilty to <a class="calibre4"></a>second-degree murder to avoid a possible death penalty. At the arraignment, however, he testified that he was not guilty and was simply pleading guilty to escape the risk of capital punishment. Nevertheless, because there was evidence that might have supported a conviction, it was permissible to allow him to plead to a crime while denying his guilt.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最后，协议终究是协议，至少在某种程度上如此。检察官和被告都必须遵守他们达成的协议。如果检察官承诺以某种量刑来换取认罪，他必须履行。同样，如果被告除了认罪之外还承诺了其他条件——例如提供针对共同被告的证词——她也必须履行自己的承诺。除非法官参与了认罪协商，否则他没有义务遵守达成的谅解或检察官的认罪协商。然而，在很多情况下，除非法官接受认罪协议，否则被告将被允许撤回认罪并接受审判。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Finally, a deal is a deal, at least in part. The prosecutor and defendant each must abide by the deal they have struck. If the prosecutor has promised to recommend a certain sentence in exchange for the plea, he must do so. Similarly, if the defendant has promised something in addition to the plea—such as testimony against a codefendant—she must keep her side of the bargain, too. Unless the judge has taken part in the plea negotiations, he is not obligated to abide by the understanding reached or the prosecutor’s plea negotiations. In many cases, though, unless and until the judge accepts the plea agreement, the defendant will be allowed to withdraw her plea and go to trial.</p>

<p class="noindent">普通法国家刑事诉讼程序的一个显著特征是陪审团。回想一下前面对刑事诉讼程序的概述，陪审团有两种。大陪审团负责起诉被告。审判陪审团，或称小陪审团，负责在审判中裁定被告是否有罪。（大陪审团的规模称为“大”，审判陪审团的规模称为“小”，法语中意为“小”。历史上，大陪审团有23名成员，审判陪审团有12名成员。）</p><p class="noindent">A distinctive feature of the criminal process in common law countries is the jury. Recall from the earlier survey of the criminal process that there are two kinds of juries. The grand jury indicts, or brings charges against, a defendant. The trial jury, or petit jury, decides the issue of guilt at trial. (The grand jury is grand and the trial jury petit—French for “small”—because of their sizes. Historically the grand jury had twenty-three members and the trial jury had twelve.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>陪审团在英国法中作为刑事审判的裁决机构已有800年的历史，而美国法自建国以来也一直如此。在殖民时期，陪审团发挥着守护殖民者自由、抵御皇家法官强加的裁决的作用，因此其重要性尤为突出。最高法院在1968年的<em class="calibre8">邓肯诉路易斯安那州案中描述了陪审团的历史职能：</em></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The jury has been the deciding body in criminal trials in English law for 800 years and in American law since the founding.

<p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>宪法的制定者从历史和经验中知道，有必要保护被告人免受为消灭敌人而提出的毫无根据的刑事指控，以及免受法官对上级声音过于敏感的指控……赋予被告人由同侪组成的陪审团审判的权利，为被告人提供了不可估量的保障，使其免受腐败或过分热心的检察官以及顺从、有偏见或古怪的法官的侵害……除此之外，联邦和州宪法中的陪审团审判条款反映了关于行使官方权力的一项基本决定——不愿将全权权力委托给公民的生命和自由。<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_326" class="calibre4"></a>将公民的审判权交给一位或一组法官。对不受制约的权力的担忧，在其他方面，也体现在我们州和联邦政府身上。这种担忧在刑法中得到了体现，它强调社区参与有罪或无罪的裁定。</p><p class="prosequote"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Those who wrote our constitutions knew from history and experience that it was necessary to protect against unfounded criminal charges brought to eliminate enemies and against judges too responsive to the voice of higher authority....Providing an accused with the right to be tried by a jury of his peers gave him an inestimable safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant, biased, or eccentric judge....Beyond this, the jury trial provisions in the Federal and State Constitutions reflect a fundamental decision about the exercise of official power—a reluctance to entrust plenary powers over the life and liberty of <a class="calibre4"></a>the citizen to one judge or a group of judges. Fear of unchecked power, so typical of our State and Federal Governments in other respects, found expression in the criminal law in this insistence upon community participation in the determination of guilt or innocence.</p>
<p class="noindent">近年来，陪审团制度饱受诟病。批评的部分原因在于，陪审团一直在履行其历史职能，但批评者认为，这些职能已不再适合现代社会。陪审员将过多的社区情绪带入法庭。根据这种观点，陪审团的职责并非保护被告的自由，而仅仅是在不带任何错误或偏见的情况下认定事实，而这项任务他们的能力远不及专业法官。这些批评暴露了陪审团角色的内在冲突。陪审团是最终的事实认定者，因此应当保持中立、客观和超然。同时，陪审团也是法庭上社区的良知。通过引入社区的观点，陪审团可以做一些不仅仅是以中立的方式认定事实和适用法律的事情。</p><p class="noindent">More recently, the jury has come under attack. The criticisms have come in part because the jury has been fulfilling its historic functions, but critics believe those functions no longer fit our modern world. Jurors bring too much community sentiment into the courtroom. Under this view, the role of the jury is not to protect the defendant’s liberties but simply to find the facts without error or prejudice, a task for which they are less well equipped than a professional judge. These criticisms expose an inherent conflict in the jury’s role. The jury is the ultimate fact finder and, as such, should be neutral, detached, and objective. At the same time, the jury is the conscience of the community in the courtroom. By bringing in the community’s perspective, the jury may do something other than simply determine the facts and apply the law in a neutral way.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这种冲突的一个极端例子是关于<em class="calibre8">陪审团无效化的</em>争论。在审判中，法官向陪审团说明相关法律，陪审团裁定案件事实并将所掌握的法律应用于事实。但由于陪审团宣告无罪的决定实际上都是不可复审的，因此，如果陪审团愿意，它可以不顾法官的指示，拒绝适用法律，宣告被告无罪或以较轻的罪名定罪。如果陪审团发现法律不公正、过于严厉或与社会价值观不符，它就可以用这种方式宣布法律无效。正如一家法院所指出的，陪审团可以充当特殊案件的“安全阀”，但又不会成为“野猫或失控的机构”（<em class="calibre8">美国诉托马斯案</em>，1996 年）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>An extreme example of this conflict is found in the debate over <em class="calibre8">jury nullification</em>. At trial, the judge instructs the jury on the relevant law, and the jury determines the facts of the case and applies the law it has been given to the facts. But because a jury’s decision to acquit is for all practical purposes unreviewable, it can, if it chooses to do so, refuse to apply the law and acquit a defendant or convict on lesser charges in spite of the judge’s instructions. If the jury finds the law to be unjust, too harsh, or out of line with the values of the community, it can, in this way, nullify the law. As one court stated, the jury can act as a “safety valve” for exceptional cases without being a “wildcat or runaway institution” (<em class="calibre8">United States v. Thomas</em>, 1996).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>尽管对陪审团存在诸多批评，但社会科学证据表明，在大多数情况下，陪审团的工作表现良好，或至少与法官的工作表现相当。在绝大多数案件中，当法官被问及他们会做出何种判决时，他们的结论与陪审团相同。在意见相左的案件中，法官可能更有可能定罪，部分原因是他们长期接触刑事司法系统，导致他们得出结论，认为大多数被告实际上有罪。陪审团更有可能考虑诸如被告的良好背景、在自卫等问题上需要顾及人性的弱点以及受害者的性格等因素。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For all of the criticisms of juries, the social science evidence suggests that in most cases they do a good job, or at least as good a job as a judge would do. In a large majority of cases, when judges are asked what verdict they would have arrived at, they come to the same conclusion as the jury. In the cases in which they differ, judges are probably more likely to convict, in part because their constant exposure to the criminal justice system leads them to conclude that most defendants are in fact guilty. Juries are more likely to take account of factors such as the good background of the defendant, the need to accommodate human weakness in issues such as self-defense, and the character of the victim.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>陪审制度的一些特点始终保持不变，而其他一些特点则随着时间的推移而发生了变化。两个稳定的特点是，在所有重大案件中，陪审团制度都可供被告人出庭，并且具有终审判决性。至少在可能的刑罚为六个月监禁或以上的情况下，被告人必须<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_327" class="calibre4"></a>可以选择陪审团审判。陪审团强大权力的来源在于其终局性。在民事案件中，任何一方都可以对裁决提出上诉。在刑事案件中，被告可以因审判期间犯下的错误对定罪提出上诉，但如果被告被判无罪，控方就不能对该裁决提出上诉。陪审团的两个变化特点是其规模和裁决要求。历史上，陪审团由 12 人组成，并被要求达成一致裁决。最高法院裁定，这两种特性都不是宪法要求的。一些州选择在非死刑案件中设立少至 6 人的刑事陪审团，并允许陪审团以非一致裁决的方式对案件进行裁决，尽管在同一个案件中不能同时做到这两点；法院裁定，允许 6 人陪审团做出非一致裁决是违宪的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Some attributes of the jury system have remained constant, while others have changed over time. Two stable features are its availability to the defendant in all serious cases and its finality. At least where the possible punishment is six months imprisonment or greater, the defendant must <a class="calibre4"></a>be afforded the option of trial by jury. The source of the jury’s great power is its finality. In a civil case, either party can appeal a verdict. In a criminal case, a defendant can appeal a conviction because of an error committed during the trial, but if the defendant is acquitted, the prosecution cannot appeal the decision. Two changing features of the jury are its size and decision requirement. Historically juries were composed of twelve persons and were required to reach a unanimous verdict. The Supreme Court has held that neither of those attributes is constitutionally required. A state, as some have chosen to do, can have a criminal jury as small as six members, at least in a noncapital case, and can permit juries to decide cases on less than a unanimous verdict, although it cannot do both in the same case; the Court has held that allowing a nonunanimous verdict by a jury of six members is unconstitutional.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>由于陪审团的历史目的在于在刑事诉讼中注入社区参与的元素并通过提供公正的决策者来防止滥用，因此陪审团需要代表整个社区并且保持公正。陪审团的选拔过程始于建立一份潜在陪审员的长名单。根据各司法管辖区的惯例，该名单可能来自选民登记名单、电话簿、税单或驾驶执照记录。表格将邮寄给名单上的人员，以确定其是否有资格担任陪审员（例如，不包括不会说英语的人或从事医生和消防员等重要职业的人）或传唤名单上的成员前来担任陪审员。将传唤所需数量的潜在陪审员参加一天或一周的会议，组成<em class="calibre8">陪审团</em>或小组，最终从中选出陪审团。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Since the historic purposes of the jury are to inject an element of community participation in the criminal process and to forestall abuses by providing an unbiased decision maker, the jury needs to be representative of the community at large and to be impartial. Juries are selected through a process that begins with the construction of a large list of potential jurors. Depending on the practice in the jurisdiction, the list may be constructed from voter registration lists, telephone books, tax rolls, or drivers’ license records. Forms are mailed out to people on the list, either to establish eligibility for jury service (excluding, for example, people who cannot speak English or those in essential occupations such as physicians and firefighters) or to summon members of the list for service. As many potential jurors as may be needed are summoned for a day or week, constituting the <em class="calibre8">venire</em>, or panel from which the jury eventually will be selected.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>由于并非所有陪审团都具有代表性，因此代表性检验适用于整个陪审团名单。第六修正案保障了公平遴选潜在陪审员的权利。在名单拟定地区，任何重要且独特的群体，未经正当理由，不得被系统性地排除在名单之外。根据这项要求，导致少数族裔或女性等群体系统性代表性不足的规则已被废除。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Since not every jury can be representative, the test of representativeness is applied to the jury list as a whole. The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to a fair cross-section of potential jurors. No significant, distinctive group in the population of the district from which the list is drawn may be systematically excluded from the list without a valid justification. Under this requirement, rules that caused systematic underrepresentation of racial or ethnic minorities or women, for example, have been invalidated.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>公正性更多地体现在特定陪审团而非整个陪审团名单上。公正性是刑事司法制度的要求，也是被告的权利，但追求公正性的方式往往允许控方和辩方试图实现各自想要的结果：一个偏袒各自案件的陪审团。一旦选定了一组候选陪审员，就会进行预审<em class="calibre8">。</em>陪审员们会被问及他们对……的了解<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_328" class="calibre4"></a>当事人、律师或案件事实，以及任何可能影响其公正性的背景因素、经历或倾向。在某些司法管辖区，法官会通过预审（voir dire）的方式向陪审员提问；在其他司法管辖区，则允许双方律师在法官的监督下进行提问。律师进行预审时，会利用这个机会说服陪审员，通过巧妙的提问建立信任，同时预示即将发生的案件。在典型案件中，预审侧重于个案事实，可以快速完成。在备受瞩目的案件中，陪审团的遴选可能需要数天甚至数周的时间，因为律师需要探究陪审员信念的细微差别。在大型案件中尤其如此，因为律师会聘请陪审团顾问、心理学家或其他所谓的专家来分析陪审员，描述模范陪审员，提出问题，并评估陪审员的反应，甚至他们的肢体语言。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Impartiality is more a characteristic of the particular jury than of the whole jury list. Impartiality is a requirement of the criminal justice system as well as a right of the defendant, but the way impartiality is sought often allows the prosecution and defense to try to achieve what they each want: a partial jury, one that is likely to be predisposed to favor their respective cases. Once a panel of prospective jurors is chosen, <em class="calibre8">voir dire</em> is conducted. The jurors are questioned about their knowledge of <a class="calibre4"></a>the parties, lawyers, or facts of the case and about any background factors, experiences, or predispositions that may not render them impartial. In some jurisdictions the judge questions the jurors on voir dire; others allow the lawyers for each side to do the questioning, under the supervision of the judge. Where the lawyers conduct the voir dire, they use the opportunity to begin to persuade the jurors, through artful questioning that builds trust while it foreshadows the case that is to come. In the typical case, voir dire focuses on the facts of the individual case and can be accomplished quickly. In high-profile cases, jury selection may take days or even weeks, as the attorneys probe the nuances of the jurors’ beliefs. This has become especially true in large cases in which the lawyers retain jury consultants, psychologists, or other purported experts who analyze the pool, describe model jurors, suggest questions to ask, and evaluate jurors’ responses and even their body language.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>由于预审，控方和辩方律师可以挑战陪审员并将其排除在陪审团之外。有些挑战是有原因的<em class="calibre8">，</em>律师可以说服法官，有事实依据可以推定潜在的陪审员可能无法做出公正的裁决（例如，由于审前宣传，陪审员已经得出结论，认为被告有罪）。每一方都拥有一定数量的<em class="calibre8">无理拒绝权</em>，可以行使这些权利排除陪审员而无需给出理由。但是，检察官不得以不被允许的理由行使无理拒绝权，例如，在涉及非裔美国人被告的案件中，检察官有计划地将所有非裔美国人排除在陪审团之外。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As a result of the voir dire, the prosecution and defense lawyers can challenge jurors and exclude them from the jury. Some challenges are for <em class="calibre8">cause</em>, where the lawyer can persuade the judge that there is a factual basis for presuming that the potential juror may not be able to render an impartial verdict (for example, because of pretrial publicity, the juror has already concluded that the defendant is guilty). Each side also has a number of <em class="calibre8">peremptory challenges</em>, which it can exercise to exclude a juror without giving a reason. A prosecutor may not exercise a peremptory challenge for an impermissible reason, however, such as if a prosecutor in a case involving an African American defendant systematically excluded all African Americans from the jury.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在可判处死刑的案件中，预审程序具有独特的性质。最高法院裁定，如果一个陪审团中没有包括所有“对死刑抱有良知顾虑”的人，那么它就不是来自社会各个阶层的公正代表。这样的陪审团很可能倾向于定罪并判处死刑。但是，陪审团可以具有死刑适任性，即由那些愿意做出有罪判决并判处死刑的人组成。如果陪审员对死刑的看法使其难以判处死刑，则可以有理由将其排除在陪审团之外。结果是，具有死刑适任性的陪审团比真正具有代表性的陪审团更有可能定罪并判处死刑，但最高法院认为，这并不违宪。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The voir dire process takes on a distinctive cast in cases in which the death penalty can be imposed. The Supreme Court has held that a jury from which all persons were excluded who had “conscientious scruples against capital punishment” did not arise from a fair cross-section of the community. Such a jury was too likely to be predisposed to convict and sentence to death. But a jury can be death-qualified, or composed of those willing to return a guilty verdict and a death penalty. If a juror’s view on capital punishment would make it hard for him to impose the death penalty, he may be excluded from the jury for cause. The result is that death-qualified juries are more likely to convict and impose the death penalty than truly representative juries, but, in the opinion of the Supreme Court, not unconstitutionally so.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>由于陪审团只需根据法庭上提供的证据作出裁决，因此在审判前或审判期间公开案件信息会对被告获得公正审判的权利构成威胁。法院在必要时可以对律师发出禁言令，禁止他们就审判情况发表公开声明，但媒体拥有第一<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_329" class="calibre4"></a>修正案赋予新闻报道权，除少数情况外，法院不得对公众关闭审判程序，也不得禁止媒体报道犯罪或审判信息。（例外情况是，州政府出于迫切需要关闭诉讼程序或以其他方式限制报道，例如允许性犯罪的未成年人受害者私下作证，或禁止在备受关注的案件中披露陪审员姓名。）法院必须在公平审判权和报道诉讼程序权之间取得平衡。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Because the jury is required to reach its verdict only on the evidence presented in court, publicity about the case before or during the trial presents a problem for the defendant’s right to a fair trial. The court can, when necessary, impose a gag order on the lawyers, preventing them from making public statements about the trial, but the media has a First <a class="calibre4"></a>Amendment right to report the news, and, except in limited cases, the court cannot close a trial to the public nor prohibit the media from reporting information about a crime or a trial. (The exceptions arise where the state has a compelling interest in closing the proceedings or otherwise limiting the reporting, as in allowing minors who are victims of sex crimes to testify in private or prohibiting the disclosure of jurors’ names in high-visibility cases.) The courts have to balance the right to a fair trial against the right to report proceedings.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在极端情况下，可以通过将审判地点移至通常审理地点之外来达到平衡。如果某个地区许多潜在陪审员观看了可能影响其对案件看法的电视报道，则可以将审判地点移至其他县。有时，这种改变会产生相反的效果，给陪审员带来不便，而不是给律师、法院工作人员和证人带来不便；与其将审判地点移至其他地点，不如从其他地点调来陪审团。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In extreme cases, the balance can be struck by moving the trial outside the venue where it would normally be tried. If many potential jurors in an area have seen television reports that might prejudice their view of the case, the trial can be moved to another county. Sometimes the change works in reverse, inconveniencing the jurors rather than the lawyers, court personnel, and witnesses; instead of moving the trial to another venue, a jury is brought in from another venue.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>在不太极端的情况下，偏见性宣传会在陪审团预审期间以及庭审期间通过预防措施来处理。关键在于陪审员能否抛开他们所听到的内容，只考虑法庭上的证据。最高法院裁定，即使陪审员已经形成了对被告有罪的信念，但如果他在裁决案件时能够抛开先前的信念，则该陪审员不一定被取消资格。庭审开始时，法官会告诫那些在审前接触过宣传的陪审员，在审议时忽略这些宣传。与法官在其他情况下的指示一样，这是基于这样一种信念：陪审员会听取法官的言​​论，并能够放下他们的先入之见。法官会指示陪审团不要阅读或收听有关案件的新闻报道，也不要在网上搜索案件主题的相关资料；在特殊情况下，法官可能会下令将陪审团隔离，或将其安置在酒店，接受法院工作人员的监督，并限制其接触新闻报道。财产扣押对陪审员来说是一个很大的困难，它只用于最有可能造成偏见的案件。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In less extreme cases, prejudicial publicity is dealt with during voir dire of the jury and by prophylactic measures during trial. The key is whether jurors are able to put aside what they have heard and consider only the evidence in court. The Supreme Court has held that even if a juror has formed a belief about the guilt of the defendant, that juror is not necessarily disqualified if he can put aside his previous beliefs in deciding the case. When the trial begins the judge will admonish jurors who have been exposed to pretrial publicity to ignore it in their deliberations. As with instructions from the judge in other circumstances, this is based on the belief that jurors will listen to what the judge says and will be able to suspend their preconceptions. The judge will instruct the jury not to read or listen to news accounts of the case or to do research online about its subject matter, and, in unusual situations, may order the jury sequestered, or housed in a hotel under the supervision of court personnel with limited exposure to news reports. A great hardship to jurors, sequestration is reserved for cases with the greatest potential for prejudice.</p>

<p class="noindent">陪审团组成后，审判就开始了。我们常说，审判是对真相的探寻，但法律对这种探寻施加了限制，并赋予法庭上每个人不同的角色。刑事审判是整个刑事司法体系的体现，是一个对抗性的过程，对抗双方各怀心思，而他们为实现这些目标所能采取的手段受到法律规则和职业道德的限制。<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_330" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="noindent">Once the jury is impaneled, the trial begins. We speak of the trial as a search for truth, but the law places restrictions on the search and assigns everyone in the courtroom a different role in conducting the search. The criminal trial, as a reflection of the entire system of criminal justice, is an adversary process in which the adversaries have different objectives, and the means they can employ to achieve those objectives are limited by the rules of law and professional ethics.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>先从检察官说起。检察官的职责显然是使被告人被定罪。从理论上讲，这对检察官来说并非个人的胜利。检察官是政府的代理人，通过定罪，检察官服务于政府的利益：惩罚罪犯，预防未来犯罪。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Begin with the prosecutor. The prosecutor’s job, obviously, is to obtain a conviction of the defendant. In concept, this is not a personal triumph for the prosecutor. The prosecutor is an agent of the government, and, by obtaining a conviction, the prosecutor serves the government’s interest: punishing the criminal and preventing future crime.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>但由于检察官是政府的代理人，他的任务不仅限于定罪。政府的职责是伸张正义，这也是检察官的职责。伸张正义意味着检察官应该只试图定罪那些真正有罪的人，而不仅仅是那些可以被定罪的人。这也意味着检察官必须维护法律，包括所有导致定罪困难的法律。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But because the prosecutor is an agent of the government, his task is not limited to obtaining a conviction. The government’s job is to do justice, and that is the job of the prosecutor, too. Doing justice means that the prosecutor should attempt to convict only those who actually are guilty, not simply those against whom a conviction can be obtained. It also means that the prosecutor is required to uphold the law, including all of the laws that make it difficult to obtain a conviction.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>当然，在繁忙的公务和激烈的斗争中，检察官往往专注于第一个目标——定罪，而忽略了第二个目标——伸张正义。这在一定程度上是人性使然，但也反映了刑事诉讼程序的两个特点。首先，检察官作为体系中的常客，往往认为大多数被告确实有罪。其次，检察官的动机倾向于定罪。在大多数司法管辖区，地方检察官都是选举产生的，而以严厉打击犯罪和定罪为竞选纲领比以保护被告权利和驳回针对无辜者的案件为竞选纲领要容易得多。这种要求会渗透到一线检察官身上，而他们通常以定罪率来评判。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Of course, in the press of business and the heat of battle, prosecutors often focus on the first objective—obtaining a conviction—at the expense of the second—doing justice. In part this is just human nature, but it also reflects two features of the criminal process. First, prosecutors, as repeat players in the system, just assume that most defendants are in fact guilty. Second, the incentives of prosecutors favor achieving convictions. District attorneys are elected in most jurisdictions, and it is much easier to campaign on a platform of being tough on crime and getting convictions than on being protective of defendants’ rights and dismissing cases against the innocent. This imperative filters down to prosecutors on the line, who are typically judged by conviction rates.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>辩护律师在审判中扮演着不同的角色。辩护律师是委托人的辩护人，要求政府提供证据，要求对被告的指控排除合理怀疑。（稍后会详细介绍合理怀疑。）为此，辩护律师会攻击政府的证据，质疑证人的可信度，并提供相反的证据来陈述不同的故事，或至少对政府的说法提出质疑。辩护律师也保护被告的权利。《权利法案》的保护措施之所以有意义，是因为辩护律师的存在是为了执行这些保护措施。如果政府要定罪被告，就必须依法进行。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The defense attorney has a different role in the trial. The defense attorney is the client’s advocate, putting the government to its proof, requiring that the case against the defendant be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. (More about reasonable doubt shortly.) In doing so, the defense attorney attacks the state’s evidence, questions the credibility of its witnesses, and presents contrary evidence that tells a different story or at least casts doubt on the government’s story. The defense attorney also protects the rights of the defendant. The protections of the Bill of Rights have meaning only because the defense attorney is there to enforce them. If the government is to convict the defendant, it must do so according to law.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>人们似乎普遍理解检察官的职责，但辩护律师的角色更令人担忧。毫无疑问，系统中的大多数被告都有罪。因此，引用詹姆斯·库南（James Kunen）关于其公设辩护人生涯的书名：“你怎么能为这些人辩护？” 答案是一个基于刑事诉讼背后价值观冲突的陈词滥调，但与大多数陈词滥调一样，它基本上是正确的。在刑事司法系统中，国家权力被用来对付个人。我们政府结构的一个基本原则<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_331" class="calibre4"></a>大权难免被滥用。正因如此，国会通常未经总统批准不得通过法律，也正因如此，需要制定详尽的程序性权利和实体性权利来保护刑事被告。辩护律师的职责是制约政府权力的运用，确保被告的权利得到保护。如果我们只能保护无辜者的权利，那当然方便，但我们做不到，因此我们采用对抗制程序，赋予辩护律师维护任何被告权利的权力。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>People generally seem to understand what prosecutors do, but the defense attorney’s role is more troubling. Most of the defendants in the system undoubtedly are guilty. Therefore, to quote the title of James Kunen’s book on his career as a public defender, “How can you defend those people?” The answer is a cliché based in the conflict of values underlying criminal procedure, but, like most clichés, it is basically accurate. In the criminal justice system, the power of the state is brought to bear against an individual. A basic principle of our government structure <a class="calibre4"></a>is that great power is subject to abuse. That is why Congress ordinarily can’t pass a law without the approval of the president and why elaborate procedural and substantive rights protect criminal defendants. The defense attorney’s role is to check the application of government power, by ensuring that the defendant’s rights are protected. It would be convenient if we could only protect the rights of innocent people, but we can’t, so we use an adversary process that empowers a defense attorney to assert the rights of any defendant.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这种制度会产生弊端吗？毫无疑问。辩护律师可能会过度热心，而所有对被告权利的保护几乎都意味着一些有罪的被告会逍遥法外。最终，我们需要决定的是，弊端是否大于好处，以及该制度是否可以在不被废除的情况下进行修改。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Does this kind of system produce abuses? No doubt. Advocates can be overzealous, and all of the protections of defendants’ rights almost guarantee that some guilty defendants will go free. What we need to decide, ultimately, is whether the abuses outweigh the advantages and whether the system can be modified without being scrapped.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>为了保护被告免受政府滥用权力，对抗制在两个方面受到限制。电视上的庭审往往取决于一个出其不意的证人，或者一个出其不意的策略，巧妙的辩护律师正是凭借这些策略击败了对手。但在现实生活中，证据开示规则极大地限制了这种出其不意的机会。最高法院裁定，检察官有宪法义务向辩方披露证据，尤其是那些倾向于为被告开脱罪责的证据。相反，被告的不自证其罪特权使法院无法要求被告交出有罪证据。权力如此不平衡，要求检察官披露更多信息似乎是公平的。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Consider two of the ways that the adversary system is limited in the interest of protecting the defendant against abuse of power by the government. On television the trial often turns on a surprise witness or an unexpected tactic by which a clever advocate defeats his opponent. In real life, the opportunity for surprise is drastically limited by discovery rules. The Supreme Court has held that the prosecutor has a constitutional duty to disclose evidence to the defense, particularly evidence that tends to exculpate the defendant. Conversely, the defendant’s privilege against self-incrimination prevents the court from requiring the defendant to turn over incriminating evidence. And the imbalance of power is such that it seems fair to require the prosecutor to disclose more information.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第二种保护手段是检察官的举证责任，<em class="calibre8">即排除合理怀疑地</em>证明被告有罪。陪审团的无罪判决并不意味着被告无罪，被告也永远没有举证责任。举证责任完全在检察官身上，如果检察官未能承担该责任，则必须宣告被告无罪。辩护律师可以选择一种庭审策略，试图说服陪审团被告无罪，但同样恰当的做法是，对检察官的陈述提出足够的怀疑，以免达到举证责任。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A second means of protection is the prosecutor’s burden of proving guilt <em class="calibre8">beyond a reasonable doubt</em>. A jury verdict of acquittal does not mean that the defendant is innocent, and the defendant never has the burden of proving his innocence. The burden is entirely on the prosecutor, and if the prosecutor fails to carry that burden, an acquittal is required. The defense attorney may choose as a matter of trial strategy to try to convince the jury that the defendant is innocent, but it is equally appropriate simply to cast sufficient doubt on the prosecutor’s story so that the burden is not met.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>合理怀疑的标准远高于法律其他领域的举证责任。在民事案件中，该标准是<em class="calibre8">优势证据</em>，这仅仅意味着结论的可能性大于不可能性。合理怀疑是指陪审团在权衡所有证据并认真考虑案件后，对有罪判决仍然存在的怀疑。这长期以来一直是刑事案件的定罪标准，最高法院也裁定，这是正当程序的宪法要求要素。刑事制裁应保留用于以下案件：<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_332" class="calibre4"></a>被告人犯有犯罪行为的可能性极高。此外，由于刑事司法体系中存在政府对个人施加压力的不平衡，合理怀疑标准为防止政府压迫提供了进一步的保护。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Reasonable doubt is a much higher standard than the burden of proof elsewhere in the law. In civil cases, the standard is <em class="calibre8">preponderance of the evidence</em>, which only means that the conclusion is more likely than not. Reasonable doubt is a doubt about guilt that remains after the jury has weighed all of the evidence and seriously considered the matter. This has long been the standard for conviction in criminal cases, and the Supreme Court has held that it is a constitutionally required element of due process. The criminal sanction should be reserved for cases in which <a class="calibre4"></a>there is the utmost certainty that the defendant has committed a crime. Moreover, because of the imbalance in the criminal justice system in which the weight of the government is arrayed against an individual, the reasonable doubt standard provides further protection against government oppression.</p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0015_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-9-div1-11"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0093" class="calibre1">量刑如何进行？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0093" class="calibre1">How Does Sentencing Work?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">当被告人被判有罪或认罪时，量刑就是对其量刑的过程。在从犯罪定义到刑事诉讼各个阶段的所有步骤中，量刑是关键环节；在很大程度上，所有其他活动都旨在对罪犯进行惩罚，而量刑是决定其刑罚的环节。</p><p class="noindent">When a defendant is convicted of or pleads guilty to a crime, sentencing is the process through which his punishment is meted out. Of all the steps from the definition of crimes through the stages of the criminal process, sentencing is where the rubber meets the road; to a large extent, all of the other activity is directed at punishment of the guilty, and sentencing is the step that determines the punishment.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>量刑的第一步是立法。法官只能判处法律授权的刑罚。立法机关决定对何种案件适用何种惩罚以及判处惩罚的程序。虽然立法机关的量刑能力受到宪法的限制，但最高法院认为这种限制非常广泛。例如，规定鞭刑作为惩罚将违反第八修正案禁止施加“残酷和非常惩罚”的规定，但法院认为，对于没有前科的罪犯，因持有 672 克（约一磅半）可卡因而判处终身监禁不得假释，这可能很残酷，但在宪法上并非非常惩罚（<em class="calibre8">Harmelin v. Michigan</em>，1991 年）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The first step in sentencing is legislative. Judges are allowed to impose only sentences that have been authorized by statute. The legislature determines what types of punishments will be imposed in what type of cases and the procedure by which they will be imposed. Although the legislature’s ability to prescribe sentences is limited by the Constitution, the Supreme Court has held that the limits are very broad. It would violate the Eighth Amendment’s ban on the infliction of “cruel and unusual punishments” to provide flogging as a punishment, for example, but the Court held that a sentence of life imprisonment without parole for possession of 672 grams (about a pound and a half) of cocaine for an offender with no prior convictions might be cruel but was not constitutionally unusual (<em class="calibre8">Harmelin v. Michigan</em>, 1991).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>立法机关在决定刑罚类型方面拥有很大的自由度。最严厉的制裁当然是死刑。监禁和缓刑更为常见。由于犯罪类型、罪犯和司法管辖区的差异，很难一概而论，但大约70%的重罪犯被判处监禁，约30%被判处缓刑。对于情节较轻的罪行，获得缓刑的比例要高得多。对于轻罪或初犯，社区服务、青少年训练营、居家监禁或其他中级制裁措施较为常见。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The legislature has a great deal of latitude to determine the types of sentences to be imposed. The most severe sanction, of course, is the death penalty. Incarceration and probation are much more common. The variations among crimes, criminals, and jurisdictions make it hard to generalize, but about 70 percent of convicted felons are sentenced to imprisonment and about 30 percent to probation. For less serious crimes, the proportion receiving probation is much higher. For minor offenses or first-time offenders, community service, youth boot camp, home confinement, or other intermediate sanctions are common.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>获得缓刑的罪犯实际上通常也会被判入狱，但缓刑期间，刑罚的执行会暂停。缓刑期间，罪犯通常必须满足一系列要求，例如找到工作、定期向缓刑官汇报以及避免再次惹麻烦。如果违反缓刑条件，缓刑可能会被撤销，缓刑将生效，最终入狱。<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_333" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Criminals who receive probation actually often receive a jail sentence, too, but execution of the sentence is suspended while they are on probation. While he is on probation, an offender usually must meet a set of requirements, such as finding a job, reporting regularly to a probation officer, and staying out of further trouble. If he violates the conditions of probation, the probation may be revoked and the suspended sentence takes effect, sending him to jail.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>直到最近，对已定罪罪犯进行量刑的典型程序仍要求法官在立法机构规定的相当大范围内行使自由裁量权。例如，法律可能规定抢劫罪可判处五至十五年监禁。法官会收到缓刑办公室的判前报告，其中包含有关罪犯的重要信息，例如犯罪记录、家庭和工作经历以及心理状况。犯罪受害者或其家人可以提交一份<em class="calibre8">受害人影响陈述</em>，向法庭陈述犯罪对他们造成的影响，并可能提供比庭审中披露的更多犯罪细节。结合这些信息以及庭审中获得的认知，法官将在允许的范围内量刑，并可能对罪犯进行缓刑或缓刑。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Until recently, the typical procedure for sentencing a convicted offender required the judge to exercise discretion within a considerable range prescribed by the legislature. For example, the statute might prescribe that robbery is punishable by a sentence of five to fifteen years in prison. The judge would receive a presentence report from the probation office, relating important information about the offender, such as criminal record, family and employment history, and psychological profile. The victim of the crime or his family may make a <em class="calibre8">victim impact statement</em> to tell the court about the effect the crime has had on them and may provide more details about the crime than came out at trial. Combining this information with the perceptions gained at the trial, the judge would sentence within the permitted range, with the possibility of suspending the sentence and putting the offender on probation.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，被告实际服刑的刑期可能远短于规定的刑期——通常少一半到三分之二。在不确定量刑制度下，假释当局拥有相当大的自由裁量权，可以决定囚犯何时（如果可以的话）能够充分康复，从而在服刑期满前获释。大多数州也实行“良好服刑”制度，即囚犯在服刑期间表现良好，有时还参与教育、工作或其他康复项目，监狱当局可酌情减刑。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The defendant might actually serve much less than the stated sentence, however—often a half to two-thirds less. Under an indeterminate sentencing system, the parole authorities have considerable discretion in deciding when, if at all, a prisoner is sufficiently rehabilitated to be released before his sentence is completed. Most states also have “good time” practices, under which prisoners can earn a reduction in their sentence, at the discretion of prison authorities, for serving “good time,” or time in prison on good behavior, sometimes with participation in educational, work, or other rehabilitative programs.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>传统模式仍被广泛使用，但从 20 世纪 70 年代末开始，人们开始齐心协力地重组该体系，以限制法官的量刑自由裁量权。这一努力源于这样一种观点：法官行使自由裁量权的方式导致判决之间存在很大差异，从而导致了体系的任意性和不可预测性。两名法官可能会对相似的罪犯做出不同的判决，因为一名法官比另一名法官更宽容或在量刑时强调不同的因素。此外，随着对该体系改造罪犯能力的质疑不断增加，人们对法官裁定适当判决的能力以及假释委员会确定囚犯何时已改造的能力的信心下降。人们颁布了各种措施来限制量刑自由裁量权。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The traditional model is still widely used, but, beginning in the late 1970s, there began a concerted effort to restructure the system to rein in the judge’s discretion in sentencing. The effort arose from a perception that judges were exercising their discretion in such a way that there was wide disparity among sentences, producing arbitrariness and unpredictability in the system. Two judges might sentence similar offenders in different ways because one judge was more lenient than another or emphasized different factors in sentencing. As doubts arose about the system’s ability to rehabilitate offenders, moreover, confidence declined in judges’ ability to determine appropriate sentences and in parole boards’ ability to determine when a prisoner had been rehabilitated. A variety of measures were enacted to limit discretion in sentencing.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第一项措施是使用量刑指南。量刑指南的目的是将量刑自由裁量权从审判法官手中剥离，交由立法机关或立法设立的量刑委员会。一套指南规定了审判法官如何量刑。通常，这些指南包含一项<em class="calibre8">推定刑罚</em>，即根据被告被定罪的罪行严重程度和被告的特征（尤其是……）推定的适当刑罚。<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_334" class="calibre4"></a>他的犯罪史。例如，抢劫案会有一个指定的基础刑罚，如果特定被告是未成年参与者（例如，如果他只驾驶了逃逸车辆），法官将被指示减少一定数额的刑罚；如果被告有特定类型的犯罪前科，则增加一定数额的刑罚。有时，当存在特定事实时，例如犯罪是出于种族动机，指导方针只会规定加重刑罚。根据不同的制度，审判法官在偏离推定刑罚方面可能拥有有限的自由裁量权，但如果他这样做，他必须发表意见解释原因，并且偏离量刑可能会在上诉时接受审查。量刑指导方针减少了量刑的可变性，但许多法官抱怨说，它们阻碍了法官根据罪行和罪犯的具体情况量身定制惩罚。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The first measure is the use of sentencing guidelines. The objective of sentencing guidelines is to take much of the discretion in sentencing away from the trial judge and place it in the hands of the legislature or a legislatively created sentencing commission. A set of guidelines prescribes how the trial judge must arrive at the sentence. Usually the guidelines include a <em class="calibre8">presumptive sentence</em>, a sentence that is presumed to be appropriate given the severity of the crime for which the defendant has been convicted and characteristics of the defendant, notably <a class="calibre4"></a>his criminal history. For example, a robbery will have a designated base level sentence that the judge is directed to reduce by a certain amount if the particular defendant was a minor participant (if he only drove the getaway car, for example) and increase by a certain amount if the defendant has a prior criminal history of a specified type. Sometimes the guidelines will simply prescribe an enhancement of a sentence when particular facts are present, such as the crime’s being racially motivated. Depending on the system, the trial judge may have limited discretion to depart from the presumptive sentence, but if he does so, he must issue an opinion explaining why, and the departure is subject to review on appeal. Sentencing guidelines reduce the degree of variability in sentencing, but many judges complain that they prevent judges from individually tailoring the punishment to fit the crime and the criminal.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>2000 年开始的一系列最高法院意见扰乱了量刑指南和司法加重刑罚的使用。这些意见认为，根据第六修正案赋予的陪审团审判权，用于加重被告刑罚的事实必须提交给陪审团，并在排除合理怀疑的情况下予以认定，除非被告承认。例如，在 2004 年的<em class="calibre8">布莱克利诉华盛顿案</em>中，拉尔夫·布莱克利承认二级绑架罪，该罪通常可判处四十九至五十三个月的监禁。法官根据华盛顿的指导方针，判处他九十个月的监禁，因为布莱克利的行为具有“故意残忍”。法院认为，由于“故意残忍”不属于二级绑架的法定罪行，除非陪审团排除合理怀疑地认定该因素，否则不能加重他的刑期。因此，华盛顿的量刑指南违宪。随后，在2005年<em class="calibre8">美国诉布克案</em>中，最高法院裁定，由审判法官而非陪审团根据联邦量刑指南裁定需要加重刑罚的事实违宪，并且该指南此后将仅作为建议而非强制性的。如今，一些司法管辖区要求陪审团确定是否存在会影响量刑的因素，而其他司法管辖区则效仿最高法院在<em class="calibre8">布克案</em>中的举措，赋予法官更多自由裁量权，使其能够偏离量刑指南，最高法院对这种自由裁量权的行使表示赞赏。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The use of sentencing guidelines and judicial enhancement of sentences was disrupted by a series of Supreme Court opinions beginning in 2000, which held that under the Sixth Amendment’s right to a jury trial, facts that are used to increase a defendant’s sentence must be submitted to the jury and determined beyond a reasonable doubt, unless the defendant admitted them. In <em class="calibre8">Blakely v. Washington</em> (2004), for example, Ralph Blakely pleaded guilty to second-degree kidnaping, which was ordinarily punishable by a sentence of forty-nine to fifty-three months. The judge, acting under Washington’s guidelines, sentenced him to ninety months because Blakely had acted with “deliberate cruelty.” Because “deliberate cruelty” was not part of the statutory offense of second-degree kidnaping, the Court held, his sentence could not be increased unless a jury found that factor beyond a reasonable doubt. Washington’s sentencing guidelines were, therefore, unconstitutional. Then in <em class="calibre8">United States v. Booker</em> (2005) the Court held that it was unconstitutional for the trial judge rather than the jury to determine a fact that required an enhanced sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines and that the guidelines would thereafter be advisory rather than mandatory. Some jurisdictions now require that juries determine whether factors that will affect the sentence are present, and others have followed the Court’s lead in <em class="calibre8">Booker</em> by giving judges more discretion to depart from the guidelines, an exercise of discretion that the Court has viewed favorably.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>限制量刑自由裁量权的另一种措施是针对特定情况强制量刑。根据这些法规，法官在量刑方面几乎没有或完全没有自由裁量权。（除了限制自由裁量权外，强制量刑也常用于加重某些类型犯罪的惩罚。）例如，在佛罗里达州，犯罪过程中拔枪将被强制判处至少十年徒刑。强制量刑规避了第六修正案的适用。<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_335" class="calibre4"></a><em class="calibre8">问题，但可能违反第八修正案禁止残酷和不寻常惩罚的规定；在米勒诉阿拉巴马州</em>（2012 年）一案中，对未成年被告人强制判处终身监禁且不得假释的规定被推翻。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Another measure to limit discretion in sentencing is mandatory sentencing for particular types of situations. Under these statutes, the judge has little or no discretion in meting out a sentence. (Aside from limiting discretion, mandatory sentencing also is often used to increase punishment for certain types of crimes.) In Florida, for example, pulling a gun during the commission of a crime carries a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years. Mandatory sentencing avoids the Sixth Amendment <a class="calibre4"></a>problem but can violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment; a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole for a juvenile defendant was struck down in <em class="calibre8">Miller v. Alabama</em> (2012).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>另一种强制量刑是“三振出局法”。被告第三次被判定犯有特定严重程度的罪行时，必须被判处长期监禁，或者在某些州被判处终身监禁，不得假释。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A different type of mandatory sentencing is the “three strikes and you’re out” law. Upon a defendant’s third conviction of a crime of specified seriousness, the defendant must be sentenced to a long prison term or, in some states, life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“三振出局法”的目的是通过提高第二次和第三次犯罪的处罚标准来阻止罪犯重复犯罪，并确保对最严重的罪犯（惯犯）进行严厉判决，防止其再次犯罪。有时，“三振出局法”也会产生意想不到的后果。由于这些法规的定义往往过于宽泛，一些根据这些法规被判刑的罪犯并不是起草者所想象的对社会的真正威胁，例如在加利福尼亚州一个臭名昭著的案件中，被告的第三次罪行是偷披萨。此外，根据此类法律被判刑的威胁可能会影响潜在受害人的行为，使他们不太愿意就第一次或第二次重罪进行辩诉交易，如果面临第三次刑罚，他们更愿意暴力抵抗逮捕。“三振出局法”和其他强制量刑法律也导致监狱人口大幅增加；在一些地方，监狱人满为患，结果不得不释放其他可能更危险的罪犯。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The purpose of three strikes statutes is to deter criminals from repeating their crimes by raising the stakes for a second and third offense and to make sure that the most serious criminals—repeat offenders—are sentenced severely and prevented from committing future crimes. As sometimes happens, three strikes laws have had unintended consequences. Because the statutes often are sweeping in their definition, some of the criminals sentenced under them are not the hardened threats to society imagined by the drafters, as in a notorious California case in which the defendant’s third offense was stealing a pizza. In addition, the threat of being sentenced under such a law may affect the behavior of offenders potentially subject to it, making them less willing to plea bargain to a first or second felony and, if facing a third strike, more willing to violently resist apprehension. Three strikes and other mandatory sentencing laws have also contributed to a vastly expanded prison population; in some places, where prisons have become unconstitutionally overcrowded, the result has been to require the release of other, potentially more dangerous offenders.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>最后，假释因“量刑真实性”法规而受到严格限制，根据该法规，法官判处的刑期代表被告实际服刑的时间。一些州已经完全废除了假释，还有更多州将假释限制在非暴力犯罪的被告身上。大多数州还限制了“良好表现”的认可，要求暴力犯罪者至少服满85%的刑期才能获得假释。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Finally, parole release has been severely restricted through “truth in sentencing” statutes under which the sentence handed out by the judge represents the time the defendant actually will serve. A few states have abolished parole altogether, and many more have restricted it to defendants convicted of nonviolent crimes. Most states also have limited credit for good time by requiring that violent offenders serve at least 85 percent of their sentence before they can be paroled.</p>

<p class="noindent">死刑或许是刑事诉讼中最受争议的领域。所有其他关于犯罪控制、正义、公平和权利的论点，都汇聚在关于国家是否可以处死某人的争论中。一些死刑的支持者援引圣经中“以眼还眼，以牙还牙”的训诫，认为死刑的可能性是对暴力犯罪的终极威慑。反对者则认为死刑是一种过时的野蛮行径，<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_336" class="calibre4"></a>在其他所有西方国家都已废除死刑，但对犯罪率的影响却不大。</p><p class="noindent">The death penalty may be the most hotly contested area of criminal procedure. All the other arguments about crime control, justice, fairness, and rights coalesce in the debate about whether the state may put someone to death. Some advocates of capital punishment cite the Biblical injunction of “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth” and see the possibility of a death sentence as the ultimate deterrent for violent crime. Opponents characterize capital punishment as an outdated barbarism, <a class="calibre4"></a>abolished in every other Western nation and having little real effect on the incidence of crime.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>关于死刑的争论过于复杂，我们无法用简单的刑事诉讼程序概述来概括其激烈程度。在这场常常被口号所主导的辩论中，本节展现了这个问题的复杂性。实际上，它涉及两个问题：是否应该适用死刑；如果适用，如何才能公平地适用死刑。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The debate about capital punishment is too complicated to do more than capture its intensity in this brief survey of criminal procedure. In a debate too often dominated by slogans, this section shows how complex the issue is. There are two issues, really: whether the death penalty should be applied at all and, if so, how it can be applied fairly.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>关于是否应该保留死刑的争论主要有两个方面。第一方面涉及死刑的道德性：不考虑其社会后果，死刑在道德上是否合理？第二方面则直接探讨这些后果：死刑是否服务于重要的社会目标，尤其是对犯罪的震慑？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The argument about whether we should have a death penalty has two strands. The first strand concerns the morality of the death penalty: Is it morally justified, without regard to its social consequences? The second strand addresses those consequences directly: Does the death penalty serve important social goals, especially the deterrence of crime?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>死刑的支持者认为，处决杀人者是正义的。正义在于，他们的罪行理应受到最严厉的惩罚，而施加应得的惩罚是刑法公认的功能。死刑是报应而非复仇；国家衡量罪犯的罪责，只对最应受惩罚的人施以刑罚。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Supporters of the death penalty argue that executing those who have killed is just. It is just in that their crime deserves the most extreme punishment, and imposing deserved punishments is an accepted function of the criminal law. Capital punishment is retribution rather than vengeance; the state weighs the criminal’s culpability and imposes the penalty only on those most deserving of it.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>批评者回应说，处决罪犯与伸张正义之间没有必然联系。当然，许多被判处死刑的人罪有应得、危险至极，理应受到惩罚和监禁，但他们中的大多数人并不符合“算计杀人犯”的典型特征，理应被处决。相反，他们中的大多数人成长于可怕的环境中，缺乏正常的养育，以至于变得病态地反社会。此外，处决是否是报复的必要条件并不明显；我们不会砍掉小偷的手，也不会阉割强奸犯，那么为什么要处决杀人犯呢？</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Critics respond that there is no necessary connection between executing criminals and doing justice. Certainly many of those sentenced to death are culpable and dangerous, worthy of punishment and confinement, but most of them do not fit the model of a calculating killer who deserves to be executed. Instead, most are the product of a horrific upbringing, deprived of normal nurturing to an extent that they have become pathologically asocial. Moreover, it is not obvious that executions are necessary for retribution; we do not cut off the hands of thieves or castrate rapists, so why execute murderers?</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>支持者还认为，死刑肯定了社会对人类生命的重视，将其最严厉的制裁留给了那些夺走他人生命的人。批评者则回应说，死刑贬低了我们对生命的尊重，使我们变得残暴，并使我们习惯于杀戮。正如美国天主教主教会议所写：“对死刑的日益依赖贬低了我们，这是对人类生命日益不尊重的表现……死刑提供了一种悲剧性的幻觉，即我们可以通过夺走生命来捍卫生命。”</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Supporters also argue that the death penalty affirms the value society places on human life, reserving its most severe sanction for those people who have taken another life. Critics respond that capital punishment cheapens our regard for life, brutalizes us, and inures us to killing. As the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops wrote, “Increasing reliance on the death penalty diminishes us and is a sign of growing disrespect for human life....The death penalty offers the tragic illusion that we can defend life by taking life.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>道德论证与政策论证息息相关；即使死刑在道德上合理，如果死刑没有带来一些好处，恐怕也很少有人会支持它。威慑是刑事诉讼程序的一项重要功能，而支持者认为，死刑的威胁才是终极威慑。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The moral argument is linked to the policy argument; probably few people would argue for the death penalty, even if it is morally justified, if it did not also do some good. Deterrence is an important function of the criminal process, and the threat of capital punishment, supporters contend, is the ultimate deterrent.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>批评人士认为，死刑的威慑力不大。许多杀人者都受到毒品或酒精的影响，<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_337" class="calibre4"></a>心理失常，或处于情绪失控的状态，以至于无法停下来冷静地反思其行为的后果。其他杀人犯和大多数罪犯一样，认为自己永远不会被抓到，或者即使被抓到，也能以某种方式逃脱最高惩罚。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Critics respond that the death penalty is not much of a deterrent. Many people who murder are under the influence of drugs or alcohol, <a class="calibre4"></a>psychologically disturbed, or in an emotional state so that they cannot stop and coolly reflect on the consequences of their acts. Other murderers believe, as most criminals do, that they will never be caught or, if they are, that they will somehow escape the maximum punishment.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>死刑的威慑作用是一个实证问题，但却难以解答。许多研究已经进行了比较，例如比较邻近各州在有死刑和无死刑的情况下的杀人案率，或比较一个州在引入死刑前后的杀人案率。正如人们所预料的那样，在这样一个争议如此激烈、难以收集清晰数据的问题上，研究报告的结果也各不相同。一些学者认为死刑没有威慑作用；另一些学者则认为每次处决可以防止多达18起谋杀案；还有一些人得出结论，处决会对公众产生残酷的影响，实际上会增加谋杀率。目前，我们只能得出这样的结论：没有令人信服的证据证明死刑具有威慑作用。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The deterrent effect of the death penalty is an empirical question, but one that is hard to answer. Numerous studies have been conducted comparing, for example, homicide rates in neighboring states with and without the death penalty, or homicide rates in a state before and after the death penalty is introduced. As one might expect on such a hotly contested issue where clear data are difficult to gather, the studies report varied results. Some scholars find no deterrent effect; others have argued that each execution prevents as many as eighteen murders; still others have concluded that executions have a brutalizing effect on the public so that they actually increase the murder rate. At this point, we can only conclude that there is no convincing evidence of a deterrent effect.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>道德和威慑力争论中一个重叠的问题是死刑是否得到公平和一贯的适用。被判处死刑的谋杀罪犯相对较少——大约百分之一——而真正被处死的罪犯就更少了。律师的效力、经济资源和个人特征都会影响谁将被判处死刑以及谁最终会被处死。更令人不安的是种族偏见的模式。佐治亚州（美国最高法院在该州判处死刑的案件导致该州暂时停止执行死刑）的一项关于该州处决模式的研究表明，被判杀害白人的被告被判处死刑的可能性是被判杀害黑人的被告的11倍。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>An issue that overlaps the moral and deterrent arguments concerns whether the death penalty is applied fairly and consistently. Relatively few criminals who commit murder are ever sentenced to death—about one in a hundred—and even fewer of those ever are actually put to death. The effectiveness of counsel, economic resources, and personal characteristics all influence who will be sentenced to death and who will die. Even more troubling are patterns of racial bias. A study of patterns of execution in Georgia, the state that gave rise to the U.S. Supreme Court case that put a temporary hold on executions, showed that a defendant convicted of killing a white person is eleven times more likely to be sentenced to death than one convicted of killing a black person.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>死刑的支持者回应说，不一致和歧视是问题所在，但真正的问题是处决数量太少，而不是太多。例如，在种族偏见问题上，问题不在于白人谋杀者被处决的比例过高，而在于黑人谋杀者被处决的频率不够。解决办法是增加死刑的适用范围，而不是废除死刑。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Advocates of capital punishment respond that inconsistency and discrimination are problems, but the real problem is that there are too few executions, not too many. On the issue of racial bias, for example, the problem is not that murderers of white people are executed at too high a rate but that murderers of black people are not executed frequently enough. The cure is to increase the application of the death penalty, not to abolish it.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>批评人士还质疑死刑是否能够准确无误地执行，这是一个重要问题，因为死刑是最终判决。近年来，数百名死囚在进一步调查后获释，原因是警方或检察官的不当行为、律师服务不力或证人证词错误，导致他们被错误定罪。DNA检测技术的进步也使许多被告脱罪。美国律师协会等组织呼吁暂停执行死刑，直至相关程序到位，以确保公平有效的程序，使无辜者或被指控的被告能够……<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_338" class="calibre4"></a>不值得的人不会被处以死刑。一些州对此做出了回应；例如，2000年，伊利诺伊州州长乔治·瑞安下令暂停执行死刑，并表示：“根据我们的制度，我们释放的人比处死的人还多——13人被宣告无罪，12人被处死。毫无疑问，这个制度存在缺陷，需要进行研究。”</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Critics also question whether the death penalty can be applied without error, which is an important issue because the death penalty is final. In recent years several hundred death row inmates have been freed after further investigation revealed that they were wrongly convicted because of police or prosecutorial misconduct, ineffective lawyering, or mistaken witness testimony. Advances in DNA testing also have exonerated many defendants. Groups such as the American Bar Association have called for a moratorium on executions until procedures are in place to ensure that fair and effective procedures are in place so that the innocent or the <a class="calibre4"></a>undeserving are not sentenced to death. Some states have responded; in Illinois in 2000, for example, Governor George Ryan ordered a moratorium, stating, “We have now freed more people than we have put to death under our system—13 people have been exonerated and 12 have been put to death. There is a flaw in the system, without question, and it needs to be studied.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>无论适用死刑是否是明智的公共政策，最高法院已宣布死刑符合宪法，且四分之三的州都设有死刑。宪法的核心问题是死刑是否违反了第八修正案禁止残酷和不寻常惩罚的规定。运用这一标准引出了一个有趣的宪法主题。死刑在1791年《权利法案》颁布时就已实施，那么它怎么会违反由实施死刑的人起草和批准的宪法修正案呢？答案出现在最高法院第一起重要的第八修正案案件——<em class="calibre8">威姆斯诉美国案</em>（1910年）中。法院裁定，在从事苦役时佩戴镣铐的惩罚无效。“时间会带来改变，”约瑟夫·麦肯纳大法官写道，“[并且]会产生新的条件和目的。因此，一项至关重要的原则必须能够比其产生的危害得到更广泛的应用。”正如首席大法官厄尔·沃伦后来表达的原则，禁止残酷和不寻常的惩罚“必须从标志着成熟社会进步的不断发展的道德标准中汲取意义”。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Whether or not the application of the death penalty is wise public policy, the Supreme Court has declared it to be constitutional, and three-fourths of the states have a death penalty. The central constitutional issue is whether the death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on punishment that is cruel and unusual. Applying this standard raises an interesting theme in constitutional law. Capital punishment was practiced at the time of the enactment of the Bill of Rights in 1791, so how can it violate a constitutional amendment drafted and ratified by people who practiced it? The answer came in the Supreme Court’s first major Eighth Amendment case, <em class="calibre8">Weems v. United States</em> (1910). The Court invalidated a punishment of being shackled while at hard labor. “Time works changes,” wrote Justice Joseph McKenna, “[and] brings into existence new conditions and purposes. Therefore, a principle, to be vital, must be capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it birth.” As Chief Justice Earl Warren later expressed the principle, the prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment “must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>这里还有第二个异常。死刑是由立法机关——社会的代表——规定的。那么，它怎么会违反当代的道德标准呢？答案当然是，多数人的意志（或者更现实地说，多数人的代表）并不能决定社会的标准。在我们的宪法制度下，法院拥有立法司法审查权，正是在多数人的行为超越宪法界限的情况下，对其进行制约。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There is a second anomaly here. The death penalty is prescribed by the legislature, the representative of the community. How can it then violate contemporary standards of decency? The answer, of course, is that the will of the majority (or, more realistically, the majority’s representatives) is not conclusive as to community standards. Under our constitutional system, the courts possess the power of judicial review of legislation precisely to check the majority in cases where its actions exceed constitutional boundaries.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>20世纪60年代，死刑的合宪性问题被提交最高法院，由一群律师发起的一系列案件提出，这些律师以全国有色人种协进会法律辩护基金的律师为先锋。决定性的案件是1972年的<em class="calibre8">弗曼诉佐治亚州案</em>，该案涉及三名被判处死刑的人员，并间接涉及600多名死囚。在最高法院历史上就单个案件发表的最长的一系列意见中，五位大法官裁定当时适用的死刑无效，四位大法官持不同意见，九位大法官各自撰写了一份单独的意见。布伦南大法官和马歇尔大法官认为死刑本质上是残酷且不寻常的，他们关注的是<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_339" class="calibre4"></a>诸如适用的任意性（如审查案件所示）、死刑的残酷性以及缺乏威慑力等因素。其他三位持多数意见的法官则关注死刑适用的任意性。持不同意见的法官并非都否认死刑在某些方面令人憎恶，但他们建议最高法院应尊重立法机关关于“不断发展的道德标准”的判断。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The constitutionality of the death penalty came to the Supreme Court in the 1960s, raised in a series of cases by a campaign of lawyers spearheaded by attorneys associated with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. The decisive case was <em class="calibre8">Furman v. Georgia</em> (1972), which involved three persons under death sentence and, indirectly, more than 600 prisoners on death row. In the longest set of opinions published in a single case in the history of the Court, five justices invalidated the death penalty as then applied and four dissented, with each of the nine writing a separate opinion. Justices Brennan and Marshall held the death penalty to be inherently cruel and unusual, focusing on <a class="calibre4"></a>factors such as the arbitrariness of application (as shown in the cases under review), the cruelty, and the lack of deterrent effect of the death penalty. The three other justices in the majority focused on the arbitrariness of application. The dissenters did not all disagree that the death penalty was in some respects abhorrent, but they suggested that the Court should defer to the legislature’s judgment about “evolving standards of decency.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em class="calibre8">由于弗曼案</em>中三位多数派大法官的焦点在于死刑适用的任意性，各州立法机构修改了量刑法律，以符合最高法院的意见。一项针对任意性的建议是，在所有特定类型的谋杀案件中强制判处死刑，例如所有被判终身监禁的囚犯犯下的谋杀案。然而，最高法院随后驳回了强制判处死刑的方案，认为每个人都是独一无二的个体，因此宪法要求对与犯罪和被告相关的个人因素进行具体考虑。解决任意性问题的另一种方法是引导决策者的自由裁量权，最高法院也采用了这种方法。大多数设有死刑的州都允许陪审团判处刑罚，而引导陪审团自由裁量权的第一步是将审判分为两部分。在审判的第一阶段，陪审团将就被告的有罪作出裁决。如果被告被判有罪，则在审判的第二阶段会出示补充证据，陪审团将在审判结束时决定是否判处死刑。由于审判分为两个阶段，量刑阶段的陪审团可以听取与量刑相关的<em class="calibre8">加重</em>和<em class="calibre8">减轻因素</em>的证据，而这些证据在定罪阶段是不可采纳的。这一点很重要，因为法院认为，必须允许陪审团考虑所有减轻被告罪责的因素，以便其能够自由裁定死刑不合适。通常需要考虑的因素包括：犯罪性质极其恶劣（可作为加重因素）；以及年轻被告受他人影响犯罪（可作为减轻因素）。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Because the focus of three of the majority justices in <em class="calibre8">Furman</em> was on the arbitrariness of the death penalty as applied, state legislatures rewrote their sentencing laws to conform to the Court’s opinion. One proposed cure for arbitrariness is to make a death sentence mandatory in all cases of specified types of murder, such as all murders committed by prisoners under life sentence. The Court, however, subsequently rejected mandatory sentences, in the view that, because every person is a unique individual, particularized consideration of individual factors relating to the crime and the defendant is constitutionally required. A different cure for the problem of arbitrariness is to guide the discretion of the decision maker, and the Court has adopted this approach. Most states that have a death penalty allow the jury to impose the sentence, and a first step in guiding the jury’s discretion is to bifurcate the trial. At the first stage of the trial the jury renders a verdict on the defendant’s guilt. If the defendant is found guilty, additional evidence is presented at a second stage of the trial, at the conclusion of which the jury decides whether a death sentence will be imposed. Because the trial is bifurcated, the jury in the sentencing phase can hear evidence of <em class="calibre8">aggravating</em> and <em class="calibre8">mitigating factors</em> relevant to sentencing that would not be admissible during the guilt phase. This is important, because the Court has held that the jury must be allowed to consider all factors that mitigate the defendant’s guilt so that it is free to decide that the death penalty is not appropriate. Typical factors to be considered include the particularly heinous nature of the crime as an aggravating factor and that a young defendant was influenced by someone else to commit the crime as a mitigating factor.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>法院还缩小了可判处死刑的案件范围。在某些情况下，刑罚与犯罪行为不相称，例如，如果被告仅为共犯，或被告仅被判犯有强奸儿童罪而非谋杀罪，则不得判处死刑。在其他情况下，被告的处境使其无法执行死刑；例如，法院认为，处决一名智力障碍者或犯罪时未满18岁的人是残酷且不寻常的。<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_340" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Court has also narrowed the class of cases in which the death penalty can be imposed at all. In some circumstances the penalty is disproportionate to the crime, so, for example, it may not be imposed as a punishment where the defendant was only an accomplice to a crime or where the defendant has been convicted of child rape but not murder. In other circumstances the situation of the defendant precludes execution; for example, the Court has held that to execute a mentally retarded person or a person who was under eighteen years old at the time he committed his crime would be cruel and unusual.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<h3 class="sec" id="text/part0015_split_001.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-9-div1-13"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0095" class="calibre1">为什么刑事上诉程序似乎要耗费这么长时间？</a></h3><h3 class="sec"><a href="#text/part0004.html.n0095" class="calibre1">Why Does It Seem That Criminal Appeals Go on So Long?</a></h3>
<p class="noindent">在上诉过程中，就像在刑事诉讼的其他环节一样，我们必须平衡相互冲突的目的。审判法官可能会犯错，当这些错误损害被告的权利时，我们希望确保这些错误得到纠正。否则，宪法保障的权利可能会被践踏，无辜者可能会锒铛入狱。但适可而止。终局性也很重要。正如我们不愿在调查和审判过程中投入无限的资源以确保不犯任何错误一样，在某个时候，当被告的审判已被上诉法院复审一次、两次或更多次时，我们会得出结论，被告已经获得了其应得的复审。</p><p class="noindent">In appeals, as elsewhere in the criminal process, we have to balance conflicting purposes. Trial judges can make mistakes, and when those mistakes prejudice a defendant’s rights, we want to make sure that the mistakes are corrected. Otherwise, the rights guaranteed by the Constitution may be subverted and an innocent person may go to jail. But enough is enough. Finality is important, too. Just as we are unwilling to invest unlimited resources into the investigative and trial processes to make sure no mistakes are made, so, too, at some point, when a defendant’s trial has been reviewed by an appellate court once, twice, or more, we conclude that the defendant has gotten as much review as he is entitled to.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>请注意，本节讨论的是被告对定罪的上诉。在民事案件中，任何一方均可对不利的判决提出上诉；在刑事案件中，被告始终可以对定罪或审判过程中的错误提出上诉。第五修正案的双重危险条款禁止政府反复起诉某人，直到经过一系列无罪判决后最终定罪。因此，检方通常不能对无罪判决提出上诉。然而，该条款的适用范围远不止于此。一旦陪审团组成，危险便会生效，因此检方不能在审判进展不顺利时决定中止审判，并由不同的陪审团再次审判。该条款还禁止对同一组事实引起的不同法定罪行提起诉讼，因为对同一组事实的证明要求与对另一组事实的证明要求相同。例如，如果一名司机被判醉酒驾驶罪，她不能随后因在醉酒驾驶过程中撞倒行人而被以过失杀人罪起诉，因为她的过失证据就是醉酒驾驶。州政府可以同时对她提出两项指控，但连续起诉构成双重危险。但是，当犯罪违反了各自当局的法律时，双重危险条款并不禁止州和联邦法院进行两次起诉。银行抢劫犯可能同时根据州法律因抢劫而被起诉，也可能根据联邦法律因银行抢劫（联邦罪行）而被起诉。它也不禁止在因相关行为被刑事定罪后提起具有一定惩罚性后果的民事诉讼。当一名囚犯因猥亵儿童而服刑完毕后即将获释时，州政府可以根据性暴力侵犯者法规提起诉讼，将其民事送往州立机构，而不会违反双重危险条款。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Note that the discussion in this section is about appeal of a conviction by the defendant. In civil cases, either party may appeal an adverse decision and in criminal cases, the defendant can always appeal a conviction or an error in the conduct of the trial. The double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment prevents the government from repeatedly prosecuting someone for a crime until, after a string of acquittals, it finally obtains a conviction. Therefore, the prosecution generally cannot appeal an acquittal. The clause’s scope is broader than that, though. Jeopardy attaches once the jury is impaneled, so the prosecution cannot decide to stop a trial if it is not going well and try again with a different jury. It also bars prosecution for different statutory offenses arising out of the same set of facts, when the proof required for one is the same as the proof required for another. For example, if a driver is convicted of driving while intoxicated, she cannot subsequently be prosecuted for negligent homicide for running over a pedestrian during her drunken-driving spree, where the proof of her negligence is her drunk driving. The state could bring both charges against her at the same time, but sequential prosecutions constitute double jeopardy. However, the double jeopardy clause does not bar two prosecutions by state and federal courts, when the crime is a violation of the law of each authority. A bank robber may be prosecuted both under state law for robbery and under federal law for bank robbery, a federal crime. Nor does it bar a civil action that has some punitive effect following a criminal conviction for related conduct. When an inmate is about to be released from prison after serving time for taking indecent liberties with a child, the state can institute proceedings to have him civilly committed to a state institution under a sexually violent predator statute without violating the double jeopardy clause.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>被告可以对初审法院的定罪或错误提出两种不同的质疑。<em class="calibre8">上诉</em>是指请求<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_341" class="calibre4"></a>对初审法院错误的直接审查，直接提交给高于初审法院的更高级别的法院。<em class="calibre8">附带质疑</em>是对初审法院判决的质疑，顾名思义，这种质疑是附带的，或者说，它超出了正常的审查程序；附带质疑通常在所有上诉都已用尽之后提出。大多数对被告无休止上诉的批评，实际上都是对附带质疑的批评。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There are two separate kinds of challenges that a defendant can make to a conviction or an error by the trial court. An <em class="calibre8">appeal</em> is a request for <a class="calibre4"></a>a direct review of a trial court error, directed to a court higher up in the system than the trial court. A <em class="calibre8">collateral challenge</em> is an attack on a trial court decision that is, as its name indicates, collateral, or out of the normal chain of review; a collateral challenge usually comes after all appeals have been exhausted. Most of the criticism of endless appeals by defendants is actually criticism of collateral challenges.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>首先，让我们考虑一下上诉。在任何案件中，被告都有权向更高一级的法院上诉，以纠正初审法院所犯的错误。这是有道理的；如果初审法官不当地采纳证据或错误地指导陪审团理解法律，而被告又无法纠正错误，那将是非常不公平的。除了第一级审查之外，上诉通常由审查法院自行决定。例如，在典型的州级系统中，被告有权向中级上诉法院上诉，但州最高法院有权决定是否受理此案。美国最高法院比几乎任何其他法院都拥有更大的自由裁量权；大多数希望法院审理其案件的被告必须申请<em class="calibre8">调卷令</em>，请求法院决定审理此案。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>First, let’s consider appeals. In every case, a defendant has a right to appeal to a higher court to correct errors made by the trial court. This makes sense; it would be grossly unfair if the trial judge improperly admitted evidence or erroneously instructed the jury on the law and there was no way for the defendant to have the mistake corrected. Beyond this first level of review, appeals are often discretionary with the reviewing court. In a typical state system, for example, the defendant has a right to appeal to the intermediate appellate court, but the state supreme court has the discretion to decide whether or not it wants to take the case. The U.S. Supreme Court exercises more discretion than almost any other court; most defendants who want their cases heard by the Court must petition for a <em class="calibre8">writ of certiorari</em>, asking the Court to decide to hear the case.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>假设一名被定罪的被告可以向上诉法院指出下级法院所犯的任何错误，而上诉法院如果发现错误，就会撤销原判并下令重新审判。由于任何审判都不可能完美无缺，被告总是可以进行第二次、第三次甚至第四次尝试；任何定罪都无法经受复审。法院制定了两项原则来防止这种情况发生，一项涉及可复审的内容，另一项涉及如何复审。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Suppose a convicted defendant could bring to the appellate court’s attention any mistake that had been made below, and the appellate court would reverse and order a new trial if it discovered a mistake. Since no trial is ever perfect, a defendant always could have a second, third, and fourth bite at the apple; no conviction could ever withstand review. The courts have developed two doctrines to prevent this situation, one dealing with what may be reviewed and the other dealing with how it is reviewed.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第一项原则规定，上诉法院只会在上诉中考虑被告在审判中提出的问题。其理由很简单：如果被告最初提出该问题，并且审判法院有机会纠正其错误，那么不惜花费重审的精力和费用是不合理的。例如，被告不能在上诉中声称自己是使用非法获取的证据被定罪的，除非她的律师提出申请，要求在审判中排除该证据。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The first doctrine states that an appellate court will only consider on appeal an issue that the defendant raised at trial. The rationale is simple; it is unreasonable to go to the trouble and expense of a new trial that could have been avoided if the defendant had raised the issue initially and the trial court had an opportunity to correct its error. For example, a defendant cannot claim on appeal that she was convicted using illegally obtained evidence unless her attorney had moved to exclude the evidence from the trial.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>然而，法律上，每条规则都有例外。“未提出”规则的一个例外是“<em class="calibre8">明显错误</em>”规则。即使被告未在上诉法院提起该问题，上诉法院也可以纠正审判中发生的明显错误或“影响实质性权利的缺陷”。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In law, however, every rule has its exception. One exception to the failure-to-raise rule is the <em class="calibre8">plain error</em> rule. The appellate court can correct plain errors or “defects affecting substantial rights” that occurred at the trial, even if the defendant did not raise the issue below.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第二个原则指出，并非所有错误都足以推翻判决。该规则几乎字面意思就是“无害，无犯规”。根据<em class="calibre8">无害错误</em>规则，只有重大错误才足以推翻判决。<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_342" class="calibre4"></a>如果被投诉的错误与被告的宪法权利无关，那么问题在于该错误对定罪的贡献有多大。例如，如果法官在某一点上采纳了不可接受的证据，但有大量其他证据可以佐证该点，那么这种错误的采纳从总体上来说并无害。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The second doctrine states that not every error gives cause for reversal. The rule, almost literally, is “no harm, no foul.” Under the <em class="calibre8">harmless error</em> rule, only important errors justify reversing a conviction. <a class="calibre4"></a>When the error complained of does not concern the defendant’s constitutional rights, the question is how much the mistake contributed to the conviction. For instance, when the judge admits inadmissible evidence on a point but there is plenty of other evidence substantiating the point, the erroneous admission is, in the scheme of things, harmless.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>人们或许会认为，涉及被告宪法权利的错误总是应该被推翻。侵犯宪法权利怎么可能无害呢？无论是就其对被告的影响而言，还是就其在预防违宪方面所起的预防作用而言。但最高法院已经区分了无害的宪法错误和需要自动推翻的错误，并且根据其目前的观点，大多数错误都属于第一类。例如，如果一份违反律师辩护权而获得的供词被采纳为证据，则只适用无害错误标准。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One might think that mistakes that implicate the defendant’s constitutional rights should always give rise to a reversal. How can the violation of a constitutional right be harmless, either in its effect on the defendant or in the prophylactic effect in preventing constitutional violations? But the Supreme Court has distinguished constitutional errors that are harmless from those that require automatic reversal and, under its current view of the matter, most errors fall in the first category. For example, if a confession obtained in violation of the right to counsel is admitted into evidence, only the harmless error standard applies.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>上诉程序应该足以纠正大多数错误，但几个世纪以来，一直存在一种替代的、附带的攻击定罪的手段：<em class="calibre8">人身保护令</em>。“人身保护令”在拉丁语中的意思是“你掌握了尸体”——这是针对关押某人囚犯的政府官员发出的法院命令的首字母，实际上是说“你掌握了这个人的尸体，你必须将他送上法庭。”人身保护令，被称为大令状，是一种挑战监禁合法性的万能程序。被拘留（实际或推定）的被定罪囚犯可以向联邦法院申请人身保护令，针对关押他的联邦或州当局，声称监禁是非法的，因为导致监禁的程序中存在法律错误。 （如<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.n0127" href="#text/part0008_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-2" class="calibre4">第二章</a>所讨论的，最高法院还裁定，人身保护令可以用来质疑在阿富汗战争期间被捕并作为敌方战斗人员关押在美国军事监狱和古巴关塔那摩湾的囚犯的拘留合法性[<em class="calibre8">哈姆迪诉拉姆斯菲尔德案</em>和<em class="calibre8">拉苏尔诉布什案</em>，2004 年，以及<em class="calibre8">布迈丁诉布什案</em>，2008 年]。）</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The appeals process should be enough to correct most errors, but for centuries there has been an alternative, collateral means of attacking a conviction: the <em class="calibre8">writ of habeas corpus</em>. “Habeas corpus” in Latin means “you have the body”—the initial words of the court order directed to a government official holding someone prisoner, in effect saying “you have the body of this person and you must bring him to court.” Habeas corpus, known as the Great Writ, is an all-purpose proceeding for challenging the legitimacy of one’s confinement. A convicted prisoner who is in custody (actual or constructive) can petition a federal court for habeas corpus directed at the federal or state authority holding him, claiming that the confinement is illegal because of a legal error in the proceeding that led to confinement. (As discussed in <a href="#text/part0008_split_000.html.actrade-9780199341696-chapter-2" class="calibre4">Chapter 2</a>, the Supreme Court also held that habeas was available to challenge the legality of the detention of prisoners captured during the war in Afghanistan and held as enemy combatants in military prisons in the United States and at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba [<em class="calibre8">Hamdi v. Rumsfeld</em> and <em class="calibre8">Rasul v. Bush</em>, 2004, and <em class="calibre8">Boumedienne v. Bush</em>, 2008].)</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>人身保护令是一项强有力的救济措施。它表达了一些基本原则：个人只能依法，尤其是宪法，才能受到刑事处罚，这一要求至关重要，因此除了普通的上诉权之外，还存在司法救济。但这又一次引发了冲突。如果被告可以动用人身保护令来质疑定罪，那么她是否可以反复使用它，质疑一个又一个的错误，即使是那些在直接上诉中未被考虑的错误？法院和立法机构一直试图在人身保护令所保护的权利与对最终判决的渴望以及惩罚罪犯的实际考虑之间取得平衡。<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_343" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Habeas corpus is a powerful remedy. It expresses some basic principles: An individual can be criminally punished only in accordance with law and especially constitutional law, and that requirement is so important that a judicial remedy exists in addition to the ordinary right of appeal. But once again there is a conflict. If a defendant can use habeas to challenge a conviction, can she use it over and over, to challenge one error after another, even errors that have not been considered on direct appeal? The courts and legislatures have attempted to balance the rights protected by habeas against the desire for finality and the practical concern of punishing criminals.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>自20世纪70年代以来，平衡已转向有利于限制人身保护令。首先，根据现行法律，许多违宪行为在人身保护令程序中根本无法提出。特别是，如果被告有“充分和公平的机会”在州诉讼程序中提起诉讼，则第四修正案中关于被告基于非法扣押证据被定罪的主张将被排除。法院表示，如果被告有这样的机会，那么第四修正案旨在对非法警察行为产生的任何威慑作用都已经显现，因此允许被告再次提起诉讼毫无意义。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Since the 1970s, the balance has shifted in favor of limiting the habeas right. First, under current law a number of constitutional violations may not be raised at all in habeas proceedings. In particular, Fourth Amendment claims that a defendant was convicted on the basis of illegally seized evidence are precluded where the defendant had a “full and fair opportunity” to litigate the claims in the state proceeding. If the defendant had such an opportunity, the courts have said, whatever deterrent effect the Fourth Amendment was designed to have on illegal police conduct has already been felt, so there is no point in allowing the defendant to litigate the claims again.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>其次，在援引人身保护令之前，被告必须用尽其他可用的救济措施。如果被告的权利明显受到侵犯，她必须首先向州法院提出相关问题。该规则的唯一例外是：被告能够证明未能提出索赔的理由以及由此造成的实际损害；存在根本性的误判；或者在州法院没有获得有效救济的机会。然而，值得注意的是，即使被告试图证明她实际上对被定罪的指控是无辜的，法院也不太可能批准人身保护令申请。</p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Second, before invoking habeas a defendant must exhaust other remedies available. If the defendant’s rights have clearly been violated, she must raise the issues first in the state court. The only exceptions to this rule are when the defendant can show a reason for failing to raise the claim and actual prejudice as a result, when there was a fundamental miscarriage of justice, or when there is no effective opportunity to obtain redress in state court. Remarkably, though, even when the defendant attempts to show that she actually is innocent of the charges of which she was convicted, the court is unlikely to allow the habeas petition.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>第三，联邦人身保护令法允许法院驳回人身保护令申请，前提是相关问题已在先前的申请中得到处理，且进一步审查“无助于伸张正义”。该法还授权法院驳回滥用人身保护令的申请；如果被告曾经申请过人身保护令，法院将驳回后续申请，即使其理由不同，除非被告能够解释其先前未提出该问题的原因，并证明由此将造成的损害。<a id="text/part0015_split_001.html.page_344" class="calibre4"></a></p><p class="indent"><span class="space" data-amznremoved-m8="true">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Third, the federal habeas corpus statute permits courts to refuse habeas petitions if the issues have been dealt with in previous petitions and “the ends of justice will not be served” by further review. The statute also authorizes courts to deny petitions for abuse of the writ; where a defendant has once sought habeas, the court will deny successive petitions, even those that raise different grounds, unless the defendant can provide an explanation for failing to raise the issue previously and can prove the prejudice that will result.<a class="calibre4"></a></p>
