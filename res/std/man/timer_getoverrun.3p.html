<p class="Pp">The <i>timer_gettime</i>() function shall store the amount of time
    until the specified timer, <i>timerid</i>, expires and the reload value of
    the timer into the space pointed to by the <i>value</i> argument. The
    <i>it_value</i> member of this structure shall contain the amount of time
    before the timer expires, or zero if the timer is disarmed. This value is
    returned as the interval until timer expiration, even if the timer was armed
    with absolute time. The <i>it_interval</i> member of <i>value</i> shall
    contain the reload value last set by <i>timer_settime</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>timer_settime</i>() function shall set the time until the
    next expiration of the timer specified by <i>timerid</i> from the
    <i>it_value</i> member of the <i>value</i> argument and arm the timer if the
    <i>it_value</i> member of <i>value</i> is non-zero. If the specified timer
    was already armed when <i>timer_settime</i>() is called, this call shall
    reset the time until next expiration to the <i>value</i> specified. If the
    <i>it_value</i> member of <i>value</i> is zero, the timer shall be disarmed.
    The effect of disarming or resetting a timer with pending expiration
    notifications is unspecified.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the flag TIMER_ABSTIME is not set in the argument <i>flags</i>,
    <i>timer_settime</i>() shall behave as if the time until next expiration is
    set to be equal to the interval specified by the <i>it_value</i> member of
    <i>value</i>. That is, the timer shall expire in <i>it_value</i> nanoseconds
    from when the call is made. If the flag TIMER_ABSTIME is set in the argument
    <i>flags</i>, <i>timer_settime</i>() shall behave as if the time until next
    expiration is set to be equal to the difference between the absolute time
    specified by the <i>it_value</i> member of <i>value</i> and the current
    value of the clock associated with <i>timerid</i>. That is, the timer shall
    expire when the clock reaches the value specified by the <i>it_value</i>
    member of <i>value</i>. If the specified time has already passed, the
    function shall succeed and the expiration notification shall be made.</p>
<p class="Pp">The reload value of the timer shall be set to the value specified
    by the <i>it_interval</i> member of <i>value</i>. When a timer is armed with
    a non-zero <i>it_interval</i>, a periodic (or repetitive) timer is
    specified.</p>
<p class="Pp">Time values that are between two consecutive non-negative integer
    multiples of the resolution of the specified timer shall be rounded up to
    the larger multiple of the resolution. Quantization error shall not cause
    the timer to expire earlier than the rounded time value.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the argument <i>ovalue</i> is not NULL, the
    <i>timer_settime</i>() function shall store, in the location referenced by
    <i>ovalue</i>, a value representing the previous amount of time before the
    timer would have expired, or zero if the timer was disarmed, together with
    the previous timer reload value. Timers shall not expire before their
    scheduled time.</p>
<p class="Pp">Only a single signal shall be queued to the process for a given
    timer at any point in time. When a timer for which a signal is still pending
    expires, no signal shall be queued, and a timer overrun shall occur. When a
    timer expiration signal is delivered to or accepted by a process, the
    <i>timer_getoverrun</i>() function shall return the timer expiration overrun
    count for the specified timer. The overrun count returned contains the
    number of extra timer expirations that occurred between the time the signal
    was generated (queued) and when it was delivered or accepted, up to but not
    including an implementation-defined maximum of {DELAYTIMER_MAX}. If the
    number of such extra expirations is greater than or equal to
    {DELAYTIMER_MAX}, then the overrun count shall be set to {DELAYTIMER_MAX}.
    The value returned by <i>timer_getoverrun</i>() shall apply to the most
    recent expiration signal delivery or acceptance for the timer. If no
    expiration signal has been delivered for the timer, the return value of
    <i>timer_getoverrun</i>() is unspecified.</p>
<p class="Pp">The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the
    <i>timerid</i> argument to <i>timer_getoverrun</i>(),
    <i>timer_gettime</i>(), or <i>timer_settime</i>() does not correspond to a
    timer ID returned by <i>timer_create</i>() but not yet deleted by
    <i>timer_delete</i>().</p>

<p class="Pp">If the <i>timer_getoverrun</i>() function succeeds, it shall
    return the timer expiration overrun count as explained above.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>timer_gettime</i>() or <i>timer_settime</i>() functions
    succeed, a value of 0 shall be returned.</p>
<p class="Pp">If an error occurs for any of these functions, the value -1 shall
    be returned, and <i>errno</i> set to indicate the error.</p>

  USAGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Using fixed stack addresses is problematic when timer expiration
    is signaled by the creation of a new thread. Since it cannot be assumed that
    the thread created for one expiration is finished before the next expiration
    of the timer, it could happen that two threads use the same memory as a
    stack at the same time. This is invalid and produces undefined results.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="permalink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Practical clocks tick at a finite rate, with rates of 100 hertz
    and 1000 hertz being common. The inverse of this tick rate is the clock
    resolution, also called the clock granularity, which in either case is
    expressed as a time duration, being 10 milliseconds and 1 millisecond
    respectively for these common rates. The granularity of practical clocks
    implies that if one reads a given clock twice in rapid succession, one may
    get the same time value twice; and that timers must wait for the next clock
    tick after the theoretical expiration time, to ensure that a timer never
    returns too soon. Note also that the granularity of the clock may be
    significantly coarser than the resolution of the data format used to set and
    get time and interval values. Also note that some implementations may choose
    to adjust time and/or interval values to exactly match the ticks of the
    underlying clock.</p>
<p class="Pp">This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defines functions that allow an
    application to determine the implementation-supported resolution for the
    clocks and requires an implementation to document the resolution supported
    for timers and <i>nanosleep</i>() if they differ from the supported clock
    resolution. This is more of a procurement issue than a runtime application
    issue.</p>
<p class="Pp">If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
    <i>timerid</i> argument to <i>timer_getoverrun</i>(),
    <i>timer_gettime</i>(), or <i>timer_settime</i>() does not correspond to a
    timer ID returned by <i>timer_create</i>() but not yet deleted by
    <i>timer_delete</i>(), it is recommended that the function should fail and
    report an <b>[EINVAL]</b> error.</p>
