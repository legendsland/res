<p class="Pp">The <i>access</i>() function shall check the file named by the
    pathname pointed to by the <i>path</i> argument for accessibility according
    to the bit pattern contained in <i>amode</i>. The checks for accessibility
    (including directory permissions checked during pathname resolution) shall
    be performed using the real user ID in place of the effective user ID and
    the real group ID in place of the effective group ID.</p>
<p class="Pp">The value of <i>amode</i> is either the bitwise-inclusive OR of
    the access permissions to be checked (R_OK, W_OK, X_OK) or the existence
    test (F_OK).</p>
<p class="Pp">If any access permissions are checked, each shall be checked
    individually, as described in the Base Definitions volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 4.5</i>, <i>File Access Permissions</i>,
    except that where that description refers to execute permission for a
    process with appropriate privileges, an implementation may indicate success
    for X_OK even if execute permission is not granted to any user.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>faccessat</i>() function, when called with a <i>flag</i>
    value of zero, shall be equivalent to the <i>access</i>() function, except
    in the case where <i>path</i> specifies a relative path. In this case the
    file whose accessibility is to be determined shall be located relative to
    the directory associated with the file descriptor <i>fd</i> instead of the
    current working directory. If the access mode of the open file description
    associated with the file descriptor is not O_SEARCH, the function shall
    check whether directory searches are permitted using the current permissions
    of the directory underlying the file descriptor. If the access mode is
    O_SEARCH, the function shall not perform the check.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>faccessat</i>() is passed the special value AT_FDCWD in the
    <i>fd</i> parameter, the current working directory shall be used and, if
    flag is zero, the behavior shall be identical to a call to
  <i>access</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">Values for <i>flag</i> are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive OR
    of flags from the following list, defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>:</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="APPLICATION_USAGE"><a class="permalink" href="#APPLICATION_USAGE">APPLICATION
  USAGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Use of these functions is discouraged since by the time the
    returned information is acted upon, it is out-of-date. (That is, acting upon
    the information always leads to a time-of-check-to-time-of-use race
    condition.) An application should instead attempt the action itself and
    handle the <b>[EACCES]</b> error that occurs if the file is not accessible
    (with a change of effective user and group IDs beforehand, and perhaps a
    change back afterwards, in the case where <i>access</i>() or
    <i>faccessat</i>() without AT_EACCES would have been used.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, one of the uses of <i>access</i>() was in
    set-user-ID root programs to check whether the user running the program had
    access to a file. This relied on ``super-user'' privileges which were
    granted based on the effective user ID being zero, so that when
    <i>access</i>() used the real user ID to check accessibility those
    privileges were not taken into account. On newer systems where privileges
    can be assigned which have no association with user or group IDs, if a
    program with such privileges calls <i>access</i>(), the change of IDs has no
    effect on the privileges and therefore they are taken into account in the
    accessibility checks. Thus, <i>access</i>() (and <i>faccessat</i>() with
    flag zero) cannot be used for this historical purpose in such programs.
    Likewise, if a system provides any additional or alternate file access
    control mechanisms that are not user ID-based, they will still be taken into
    account.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a relative pathname is used, no account is taken of whether the
    current directory (or the directory associated with the file descriptor
    <i>fd</i>) is accessible via any absolute pathname. Applications using
    <i>access</i>(), or <i>faccessat</i>() without AT_EACCES, may consequently
    act as if the file would be accessible to a user with the real user ID and
    group ID of the process when such a user would not in practice be able to
    access the file because access would be denied at some point above the
    current directory (or the directory associated with the file descriptor
    <i>fd</i>) in the file hierarchy.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>access</i>() or <i>faccessat</i>() is used with W_OK to
    check for write access to a directory which has the S_ISVTX bit set, a
    return value indicating the directory is writable can be misleading since
    some operations on files in the directory would not be permitted based on
    the ownership of those files (see the Base Definitions volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 4.3</i>, <i>Directory Protection</i>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Additional values of <i>amode</i> other than the set defined in
    the description may be valid; for example, if a system has extended access
    controls.</p>
<p class="Pp">The use of the AT_EACCESS value for <i>flag</i> enables
    functionality not available in <i>access</i>().</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="permalink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">In early proposals, some inadequacies in the <i>access</i>()
    function led to the creation of an <i>eaccess</i>() function because:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> 1.</dt>
  <dd>Historical implementations of <i>access</i>() do not test file access
      correctly when the process' real user ID is superuser. In particular, they
      always return zero when testing execute permissions without regard to
      whether the file is executable.</dd>
  <dt> 2.</dt>
  <dd>The superuser has complete access to all files on a system. As a
      consequence, programs started by the superuser and switched to the
      effective user ID with lesser privileges cannot use <i>access</i>() to
      test their file access permissions.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">However, the historical model of <i>eaccess</i>() does not resolve
    problem (1), so this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 now allows
    <i>access</i>() to behave in the desired way because several implementations
    have corrected the problem. It was also argued that problem (2) is more
    easily solved by using <i>open</i>(), <i>chdir</i>(), or one of the
    <i>exec</i> functions as appropriate and responding to the error, rather
    than creating a new function that would not be as reliable. Therefore,
    <i>eaccess</i>() is not included in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.</p>
<p class="Pp">The sentence concerning appropriate privileges and execute
    permission bits reflects the two possibilities implemented by historical
    implementations when checking superuser access for X_OK.</p>
<p class="Pp">New implementations are discouraged from returning X_OK unless at
    least one execution permission bit is set.</p>
<p class="Pp">The purpose of the <i>faccessat</i>() function is to enable the
    checking of the accessibility of files in directories other than the current
    working directory without exposure to race conditions. Any part of the path
    of a file could be changed in parallel to a call to <i>access</i>(),
    resulting in unspecified behavior. By opening a file descriptor for the
    target directory and using the <i>faccessat</i>() function it can be
    guaranteed that the file tested for accessibility is located relative to the
    desired directory.</p>
