<p class="Pp">The <i>pthread_atfork</i>() function shall declare fork handlers
    to be called before and after <i>fork</i>(), in the context of the thread
    that called <i>fork</i>(). The <i>prepare</i> fork handler shall be called
    before <i>fork</i>() processing commences. The <i>parent</i> fork handle
    shall be called after <i>fork</i>() processing completes in the parent
    process. The <i>child</i> fork handler shall be called after <i>fork</i>()
    processing completes in the child process. If no handling is desired at one
    or more of these three points, the corresponding fork handler address(es)
    may be set to NULL.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a <i>fork</i>() call in a multi-threaded process leads to a
    <i>child</i> fork handler calling any function that is not
    async-signal-safe, the behavior is undefined.</p>
<p class="Pp">The order of calls to <i>pthread_atfork</i>() is significant. The
    <i>parent</i> and <i>child</i> fork handlers shall be called in the order in

<h1 class="Sh" id="APPLICATION_USAGE"><a class="permalink" href="#APPLICATION_USAGE">APPLICATION
  USAGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The original usage pattern envisaged for <i>pthread_atfork</i>()
    was for the <i>prepare</i> fork handler to lock mutexes and other locks, and
    for the <i>parent</i> and <i>child</i> handlers to unlock them. However,
    since all of the relevant unlocking functions, except <i>sem_post</i>(), are
    not async-signal-safe, this usage results in undefined behavior in the child
    process unless the only such unlocking function it calls is
    <i>sem_post</i>().</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="permalink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">There are at least two serious problems with the semantics of
    <i>fork</i>() in a multi-threaded program. One problem has to do with state
    (for example, memory) covered by mutexes. Consider the case where one thread
    has a mutex locked and the state covered by that mutex is inconsistent while
    another thread calls <i>fork</i>(). In the child, the mutex is in the locked
    state (locked by a nonexistent thread and thus can never be unlocked).
    Having the child simply reinitialize the mutex is unsatisfactory since this
    approach does not resolve the question about how to correct or otherwise
    deal with the inconsistent state in the child.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is suggested that programs that use <i>fork</i>() call an
    <i>exec</i> function very soon afterwards in the child process, thus
    resetting all states. In the meantime, only a short list of
    async-signal-safe library routines are promised to be available.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unfortunately, this solution does not address the needs of
    multi-threaded libraries. Application programs may not be aware that a
    multi-threaded library is in use, and they feel free to call any number of
    library routines between the <i>fork</i>() and <i>exec</i> calls, just as
    they always have. Indeed, they may be extant single-threaded programs and
    cannot, therefore, be expected to obey new restrictions imposed by the
    threads library.</p>
<p class="Pp">On the other hand, the multi-threaded library needs a way to
    protect its internal state during <i>fork</i>() in case it is re-entered
    later in the child process. The problem arises especially in multi-threaded
    I/O libraries, which are almost sure to be invoked between the <i>fork</i>()
    and <i>exec</i> calls to effect I/O redirection. The solution may require
    locking mutex variables during <i>fork</i>(), or it may entail simply
    resetting the state in the child after the <i>fork</i>() processing
    completes.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>pthread_atfork</i>() function was intended to provide
    multi-threaded libraries with a means to protect themselves from innocent
    application programs that call <i>fork</i>(), and to provide multi-threaded
    application programs with a standard mechanism for protecting themselves
    from <i>fork</i>() calls in a library routine or the application itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">The expected usage was that the prepare handler would acquire all
    mutex locks and the other two fork handlers would release them.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, an application could have supplied a prepare routine
    that acquires the necessary mutexes the library maintains and supplied child
    and parent routines that release those mutexes, thus ensuring that the child
    would have got a consistent snapshot of the state of the library (and that
    no mutexes would have been left stranded). This is good in theory, but in
    reality not practical. Each and every mutex and lock in the process must be
    located and locked. Every component of a program including third-party
    components must participate and they must agree who is responsible for which
    mutex or lock. This is especially problematic for mutexes and locks in
    dynamically allocated memory. All mutexes and locks internal to the
    implementation must be locked, too. This possibly delays the thread calling
    <i>fork</i>() for a long time or even indefinitely since uses of these
    synchronization objects may not be under control of the application. A final
    problem to mention here is the problem of locking streams. At least the
    streams under control of the system (like <i>stdin</i>, <i>stdout</i>,
    <i>stderr</i>) must be protected by locking the stream with
    <i>flockfile</i>(). But the application itself could have done that,
    possibly in the same thread calling <i>fork</i>(). In this case, the process
    will deadlock.</p>
<p class="Pp">Alternatively, some libraries might have been able to supply just
    a <i>child</i> routine that reinitializes the mutexes in the library and all
    associated states to some known value (for example, what it was when the
    image was originally executed). This approach is not possible, though,
    because implementations are allowed to fail <i>*_init</i>() and
    <i>*_destroy</i>() calls for mutexes and locks if the mutex or lock is still
    locked. In this case, the <i>child</i> routine is not able to reinitialize
    the mutexes and locks.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <i>fork</i>() is called, only the calling thread is
    duplicated in the child process. Synchronization variables remain in the
    same state in the child as they were in the parent at the time <i>fork</i>()
    was called. Thus, for example, mutex locks may be held by threads that no
    longer exist in the child process, and any associated states may be
    inconsistent. The intention was that the parent process could have avoided
    this by explicit code that acquires and releases locks critical to the child
    via <i>pthread_atfork</i>(). In addition, any critical threads would have
    needed to be recreated and reinitialized to the proper state in the child
    (also via <i>pthread_atfork</i>()).</p>
<p class="Pp">A higher-level package may acquire locks on its own data
    structures before invoking lower-level packages. Under this scenario, the
    order specified for fork handler calls allows a simple rule of
    initialization for avoiding package deadlock: a package initializes all
    packages on which it depends before it calls the <i>pthread_atfork</i>()
    function for itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">As explained, there is no suitable solution for functionality
    which requires non-atomic operations to be protected through mutexes and
    locks. This is why the POSIX.1 standard since the 1996 release requires that
    the child process after <i>fork</i>() in a multi-threaded process only calls
    async-signal-safe interfaces.</p>
