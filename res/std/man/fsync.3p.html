<p class="Pp">The <i>fsync</i>() function shall request that all data for the
    open file descriptor named by <i>fildes</i> is to be transferred to the
    storage device associated with the file described by <i>fildes</i>. The
    nature of the transfer is implementation-defined. The <i>fsync</i>()
    function shall not return until the system has completed that action or
    until an error is detected.</p>
<p class="Pp">If _POSIX_SYNCHRONIZED_IO is defined, the <i>fsync</i>() function
    shall force all currently queued I/O operations associated with the file
    indicated by file descriptor <i>fildes</i> to the synchronized I/O
    completion state. All I/O operations shall be completed as defined for
    synchronized I/O file integrity completion.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="APPLICATION_USAGE"><a class="permalink" href="#APPLICATION_USAGE">APPLICATION
  USAGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <i>fsync</i>() function should be used by programs which
    require modifications to a file to be completed before continuing; for
    example, a program which contains a simple transaction facility might use it
    to ensure that all modifications to a file or files caused by a transaction
    are recorded.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="permalink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <i>fsync</i>() function is intended to force a physical write
    of data from the buffer cache, and to assure that after a system crash or
    other failure that all data up to the time of the <i>fsync</i>() call is
    recorded on the disk. Since the concepts of ``buffer cache'', ``system
    crash'', ``physical write'', and ``non-volatile storage'' are not defined
    here, the wording has to be more abstract.</p>
<p class="Pp">If _POSIX_SYNCHRONIZED_IO is not defined, the wording relies
    heavily on the conformance document to tell the user what can be expected
    from the system. It is explicitly intended that a null implementation is
    permitted. This could be valid in the case where the system cannot assure
    non-volatile storage under any circumstances or when the system is highly
    fault-tolerant and the functionality is not required. In the middle ground
    between these extremes, <i>fsync</i>() might or might not actually cause
    data to be written where it is safe from a power failure. The conformance
    document should identify at least that one configuration exists (and how to
    obtain that configuration) where this can be assured for at least some files
    that the user can select to use for critical data. It is not intended that
    an exhaustive list is required, but rather sufficient information is
    provided so that if critical data needs to be saved, the user can determine
    how the system is to be configured to allow the data to be written to
    non-volatile storage.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is reasonable to assert that the key aspects of <i>fsync</i>()
    are unreasonable to test in a test suite. That does not make the function
    any less valuable, just more difficult to test. A formal conformance test
    should probably force a system crash (power shutdown) during the test for
    this condition, but it needs to be done in such a way that automated testing
    does not require this to be done except when a formal record of the results
    is being made. It would also not be unreasonable to omit testing for
    <i>fsync</i>(), allowing it to be treated as a quality-of-implementation
    issue.</p>
