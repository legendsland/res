<p class="Pp">UTF-8 - an ASCII compatible multibyte Unicode encoding</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The Unicode 3.0 character set occupies a 16-bit code space. The
    most obvious Unicode encoding (known as UCS-2) consists of a sequence of
    16-bit words. Such strings can contain—as part of many 16-bit
    characters—bytes such as '\0' or '/', which have a special meaning in
    filenames and other C library function arguments. In addition, the majority
    of UNIX tools expect ASCII files and can't read 16-bit words as characters
    without major modifications. For these reasons, UCS-2 is not a suitable
    external encoding of Unicode in filenames, text files, environment
    variables, and so on. The ISO/IEC 10646 Universal Character Set (UCS), a
    superset of Unicode, occupies an even larger code
    space—31&nbsp;bits—and the obvious UCS-4 encoding for it (a
    sequence of 32-bit words) has the same problems.</p>
<p class="Pp">The UTF-8 encoding of Unicode and UCS does not have these problems
    and is the common way in which Unicode is used on UNIX-style operating
    systems.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Properties"><a class="permalink" href="#Properties">Properties</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The UTF-8 encoding has the following nice properties:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>*</dt>
  <dd>UCS characters 0x00000000 to 0x0000007f (the classic US-ASCII characters)
      are encoded simply as bytes 0x00 to 0x7f (ASCII compatibility). This means
      that files and strings which contain only 7-bit ASCII characters have the
      same encoding under both ASCII and UTF-8 .</dd>
  <dt>*</dt>
  <dd>All UCS characters greater than 0x7f are encoded as a multibyte sequence
      consisting only of bytes in the range 0x80 to 0xfd, so no ASCII byte can
      appear as part of another character and there are no problems with, for
      example, '\0' or '/'.</dd>
  <dt>*</dt>
  <dd>The lexicographic sorting order of UCS-4 strings is preserved.</dd>
  <dt>*</dt>
  <dd>All possible 2^31 UCS codes can be encoded using UTF-8.</dd>
  <dt>*</dt>
  <dd>The bytes 0xc0, 0xc1, 0xfe, and 0xff are never used in the UTF-8
    encoding.</dd>
  <dt>*</dt>
  <dd>The first byte of a multibyte sequence which represents a single non-ASCII
      UCS character is always in the range 0xc2 to 0xfd and indicates how long
      this multibyte sequence is. All further bytes in a multibyte sequence are
      in the range 0x80 to 0xbf. This allows easy resynchronization and makes
      the encoding stateless and robust against missing bytes.</dd>
  <dt>*</dt>
  <dd>UTF-8 encoded UCS characters may be up to six bytes long, however the
      Unicode standard specifies no characters above 0x10ffff, so Unicode
      characters can be only up to four bytes long in UTF-8.</dd>
</dl>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Encoding"><a class="permalink" href="#Encoding">Encoding</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The following byte sequences are used to represent a character.
    The sequence to be used depends on the UCS code number of the character:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>0x00000000 - 0x0000007F:</dt>
  <dd>0<i>xxxxxxx</i></dd>
  <dt>0x00000080 - 0x000007FF:</dt>
  <dd>110<i>xxxxx</i> 10<i>xxxxxx</i></dd>
  <dt>0x00000800 - 0x0000FFFF:</dt>
  <dd>1110<i>xxxx</i> 10<i>xxxxxx</i> 10<i>xxxxxx</i></dd>
  <dt>0x00010000 - 0x001FFFFF:</dt>
  <dd>11110<i>xxx</i> 10<i>xxxxxx</i> 10<i>xxxxxx</i> 10<i>xxxxxx</i></dd>
  <dt>0x00200000 - 0x03FFFFFF:</dt>
  <dd>111110<i>xx</i> 10<i>xxxxxx</i> 10<i>xxxxxx</i> 10<i>xxxxxx</i>
      10<i>xxxxxx</i></dd>
  <dt>0x04000000 - 0x7FFFFFFF:</dt>
  <dd>1111110<i>x</i> 10<i>xxxxxx</i> 10<i>xxxxxx</i> 10<i>xxxxxx</i>
      10<i>xxxxxx</i> 10<i>xxxxxx</i></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The <i>xxx</i> bit positions are filled with the bits of the
    character code number in binary representation, most significant bit first
    (big-endian). Only the shortest possible multibyte sequence which can
    represent the code number of the character can be used.</p>
<p class="Pp">The UCS code values 0xd800–0xdfff (UTF-16 surrogates) as
    well as 0xfffe and 0xffff (UCS noncharacters) should not appear in
    conforming UTF-8 streams. According to RFC 3629 no point above U+10FFFF
    should be used, which limits characters to four bytes.</p>

<p class="Pp">Users have to select a UTF-8 locale, for example with</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">export LANG=en_GB.UTF-8</div>
<p class="Pp">in order to activate the UTF-8 support in applications.</p>
<p class="Pp">Application software that has to be aware of the used character
    encoding should always set the locale with for example</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">setlocale(LC_CTYPE, "")</div>
<p class="Pp">and programmers can then test the expression</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">strcmp(nl_langinfo(CODESET), "UTF-8") ==
  0</div>
<p class="Pp">to determine whether a UTF-8 locale has been selected and whether
    therefore all plaintext standard input and output, terminal communication,
    plaintext file content, filenames, and environment variables are encoded in
    UTF-8.</p>
<p class="Pp">Programmers accustomed to single-byte encodings such as US-ASCII
    or ISO 8859 have to be aware that two assumptions made so far are no longer
    valid in UTF-8 locales. Firstly, a single byte does not necessarily
    correspond any more to a single character. Secondly, since modern terminal
    emulators in UTF-8 mode also support Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
    double-width characters as well as nonspacing combining characters,
    outputting a single character does not necessarily advance the cursor by one
    position as it did in ASCII. Library functions such as <b>mbsrtowcs</b>(3)
    and <b>wcswidth</b>(3) should be used today to count characters and cursor
    positions.</p>
<p class="Pp">The official ESC sequence to switch from an ISO 2022 encoding
    scheme (as used for instance by VT100 terminals) to UTF-8 is ESC % G
    ("\x1b%G"). The corresponding return sequence from UTF-8 to ISO
    2022 is ESC % @ ("\x1b%@"). Other ISO 2022 sequences (such as for
    switching the G0 and G1 sets) are not applicable in UTF-8 mode.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Security"><a class="permalink" href="#Security">Security</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The Unicode and UCS standards require that producers of UTF-8
    shall use the shortest form possible, for example, producing a two-byte
    sequence with first byte 0xc0 is nonconforming. Unicode 3.1 has added the
    requirement that conforming programs must not accept non-shortest forms in
    their input. This is for security reasons: if user input is checked for
    possible security violations, a program might check only for the ASCII
    version of "/../" or ";" or NUL and overlook that there
    are many non-ASCII ways to represent these things in a non-shortest UTF-8
    encoding.</p>
