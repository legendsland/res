<p class="Pp">The <i>read</i>() function shall attempt to read <i>nbyte</i>
    bytes from the file associated with the open file descriptor, <i>fildes</i>,
    into the buffer pointed to by <i>buf</i>. The behavior of multiple
    concurrent reads on the same pipe, FIFO, or terminal device is
  unspecified.</p>
<p class="Pp">Before any action described below is taken, and if <i>nbyte</i> is
    zero, the <i>read</i>() function may detect and return errors as described
    below. In the absence of errors, or if error detection is not performed, the
    <i>read</i>() function shall return zero and have no other results.</p>
<p class="Pp">On files that support seeking (for example, a regular file), the
    <i>read</i>() shall start at a position in the file given by the file offset
    associated with <i>fildes</i>. The file offset shall be incremented by the
    number of bytes actually read.</p>
<p class="Pp">Files that do not support seeking—for example,
    terminals—always read from the current position. The value of a file
    offset associated with such a file is undefined.</p>
<p class="Pp">No data transfer shall occur past the current end-of-file. If the
    starting position is at or after the end-of-file, 0 shall be returned. If
    the file refers to a device special file, the result of subsequent
    <i>read</i>() requests is implementation-defined.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the value of <i>nbyte</i> is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the
    result is implementation-defined.</p>
<p class="Pp">When attempting to read from an empty pipe or FIFO:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>If no process has the pipe open for writing, <i>read</i>() shall return 0
      to indicate end-of-file.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>If some process has the pipe open for writing and O_NONBLOCK is set,
      <i>read</i>() shall return -1 and set <i>errno</i> to
    <b>[EAGAIN]</b>.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>If some process has the pipe open for writing and O_NONBLOCK is clear,
      <i>read</i>() shall block the calling thread until some data is written or
      the pipe is closed by all processes that had the pipe open for
    writing.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">When attempting to read a file (other than a pipe or FIFO) that
    supports non-blocking reads and has no data currently available:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>If O_NONBLOCK is set, <i>read</i>() shall return -1 and set <i>errno</i>
      to <b>[EAGAIN]</b>.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>If O_NONBLOCK is clear, <i>read</i>() shall block the calling thread until
      some data becomes available.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>The use of the O_NONBLOCK flag has no effect if there is some data
      available.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The <i>read</i>() function reads data previously written to a
    file. If any portion of a regular file prior to the end-of-file has not been
    written, <i>read</i>() shall return bytes with value 0. For example,
    <i>lseek</i>() allows the file offset to be set beyond the end of existing
    data in the file. If data is later written at this point, subsequent reads
    in the gap between the previous end of data and the newly written data shall
    return bytes with value 0 until data is written into the gap.</p>
<p class="Pp">Upon successful completion, where <i>nbyte</i> is greater than 0,
    <i>read</i>() shall mark for update the last data access timestamp of the
    file, and shall return the number of bytes read. This number shall never be
    greater than <i>nbyte</i>. The value returned may be less than <i>nbyte</i>
    if the number of bytes left in the file is less than <i>nbyte</i>, if the
    <i>read</i>() request was interrupted by a signal, or if the file is a pipe
    or FIFO or special file and has fewer than <i>nbyte</i> bytes immediately
    available for reading. For example, a <i>read</i>() from a file associated
    with a terminal may return one typed line of data.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a <i>read</i>() is interrupted by a signal before it reads any
    data, it shall return -1 with <i>errno</i> set to <b>[EINTR]</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a <i>read</i>() is interrupted by a signal after it has
    successfully read some data, it shall return the number of bytes read.</p>
<p class="Pp">For regular files, no data transfer shall occur past the offset
    maximum established in the open file description associated with
    <i>fildes</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>fildes</i> refers to a socket, <i>read</i>() shall be
    equivalent to <i>recv</i>() with no flags set.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the O_DSYNC and O_RSYNC bits have been set, read I/O operations
    on the file descriptor shall complete as defined by synchronized I/O data
    integrity completion. If the O_SYNC and O_RSYNC bits have been set, read I/O
    operations on the file descriptor shall complete as defined by synchronized
    I/O file integrity completion.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>fildes</i> refers to a shared memory object, the result of
    the <i>read</i>() function is unspecified.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>fildes</i> refers to a typed memory object, the result of
    the <i>read</i>() function is unspecified.</p>
<p class="Pp">A <i>read</i>() from a STREAMS file can read data in three
    different modes: <i>byte-stream</i> mode, <i>message-nondiscard</i> mode,
    and <i>message-discard</i> mode. The default shall be byte-stream mode. This
    can be changed using the I_SRDOPT <i>ioctl</i>() request, and can be tested
    with I_GRDOPT <i>ioctl</i>(). In byte-stream mode, <i>read</i>() shall
    retrieve data from the STREAM until as many bytes as were requested are
    transferred, or until there is no more data to be retrieved. Byte-stream
    mode ignores message boundaries.</p>
<p class="Pp">In STREAMS message-nondiscard mode, <i>read</i>() shall retrieve
    data until as many bytes as were requested are transferred, or until a
    message boundary is reached. If <i>read</i>() does not retrieve all the data
    in a message, the remaining data shall be left on the STREAM, and can be
    retrieved by the next <i>read</i>() call. Message-discard mode also
    retrieves data until as many bytes as were requested are transferred, or a
    message boundary is reached. However, unread data remaining in a message
    after the <i>read</i>() returns shall be discarded, and shall not be
    available for a subsequent <i>read</i>(), <i>getmsg</i>(), or
    <i>getpmsg</i>() call.</p>
<p class="Pp">How <i>read</i>() handles zero-byte STREAMS messages is determined
    by the current read mode setting. In byte-stream mode, <i>read</i>() shall
    accept data until it has read <i>nbyte</i> bytes, or until there is no more
    data to read, or until a zero-byte message block is encountered. The
    <i>read</i>() function shall then return the number of bytes read, and place
    the zero-byte message back on the STREAM to be retrieved by the next
    <i>read</i>(), <i>getmsg</i>(), or <i>getpmsg</i>(). In message-nondiscard
    mode or message-discard mode, a zero-byte message shall return 0 and the
    message shall be removed from the STREAM. When a zero-byte message is read
    as the first message on a STREAM, the message shall be removed from the
    STREAM and 0 shall be returned, regardless of the read mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">A <i>read</i>() from a STREAMS file shall return the data in the
    message at the front of the STREAM head read queue, regardless of the
    priority band of the message.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, STREAMs are in control-normal mode, in which a
    <i>read</i>() from a STREAMS file can only process messages that contain a
    data part but do not contain a control part. The <i>read</i>() shall fail if
    a message containing a control part is encountered at the STREAM head. This
    default action can be changed by placing the STREAM in either control-data
    mode or control-discard mode with the I_SRDOPT <i>ioctl</i>() command. In
    control-data mode, <i>read</i>() shall convert any control part to data and
    pass it to the application before passing any data part originally present
    in the same message. In control-discard mode, <i>read</i>() shall discard
    message control parts but return to the process any data part in the
    message.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition, <i>read</i>() shall fail if the STREAM head had
    processed an asynchronous error before the call. In this case, the value of
    <i>errno</i> shall not reflect the result of <i>read</i>(), but reflect the
    prior error. If a hangup occurs on the STREAM being read, <i>read</i>()
    shall continue to operate normally until the STREAM head read queue is
    empty. Thereafter, it shall return 0.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>pread</i>() function shall be equivalent to <i>read</i>(),
    except that it shall read from a given position in the file without changing
    the file offset. The first three arguments to <i>pread</i>() are the same as
    <i>read</i>() with the addition of a fourth argument <i>offset</i> for the
    desired position inside the file. An attempt to perform a <i>pread</i>() on
    a file that is incapable of seeking shall result in an error.</p>

<p class="Pp">This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify the value of
    the file offset after an error is returned; there are too many cases. For
    programming errors, such as <b>[EBADF]</b>, the concept is meaningless since
    no file is involved. For errors that are detected immediately, such as
    <b>[EAGAIN]</b>, clearly the offset should not change. After an interrupt or
    hardware error, however, an updated value would be very useful and is the
    behavior of many implementations.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that a <i>read</i>() of zero bytes does not modify the last
    data access timestamp. A <i>read</i>() that requests more than zero bytes,
    but returns zero, is required to modify the last data access timestamp.</p>
<p class="Pp">Implementations are allowed, but not required, to perform error
    checking for <i>read</i>() requests of zero bytes.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Input_and_Output"><a class="permalink" href="#Input_and_Output">Input
  and Output</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The use of I/O with large byte counts has always presented
    problems. Ideas such as <i>lread</i>() and <i>lwrite</i>() (using and
    returning <b>long</b>s) were considered at one time. The current solution is
    to use abstract types on the ISO&nbsp;C standard function to <i>read</i>()
    and <i>write</i>(). The abstract types can be declared so that existing
    functions work, but can also be declared so that larger types can be
    represented in future implementations. It is presumed that whatever
    constraints limit the maximum range of <b>size_t</b> also limit portable I/O
    requests to the same range. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 also limits
    the range further by requiring that the byte count be limited so that a
    signed return value remains meaningful. Since the return type is also a
    (signed) abstract type, the byte count can be defined by the implementation
    to be larger than an <b>int</b> can hold.</p>
<p class="Pp">The standard developers considered adding atomicity requirements
    to a pipe or FIFO, but recognized that due to the nature of pipes and FIFOs
    there could be no guarantee of atomicity of reads of {PIPE_BUF} or any other
    size that would be an aid to applications portability.</p>
<p class="Pp">This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires that no action be
    taken for <i>read</i>() or <i>write</i>() when <i>nbyte</i> is zero. This is
    not intended to take precedence over detection of errors (such as invalid
    buffer pointers or file descriptors). This is consistent with the rest of
    this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, but the phrasing here could be misread
    to require detection of the zero case before any other errors. A value of
    zero is to be considered a correct value, for which the semantics are a
    no-op.</p>
<p class="Pp">I/O is intended to be atomic to ordinary files and pipes and
    FIFOs. Atomic means that all the bytes from a single operation that started
    out together end up together, without interleaving from other I/O
    operations. It is a known attribute of terminals that this is not honored,
    and terminals are explicitly (and implicitly permanently) excepted, making
    the behavior unspecified. The behavior for other device types is also left
    unspecified, but the wording is intended to imply that future standards
    might choose to specify atomicity (or not).</p>
<p class="Pp">There were recommendations to add format parameters to
    <i>read</i>() and <i>write</i>() in order to handle networked transfers
    among heterogeneous file system and base hardware types. Such a facility may
    be required for support by the OSI presentation of layer services. However,
    it was determined that this should correspond with similar C-language
    facilities, and that is beyond the scope of this volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017. The concept was suggested to the developers of the
    ISO&nbsp;C standard for their consideration as a possible area for future
    work.</p>
<p class="Pp">In 4.3 BSD, a <i>read</i>() or <i>write</i>() that is interrupted
    by a signal before transferring any data does not by default return an
    <b>[EINTR]</b> error, but is restarted. In 4.2 BSD, 4.3 BSD, and the Eighth
    Edition, there is an additional function, <i>select</i>(), whose purpose is
    to pause until specified activity (data to read, space to write, and so on)
    is detected on specified file descriptors. It is common in applications
    written for those systems for <i>select</i>() to be used before
    <i>read</i>() in situations (such as keyboard input) where interruption of
    I/O due to a signal is desired.</p>
<p class="Pp">The issue of which files or file types are interruptible is
    considered an implementation design issue. This is often affected primarily
    by hardware and reliability issues.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are no references to actions taken following an
    ``unrecoverable error''. It is considered beyond the scope of this volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017 to describe what happens in the case of hardware
  errors.</p>
<p class="Pp">Earlier versions of this standard allowed two very different
    behaviors with regard to the handling of interrupts. In order to minimize
    the resulting confusion, it was decided that POSIX.1‐2008 should
    support only one of these behaviors. Historical practice on AT&amp;T-derived
    systems was to have <i>read</i>() and <i>write</i>() return -1 and set
    <i>errno</i> to <b>[EINTR]</b> when interrupted after some, but not all, of
    the data requested had been transferred. However, the US Department of
    Commerce FIPS 151‐1 and FIPS 151‐2 require the historical BSD
    behavior, in which <i>read</i>() and <i>write</i>() return the number of
    bytes actually transferred before the interrupt. If -1 is returned when any
    data is transferred, it is difficult to recover from the error on a seekable
    device and impossible on a non-seekable device. Most new implementations
    support this behavior. The behavior required by POSIX.1‐2008 is to
    return the number of bytes transferred.</p>
<p class="Pp">POSIX.1‐2008 does not specify when an implementation that
    buffers <i>read</i>()s actually moves the data into the user-supplied
    buffer, so an implementation may choose to do this at the latest possible
    moment. Therefore, an interrupt arriving earlier may not cause <i>read</i>()
    to return a partial byte count, but rather to return -1 and set <i>errno</i>
    to <b>[EINTR]</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Consideration was also given to combining the two previous
    options, and setting <i>errno</i> to <b>[EINTR]</b> while returning a short
    count. However, not only is there no existing practice that implements this,
    it is also contradictory to the idea that when <i>errno</i> is set, the
    function responsible shall return -1.</p>
<p class="Pp">This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 intentionally does not specify
    any <i>pread</i>() errors related to pipes, FIFOs, and sockets other than
    <b>[ESPIPE]</b>.</p>
