<p class="Pp">The <i>find</i> utility shall recursively descend the directory
    hierarchy from each file specified by <i>path</i>, evaluating a Boolean
    expression composed of the primaries described in the OPERANDS section for
    each file encountered. Each <i>path</i> operand shall be evaluated unaltered
    as it was provided, including all trailing &lt;slash&gt; characters; all
    pathnames for other files encountered in the hierarchy shall consist of the
    concatenation of the current <i>path</i> operand, a &lt;slash&gt; if the
    current <i>path</i> operand did not end in one, and the filename relative to
    the <i>path</i> operand. The relative portion shall contain no dot or
    dot-dot components, no trailing &lt;slash&gt; characters, and only single
    &lt;slash&gt; characters between pathname components.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>find</i> utility shall be able to descend to arbitrary
    depths in a file hierarchy and shall not fail due to path length limitations
    (unless a <i>path</i> operand specified by the application exceeds
    {PATH_MAX} requirements).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>find</i> utility shall detect infinite loops; that is,
    entering a previously visited directory that is an ancestor of the last file
    encountered. When it detects an infinite loop, <i>find</i> shall write a
    diagnostic message to standard error and shall either recover its position
    in the hierarchy or terminate.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a file is removed from or added to the directory hierarchy
    being searched it is unspecified whether or not <i>find</i> includes that
    file in its search.</p>

<p class="Pp">Specifying more than one of the mutually-exclusive options
    <b>-H</b> and <b>-L</b> shall not be considered an error. The last option

<p class="Pp">The <b>-a</b> operator was retained as an optional operator for
    compatibility with historical shell scripts, even though it is redundant
    with expression concatenation.</p>
<p class="Pp">The descriptions of the <b>'-'</b> modifier on the <i>mode</i> and
    <i>onum</i> arguments to the <b>-perm</b> primary agree with historical
    practice on BSD and System V implementations. System V and BSD documentation
    both describe it in terms of checking additional bits; in fact, it uses the
    same bits, but checks for having at least all of the matching bits set
    instead of having exactly the matching bits set.</p>
<p class="Pp">The exact format of the interactive prompts is unspecified. Only
    the general nature of the contents of prompts are specified because:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>Implementations may desire more descriptive prompts than those used on
      historical implementations.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>Since the historical prompt strings do not terminate with &lt;newline&gt;
      characters, there is no portable way for another program to interact with
      the prompts of this utility via pipes.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Therefore, an application using this prompting option relies on
    the system to provide the most suitable dialog directly with the user, based
    on the general guidelines specified.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-name</b> <i>file</i> operand was changed to use the shell
    pattern matching notation so that <i>find</i> is consistent with other
    utilities using pattern matching.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-size</b> operand refers to the size of a file, rather than
    the number of blocks it may occupy in the file system. The intent is that
    the <i>st_size</i> field defined in the System Interfaces volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017 should be used, not the <i>st_blocks</i> found in
    historical implementations. There are at least two reasons for this:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> 1.</dt>
  <dd>In both System V and BSD, <i>find</i> only uses <i>st_size</i> in size
      calculations for the operands specified by this volume of
      POSIX.1‐2017. (BSD uses <i>st_blocks</i> only when processing the
      <b>-ls</b> primary.)</dd>
  <dt> 2.</dt>
  <dd>Users usually think of file size in terms of bytes, which is also the unit
      used by the <i>ls</i> utility for the output from the <b>-l</b> option.
      (In both System V and BSD, <i>ls</i> uses <i>st_size</i> for the <b>-l</b>
      option size field and uses <i>st_blocks</i> for the <i>ls</i> <b>-s</b>
      calculations. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify
      <i>ls</i> <b>-s</b>.)</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The descriptions of <b>-atime</b>, <b>-ctime</b>, and
    <b>-mtime</b> were changed from the SVID description of <i>n</i> ``days'' to
    <i>n</i> being the result of the integer division of the time difference in
    seconds by 86400. The description is also different in terms of the exact
    timeframe for the <i>n</i> case (<i>versus</i> the <i>+n</i> or <i>-n</i>),
    but it matches all known historical implementations. It refers to one 86400
    second period in the past, not any time from the beginning of that period to
    the current time. For example, <b>-atime</b> 2 is true if the file was
    accessed any time in the period from 72 hours to 48 hours ago.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historical implementations do not modify <b>"{}"</b>
    when it appears as a substring of an <b>-exec</b> or <b>-ok</b>
    <i>utility_name</i> or argument string. There have been numerous user
    requests for this extension, so this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 allows
    the desired behavior. At least one recent implementation does support this
    feature, but encountered several problems in managing memory allocation and
    dealing with multiple occurrences of <b>"{}"</b> in a string while
    it was being developed, so it is not yet required behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">Assuming the presence of <b>-print</b> was added to correct a
    historical pitfall that plagues novice users, it is entirely
    upwards-compatible from the historical System V <i>find</i> utility. In its
    simplest form (<i>find</i> <i>directory</i>), it could be confused with the
    historical BSD fast <i>find</i>. The BSD developers agreed that adding
    <b>-print</b> as a default expression was the correct decision and have
    added the fast <i>find</i> functionality within a new utility called
    <i>locate</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>-L</b> option was implemented using the
    primary <b>-follow</b>. The <b>-H</b> and <b>-L</b> options were added for
    two reasons. First, they offer a finer granularity of control and
    consistency with other programs that walk file hierarchies. Second, the
    <b>-follow</b> primary always evaluated to true. As they were historically
    really global variables that took effect before the traversal began, some
    valid expressions had unexpected results. An example is the expression
    <b>-print</b> <b>-o</b> <b>-follow</b>. Because <b>-print</b> always
    evaluates to true, the standard order of evaluation implies that
    <b>-follow</b> would never be evaluated. This was never the case. Historical
    practice for the <b>-follow</b> primary, however, is not consistent. Some
    implementations always follow symbolic links on the command line whether
    <b>-follow</b> is specified or not. Others follow symbolic links on the
    command line only if <b>-follow</b> is specified. Both behaviors are
    provided by the <b>-H</b> and <b>-L</b> options, but scripts using the
    current <b>-follow</b> primary would be broken if the <b>-follow</b> option
    is specified to work either way.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since the <b>-L</b> option resolves all symbolic links and the
    <b>-type</b> <i>l</i> primary is true for symbolic links that still exist
    after symbolic links have been resolved, the command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>find -L . -type l</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">prints a list of symbolic links reachable from the current
    directory that do not resolve to accessible files.</p>
<p class="Pp">A feature of SVR4's <i>find</i> utility was the <b>-exec</b>
    primary's <b>+</b> terminator. This allowed filenames containing special
    characters (especially &lt;newline&gt; characters) to be grouped together
    without the problems that occur if such filenames are piped to <i>xargs</i>.
    Other implementations have added other ways to get around this problem,
    notably a <b>-print0</b> primary that wrote filenames with a null byte
    terminator. This was considered here, but not adopted. Using a null
    terminator meant that any utility that was going to process <i>find</i>'s
    <b>-print0</b> output had to add a new option to parse the null terminators
    it would now be reading.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>"-exec</b>...<b>{}</b>+" syntax adopted was a
    result of IEEE PASC Interpretation 1003.2 #210. It should be noted that this
    is an incompatible change to IEEE&nbsp;Std 1003.2‐1992. For
    example, the following command printed all files with a <b>'-'</b> after
    their name if they are regular files, and a <b>'+'</b> otherwise:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>find / -type f -exec echo {} - ';' -o -exec echo {} + ';'</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The change invalidates usage like this. Even though the previous
    standard stated that this usage would work, in practice many did not support
    it and the standard developers felt it better to now state that this was not
    allowable.</p>
