<p class="Pp">The <b>-h</b> option was omitted because it was insufficiently
    specified and does not add to applications portability.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historical implementations employ algorithms that do not always
    produce a minimum list of differences; the current language about making
    every effort is the best this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 can do, as there
    is no metric that could be employed to judge the quality of implementations
    against any and all file contents. The statement ``This list should be
    minimal'' clearly implies that implementations are not expected to provide
    the following output when comparing two 100-line files that differ in only
    one character on a single line:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>1,100c1,100
all 100 lines from file1 preceded with "&lt; "
---
all 100 lines from file2 preceded with "&gt; "</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The ``Only in'' messages required when the <b>-r</b> option is
    specified are not used by most historical implementations if the <b>-e</b>
    option is also specified. It is required here because it provides useful
    information that must be provided to update a target directory hierarchy to
    match a source hierarchy. The ``Common subdirectories'' messages are written
    by System V and 4.3 BSD when the <b>-r</b> option is specified. They are
    allowed here but are not required because they are reporting on something
    that is the same, not reporting a difference, and are not needed to update a
    target hierarchy.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-c</b> option, which writes output in a format using lines
    of context, has been included. The format is useful for a variety of
    reasons, among them being much improved readability and the ability to
    understand difference changes when the target file has line numbers that
    differ from another similar, but slightly different, copy. The <i>patch</i>
    utility is most valuable when working with difference listings using a
    context format. The BSD version of <b>-c</b> takes an optional argument
    specifying the amount of context. Rather than overloading <b>-c</b> and
    breaking the Utility Syntax Guidelines for <i>diff</i>, the standard
    developers decided to add a separate option for specifying a context diff
    with a specified amount of context (<b>-C</b>). Also, the format for context
    <i>diff</i>s was extended slightly in 4.3 BSD to allow multiple changes that
    are within context lines from each other to be merged together. The output
    format contains an additional four &lt;asterisk&gt; characters after the
    range of affected lines in the first filename. This was to provide a flag
    for old programs (like old versions of <i>patch</i>) that only understand
    the old context format. The version of context described here does not
    require that multiple changes within context lines be merged, but it does
    not prohibit it either. The extension is upwards-compatible, so any vendors
    that wish to retain the old version of <i>diff</i> can do so by adding the
    extra four &lt;asterisk&gt; characters (that is, utilities that currently
    use <i>diff</i> and understand the new merged format will also understand
    the old unmerged format, but not <i>vice versa</i>).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-u</b> and <b>-U</b> options of GNU <i>diff</i> have been
    included. Their output format, designed by Wayne Davison, takes up less
    space than <b>-c</b> and <b>-C</b> format, and in many cases is easier to
    read. The format's timestamps do not vary by locale, so <i>LC_TIME</i> does
    not affect it. The format's line numbers are rendered with the <b>%1d</b>
    format, not <b>%d</b>, because the file format notation rules would allow
    extra &lt;blank&gt; characters to appear around the numbers.</p>
<p class="Pp">The substitute command was added as an additional format for the
    <b>-e</b> option. This was added to provide implementations with a way to
    fix the classic ``dot alone on a line'' bug present in many versions of
    <i>diff</i>. Since many implementations have fixed this bug, the standard
    developers decided not to standardize broken behavior, but rather to provide
    the necessary tool for fixing the bug. One way to fix this bug is to output
    two periods whenever a lone period is needed, then terminate the append
    command with a period, and then use the substitute command to convert the
    two periods into one period.</p>
<p class="Pp">The BSD-derived <b>-r</b> option was added to provide a mechanism
    for using <i>diff</i> to compare two file system trees. This behavior is
    useful, is standard practice on all BSD-derived systems, and is not easily
    reproducible with the <i>find</i> utility.</p>
<p class="Pp">The requirement that <i>diff</i> not compare files in some
    circumstances, even though they have the same name, is based on the actual
    output of historical implementations. The specified behavior precludes the
    problems arising from running into FIFOs and other files that would cause
    <i>diff</i> to hang waiting for input with no indication to the user that
    <i>diff</i> was hung. An earlier version of this standard specified the
    output format more precisely, but in practice this requirement was widely
    ignored and the benefit of standardization seemed small, so it is now
    unspecified. In most common usage, <i>diff</i> <b>-r</b> should indicate
    differences in the file hierarchies, not the difference of contents of
    devices pointed to by the hierarchies.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many early implementations of <i>diff</i> require seekable files.
    Since the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 supports named
    pipes, the standard developers decided that such a restriction was
    unreasonable. Note also that the allowed filename <b>-</b> almost always
    refers to a pipe.</p>
<p class="Pp">No directory search order is specified for <i>diff</i>. The
    historical ordering is, in fact, not optimal, in that it prints out all of
    the differences at the current level, including the statements about all
    common subdirectories before recursing into those subdirectories.</p>
<p class="Pp">The message:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>"diff %s %s %s\n", &lt;<i>diff_options</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>filename1</i>&gt;, &lt;<i>filename2</i>&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">does not vary by locale because it is the representation of a
    command, not an English sentence.</p>
