<p class="Pp">The <i>timer_create</i>() function shall create a per-process
    timer using the specified clock, <i>clock_id</i>, as the timing base. The
    <i>timer_create</i>() function shall return, in the location referenced by
    <i>timerid</i>, a timer ID of type <b>timer_t</b> used to identify the timer
    in timer requests. This timer ID shall be unique within the calling process
    until the timer is deleted. The particular clock, <i>clock_id</i>, is
    defined in <i>&lt;time.h&gt;</i>. The timer whose ID is returned shall be in
    a disarmed state upon return from <i>timer_create</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>evp</i> argument, if non-NULL, points to a <b>sigevent</b>
    structure. This structure, allocated by the application, defines the
    asynchronous notification to occur as specified in <i>Section 2.4.1</i>,
    <i>Signal Generation and Delivery</i> when the timer expires. If the
    <i>evp</i> argument is NULL, the effect is as if the <i>evp</i> argument
    pointed to a <b>sigevent</b> structure with the <i>sigev_notify</i> member
    having the value SIGEV_SIGNAL, the <i>sigev_signo</i> having a default
    signal number, and the <i>sigev_value</i> member having the value of the
    timer ID.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each implementation shall define a set of clocks that can be used
    as timing bases for per-process timers. All implementations shall support a
    <i>clock_id</i> of CLOCK_REALTIME. If the Monotonic Clock option is
    supported, implementations shall support a <i>clock_id</i> of
    CLOCK_MONOTONIC.</p>
<p class="Pp">Per-process timers shall not be inherited by a child process
    across a <i>fork</i>() and shall be disarmed and deleted by an
  <i>exec</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If _POSIX_CPUTIME is defined, implementations shall support
    <i>clock_id</i> values representing the CPU-time clock of the calling
    process.</p>
<p class="Pp">If _POSIX_THREAD_CPUTIME is defined, implementations shall support
    <i>clock_id</i> values representing the CPU-time clock of the calling
    thread.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is implementation-defined whether a <i>timer_create</i>()
    function will succeed if the value defined by <i>clock_id</i> corresponds to
    the CPU-time clock of a process or thread different from the process or
    thread invoking the function.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>evp</i>-&gt;<i>sigev_sigev_notify</i> is SIGEV_THREAD and
    <i>sev</i>-&gt;<i>sigev_notify_attributes</i> is not NULL, if the attribute
    pointed to by <i>sev</i>-&gt;<i>sigev_notify_attributes</i> has a thread
    stack address specified by a call to <i>pthread_attr_setstack</i>(), the
    results are unspecified if the signal is generated more than once.</p>

<p class="Pp">If the call succeeds, <i>timer_create</i>() shall return zero and
    update the location referenced by <i>timerid</i> to a <b>timer_t</b>, which
    can be passed to the per-process timer calls. If an error occurs, the
    function shall return a value of -1 and set <i>errno</i> to indicate the
    error. The value of <i>timerid</i> is undefined if an error occurs.</p>

<p class="Pp">If a timer is created which has
    <i>evp</i>-&gt;<i>sigev_sigev_notify</i> set to SIGEV_THREAD and the
    attribute pointed to by <i>evp</i>-&gt;<i>sigev_notify_attributes</i> has a
    thread stack address specified by a call to <i>pthread_attr_setstack</i>(),
    the memory dedicated as a thread stack cannot be recovered. The reason for
    this is that the threads created in response to a timer expiration are
    created detached, or in an unspecified way if the thread attribute's
    <i>detachstate</i> is PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE. In neither case is it valid
    to call <i>pthread_join</i>(), which makes it impossible to determine the
    lifetime of the created thread which thus means the stack memory cannot be
    reused.</p>

  Timer Overrun and Resource Allocation</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The specified timer facilities may deliver realtime signals (that
    is, queued signals) on implementations that support this option. Since
    realtime applications cannot afford to lose notifications of asynchronous
    events, like timer expirations or asynchronous I/O completions, it must be
    possible to ensure that sufficient resources exist to deliver the signal
    when the event occurs. In general, this is not a difficulty because there is
    a one-to-one correspondence between a request and a subsequent signal
    generation. If the request cannot allocate the signal delivery resources, it
    can fail the call with an <b>[EAGAIN]</b> error.</p>
<p class="Pp">Periodic timers are a special case. A single request can generate
    an unspecified number of signals. This is not a problem if the requesting
    process can service the signals as fast as they are generated, thus making
    the signal delivery resources available for delivery of subsequent periodic
    timer expiration signals. But, in general, this cannot be
    assured—processing of periodic timer signals may ``overrun''; that
    is, subsequent periodic timer expirations may occur before the currently
    pending signal has been delivered.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also, for signals, according to the POSIX.1‐1990 standard,
    if subsequent occurrences of a pending signal are generated, it is
    implementation-defined whether a signal is delivered for each occurrence.
    This is not adequate for some realtime applications. So a mechanism is
    required to allow applications to detect how many timer expirations were
    delayed without requiring an indefinite amount of system resources to store
    the delayed expirations.</p>
<p class="Pp">The specified facilities provide for an overrun count. The overrun
    count is defined as the number of extra timer expirations that occurred
    between the time a timer expiration signal is generated and the time the
    signal is delivered. The signal-catching function, if it is concerned with
    overruns, can retrieve this count on entry. With this method, a periodic
    timer only needs one ``signal queuing resource'' that can be allocated at
    the time of the <i>timer_create</i>() function call.</p>
<p class="Pp">A function is defined to retrieve the overrun count so that an
    application need not allocate static storage to contain the count, and an
    implementation need not update this storage asynchronously on timer
    expirations. But, for some high-frequency periodic applications, the
    overhead of an additional system call on each timer expiration may be
    prohibitive. The functions, as defined, permit an implementation to maintain
    the overrun count in user space, associated with the <i>timerid</i>. The
    <i>timer_getoverrun</i>() function can then be implemented as a macro that
    uses the <i>timerid</i> argument (which may just be a pointer to a user
    space structure containing the counter) to locate the overrun count with no
    system call overhead. Other implementations, less concerned with this class
    of applications, can avoid the asynchronous update of user space by
    maintaining the count in a system structure at the cost of the extra system
    call to obtain it.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Timer_Expiration_Signal_Parameters"><a class="permalink" href="#Timer_Expiration_Signal_Parameters">Timer
  Expiration Signal Parameters</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The Realtime Signals Extension option supports an
    application-specific datum that is delivered to the extended signal handler.
    This value is explicitly specified by the application, along with the signal
    number to be delivered, in a <b>sigevent</b> structure. The type of the
    application-defined value can be either an integer constant or a pointer.
    This explicit specification of the value, as opposed to always sending the
    timer ID, was selected based on existing practice.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is common practice for realtime applications (on non-POSIX
    systems or realtime extended POSIX systems) to use the parameters of event
    handlers as the case label of a switch statement or as a pointer to an
    application-defined data structure. Since <i>timer_id</i>s are dynamically
    allocated by the <i>timer_create</i>() function, they can be used for
    neither of these functions without additional application overhead in the
    signal handler; for example, to search an array of saved timer IDs to
    associate the ID with a constant or application data structure.</p>
