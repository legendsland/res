  <dd>Cut off interval output at the given year(s). Cutoff times are computed
      using the proleptic Gregorian calendar with year 0 and with Universal Time
      (UT) ignoring leap seconds. Cutoffs are at the start of each year, where
      the lower-bound timestamp is inclusive and the upper is exclusive; for
      example, <b><span class="Li">-</span>c 1970,2070</b> selects transitions
      on or after 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC and before 2070-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.

  <dd>Cut off interval output at the given time(s), given in decimal seconds
      since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The
      <i>timezone</i> determines whether the count includes leap seconds. As
      with <b><span class="Li">-</span>c</b>, the cutoff's lower bound is
      inclusive and its upper bound is exclusive.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="INTERVAL_FORMAT"><a class="permalink" href="#INTERVAL_FORMAT">INTERVAL
  FORMAT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The interval format is a compact text representation that is
    intended to be both human- and machine-readable. It consists of an empty
    line, then a line “TZ=<i>string</i>” where <i>string</i> is a
    double-quoted string giving the timezone, a second line
    “<span class="Li">-</span> <span class="Li">-</span>
    <i>interval</i>” describing the time interval before the first
    transition if any, and zero or more following lines “<i>date time
    interval</i>”, one line for each transition time and following
    interval. Fields are separated by single tabs.</p>
<p class="Pp">Dates are in <i>yyyy</i>-<i>mm</i>-<i>dd</i> format and times are
    in 24-hour <i>hh</i>:<i>mm</i>:<i>ss</i> format where <i>hh</i>&lt;24. Times
    are in local time immediately after the transition. A time interval
    description consists of a UT offset in signed ±<i>hhmmss</i> format,
    a time zone abbreviation, and an isdst flag. An abbreviation that equals the
    UT offset is omitted; other abbreviations are double-quoted strings unless
    they consist of one or more alphabetic characters. An isdst flag is omitted
    for standard time, and otherwise is a decimal integer that is unsigned and
    positive (typically 1) for daylight saving time and negative for
  unknown.</p>
<p class="Pp">In times and in UT offsets with absolute value less than 100
    hours, the seconds are omitted if they are zero, and the minutes are also
    omitted if they are also zero. Positive UT offsets are east of Greenwich.
    The UT offset <span class="Li">-</span>00 denotes a UT placeholder in areas
    where the actual offset is unspecified; by convention, this occurs when the
    UT offset is zero and the time zone abbreviation begins with
    “<span class="Li">-</span>” or is “zzz”.</p>
<p class="Pp">In double-quoted strings, escape sequences represent unusual
    characters. The escape sequences are \s for space, and \", \\, \f, \n,
    \r, \t, and \v with their usual meaning in the C programming language. E.g.,
    the double-quoted string “"CET\s\"\\"”
    represents the character sequence “CET "\”.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here is an example of the output, with the leading empty line
    omitted. (This example is shown with tab stops set far enough apart so that
    the tabbed columns line up.)</p>

Here, local time begins 10 hours, 31 minutes and 26 seconds west of UT, and is a
  standard time abbreviated LMT. Immediately after the first transition, the
  date is 1896-01-13 and the time is 12:01:26, and the following time interval
  is 10.5 hours west of UT, a standard time abbreviated HST. Immediately after
  the second transition, the date is 1933-04-30 and the time is 03:00:00 and the
  following time interval is 9.5 hours west of UT, is abbreviated HDT, and is
  daylight saving time. Immediately after the last transition the date is
  1947-06-08 and the time is 02:30:00, and the following time interval is 10
  hours west of UT, a standard time abbreviated HST.

This time zone is east of UT, so its UT offsets are positive. Also, many of its
  time zone abbreviations are omitted since they duplicate the text of the UT
  offset.

<p class="Pp">Time discontinuities are found by sampling the results returned by
    <b>localtime</b>(3) at twelve-hour intervals. This works in all real-world
    cases; one can construct artificial time zones for which this fails.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the <b><span class="Li">-</span>v</b> and
    <b><span class="Li">-</span>V</b> output, “UT” denotes the
    value returned by <b>gmtime</b>(3), which uses UTC for modern timestamps and
    some other UT flavor for timestamps that predate the introduction of UTC. No
    attempt is currently made to have the output use “UTC” for
    newer and “UT” for older timestamps, partly because the exact
    date of the introduction of UTC is problematic.</p>
