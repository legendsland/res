<p class="Pp">Extended attributes are name:value pairs associated permanently
    with files and directories, similar to the environment strings associated
    with a process. An attribute may be defined or undefined. If it is defined,
    its value may be empty or non-empty.</p>
<p class="Pp">Extended attributes are extensions to the normal attributes which
    are associated with all inodes in the system (i.e., the <b>stat</b>(2)
    data). They are often used to provide additional functionality to a
    filesystemâ€”for example, additional security features such as Access
    Control Lists (ACLs) may be implemented using extended attributes.</p>
<p class="Pp">Users with search access to a file or directory may use
    <b>listxattr</b>(2) to retrieve a list of attribute names defined for that
    file or directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">Extended attributes are accessed as atomic objects. Reading
    (<b>getxattr</b>(2)) retrieves the whole value of an attribute and stores it
    in a buffer. Writing (<b>setxattr</b>(2)) replaces any previous value with
    the new value.</p>
<p class="Pp">Space consumed for extended attributes may be counted towards the
    disk quotas of the file owner and file group.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Extended_attribute_namespaces"><a class="permalink" href="#Extended_attribute_namespaces">Extended
  attribute namespaces</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Attribute names are null-terminated strings. The attribute name is
    always specified in the fully qualified <i>namespace.attribute</i> form, for
    example, <i>user.mime_type</i>, <i>trusted.md5sum</i>,
    <i>system.posix_acl_access</i>, or <i>security.selinux</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The namespace mechanism is used to define different classes of
    extended attributes. These different classes exist for several reasons; for
    example, the permissions and capabilities required for manipulating extended
    attributes of one namespace may differ to another.</p>
<p class="Pp">Currently, the <i>security</i>, <i>system</i>, <i>trusted</i>, and
    <i>user</i> extended attribute classes are defined as described below.
    Additional classes may be added in the future.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Extended_security_attributes"><a class="permalink" href="#Extended_security_attributes">Extended
  security attributes</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The security attribute namespace is used by kernel security
    modules, such as Security Enhanced Linux, and also to implement file
    capabilities (see <b>capabilities</b>(7)). Read and write access permissions
    to security attributes depend on the policy implemented for each security
    attribute by the security module. When no security module is loaded, all
    processes have read access to extended security attributes, and write access
    is limited to processes that have the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> capability.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="System_extended_attributes"><a class="permalink" href="#System_extended_attributes">System
  extended attributes</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">System extended attributes are used by the kernel to store system
    objects such as Access Control Lists. Read and write access permissions to
    system attributes depend on the policy implemented for each system attribute
    implemented by filesystems in the kernel.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Trusted_extended_attributes"><a class="permalink" href="#Trusted_extended_attributes">Trusted
  extended attributes</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Trusted extended attributes are visible and accessible only to
    processes that have the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> capability. Attributes in this
    class are used to implement mechanisms in user space (i.e., outside the
    kernel) which keep information in extended attributes to which ordinary
    processes should not have access.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="User_extended_attributes"><a class="permalink" href="#User_extended_attributes">User
  extended attributes</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">User extended attributes may be assigned to files and directories
    for storing arbitrary additional information such as the mime type,
    character set or encoding of a file. The access permissions for user
    attributes are defined by the file permission bits: read permission is
    required to retrieve the attribute value, and writer permission is required
    to change it.</p>
<p class="Pp">The file permission bits of regular files and directories are
    interpreted differently from the file permission bits of special files and
    symbolic links. For regular files and directories the file permission bits
    define access to the file's contents, while for device special files they
    define access to the device described by the special file. The file
    permissions of symbolic links are not used in access checks. These
    differences would allow users to consume filesystem resources in a way not
    controllable by disk quotas for group or world writable special files and
    directories.</p>
<p class="Pp">For this reason, user extended attributes are allowed only for
    regular files and directories, and access to user extended attributes is
    restricted to the owner and to users with appropriate capabilities for
    directories with the sticky bit set (see the <b>chmod</b>(1) manual page for
    an explanation of the sticky bit).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Filesystem_differences"><a class="permalink" href="#Filesystem_differences">Filesystem
  differences</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The kernel and the filesystem may place limits on the maximum
    number and size of extended attributes that can be associated with a file.
    The VFS-imposed limits on attribute names and values are 255 bytes and
    64&nbsp;kB, respectively. The list of attribute names that can be returned
    is also limited to 64&nbsp;kB (see BUGS in <b>listxattr</b>(2)).</p>
<p class="Pp">Some filesystems, such as Reiserfs (and, historically, ext2 and
    ext3), require the filesystem to be mounted with the <b>user_xattr</b> mount
    option in order for user extended attributes to be used.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the current ext2, ext3, and ext4 filesystem implementations,
    the total bytes used by the names and values of all of a file's extended
    attributes must fit in a single filesystem block (1024, 2048 or 4096 bytes,
    depending on the block size specified when the filesystem was created).</p>
<p class="Pp">In the Btrfs, XFS, and Reiserfs filesystem implementations, there
    is no practical limit on the number of extended attributes associated with a
    file, and the algorithms used to store extended attribute information on
    disk are scalable.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the JFS, XFS, and Reiserfs filesystem implementations, the
    limit on bytes used in an EA value is the ceiling imposed by the VFS.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the Btrfs filesystem implementation, the total bytes used for
    the name, value, and implementation overhead bytes is limited to the
    filesystem <i>nodesize</i> value (16&nbsp;kB by default).</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="STANDARDS"><a class="permalink" href="#STANDARDS">STANDARDS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Extended attributes are not specified in POSIX.1, but some other
    systems (e.g., the BSDs and Solaris) provide a similar feature.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Since the filesystems on which extended attributes are stored
    might also be used on architectures with a different byte order and machine
    word size, care should be taken to store attribute values in an
    architecture-independent format.</p>
