<p class="Pp">The <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() and <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>()
    functions shall block on a condition variable. The application shall ensure
    that these functions are called with <i>mutex</i> locked by the calling
    thread; otherwise, an error (for PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK and robust
    mutexes) or undefined behavior (for other mutexes) results.</p>
<p class="Pp">These functions atomically release <i>mutex</i> and cause the
    calling thread to block on the condition variable <i>cond</i>; atomically
    here means ``atomically with respect to access by another thread to the
    mutex and then the condition variable''. That is, if another thread is able
    to acquire the mutex after the about-to-block thread has released it, then a
    subsequent call to <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() or
    <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() in that thread shall behave as if it were
    issued after the about-to-block thread has blocked.</p>
<p class="Pp">Upon successful return, the mutex shall have been locked and shall
    be owned by the calling thread. If <i>mutex</i> is a robust mutex where an
    owner terminated while holding the lock and the state is recoverable, the
    mutex shall be acquired even though the function returns an error code.</p>
<p class="Pp">When using condition variables there is always a Boolean predicate
    involving shared variables associated with each condition wait that is true
    if the thread should proceed. Spurious wakeups from the
    <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() or <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() functions may
    occur. Since the return from <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() or
    <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() does not imply anything about the value of this
    predicate, the predicate should be re-evaluated upon such return.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a thread waits on a condition variable, having specified a
    particular mutex to either the <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() or the
    <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() operation, a dynamic binding is formed between
    that mutex and condition variable that remains in effect as long as at least
    one thread is blocked on the condition variable. During this time, the
    effect of an attempt by any thread to wait on that condition variable using
    a different mutex is undefined. Once all waiting threads have been unblocked
    (as by the <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() operation), the next wait
    operation on that condition variable shall form a new dynamic binding with
    the mutex specified by that wait operation. Even though the dynamic binding
    between condition variable and mutex may be removed or replaced between the
    time a thread is unblocked from a wait on the condition variable and the
    time that it returns to the caller or begins cancellation cleanup, the
    unblocked thread shall always re-acquire the mutex specified in the
    condition wait operation call from which it is returning.</p>
<p class="Pp">A condition wait (whether timed or not) is a cancellation point.
    When the cancelability type of a thread is set to PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED, a
    side-effect of acting upon a cancellation request while in a condition wait
    is that the mutex is (in effect) re-acquired before calling the first
    cancellation cleanup handler. The effect is as if the thread were unblocked,
    allowed to execute up to the point of returning from the call to
    <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() or <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>(), but at that
    point notices the cancellation request and instead of returning to the
    caller of <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() or <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>(),
    starts the thread cancellation activities, which includes calling
    cancellation cleanup handlers.</p>
<p class="Pp">A thread that has been unblocked because it has been canceled
    while blocked in a call to <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() or
    <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() shall not consume any condition signal that may
    be directed concurrently at the condition variable if there are other
    threads blocked on the condition variable.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() function shall be equivalent
    to <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>(), except that an error is returned if the
    absolute time specified by <i>abstime</i> passes (that is, system time
    equals or exceeds <i>abstime</i>) before the condition <i>cond</i> is
    signaled or broadcasted, or if the absolute time specified by <i>abstime</i>
    has already been passed at the time of the call. When such timeouts occur,
    <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() shall nonetheless release and re-acquire the
    mutex referenced by <i>mutex</i>, and may consume a condition signal
    directed concurrently at the condition variable.</p>
<p class="Pp">The condition variable shall have a clock attribute which
    specifies the clock that shall be used to measure the time specified by the
    <i>abstime</i> argument. The <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() function is
    also a cancellation point.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a signal is delivered to a thread waiting for a condition
    variable, upon return from the signal handler the thread resumes waiting for
    the condition variable as if it was not interrupted, or it shall return zero
    due to spurious wakeup.</p>
<p class="Pp">The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the
    <i>cond</i> or <i>mutex</i> argument to these functions does not refer to an
    initialized condition variable or an initialized mutex object,
  respectively.</p>

<p class="Pp">Applications that have assumed that non-zero return values are
    errors will need updating for use with robust mutexes, since a valid return
    for a thread acquiring a mutex which is protecting a currently inconsistent
    state is <b>[EOWNERDEAD]</b>. Applications that do not check the error
    returns, due to ruling out the possibility of such errors arising, should
    not use robust mutexes. If an application is supposed to work with normal
    and robust mutexes, it should check all return values for error conditions
    and if necessary take appropriate action.</p>

<p class="Pp">If an implementation detects that the value specified by the

    variable, or detects that the value specified by the <i>mutex</i> argument
    to <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() or <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() does not
    refer to an initialized mutex object, it is recommended that the function
    should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL]</b> error.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Condition_Wait_Semantics"><a class="permalink" href="#Condition_Wait_Semantics">Condition
  Wait Semantics</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">It is important to note that when <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() and
    <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() return without error, the associated
    predicate may still be false. Similarly, when
    <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() returns with the timeout error, the
    associated predicate may be true due to an unavoidable race between the
    expiration of the timeout and the predicate state change.</p>
<p class="Pp">The application needs to recheck the predicate on any return
    because it cannot be sure there is another thread waiting on the thread to
    handle the signal, and if there is not then the signal is lost. The burden
    is on the application to check the predicate.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some implementations, particularly on a multi-processor, may
    sometimes cause multiple threads to wake up when the condition variable is
    signaled simultaneously on different processors.</p>
<p class="Pp">In general, whenever a condition wait returns, the thread has to
    re-evaluate the predicate associated with the condition wait to determine
    whether it can safely proceed, should wait again, or should declare a
    timeout. A return from the wait does not imply that the associated predicate
    is either true or false.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is thus recommended that a condition wait be enclosed in the
    equivalent of a ``while loop'' that checks the predicate.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Timed_Wait_Semantics"><a class="permalink" href="#Timed_Wait_Semantics">Timed
  Wait Semantics</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">An absolute time measure was chosen for specifying the timeout
    parameter for two reasons. First, a relative time measure can be easily
    implemented on top of a function that specifies absolute time, but there is
    a race condition associated with specifying an absolute timeout on top of a
    function that specifies relative timeouts. For example, assume that
    <i>clock_gettime</i>() returns the current time and
    <i>cond_relative_timed_wait</i>() uses relative timeouts:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &amp;now)
reltime = sleep_til_this_absolute_time -now;
cond_relative_timed_wait(c, m, &amp;reltime);</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If the thread is preempted between the first statement and the
    last statement, the thread blocks for too long. Blocking, however, is
    irrelevant if an absolute timeout is used. An absolute timeout also need not
    be recomputed if it is used multiple times in a loop, such as that enclosing
    a condition wait.</p>
<p class="Pp">For cases when the system clock is advanced discontinuously by an
    operator, it is expected that implementations process any timed wait
    expiring at an intervening time as if that time had actually occurred.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Cancellation_and_Condition_Wait"><a class="permalink" href="#Cancellation_and_Condition_Wait">Cancellation
  and Condition Wait</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A condition wait, whether timed or not, is a cancellation point.
    That is, the functions <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() or
    <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() are points where a pending (or concurrent)
    cancellation request is noticed. The reason for this is that an indefinite
    wait is possible at these points—whatever event is being waited for,
    even if the program is totally correct, might never occur; for example, some
    input data being awaited might never be sent. By making condition wait a
    cancellation point, the thread can be canceled and perform its cancellation
    cleanup handler even though it may be stuck in some indefinite wait.</p>
<p class="Pp">A side-effect of acting on a cancellation request while a thread
    is blocked on a condition variable is to re-acquire the mutex before calling
    any of the cancellation cleanup handlers. This is done in order to ensure
    that the cancellation cleanup handler is executed in the same state as the
    critical code that lies both before and after the call to the condition wait
    function. This rule is also required when interfacing to POSIX threads from
    languages, such as Ada or C++, which may choose to map cancellation onto a
    language exception; this rule ensures that each exception handler guarding a
    critical section can always safely depend upon the fact that the associated
    mutex has already been locked regardless of exactly where within the
    critical section the exception was raised. Without this rule, there would
    not be a uniform rule that exception handlers could follow regarding the
    lock, and so coding would become very cumbersome.</p>
<p class="Pp">Therefore, since <i>some</i> statement has to be made regarding
    the state of the lock when a cancellation is delivered during a wait, a
    definition has been chosen that makes application coding most convenient and
    error free.</p>
<p class="Pp">When acting on a cancellation request while a thread is blocked on
    a condition variable, the implementation is required to ensure that the
    thread does not consume any condition signals directed at that condition
    variable if there are any other threads waiting on that condition variable.
    This rule is specified in order to avoid deadlock conditions that could
    occur if these two independent requests (one acting on a thread and the
    other acting on the condition variable) were not processed
  independently.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Performance_of_Mutexes_and_Condition_Variables"><a class="permalink" href="#Performance_of_Mutexes_and_Condition_Variables">Performance
  of Mutexes and Condition Variables</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Mutexes are expected to be locked only for a few instructions.
    This practice is almost automatically enforced by the desire of programmers
    to avoid long serial regions of execution (which would reduce total
    effective parallelism).</p>
<p class="Pp">When using mutexes and condition variables, one tries to ensure
    that the usual case is to lock the mutex, access shared data, and unlock the
    mutex. Waiting on a condition variable should be a relatively rare
    situation. For example, when implementing a read-write lock, code that
    acquires a read-lock typically needs only to increment the count of readers
    (under mutual-exclusion) and return. The calling thread would actually wait
    on the condition variable only when there is already an active writer. So
    the efficiency of a synchronization operation is bounded by the cost of
    mutex lock/unlock and not by condition wait. Note that in the usual case
    there is no context switch.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is not to say that the efficiency of condition waiting is
    unimportant. Since there needs to be at least one context switch per Ada
    rendezvous, the efficiency of waiting on a condition variable is important.
    The cost of waiting on a condition variable should be little more than the
    minimal cost for a context switch plus the time to unlock and lock the
    mutex.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Features_of_Mutexes_and_Condition_Variables"><a class="permalink" href="#Features_of_Mutexes_and_Condition_Variables">Features
  of Mutexes and Condition Variables</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">It had been suggested that the mutex acquisition and release be
    decoupled from condition wait. This was rejected because it is the combined
    nature of the operation that, in fact, facilitates realtime implementations.
    Those implementations can atomically move a high-priority thread between the
    condition variable and the mutex in a manner that is transparent to the
    caller. This can prevent extra context switches and provide more
    deterministic acquisition of a mutex when the waiting thread is signaled.
    Thus, fairness and priority issues can be dealt with directly by the
    scheduling discipline. Furthermore, the current condition wait operation
    matches existing practice.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Scheduling_Behavior_of_Mutexes_and_Condition_Variables"><a class="permalink" href="#Scheduling_Behavior_of_Mutexes_and_Condition_Variables">Scheduling
  Behavior of Mutexes and Condition Variables</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Synchronization primitives that attempt to interfere with
    scheduling policy by specifying an ordering rule are considered undesirable.
    Threads waiting on mutexes and condition variables are selected to proceed
    in an order dependent upon the scheduling policy rather than in some fixed
    order (for example, FIFO or priority). Thus, the scheduling policy
    determines which thread(s) are awakened and allowed to proceed.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Timed_Condition_Wait"><a class="permalink" href="#Timed_Condition_Wait">Timed
  Condition Wait</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() function allows an application
    to give up waiting for a particular condition after a given amount of time.
    An example of its use follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>(void) pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;t.mn);
<br>
    t.waiters++;
<br>
    clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &amp;ts);
<br>
    ts.tv_sec += 5;
<br>
    rc = 0;
<br>
    while (! mypredicate(&amp;t) &amp;&amp; rc == 0)
<br>
        rc = pthread_cond_timedwait(&amp;t.cond, &amp;t.mn, &amp;ts);
<br>
    t.waiters--;
<br>
    if (rc == 0 || mypredicate(&amp;t))
<br>
        setmystate(&amp;t);
(void) pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;t.mn);</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">By making the timeout parameter absolute, it does not need to be
    recomputed each time the program checks its blocking predicate. If the
    timeout was relative, it would have to be recomputed before each call. This
    would be especially difficult since such code would need to take into
    account the possibility of extra wakeups that result from extra broadcasts
    or signals on the condition variable that occur before either the predicate
    is true or the timeout is due.</p>
