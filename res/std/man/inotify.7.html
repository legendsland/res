<p class="Pp">inotify - monitoring filesystem events</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <i>inotify</i> API provides a mechanism for monitoring
    filesystem events. Inotify can be used to monitor individual files, or to
    monitor directories. When a directory is monitored, inotify will return
    events for the directory itself, and for files inside the directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following system calls are used with this API:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd><b>inotify_init</b>(2) creates an inotify instance and returns a file
      descriptor referring to the inotify instance. The more recent
      <b>inotify_init1</b>(2) is like <b>inotify_init</b>(2), but has a
      <i>flags</i> argument that provides access to some extra
    functionality.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd><b>inotify_add_watch</b>(2) manipulates the "watch list"
      associated with an inotify instance. Each item ("watch") in the
      watch list specifies the pathname of a file or directory, along with some
      set of events that the kernel should monitor for the file referred to by
      that pathname. <b>inotify_add_watch</b>(2) either creates a new watch
      item, or modifies an existing watch. Each watch has a unique "watch
      descriptor", an integer returned by <b>inotify_add_watch</b>(2) when
      the watch is created.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>When events occur for monitored files and directories, those events are
      made available to the application as structured data that can be read from
      the inotify file descriptor using <b>read</b>(2) (see below).</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd><b>inotify_rm_watch</b>(2) removes an item from an inotify watch
    list.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>When all file descriptors referring to an inotify instance have been
      closed (using <b>close</b>(2)), the underlying object and its resources
      are freed for reuse by the kernel; all associated watches are
      automatically freed.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">With careful programming, an application can use inotify to
    efficiently monitor and cache the state of a set of filesystem objects.
    However, robust applications should allow for the fact that bugs in the
    monitoring logic or races of the kind described below may leave the cache
    inconsistent with the filesystem state. It is probably wise to do some
    consistency checking, and rebuild the cache when inconsistencies are
    detected.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Reading_events_from_an_inotify_file_descriptor"><a class="permalink" href="#Reading_events_from_an_inotify_file_descriptor">Reading
  events from an inotify file descriptor</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">To determine what events have occurred, an application
    <b>read</b>(2)s from the inotify file descriptor. If no events have so far
    occurred, then, assuming a blocking file descriptor, <b>read</b>(2) will
    block until at least one event occurs (unless interrupted by a signal, in
    which case the call fails with the error <b>EINTR</b>; see
    <b>signal</b>(7)).</p>
<p class="Pp">Each successful <b>read</b>(2) returns a buffer containing one or
    more of the following structures:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>struct inotify_event {
<br>
    int      wd;       /* Watch descriptor */
<br>
    uint32_t mask;     /* Mask describing event */
<br>
    uint32_t cookie;   /* Unique cookie associating related
<br>
                          events (for rename(2)) */
<br>
    uint32_t len;      /* Size of <i>name</i> field */
<br>
    char     name[];   /* Optional null-terminated name */
};
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp"><i>wd</i> identifies the watch for which this event occurs. It is
    one of the watch descriptors returned by a previous call to
    <b>inotify_add_watch</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>mask</i> contains bits that describe the event that occurred
    (see below).</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>cookie</i> is a unique integer that connects related events.
    Currently, this is used only for rename events, and allows the resulting
    pair of <b>IN_MOVED_FROM</b> and <b>IN_MOVED_TO</b> events to be connected
    by the application. For all other event types, <i>cookie</i> is set to
  0.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>name</i> field is present only when an event is returned
    for a file inside a watched directory; it identifies the filename within the
    watched directory. This filename is null-terminated, and may include further
    null bytes ('\0') to align subsequent reads to a suitable address
  boundary.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>len</i> field counts all of the bytes in <i>name</i>,
    including the null bytes; the length of each <i>inotify_event</i> structure
    is thus <i>sizeof(struct inotify_event)+len</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The behavior when the buffer given to <b>read</b>(2) is too small
    to return information about the next event depends on the kernel version:
    before Linux 2.6.21, <b>read</b>(2) returns 0; since Linux 2.6.21,
    <b>read</b>(2) fails with the error <b>EINVAL</b>. Specifying a buffer of
    size</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>sizeof(struct inotify_event) + NAME_MAX + 1
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">will be sufficient to read at least one event.</p>

<p class="Pp">Inotify monitoring is inode-based: when monitoring a file (but not
    when monitoring the directory containing a file), an event can be generated
    for activity on any link to the file (in the same or a different
  directory).</p>
<p class="Pp">When monitoring a directory:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>the events marked above with an asterisk (*) can occur both for the

</dl>
<p class="Pp"><i>Note</i>: when monitoring a directory, events are not generated
    for the files inside the directory when the events are performed via a
    pathname (i.e., a link) that lies outside the monitored directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">When events are generated for objects inside a watched directory,
    the <i>name</i> field in the returned <i>inotify_event</i> structure
    identifies the name of the file within the directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>IN_ALL_EVENTS</b> macro is defined as a bit mask of all of
    the above events. This macro can be used as the <i>mask</i> argument when

<p class="Pp">Inotify file descriptors can be monitored using <b>select</b>(2),
    <b>poll</b>(2), and <b>epoll</b>(7). When an event is available, the file
    descriptor indicates as readable.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 2.6.25, signal-driven I/O notification is available
    for inotify file descriptors; see the discussion of <b>F_SETFL</b> (for
    setting the <b>O_ASYNC</b> flag), <b>F_SETOWN</b>, and <b>F_SETSIG</b> in
    <b>fcntl</b>(2). The <i>siginfo_t</i> structure (described in
    <b>sigaction</b>(2)) that is passed to the signal handler has the following
    fields set: <i>si_fd</i> is set to the inotify file descriptor number;
    <i>si_signo</i> is set to the signal number; <i>si_code</i> is set to
    <b>POLL_IN</b>; and <b>POLLIN</b> is set in <i>si_band</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If successive output inotify events produced on the inotify file
    descriptor are identical (same <i>wd</i>, <i>mask</i>, <i>cookie</i>, and
    <i>name</i>), then they are coalesced into a single event if the older event
    has not yet been read (but see BUGS). This reduces the amount of kernel
    memory required for the event queue, but also means that an application
    can't use inotify to reliably count file events.</p>
<p class="Pp">The events returned by reading from an inotify file descriptor
    form an ordered queue. Thus, for example, it is guaranteed that when
    renaming from one directory to another, events will be produced in the
    correct order on the inotify file descriptor.</p>
<p class="Pp">The set of watch descriptors that is being monitored via an
    inotify file descriptor can be viewed via the entry for the inotify file
    descriptor in the process's <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/fdinfo</i> directory. See
    <b>proc</b>(5) for further details. The <b>FIONREAD</b> <b>ioctl</b>(2)

    that triggered the inotify event. In particular, there is no easy way for a
    process that is monitoring events via inotify to distinguish events that it
    triggers itself from those that are triggered by other processes.</p>
<p class="Pp">Inotify reports only events that a user-space program triggers
    through the filesystem API. As a result, it does not catch remote events
    that occur on network filesystems. (Applications must fall back to polling
    the filesystem to catch such events.) Furthermore, various
    pseudo-filesystems such as <i>/proc</i>, <i>/sys</i>, and <i>/dev/pts</i>
    are not monitorable with inotify.</p>
<p class="Pp">The inotify API does not report file accesses and modifications
    that may occur because of <b>mmap</b>(2), <b>msync</b>(2), and
    <b>munmap</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp">The inotify API identifies affected files by filename. However, by
    the time an application processes an inotify event, the filename may already
    have been deleted or renamed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The inotify API identifies events via watch descriptors. It is the
    application's responsibility to cache a mapping (if one is needed) between
    watch descriptors and pathnames. Be aware that directory renamings may
    affect multiple cached pathnames.</p>
<p class="Pp">Inotify monitoring of directories is not recursive: to monitor
    subdirectories under a directory, additional watches must be created. This
    can take a significant amount time for large directory trees.</p>
<p class="Pp">If monitoring an entire directory subtree, and a new subdirectory
    is created in that tree or an existing directory is renamed into that tree,
    be aware that by the time you create a watch for the new subdirectory, new
    files (and subdirectories) may already exist inside the subdirectory.
    Therefore, you may want to scan the contents of the subdirectory immediately
    after adding the watch (and, if desired, recursively add watches for any
    subdirectories that it contains).</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the event queue can overflow. In this case, events are
    lost. Robust applications should handle the possibility of lost events
    gracefully. For example, it may be necessary to rebuild part or all of the
    application cache. (One simple, but possibly expensive, approach is to close
    the inotify file descriptor, empty the cache, create a new inotify file
    descriptor, and then re-create watches and cache entries for the objects to
    be monitored.)</p>
<p class="Pp">If a filesystem is mounted on top of a monitored directory, no
    event is generated, and no events are generated for objects immediately
    under the new mount point. If the filesystem is subsequently unmounted,
    events will subsequently be generated for the directory and the objects it
    contains.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Dealing_with_rename()_events"><a class="permalink" href="#Dealing_with_rename()_events">Dealing
  with rename() events</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">As noted above, the <b>IN_MOVED_FROM</b> and <b>IN_MOVED_TO</b>
    event pair that is generated by <b>rename</b>(2) can be matched up via their
    shared cookie value. However, the task of matching has some challenges.</p>
<p class="Pp">These two events are usually consecutive in the event stream
    available when reading from the inotify file descriptor. However, this is
    not guaranteed. If multiple processes are triggering events for monitored
    objects, then (on rare occasions) an arbitrary number of other events may
    appear between the <b>IN_MOVED_FROM</b> and <b>IN_MOVED_TO</b> events.
    Furthermore, it is not guaranteed that the event pair is atomically inserted
    into the queue: there may be a brief interval where the <b>IN_MOVED_FROM</b>
    has appeared, but the <b>IN_MOVED_TO</b> has not.</p>
<p class="Pp">Matching up the <b>IN_MOVED_FROM</b> and <b>IN_MOVED_TO</b> event
    pair generated by <b>rename</b>(2) is thus inherently racy. (Don't forget
    that if an object is renamed outside of a monitored directory, there may not
    even be an <b>IN_MOVED_TO</b> event.) Heuristic approaches (e.g., assume the
    events are always consecutive) can be used to ensure a match in most cases,
    but will inevitably miss some cases, causing the application to perceive the
    <b>IN_MOVED_FROM</b> and <b>IN_MOVED_TO</b> events as being unrelated. If
    watch descriptors are destroyed and re-created as a result, then those watch
    descriptors will be inconsistent with the watch descriptors in any pending
    events. (Re-creating the inotify file descriptor and rebuilding the cache
    may be useful to deal with this scenario.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Applications should also allow for the possibility that the
    <b>IN_MOVED_FROM</b> event was the last event that could fit in the buffer
    returned by the current call to <b>read</b>(2), and the accompanying
    <b>IN_MOVED_TO</b> event might be fetched only on the next <b>read</b>(2),
    which should be done with a (small) timeout to allow for the fact that
    insertion of the <b>IN_MOVED_FROM</b>+<b>IN_MOVED_TO</b> event pair is not
    atomic, and also the possibility that there may not be any
    <b>IN_MOVED_TO</b> event.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Before Linux 3.19, <b>fallocate</b>(2) did not create any inotify
    events. Since Linux 3.19, calls to <b>fallocate</b>(2) generate
    <b>IN_MODIFY</b> events.</p>
<p class="Pp">Before Linux 2.6.16, the <b>IN_ONESHOT</b> <i>mask</i> flag does
    not work.</p>
<p class="Pp">As originally designed and implemented, the <b>IN_ONESHOT</b> flag
    did not cause an <b>IN_IGNORED</b> event to be generated when the watch was
    dropped after one event. However, as an unintended effect of other changes,
    since Linux 2.6.36, an <b>IN_IGNORED</b> event is generated in this
  case.</p>
<p class="Pp">Before Linux 2.6.25, the kernel code that was intended to coalesce
    successive identical events (i.e., the two most recent events could
    potentially be coalesced if the older had not yet been read) instead checked
    if the most recent event could be coalesced with the <i>oldest</i> unread
    event.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a watch descriptor is removed by calling
    <b>inotify_rm_watch</b>(2) (or because a watch file is deleted or the
    filesystem that contains it is unmounted), any pending unread events for
    that watch descriptor remain available to read. As watch descriptors are
    subsequently allocated with <b>inotify_add_watch</b>(2), the kernel cycles
    through the range of possible watch descriptors (0 to <b>INT_MAX</b>)
    incrementally. When allocating a free watch descriptor, no check is made to
    see whether that watch descriptor number has any pending unread events in
    the inotify queue. Thus, it can happen that a watch descriptor is
    reallocated even when pending unread events exist for a previous incarnation
    of that watch descriptor number, with the result that the application might
    then read those events and interpret them as belonging to the file
    associated with the newly recycled watch descriptor. In practice, the
    likelihood of hitting this bug may be extremely low, since it requires that
    an application cycle through <b>INT_MAX</b> watch descriptors, release a
    watch descriptor while leaving unread events for that watch descriptor in
    the queue, and then recycle that watch descriptor. For this reason, and
    because there have been no reports of the bug occurring in real-world
    applications, as of Linux 3.15, no kernel changes have yet been made to
    eliminate this possible bug.</p>
