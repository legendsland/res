</section>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">For an overview of namespaces, see <b>namespaces</b>(7).</p>
<p class="Pp">PID namespaces isolate the process ID number space, meaning that
    processes in different PID namespaces can have the same PID. PID namespaces
    allow containers to provide functionality such as suspending/resuming the
    set of processes in the container and migrating the container to a new host
    while the processes inside the container maintain the same PIDs.</p>
<p class="Pp">PIDs in a new PID namespace start at 1, somewhat like a standalone
    system, and calls to <b>fork</b>(2), <b>vfork</b>(2), or <b>clone</b>(2)
    will produce processes with PIDs that are unique within the namespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">Use of PID namespaces requires a kernel that is configured with
    the <b>CONFIG_PID_NS</b> option.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The_namespace_init_process"><a class="permalink" href="#The_namespace_init_process">The
  namespace init process</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The first process created in a new namespace (i.e., the process
    created using <b>clone</b>(2) with the <b>CLONE_NEWPID</b> flag, or the
    first child created by a process after a call to <b>unshare</b>(2) using the
    <b>CLONE_NEWPID</b> flag) has the PID 1, and is the "init" process
    for the namespace (see <b>init</b>(1)). This process becomes the parent of
    any child processes that are orphaned because a process that resides in this
    PID namespace terminated (see below for further details).</p>
<p class="Pp">If the "init" process of a PID namespace terminates, the
    kernel terminates all of the processes in the namespace via a <b>SIGKILL</b>
    signal. This behavior reflects the fact that the "init" process is
    essential for the correct operation of a PID namespace. In this case, a
    subsequent <b>fork</b>(2) into this PID namespace fail with the error
    <b>ENOMEM</b>; it is not possible to create a new process in a PID namespace
    whose "init" process has terminated. Such scenarios can occur
    when, for example, a process uses an open file descriptor for a
    <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/ns/pid</i> file corresponding to a process that was in a
    namespace to <b>setns</b>(2) into that namespace after the "init"
    process has terminated. Another possible scenario can occur after a call to
    <b>unshare</b>(2): if the first child subsequently created by a
    <b>fork</b>(2) terminates, then subsequent calls to <b>fork</b>(2) fail with
    <b>ENOMEM</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Only signals for which the "init" process has
    established a signal handler can be sent to the "init" process by
    other members of the PID namespace. This restriction applies even to
    privileged processes, and prevents other members of the PID namespace from
    accidentally killing the "init" process.</p>
<p class="Pp">Likewise, a process in an ancestor namespace can—subject to
    the usual permission checks described in <b>kill</b>(2)—send signals
    to the "init" process of a child PID namespace only if the
    "init" process has established a handler for that signal. (Within
    the handler, the <i>siginfo_t</i> <i>si_pid</i> field described in
    <b>sigaction</b>(2) will be zero.) <b>SIGKILL</b> or <b>SIGSTOP</b> are
    treated exceptionally: these signals are forcibly delivered when sent from
    an ancestor PID namespace. Neither of these signals can be caught by the
    "init" process, and so will result in the usual actions associated
    with those signals (respectively, terminating and stopping the process).</p>
<p class="Pp">Starting with Linux 3.4, the <b>reboot</b>(2) system call causes a
    signal to be sent to the namespace "init" process. See
    <b>reboot</b>(2) for more details.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Nesting_PID_namespaces"><a class="permalink" href="#Nesting_PID_namespaces">Nesting
  PID namespaces</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">PID namespaces can be nested: each PID namespace has a parent,
    except for the initial ("root") PID namespace. The parent of a PID
    namespace is the PID namespace of the process that created the namespace
    using <b>clone</b>(2) or <b>unshare</b>(2). PID namespaces thus form a tree,
    with all namespaces ultimately tracing their ancestry to the root namespace.
    Since Linux 3.7, the kernel limits the maximum nesting depth for PID
    namespaces to 32.</p>
<p class="Pp">A process is visible to other processes in its PID namespace, and
    to the processes in each direct ancestor PID namespace going back to the
    root PID namespace. In this context, "visible" means that one
    process can be the target of operations by another process using system
    calls that specify a process ID. Conversely, the processes in a child PID
    namespace can't see processes in the parent and further removed ancestor
    namespaces. More succinctly: a process can see (e.g., send signals with
    <b>kill</b>(2), set nice values with <b>setpriority</b>(2), etc.) only
    processes contained in its own PID namespace and in descendants of that
    namespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">A process has one process ID in each of the layers of the PID
    namespace hierarchy in which is visible, and walking back though each direct
    ancestor namespace through to the root PID namespace. System calls that
    operate on process IDs always operate using the process ID that is visible
    in the PID namespace of the caller. A call to <b>getpid</b>(2) always
    returns the PID associated with the namespace in which the process was
    created.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some processes in a PID namespace may have parents that are
    outside of the namespace. For example, the parent of the initial process in
    the namespace (i.e., the <b>init</b>(1) process with PID 1) is necessarily
    in another namespace. Likewise, the direct children of a process that uses
    <b>setns</b>(2) to cause its children to join a PID namespace are in a
    different PID namespace from the caller of <b>setns</b>(2). Calls to
    <b>getppid</b>(2) for such processes return 0.</p>
<p class="Pp">While processes may freely descend into child PID namespaces
    (e.g., using <b>setns</b>(2) with a PID namespace file descriptor), they may
    not move in the other direction. That is to say, processes may not enter any
    ancestor namespaces (parent, grandparent, etc.). Changing PID namespaces is
    a one-way operation.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>NS_GET_PARENT</b> <b>ioctl</b>(2) operation can be used to
    discover the parental relationship between PID namespaces; see
    <b>ioctl_ns</b>(2).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="setns(2)_and_unshare(2)_semantics"><a class="permalink" href="#setns(2)_and_unshare(2)_semantics">setns(2)
  and unshare(2) semantics</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Calls to <b>setns</b>(2) that specify a PID namespace file
    descriptor and calls to <b>unshare</b>(2) with the <b>CLONE_NEWPID</b> flag
    cause children subsequently created by the caller to be placed in a
    different PID namespace from the caller. (Since Linux 4.12, that PID
    namespace is shown via the <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/ns/pid_for_children</i> file,
    as described in <b>namespaces</b>(7).) These calls do not, however, change
    the PID namespace of the calling process, because doing so would change the
    caller's idea of its own PID (as reported by <b>getpid</b>()), which would
    break many applications and libraries.</p>
<p class="Pp">To put things another way: a process's PID namespace membership is
    determined when the process is created and cannot be changed thereafter.
    Among other things, this means that the parental relationship between
    processes mirrors the parental relationship between PID namespaces: the
    parent of a process is either in the same namespace or resides in the
    immediate parent PID namespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">A process may call <b>unshare</b>(2) with the <b>CLONE_NEWPID</b>
    flag only once. After it has performed this operation, its
    <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/ns/pid_for_children</i> symbolic link will be empty
    until the first child is created in the namespace.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Adoption_of_orphaned_children"><a class="permalink" href="#Adoption_of_orphaned_children">Adoption
  of orphaned children</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When a child process becomes orphaned, it is reparented to the
    "init" process in the PID namespace of its parent (unless one of
    the nearer ancestors of the parent employed the <b>prctl</b>(2)
    <b>PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER</b> command to mark itself as the reaper of
    orphaned descendant processes). Note that because of the <b>setns</b>(2) and
    <b>unshare</b>(2) semantics described above, this may be the
    "init" process in the PID namespace that is the <i>parent</i> of
    the child's PID namespace, rather than the "init" process in the
    child's own PID namespace.</p>
</section>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Compatibility_of_CLONE_NEWPID_with_other_CLONE_*_flags"><a class="permalink" href="#Compatibility_of_CLONE_NEWPID_with_other_CLONE_*_flags">Compatibility
  of CLONE_NEWPID with other CLONE_* flags</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In current versions of Linux, <b>CLONE_NEWPID</b> can't be
    combined with <b>CLONE_THREAD</b>. Threads are required to be in the same
    PID namespace such that the threads in a process can send signals to each
    other. Similarly, it must be possible to see all of the threads of a process
    in the <b>proc</b>(5) filesystem. Additionally, if two threads were in
    different PID namespaces, the process ID of the process sending a signal
    could not be meaningfully encoded when a signal is sent (see the description
    of the <i>siginfo_t</i> type in <b>sigaction</b>(2)). Since this is computed
    when a signal is enqueued, a signal queue shared by processes in multiple
    PID namespaces would defeat that.</p>
<p class="Pp">In earlier versions of Linux, <b>CLONE_NEWPID</b> was additionally
    disallowed (failing with the error <b>EINVAL</b>) in combination with
    <b>CLONE_SIGHAND</b> (before Linux 4.3) as well as <b>CLONE_VM</b> (before
    Linux 3.12). The changes that lifted these restrictions have also been
    ported to earlier stable kernels.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="/proc_and_PID_namespaces"><a class="permalink" href="#/proc_and_PID_namespaces">/proc
  and PID namespaces</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A <i>/proc</i> filesystem shows (in the <i>/proc/</i>pid
    directories) only processes visible in the PID namespace of the process that
    performed the mount, even if the <i>/proc</i> filesystem is viewed from
    processes in other namespaces.</p>
<p class="Pp">After creating a new PID namespace, it is useful for the child to
    change its root directory and mount a new procfs instance at <i>/proc</i> so
    that tools such as <b>ps</b>(1) work correctly. If a new mount namespace is
    simultaneously created by including <b>CLONE_NEWNS</b> in the <i>flags</i>
    argument of <b>clone</b>(2) or <b>unshare</b>(2), then it isn't necessary to
    change the root directory: a new procfs instance can be mounted directly
    over <i>/proc</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">From a shell, the command to mount <i>/proc</i> is:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>$ mount -t proc proc /proc
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">Calling <b>readlink</b>(2) on the path <i>/proc/self</i> yields
    the process ID of the caller in the PID namespace of the procfs mount (i.e.,
    the PID namespace of the process that mounted the procfs). This can be
    useful for introspection purposes, when a process wants to discover its PID
    in other namespaces.</p>
