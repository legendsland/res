<p class="Pp">The <b>ptrace</b>() system call provides a means by which one
    process (the "tracer") may observe and control the execution of
    another process (the "tracee"), and examine and change the
    tracee's memory and registers. It is primarily used to implement breakpoint
    debugging and system call tracing.</p>
<p class="Pp">A tracee first needs to be attached to the tracer. Attachment and
    subsequent commands are per thread: in a multithreaded process, every thread
    can be individually attached to a (potentially different) tracer, or left
    not attached and thus not debugged. Therefore, "tracee" always
    means "(one) thread", never "a (possibly multithreaded)
    process". Ptrace commands are always sent to a specific tracee using a
    call of the form</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>ptrace(PTRACE_foo, pid, ...)
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">where <i>pid</i> is the thread ID of the corresponding Linux
    thread.</p>
<p class="Pp">(Note that in this page, a "multithreaded process" means
    a thread group consisting of threads created using the <b>clone</b>(2)
    <b>CLONE_THREAD</b> flag.)</p>
<p class="Pp">A process can initiate a trace by calling <b>fork</b>(2) and
    having the resulting child do a <b>PTRACE_TRACEME</b>, followed (typically)
    by an <b>execve</b>(2). Alternatively, one process may commence tracing
    another process using <b>PTRACE_ATTACH</b> or <b>PTRACE_SEIZE</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">While being traced, the tracee will stop each time a signal is
    delivered, even if the signal is being ignored. (An exception is
    <b>SIGKILL</b>, which has its usual effect.) The tracer will be notified at
    its next call to <b>waitpid</b>(2) (or one of the related "wait"
    system calls); that call will return a <i>status</i> value containing
    information that indicates the cause of the stop in the tracee. While the
    tracee is stopped, the tracer can use various ptrace requests to inspect and
    modify the tracee. The tracer then causes the tracee to continue, optionally
    ignoring the delivered signal (or even delivering a different signal
    instead).</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC</b> option is not in effect, all
    successful calls to <b>execve</b>(2) by the traced process will cause it to
    be sent a <b>SIGTRAP</b> signal, giving the parent a chance to gain control
    before the new program begins execution.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the tracer is finished tracing, it can cause the tracee to
    continue executing in a normal, untraced mode via <b>PTRACE_DETACH</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The value of <i>request</i> determines the action to be
  performed:</p>

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The <b>PTRACE_TRACEME</b> request is used only by the tracee; the
      remaining requests are used only by the tracer. In the following requests,
      <i>pid</i> specifies the thread ID of the tracee to be acted on. For
      requests other than <b>PTRACE_ATTACH</b>, <b>PTRACE_SEIZE</b>,
      <b>PTRACE_INTERRUPT</b>, and <b>PTRACE_KILL</b>, the tracee must be

      <b>ptrace</b>() call. Typically, the offset must be word-aligned, though

      <b>NT_PRSTATUS</b> (with numerical value 1) usually results in reading of

      and/or vector registers, they can be retrieved by setting <i>addr</i> to
      the corresponding <b>NT_foo</b> constant. <i>data</i> points to a
      <b>struct iovec</b>, which describes the destination buffer's location and

<h2 class="Ss" id="Death_under_ptrace"><a class="permalink" href="#Death_under_ptrace">Death
  under ptrace</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When a (possibly multithreaded) process receives a killing signal
    (one whose disposition is set to <b>SIG_DFL</b> and whose default action is
    to kill the process), all threads exit. Tracees report their death to their
    tracer(s). Notification of this event is delivered via
  <b>waitpid</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the killing signal will first cause signal-delivery-stop
    (on one tracee only), and only after it is injected by the tracer (or after
    it was dispatched to a thread which isn't traced), will death from the
    signal happen on <i>all</i> tracees within a multithreaded process. (The
    term "signal-delivery-stop" is explained below.)</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>SIGKILL</b> does not generate signal-delivery-stop and
    therefore the tracer can't suppress it. <b>SIGKILL</b> kills even within
    system calls (syscall-exit-stop is not generated prior to death by
    <b>SIGKILL</b>). The net effect is that <b>SIGKILL</b> always kills the
    process (all its threads), even if some threads of the process are
  ptraced.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the tracee calls <b>_exit</b>(2), it reports its death to its
    tracer. Other threads are not affected.</p>
<p class="Pp">When any thread executes <b>exit_group</b>(2), every tracee in its
    thread group reports its death to its tracer.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>PTRACE_O_TRACEEXIT</b> option is on,
    <b>PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT</b> will happen before actual death. This applies to
    exits via <b>exit</b>(2), <b>exit_group</b>(2), and signal deaths (except
    <b>SIGKILL</b>, depending on the kernel version; see BUGS below), and when
    threads are torn down on <b>execve</b>(2) in a multithreaded process.</p>
<p class="Pp">The tracer cannot assume that the ptrace-stopped tracee exists.
    There are many scenarios when the tracee may die while stopped (such as
    <b>SIGKILL</b>). Therefore, the tracer must be prepared to handle an
    <b>ESRCH</b> error on any ptrace operation. Unfortunately, the same error is
    returned if the tracee exists but is not ptrace-stopped (for commands which
    require a stopped tracee), or if it is not traced by the process which
    issued the ptrace call. The tracer needs to keep track of the
    stopped/running state of the tracee, and interpret <b>ESRCH</b> as
    "tracee died unexpectedly" only if it knows that the tracee has
    been observed to enter ptrace-stop. Note that there is no guarantee that
    <i>waitpid(WNOHANG)</i> will reliably report the tracee's death status if a
    ptrace operation returned <b>ESRCH</b>. <i>waitpid(WNOHANG)</i> may return 0
    instead. In other words, the tracee may be "not yet fully dead",
    but already refusing ptrace requests.</p>
<p class="Pp">The tracer can't assume that the tracee <i>always</i> ends its
    life by reporting <i>WIFEXITED(status)</i> or <i>WIFSIGNALED(status)</i>;
    there are cases where this does not occur. For example, if a thread other
    than thread group leader does an <b>execve</b>(2), it disappears; its PID
    will never be seen again, and any subsequent ptrace stops will be reported
    under the thread group leader's PID.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Stopped_states"><a class="permalink" href="#Stopped_states">Stopped
  states</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A tracee can be in two states: running or stopped. For the
    purposes of ptrace, a tracee which is blocked in a system call (such as
    <b>read</b>(2), <b>pause</b>(2), etc.) is nevertheless considered to be
    running, even if the tracee is blocked for a long time. The state of the
    tracee after <b>PTRACE_LISTEN</b> is somewhat of a gray area: it is not in
    any ptrace-stop (ptrace commands won't work on it, and it will deliver
    <b>waitpid</b>(2) notifications), but it also may be considered
    "stopped" because it is not executing instructions (is not
    scheduled), and if it was in group-stop before <b>PTRACE_LISTEN</b>, it will
    not respond to signals until <b>SIGCONT</b> is received.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are many kinds of states when the tracee is stopped, and in
    ptrace discussions they are often conflated. Therefore, it is important to
    use precise terms.</p>
<p class="Pp">In this manual page, any stopped state in which the tracee is
    ready to accept ptrace commands from the tracer is called
    <i>ptrace-stop</i>. Ptrace-stops can be further subdivided into
    <i>signal-delivery-stop</i>, <i>group-stop</i>, <i>syscall-stop</i>,
    <i>PTRACE_EVENT stops</i>, and so on. These stopped states are described in
    detail below.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the running tracee enters ptrace-stop, it notifies its tracer
    using <b>waitpid</b>(2) (or one of the other "wait" system calls).
    Most of this manual page assumes that the tracer waits with:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>pid = waitpid(pid_or_minus_1, &amp;status, __WALL);
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">Ptrace-stopped tracees are reported as returns with <i>pid</i>
    greater than 0 and <i>WIFSTOPPED(status)</i> true.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>__WALL</b> flag does not include the <b>WSTOPPED</b> and
    <b>WEXITED</b> flags, but implies their functionality.</p>
<p class="Pp">Setting the <b>WCONTINUED</b> flag when calling <b>waitpid</b>(2)
    is not recommended: the "continued" state is per-process and
    consuming it can confuse the real parent of the tracee.</p>
<p class="Pp">Use of the <b>WNOHANG</b> flag may cause <b>waitpid</b>(2) to
    return 0 ("no wait results available yet") even if the tracer
    knows there should be a notification. Example:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>errno = 0;
ptrace(PTRACE_CONT, pid, 0L, 0L);
if (errno == ESRCH) {
<br>
    /* tracee is dead */

}

<p class="Pp">The following kinds of ptrace-stops exist: signal-delivery-stops,
    group-stops, <b>PTRACE_EVENT</b> stops, syscall-stops. They all are reported
    by <b>waitpid</b>(2) with <i>WIFSTOPPED(status)</i> true. They may be
    differentiated by examining the value <i>status&gt;&gt;8</i>, and if there
    is ambiguity in that value, by querying <b>PTRACE_GETSIGINFO</b>. (Note: the
    <i>WSTOPSIG(status)</i> macro can't be used to perform this examination,
    because it returns the value

<p class="Pp">When a (possibly multithreaded) process receives any signal except
    <b>SIGKILL</b>, the kernel selects an arbitrary thread which handles the
    signal. (If the signal is generated with <b>tgkill</b>(2), the target thread
    can be explicitly selected by the caller.) If the selected thread is traced,
    it enters signal-delivery-stop. At this point, the signal is not yet
    delivered to the process, and can be suppressed by the tracer. If the tracer
    doesn't suppress the signal, it passes the signal to the tracee in the next
    ptrace restart request. This second step of signal delivery is called
    <i>signal injection</i> in this manual page. Note that if the signal is
    blocked, signal-delivery-stop doesn't happen until the signal is unblocked,
    with the usual exception that <b>SIGSTOP</b> can't be blocked.</p>
<p class="Pp">Signal-delivery-stop is observed by the tracer as
    <b>waitpid</b>(2) returning with <i>WIFSTOPPED(status)</i> true, with the
    signal returned by <i>WSTOPSIG(status)</i>. If the signal is <b>SIGTRAP</b>,
    this may be a different kind of ptrace-stop; see the
    "Syscall-stops" and "execve" sections below for details.
    If <i>WSTOPSIG(status)</i> returns a stopping signal, this may be a
    group-stop; see below.</p>

  injection and suppression</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">After signal-delivery-stop is observed by the tracer, the tracer
    should restart the tracee with the call</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>ptrace(PTRACE_restart, pid, 0, sig)
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">where <b>PTRACE_restart</b> is one of the restarting ptrace
    requests. If <i>sig</i> is 0, then a signal is not delivered. Otherwise, the
    signal <i>sig</i> is delivered. This operation is called <i>signal
    injection</i> in this manual page, to distinguish it from
    signal-delivery-stop.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>sig</i> value may be different from the
    <i>WSTOPSIG(status)</i> value: the tracer can cause a different signal to be
    injected.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that a suppressed signal still causes system calls to return
    prematurely. In this case, system calls will be restarted: the tracer will
    observe the tracee to reexecute the interrupted system call (or
    <b>restart_syscall</b>(2) system call for a few system calls which use a
    different mechanism for restarting) if the tracer uses
    <b>PTRACE_SYSCALL</b>. Even system calls (such as <b>poll</b>(2)) which are
    not restartable after signal are restarted after signal is suppressed;
    however, kernel bugs exist which cause some system calls to fail with
    <b>EINTR</b> even though no observable signal is injected to the tracee.</p>
<p class="Pp">Restarting ptrace commands issued in ptrace-stops other than
    signal-delivery-stop are not guaranteed to inject a signal, even if
    <i>sig</i> is nonzero. No error is reported; a nonzero <i>sig</i> may simply
    be ignored. Ptrace users should not try to "create a new signal"
    this way: use <b>tgkill</b>(2) instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">The fact that signal injection requests may be ignored when
    restarting the tracee after ptrace stops that are not signal-delivery-stops
    is a cause of confusion among ptrace users. One typical scenario is that the
    tracer observes group-stop, mistakes it for signal-delivery-stop, restarts
    the tracee with</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>ptrace(PTRACE_restart, pid, 0, stopsig)
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">with the intention of injecting <i>stopsig</i>, but <i>stopsig</i>
    gets ignored and the tracee continues to run.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>SIGCONT</b> signal has a side effect of waking up (all
    threads of) a group-stopped process. This side effect happens before
    signal-delivery-stop. The tracer can't suppress this side effect (it can
    only suppress signal injection, which only causes the <b>SIGCONT</b> handler
    to not be executed in the tracee, if such a handler is installed). In fact,
    waking up from group-stop may be followed by signal-delivery-stop for
    signal(s) <i>other than</i> <b>SIGCONT</b>, if they were pending when
    <b>SIGCONT</b> was delivered. In other words, <b>SIGCONT</b> may be not the
    first signal observed by the tracee after it was sent.</p>
<p class="Pp">Stopping signals cause (all threads of) a process to enter
    group-stop. This side effect happens after signal injection, and therefore
    can be suppressed by the tracer.</p>
<p class="Pp">In Linux 2.4 and earlier, the <b>SIGSTOP</b> signal can't be
    injected.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>PTRACE_GETSIGINFO</b> can be used to retrieve a
    <i>siginfo_t</i> structure which corresponds to the delivered signal.
    <b>PTRACE_SETSIGINFO</b> may be used to modify it. If
    <b>PTRACE_SETSIGINFO</b> has been used to alter <i>siginfo_t</i>, the
    <i>si_signo</i> field and the <i>sig</i> parameter in the restarting command
    must match, otherwise the result is undefined.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Group-stop"><a class="permalink" href="#Group-stop">Group-stop</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When a (possibly multithreaded) process receives a stopping
    signal, all threads stop. If some threads are traced, they enter a
    group-stop. Note that the stopping signal will first cause
    signal-delivery-stop (on one tracee only), and only after it is injected by
    the tracer (or after it was dispatched to a thread which isn't traced), will
    group-stop be initiated on <i>all</i> tracees within the multithreaded
    process. As usual, every tracee reports its group-stop separately to the
    corresponding tracer.</p>
<p class="Pp">Group-stop is observed by the tracer as <b>waitpid</b>(2)
    returning with <i>WIFSTOPPED(status)</i> true, with the stopping signal
    available via <i>WSTOPSIG(status)</i>. The same result is returned by some
    other classes of ptrace-stops, therefore the recommended practice is to
    perform the call</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>ptrace(PTRACE_GETSIGINFO, pid, 0, &amp;siginfo)
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">The call can be avoided if the signal is not <b>SIGSTOP</b>,
    <b>SIGTSTP</b>, <b>SIGTTIN</b>, or <b>SIGTTOU</b>; only these four signals
    are stopping signals. If the tracer sees something else, it can't be a
    group-stop. Otherwise, the tracer needs to call <b>PTRACE_GETSIGINFO</b>. If
    <b>PTRACE_GETSIGINFO</b> fails with <b>EINVAL</b>, then it is definitely a
    group-stop. (Other failure codes are possible, such as <b>ESRCH</b>
    ("no such process") if a <b>SIGKILL</b> killed the tracee.)</p>
<p class="Pp">If tracee was attached using <b>PTRACE_SEIZE</b>, group-stop is
    indicated by <b>PTRACE_EVENT_STOP</b>: <i>status&gt;&gt;16 ==
    PTRACE_EVENT_STOP</i>. This allows detection of group-stops without
    requiring an extra <b>PTRACE_GETSIGINFO</b> call.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of Linux 2.6.38, after the tracer sees the tracee ptrace-stop
    and until it restarts or kills it, the tracee will not run, and will not
    send notifications (except <b>SIGKILL</b> death) to the tracer, even if the
    tracer enters into another <b>waitpid</b>(2) call.</p>
<p class="Pp">The kernel behavior described in the previous paragraph causes a
    problem with transparent handling of stopping signals. If the tracer
    restarts the tracee after group-stop, the stopping signal is effectively
    ignored—the tracee doesn't remain stopped, it runs. If the tracer
    doesn't restart the tracee before entering into the next <b>waitpid</b>(2),
    future <b>SIGCONT</b> signals will not be reported to the tracer; this would
    cause the <b>SIGCONT</b> signals to have no effect on the tracee.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 3.4, there is a method to overcome this problem:
    instead of <b>PTRACE_CONT</b>, a <b>PTRACE_LISTEN</b> command can be used to
    restart a tracee in a way where it does not execute, but waits for a new
    event which it can report via <b>waitpid</b>(2) (such as when it is
    restarted by a <b>SIGCONT</b>).</p>

<p class="Pp">If the tracee was restarted by <b>PTRACE_SYSCALL</b> or

    entering any system call (which will not be executed if the restart was
    using <b>PTRACE_SYSEMU</b>, regardless of any change made to registers at
    this point or how the tracee is restarted after this stop). No matter which
    method caused the syscall-entry-stop, if the tracer restarts the tracee with
    <b>PTRACE_SYSCALL</b>, the tracee enters syscall-exit-stop when the system
    call is finished, or if it is interrupted by a signal. (That is,
    signal-delivery-stop never happens between syscall-enter-stop and
    syscall-exit-stop; it happens <i>after</i> syscall-exit-stop.). If the
    tracee is continued using any other method (including <b>PTRACE_SYSEMU</b>),
    no syscall-exit-stop occurs. Note that all mentions <b>PTRACE_SYSEMU</b>
    apply equally to <b>PTRACE_SYSEMU_SINGLESTEP</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, even if the tracee was continued using
    <b>PTRACE_SYSCALL</b>, it is not guaranteed that the next stop will be a
    syscall-exit-stop. Other possibilities are that the tracee may stop in a
    <b>PTRACE_EVENT</b> stop (including seccomp stops), exit (if it entered
    <b>_exit</b>(2) or <b>exit_group</b>(2)), be killed by <b>SIGKILL</b>, or
    die silently (if it is a thread group leader, the <b>execve</b>(2) happened
    in another thread, and that thread is not traced by the same tracer; this
    situation is discussed later).</p>
<p class="Pp">Syscall-enter-stop and syscall-exit-stop are observed by the
    tracer as <b>waitpid</b>(2) returning with <i>WIFSTOPPED(status)</i> true,
    and <i>WSTOPSIG(status)</i> giving <b>SIGTRAP</b>. If the

  <dt id="si_code"><a class="permalink" href="#si_code"><i>si_code</i> &lt;=

  <dd>This is a syscall-stop.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">However, syscall-stops happen very often (twice per system call),
    and performing <b>PTRACE_GETSIGINFO</b> for every syscall-stop may be
    somewhat expensive.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some architectures allow the cases to be distinguished by
    examining registers. For example, on x86, <i>rax</i> == -<b>ENOSYS</b> in
    syscall-enter-stop. Since <b>SIGTRAP</b> (like any other signal) always
    happens <i>after</i> syscall-exit-stop, and at this point <i>rax</i> almost
    never contains -<b>ENOSYS</b>, the <b>SIGTRAP</b> looks like
    "syscall-stop which is not syscall-enter-stop"; in other words, it
    looks like a "stray syscall-exit-stop" and can be detected this
    way. But such detection is fragile and is best avoided.</p>
<p class="Pp">Using the <b>PTRACE_O_TRACESYSGOOD</b> option is the recommended
    method to distinguish syscall-stops from other kinds of ptrace-stops, since
    it is reliable and does not incur a performance penalty.</p>
<p class="Pp">Syscall-enter-stop and syscall-exit-stop are indistinguishable
    from each other by the tracer. The tracer needs to keep track of the
    sequence of ptrace-stops in order to not misinterpret syscall-enter-stop as
    syscall-exit-stop or vice versa. In general, a syscall-enter-stop is always
    followed by syscall-exit-stop, <b>PTRACE_EVENT</b> stop, or the tracee's
    death; no other kinds of ptrace-stop can occur in between. However, note
    that seccomp stops (see below) can cause syscall-exit-stops, without
    preceding syscall-entry-stops. If seccomp is in use, care needs to be taken
    not to misinterpret such stops as syscall-entry-stops.</p>
<p class="Pp">If after syscall-enter-stop, the tracer uses a restarting command
    other than <b>PTRACE_SYSCALL</b>, syscall-exit-stop is not generated.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>PTRACE_GETSIGINFO</b> on syscall-stops returns <b>SIGTRAP</b>

  stops (Linux 3.5 to Linux 4.7)</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The behavior of <b>PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP</b> stops and their
    interaction with other kinds of ptrace stops has changed between kernel
    versions. This documents the behavior from their introduction until Linux
    4.7 (inclusive). The behavior in later kernel versions is documented in the
    next section.</p>
<p class="Pp">A <b>PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP</b> stop occurs whenever a
    <b>SECCOMP_RET_TRACE</b> rule is triggered. This is independent of which
    methods was used to restart the system call. Notably, seccomp still runs
    even if the tracee was restarted using <b>PTRACE_SYSEMU</b> and this system
    call is unconditionally skipped.</p>
<p class="Pp">Restarts from this stop will behave as if the stop had occurred
    right before the system call in question. In particular, both
    <b>PTRACE_SYSCALL</b> and <b>PTRACE_SYSEMU</b> will normally cause a
    subsequent syscall-entry-stop. However, if after the
    <b>PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP</b> the system call number is negative, both the
    syscall-entry-stop and the system call itself will be skipped. This means
    that if the system call number is negative after a
    <b>PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP</b> and the tracee is restarted using
    <b>PTRACE_SYSCALL</b>, the next observed stop will be a syscall-exit-stop,
    rather than the syscall-entry-stop that might have been expected.</p>

  stops (since Linux 4.8)</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Starting with Linux 4.8, the <b>PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP</b> stop was
    reordered to occur between syscall-entry-stop and syscall-exit-stop. Note
    that seccomp no longer runs (and no <b>PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP</b> will be
    reported) if the system call is skipped due to <b>PTRACE_SYSEMU</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Functionally, a <b>PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP</b> stop functions
    comparably to a syscall-entry-stop (i.e., continuations using
    <b>PTRACE_SYSCALL</b> will cause syscall-exit-stops, the system call number
    may be changed and any other modified registers are visible to the
    to-be-executed system call as well). Note that there may be, but need not
    have been a preceding syscall-entry-stop.</p>
<p class="Pp">After a <b>PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP</b> stop, seccomp will be rerun,
    with a <b>SECCOMP_RET_TRACE</b> rule now functioning the same as a
    <b>SECCOMP_RET_ALLOW</b>. Specifically, this means that if registers are not
    modified during the <b>PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP</b> stop, the system call will

    Note that if other signals are concurrently sent to this thread during

    signal(s) first! The usual practice is to reinject these signals until
    <b>SIGSTOP</b> is seen, then suppress <b>SIGSTOP</b> injection. The design
    bug here is that a ptrace attach and a concurrently delivered <b>SIGSTOP</b>
    may race and the concurrent <b>SIGSTOP</b> may be lost.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since attaching sends <b>SIGSTOP</b> and the tracer usually
    suppresses it, this may cause a stray <b>EINTR</b> return from the currently

</p>
<pre>raise(SIGSTOP);

<br>
<p class="Pp">and allow the parent (which is our tracer now) to observe our

<p class="Pp">If the <b>PTRACE_O_TRACEFORK</b>, <b>PTRACE_O_TRACEVFORK</b>, or

    flag, <b>fork</b>(2) or <b>clone</b>(2) with the exit signal set to
    <b>SIGCHLD</b>, and other kinds of <b>clone</b>(2), are automatically
    attached to the same tracer which traced their parent. <b>SIGSTOP</b> is
    delivered to the children, causing them to enter signal-delivery-stop after
    they exit the system call which created them.</p>
<p class="Pp">Detaching of the tracee is performed by:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>ptrace(PTRACE_DETACH, pid, 0, sig);
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp"><b>PTRACE_DETACH</b> is a restarting operation; therefore it
    requires the tracee to be in ptrace-stop. If the tracee is in
    signal-delivery-stop, a signal can be injected. Otherwise, the <i>sig</i>
    parameter may be silently ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the tracee is running when the tracer wants to detach it, the
    usual solution is to send <b>SIGSTOP</b> (using <b>tgkill</b>(2), to make
    sure it goes to the correct thread), wait for the tracee to stop in
    signal-delivery-stop for <b>SIGSTOP</b> and then detach it (suppressing
    <b>SIGSTOP</b> injection). A design bug is that this can race with
    concurrent <b>SIGSTOP</b>s. Another complication is that the tracee may
    enter other ptrace-stops and needs to be restarted and waited for again,
    until <b>SIGSTOP</b> is seen. Yet another complication is to be sure that
    the tracee is not already ptrace-stopped, because no signal delivery happens
    while it is—not even <b>SIGSTOP</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the tracer dies, all tracees are automatically detached and
    restarted, unless they were in group-stop. Handling of restart from
    group-stop is currently buggy, but the "as planned" behavior is to
    leave tracee stopped and waiting for <b>SIGCONT</b>. If the tracee is
    restarted from signal-delivery-stop, the pending signal is injected.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="execve(2)_under_ptrace"><a class="permalink" href="#execve(2)_under_ptrace">execve(2)
  under ptrace</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When one thread in a multithreaded process calls <b>execve</b>(2),
    the kernel destroys all other threads in the process, and resets the thread
    ID of the execing thread to the thread group ID (process ID). (Or, to put
    things another way, when a multithreaded process does an <b>execve</b>(2),
    at completion of the call, it appears as though the <b>execve</b>(2)
    occurred in the thread group leader, regardless of which thread did the
    <b>execve</b>(2).) This resetting of the thread ID looks very confusing to
    tracers:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>All other threads stop in <b>PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT</b> stop, if the
      <b>PTRACE_O_TRACEEXIT</b> option was turned on. Then all other threads
      except the thread group leader report death as if they exited via
      <b>_exit</b>(2) with exit code 0.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>The execing tracee changes its thread ID while it is in the
      <b>execve</b>(2). (Remember, under ptrace, the "pid" returned
      from <b>waitpid</b>(2), or fed into ptrace calls, is the tracee's thread
      ID.) That is, the tracee's thread ID is reset to be the same as its
      process ID, which is the same as the thread group leader's thread ID.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>Then a <b>PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC</b> stop happens, if the
      <b>PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC</b> option was turned on.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>If the thread group leader has reported its <b>PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT</b> stop
      by this time, it appears to the tracer that the dead thread leader
      "reappears from nowhere". (Note: the thread group leader does
      not report death via <i>WIFEXITED(status)</i> until there is at least one
      other live thread. This eliminates the possibility that the tracer will
      see it dying and then reappearing.) If the thread group leader was still
      alive, for the tracer this may look as if thread group leader returns from
      a different system call than it entered, or even "returned from a
      system call even though it was not in any system call". If the thread
      group leader was not traced (or was traced by a different tracer), then
      during <b>execve</b>(2) it will appear as if it has become a tracee of the
      tracer of the execing tracee.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">All of the above effects are the artifacts of the thread ID change
    in the tracee.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC</b> option is the recommended tool for
    dealing with this situation. First, it enables <b>PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC</b>
    stop, which occurs before <b>execve</b>(2) returns. In this stop, the tracer
    can use <b>PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG</b> to retrieve the tracee's former thread ID.
    (This feature was introduced in Linux 3.0.) Second, the
    <b>PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC</b> option disables legacy <b>SIGTRAP</b> generation
    on <b>execve</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp">When the tracer receives <b>PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC</b> stop
    notification, it is guaranteed that except this tracee and the thread group
    leader, no other threads from the process are alive.</p>
<p class="Pp">On receiving the <b>PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC</b> stop notification, the
    tracer should clean up all its internal data structures describing the
    threads of this process, and retain only one data structure—one which
    describes the single still running tracee, with</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>thread ID == thread group ID == process ID.
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">Example: two threads call <b>execve</b>(2) at the same time:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>*** we get syscall-enter-stop in thread 1: **
PID1 execve("/bin/foo", "foo" &lt;unfinished ...&gt;
*** we issue PTRACE_SYSCALL for thread 1 **
*** we get syscall-enter-stop in thread 2: **
PID2 execve("/bin/bar", "bar" &lt;unfinished ...&gt;
*** we issue PTRACE_SYSCALL for thread 2 **
*** we get PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC for PID0, we issue PTRACE_SYSCALL **
*** we get syscall-exit-stop for PID0: **
PID0 &lt;... execve resumed&gt; )             = 0</pre>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC</b> option is <i>not</i> in effect
    for the execing tracee, and if the tracee was <b>PTRACE_ATTACH</b>ed rather
    that <b>PTRACE_SEIZE</b>d, the kernel delivers an extra <b>SIGTRAP</b> to
    the tracee after <b>execve</b>(2) returns. This is an ordinary signal
    (similar to one which can be generated by <i>kill -TRAP</i>), not a special
    kind of ptrace-stop. Employing <b>PTRACE_GETSIGINFO</b> for this signal
    returns <i>si_code</i> set to 0 (<i>SI_USER</i>). This signal may be blocked
    by signal mask, and thus may be delivered (much) later.</p>
<p class="Pp">Usually, the tracer (for example, <b>strace</b>(1)) would not want
    to show this extra post-execve <b>SIGTRAP</b> signal to the user, and would
    suppress its delivery to the tracee (if <b>SIGTRAP</b> is set to
    <b>SIG_DFL</b>, it is a killing signal). However, determining <i>which</i>
    <b>SIGTRAP</b> to suppress is not easy. Setting the
    <b>PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC</b> option or using <b>PTRACE_SEIZE</b> and thus
    suppressing this extra <b>SIGTRAP</b> is the recommended approach.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Real_parent"><a class="permalink" href="#Real_parent">Real
  parent</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The ptrace API (ab)uses the standard UNIX parent/child signaling
    over <b>waitpid</b>(2). This used to cause the real parent of the process to
    stop receiving several kinds of <b>waitpid</b>(2) notifications when the
    child process is traced by some other process.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of these bugs have been fixed, but as of Linux 2.6.38 several
    still exist; see BUGS below.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of Linux 2.6.38, the following is believed to work
  correctly:</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Ptrace_access_mode_checking"><a class="permalink" href="#Ptrace_access_mode_checking">Ptrace
  access mode checking</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Various parts of the kernel-user-space API (not just
    <b>ptrace</b>() operations), require so-called "ptrace access
    mode" checks, whose outcome determines whether an operation is
    permitted (or, in a few cases, causes a "read" operation to return
    sanitized data). These checks are performed in cases where one process can
    inspect sensitive information about, or in some cases modify the state of,
    another process. The checks are based on factors such as the credentials and
    capabilities of the two processes, whether or not the "target"
    process is dumpable, and the results of checks performed by any enabled
    Linux Security Module (LSM)—for example, SELinux, Yama, or
    Smack—and by the commoncap LSM (which is always invoked).</p>
<p class="Pp">Prior to Linux 2.6.27, all access checks were of a single type.
    Since Linux 2.6.27, two access mode levels are distinguished:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="PTRACE_MODE_READ"><a class="permalink" href="#PTRACE_MODE_READ"><b>PTRACE_MODE_READ</b></a></dt>
  <dd>For "read" operations or other operations that are less
      dangerous, such as: <b>get_robust_list</b>(2); <b>kcmp</b>(2); reading
      <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/auxv</i>, <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/environ</i>, or
      <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/stat</i>; or <b>readlink</b>(2) of a
      <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/ns/*</i> file.</dd>
  <dt id="PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH"><a class="permalink" href="#PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH"><b>PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH</b></a></dt>
  <dd>For "write" operations, or other operations that are more
      dangerous, such as: ptrace attaching (<b>PTRACE_ATTACH</b>) to another
      process or calling <b>process_vm_writev</b>(2). (<b>PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH</b>
      was effectively the default before Linux 2.6.27.)</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 4.5, the above access mode checks are combined (ORed)
    with one of the following modifiers:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="PTRACE_MODE_FSCREDS"><a class="permalink" href="#PTRACE_MODE_FSCREDS"><b>PTRACE_MODE_FSCREDS</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Use the caller's filesystem UID and GID (see <b>credentials</b>(7)) or

  <dd>Use the caller's real UID and GID or permitted capabilities for LSM
      checks. This was effectively the default before Linux 4.5.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Because combining one of the credential modifiers with one of the
    aforementioned access modes is typical, some macros are defined in the
    kernel sources for the combinations:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS"><a class="permalink" href="#PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS"><b>PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS</b></a></dt>

</dl>
<p class="Pp">One further modifier can be ORed with the access mode:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="PTRACE_MODE_NOAUDIT"><a class="permalink" href="#PTRACE_MODE_NOAUDIT"><b>PTRACE_MODE_NOAUDIT</b>
    (since Linux 3.3)</a></dt>
  <dd>Don't audit this access mode check. This modifier is employed for ptrace
      access mode checks (such as checks when reading
      <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/stat</i>) that merely cause the output to be filtered
      or sanitized, rather than causing an error to be returned to the caller.
      In these cases, accessing the file is not a security violation and there
      is no reason to generate a security audit record. This modifier suppresses
      the generation of such an audit record for the particular access
    check.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Note that all of the <b>PTRACE_MODE_*</b> constants described in
    this subsection are kernel-internal, and not visible to user space. The
    constant names are mentioned here in order to label the various kinds of
    ptrace access mode checks that are performed for various system calls and
    accesses to various pseudofiles (e.g., under <i>/proc</i>). These names are
    used in other manual pages to provide a simple shorthand for labeling the
    different kernel checks.</p>
<p class="Pp">The algorithm employed for ptrace access mode checking determines
    whether the calling process is allowed to perform the corresponding action
    on the target process. (In the case of opening <i>/proc/</i>pid files, the
    "calling process" is the one opening the file, and the process
    with the corresponding PID is the "target process".) The algorithm
    is as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>(1)</dt>
  <dd>If the calling thread and the target thread are in the same thread group,
      access is always allowed.</dd>
  <dt>(2)</dt>
  <dd>If the access mode specifies <b>PTRACE_MODE_FSCREDS</b>, then, for the
      check in the next step, employ the caller's filesystem UID and GID. (As
      noted in <b>credentials</b>(7), the filesystem UID and GID almost always
      have the same values as the corresponding effective IDs.)</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Otherwise, the access mode specifies <b>PTRACE_MODE_REALCREDS</b>, so use
      the caller's real UID and GID for the checks in the next step. (Most APIs
      that check the caller's UID and GID use the effective IDs. For historical
      reasons, the <b>PTRACE_MODE_REALCREDS</b> check uses the real IDs
      instead.)</dd>

  <dd>Deny access if <i>neither</i> of the following is true:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">

<p class="Pp">On systems with the Yama Linux Security Module (LSM) installed
    (i.e., the kernel was configured with <b>CONFIG_SECURITY_YAMA</b>), the
    <i>/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope</i> file (available since Linux 3.4)
    can be used to restrict the ability to trace a process with <b>ptrace</b>()
    (and thus also the ability to use tools such as <b>strace</b>(1) and
    <b>gdb</b>(1)). The goal of such restrictions is to prevent attack
    escalation whereby a compromised process can ptrace-attach to other
    sensitive processes (e.g., a GPG agent or an SSH session) owned by the user
    in order to gain additional credentials that may exist in memory and thus
    expand the scope of the attack.</p>
<p class="Pp">More precisely, the Yama LSM limits two types of operations:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>Any operation that performs a ptrace access mode <b>PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH</b>
      check—for example, <b>ptrace</b>() <b>PTRACE_ATTACH</b>. (See the
      "Ptrace access mode checking" discussion above.)</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd><b>ptrace</b>() <b>PTRACE_TRACEME</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">A process that has the <b>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</b> capability can update
    the <i>/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope</i> file with one of the following
    values:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>0 ("classic ptrace permissions")</dt>
  <dd>No additional restrictions on operations that perform
      <b>PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH</b> checks (beyond those imposed by the commoncap
      and other LSMs).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The use of <b>PTRACE_TRACEME</b> is unchanged.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1 ("restricted ptrace") [default value]</dt>
  <dd>When performing an operation that requires a <b>PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH</b>
      check, the calling process must either have the <b>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</b>
      capability in the user namespace of the target process or it must have a
      predefined relationship with the target process. By default, the
      predefined relationship is that the target process must be a descendant of
      the caller.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>A target process can employ the <b>prctl</b>(2) <b>PR_SET_PTRACER</b>
      operation to declare an additional PID that is allowed to perform
      <b>PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH</b> operations on the target. See the kernel source
      file <i>Documentation/admin-guide/LSM/Yama.rst</i> (or
      <i>Documentation/security/Yama.txt</i> before Linux 4.13) for further
      details.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The use of <b>PTRACE_TRACEME</b> is unchanged.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>2 ("admin-only attach")</dt>
  <dd>Only processes with the <b>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</b> capability in the user
      namespace of the target process may perform <b>PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH</b>
      operations or trace children that employ <b>PTRACE_TRACEME</b>.</dd>
  <dt>3 ("no attach")</dt>
  <dd>No process may perform <b>PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH</b> operations or trace
      children that employ <b>PTRACE_TRACEME</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Once this value has been written to the file, it cannot be changed.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">With respect to values 1 and 2, note that creating a new user
    namespace effectively removes the protection offered by Yama. This is
    because a process in the parent user namespace whose effective UID matches
    the UID of the creator of a child namespace has all capabilities (including
    <b>CAP_SYS_PTRACE</b>) when performing operations within the child user
    namespace (and further-removed descendants of that namespace). Consequently,
    when a process tries to use user namespaces to sandbox itself, it
    inadvertently weakens the protections offered by the Yama LSM.</p>

<p class="Pp">At the system call level, the <b>PTRACE_PEEKTEXT</b>,
    <b>PTRACE_PEEKDATA</b>, and <b>PTRACE_PEEKUSER</b> requests have a different
    API: they store the result at the address specified by the <i>data</i>
    parameter, and the return value is the error flag. The glibc wrapper
    function provides the API given in DESCRIPTION above, with the result being
    returned via the function return value.</p>

<p class="Pp">On hosts with Linux 2.6 kernel headers, <b>PTRACE_SETOPTIONS</b>
    is declared with a different value than the one for Linux 2.4. This leads to
    applications compiled with Linux 2.6 kernel headers failing when run on
    Linux 2.4. This can be worked around by redefining <b>PTRACE_SETOPTIONS</b>
    to <b>PTRACE_OLDSETOPTIONS</b>, if that is defined.</p>
<p class="Pp">Group-stop notifications are sent to the tracer, but not to real
    parent. Last confirmed on 2.6.38.6.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a thread group leader is traced and exits by calling
    <b>_exit</b>(2), a <b>PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT</b> stop will happen for it (if
    requested), but the subsequent <b>WIFEXITED</b> notification will not be
    delivered until all other threads exit. As explained above, if one of other
    threads calls <b>execve</b>(2), the death of the thread group leader will
    <i>never</i> be reported. If the execed thread is not traced by this tracer,
    the tracer will never know that <b>execve</b>(2) happened. One possible
    workaround is to <b>PTRACE_DETACH</b> the thread group leader instead of
    restarting it in this case. Last confirmed on 2.6.38.6.</p>
<p class="Pp">A <b>SIGKILL</b> signal may still cause a <b>PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT</b>
    stop before actual signal death. This may be changed in the future;
    <b>SIGKILL</b> is meant to always immediately kill tasks even under ptrace.
    Last confirmed on Linux 3.13.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some system calls return with <b>EINTR</b> if a signal was sent to
    a tracee, but delivery was suppressed by the tracer. (This is very typical
    operation: it is usually done by debuggers on every attach, in order to not
    introduce a bogus <b>SIGSTOP</b>). As of Linux 3.2.9, the following system
    calls are affected (this list is likely incomplete): <b>epoll_wait</b>(2),
    and <b>read</b>(2) from an <b>inotify</b>(7) file descriptor. The usual
    symptom of this bug is that when you attach to a quiescent process with the
    command</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>strace -p &lt;process-ID&gt;
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">then, instead of the usual and expected one-line output such
  as</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>restart_syscall(&lt;... resuming interrupted call ...&gt;_
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">or</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>select(6, [5], NULL, [5], NULL_
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">('_' denotes the cursor position), you observe more than one line.
    For example:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre><br>
    clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, {15370, 690928118}) = 0
<br>
    epoll_wait(4,_
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">What is not visible here is that the process was blocked in
    <b>epoll_wait</b>(2) before <b>strace</b>(1) has attached to it. Attaching
    caused <b>epoll_wait</b>(2) to return to user space with the error
    <b>EINTR</b>. In this particular case, the program reacted to <b>EINTR</b>
    by checking the current time, and then executing <b>epoll_wait</b>(2) again.
    (Programs which do not expect such "stray" <b>EINTR</b> errors may
    behave in an unintended way upon an <b>strace</b>(1) attach.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Contrary to the normal rules, the glibc wrapper for
    <b>ptrace</b>() can set <i>errno</i> to zero.</p>
