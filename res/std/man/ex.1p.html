<p class="Pp">The <i>ex</i> utility is a line-oriented text editor. There are
    two other modes of the editor—open and visual—in which
    screen-oriented editing is available. This is described more fully by the
    <i>ex</i> <b>open</b> and <b>visual</b> commands and in
  <i><i>vi</i></i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If an operand is <b>'-'</b>, the results are unspecified.</p>
<p class="Pp">This section uses the term <i>edit buffer</i> to describe the
    current working text. No specific implementation is implied by this term.
    All editing changes are performed on the edit buffer, and no changes to it
    shall affect any file until an editor command writes the file.</p>
<p class="Pp">Certain terminals do not have all the capabilities necessary to
    support the complete <i>ex</i> definition, such as the full-screen editing
    commands (<i>visual mode</i> or <i>open mode</i>). When these commands
    cannot be supported on such terminals, this condition shall not produce an
    error message such as ``not an editor command'' or report a syntax error.
    The implementation may either accept the commands and produce results on the
    screen that are the result of an unsuccessful attempt to meet the
    requirements of this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 or report an error
    describing the terminal-related deficiency.</p>

<p class="Pp">The <i>ex</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
    of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax
    Guidelines</i>, except for the unspecified usage of <b>'-'</b>, and that
    <b>'+'</b> may be recognized as an option delimiter as well as
  <b>'-'</b>.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd>Specify an initial command to be executed in the first edit buffer loaded

      specified on the command line.</dd>
  <dt id="r"><a class="permalink" href="#r"><b>-r</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Recover the named files (see the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section). Recovery

      can catch), or after the use of an <i>ex</i> <b>preserve</b> command.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">A <i>crash</i> in this context is an unexpected failure of the
    system or utility that requires restarting the failed system or utility. A

    the case of an editor or system crash, the number of changes to the edit
    buffer (since the most recent <b>preserve</b> command) that will be
    recovered is unspecified.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no <i>file</i> operands are given and the <b>-t</b> option is
    not specified, all other options, the <i>EXINIT</i> variable, and any

<h2 class="Ss" id="Addressing_in_ex"><a class="permalink" href="#Addressing_in_ex">Addressing
  in ex</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Addressing in <i>ex</i> relates to the current line and the
    current column; the address of a line is its 1-based line number, the
    address of a column is its 1-based count from the beginning of the line.
    Generally, the current line is the last line affected by a command. The
    current line number is the address of the current line. In each command
    description, the effect of the command on the current line number and the
    current column is described.</p>
<p class="Pp">Addresses are constructed as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> 1.</dt>
  <dd>The character <b>'.'</b> (period) shall address the current line.</dd>
  <dt> 2.</dt>
  <dd>The character <b>'$'</b> shall address the last line of the edit
    buffer.</dd>
  <dt> 3.</dt>
  <dd>The positive decimal number <i>n</i> shall address the <i>n</i>th line of
      the edit buffer.</dd>
  <dt> 4.</dt>
  <dd>The address <b>"'x"</b> refers to the line marked with the mark
      name character <b>'x'</b>, which shall be a lowercase letter from the
      portable character set, the backquote character, or the single-quote
      character. It shall be an error if the line that was marked is not
      currently present in the edit buffer or the mark has not been set. Lines
      can be marked with the <i>ex</i> <b>mark</b> or <b>k</b> commands, or the
      <i>vi</i> <b>m</b> command.</dd>
  <dt> 5.</dt>
  <dd>A regular expression enclosed by &lt;slash&gt; characters (<b>'/'</b>)
      shall address the first line found by searching forwards from the line
      following the current line toward the end of the edit buffer and stopping
      at the first line for which the line excluding the terminating
      &lt;newline&gt; matches the regular expression. As stated in <i>Regular
      Expressions in ex</i>, an address consisting of a null regular expression
      delimited by &lt;slash&gt; characters (<b>"//"</b>) shall
      address the next line for which the line excluding the terminating
      &lt;newline&gt; matches the last regular expression encountered. In
      addition, the second &lt;slash&gt; can be omitted at the end of a command
      line. If the <b>wrapscan</b> edit option is set, the search shall wrap
      around to the beginning of the edit buffer and continue up to and
      including the current line, so that the entire edit buffer is searched.
      Within the regular expression, the sequence <b>"\/"</b> shall
      represent a literal &lt;slash&gt; instead of the regular expression
      delimiter.</dd>
  <dt> 6.</dt>
  <dd>A regular expression enclosed in &lt;question-mark&gt; characters
      (<b>'?'</b>) shall address the first line found by searching backwards
      from the line preceding the current line toward the beginning of the edit
      buffer and stopping at the first line for which the line excluding the
      terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the regular expression. An address
      consisting of a null regular expression delimited by &lt;question-mark&gt;
      characters (<b>"??"</b>) shall address the previous line for
      which the line excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the last
      regular expression encountered. In addition, the second
      &lt;question-mark&gt; can be omitted at the end of a command line. If the
      <b>wrapscan</b> edit option is set, the search shall wrap around from the
      beginning of the edit buffer to the end of the edit buffer and continue up
      to and including the current line, so that the entire edit buffer is
      searched. Within the regular expression, the sequence
      <b>"\?"</b> shall represent a literal &lt;question-mark&gt;
      instead of the RE delimiter.</dd>
  <dt> 7.</dt>
  <dd>A &lt;plus-sign&gt; (<b>'+'</b>) or a &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; (<b>'-'</b>)
      followed by a decimal number shall address the current line plus or minus
      the number. A <b>'+'</b> or <b>'-'</b> not followed by a decimal number
      shall address the current line plus or minus 1.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Addresses can be followed by zero or more address offsets,
    optionally &lt;blank&gt;-separated. Address offsets are constructed as
    follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> 1.</dt>
  <dd>A <b>'+'</b> or <b>'-'</b> immediately followed by a decimal number shall
      add (subtract) the indicated number of lines to (from) the address. A
      <b>'+'</b> or <b>'-'</b> not followed by a decimal number shall add
      (subtract) 1 to (from) the address.</dd>
  <dt> 2.</dt>
  <dd>A decimal number shall add the indicated number of lines to the
    address.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">It shall not be an error for an intermediate address value to be
    less than zero or greater than the last line in the edit buffer. It shall be
    an error for the final address value to be less than zero or greater than
    the last line in the edit buffer.</p>
<p class="Pp">Commands take zero, one, or two addresses; see the descriptions of
    <i>1addr</i> and <i>2addr</i> in <i>Command Descriptions in ex</i>. If more
    than the required number of addresses are provided to a command that
    requires zero addresses, it shall be an error. Otherwise, if more than the
    required number of addresses are provided to a command, the addresses
    specified first shall be evaluated and then discarded until the maximum
    number of valid addresses remain.</p>
<p class="Pp">Addresses shall be separated from each other by a &lt;comma&gt;
    (<b>','</b>) or a &lt;semicolon&gt; (<b>';'</b>). If no address is specified
    before or after a &lt;comma&gt; or &lt;semicolon&gt; separator, it shall be
    as if the address of the current line was specified before or after the
    separator. In the case of a &lt;semicolon&gt; separator, the current line
    (<b>'.'</b>) shall be set to the first address, and only then will the next
    address be calculated. This feature can be used to determine the starting
    line for forwards and backwards searches (see rules 5. and 6.).</p>
<p class="Pp">A &lt;percent-sign&gt; (<b>'%'</b>) shall be equivalent to
    entering the two addresses <b>"1,$"</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any delimiting &lt;blank&gt; characters between addresses, address
    separators, or address offsets shall be discarded.</p>

    would otherwise be ambiguous. For example, <i>count</i> and <i>flag</i>

    arguments for all other <i>ex</i> commands that are not regular expressions
    or replacement strings, any character that would otherwise have a special
    meaning can be &lt;backslash&gt;-escaped. Escaped characters shall be
    treated literally, without special meaning as shell expansion characters or

<p class="Pp">The <i>ex</i>/<i>vi</i> specification is based on the historical
    practice found in the 4 BSD and System V implementations of <i>ex</i> and
    <i>vi</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">A <i>restricted editor</i> (both the historical <i>red</i> utility
    and modifications to <i>ex</i>) were considered and rejected for inclusion.
    Neither option provided the level of security that users might expect.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is recognized that <i>ex</i> visual mode and related features
    would be difficult, if not impossible, to implement satisfactorily on a
    block-mode terminal, or a terminal without any form of cursor addressing;
    thus, it is not a mandatory requirement that such features should work on
    all terminals. It is the intention, however, that an <i>ex</i>
    implementation should provide the full set of capabilities on all terminals
    capable of supporting them.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Options"><a class="permalink" href="#Options">Options</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-c</b> replacement for <b>+</b><i>command</i> was inspired
    by the <b>-e</b> option of <i>sed</i>. Historically, all such commands (see
    <b>edit</b> and <b>next</b> as well) were executed from the last line of the
    edit buffer. This meant, for example, that <b>"+/pattern"</b>
    would fail unless the <b>wrapscan</b> option was set. POSIX.1‐2008
    requires conformance to historical practice. The <b>+</b><i>command</i>
    option is no longer specified by POSIX.1‐2008 but may be present in
    some implementations. Historically, some implementations restricted the
    <i>ex</i> commands that could be listed as part of the command line
    arguments. For consistency, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit these
    restrictions.</p>
<p class="Pp">In historical implementations of the editor, the <b>-R</b> option
    (and the <b>readonly</b> edit option) only prevented overwriting of files;
    appending to files was still permitted, mapping loosely into the <i>csh</i>
    <b>noclobber</b> variable. Some implementations, however, have not followed
    this semantic, and <b>readonly</b> does not permit appending either.
    POSIX.1‐2008 follows the latter practice, believing that it is a more
    obvious and intuitive meaning of <b>readonly</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-s</b> option suppresses all interactive user feedback and
    is useful for editing scripts in batch jobs. The list of specific effects is
    historical practice. The terminal type ``incapable of supporting open and
    visual modes'' has historically been named ``dumb''.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-t</b> option was required because the <i>ctags</i> utility
    appears in POSIX.1‐2008 and the option is available in all historical
    implementations of <i>ex</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> utilities accepted a
    <b>-x</b> option, which did encryption based on the algorithm found in the
    historical <i>crypt</i> utility. The <b>-x</b> option for encryption, and
    the associated <i>crypt</i> utility, were omitted because the algorithm used
    was not specifiable and the export control laws of some nations make it
    difficult to export cryptographic technology. In addition, it did not

<p class="Pp">An end-of-file condition is not equivalent to an end-of-file
    character. A common end-of-file character, &lt;control&gt;‐D, is
    historically an <i>ex</i> command.</p>
<p class="Pp">There was no maximum line length in historical implementations of
    <i>ex</i>. Specifically, as it was parsed in chunks, the addresses had a
    different maximum length than the filenames. Further, the maximum line
    buffer size was declared as BUFSIZ, which was different lengths on different
    systems. This version selected the value of {LINE_MAX} to impose a
    reasonable restriction on portable usage of <i>ex</i> and to aid test suite
    writers in their development of realistic tests that exercise this
  limit.</p>

<p class="Pp">It was an explicit decision by the standard developers that a
    &lt;newline&gt; be added to any file lacking one. It was believed that this
    feature of <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> was relied on by users in order to make
    text files lacking a trailing &lt;newline&gt; more portable. It is
    recognized that this will require a user-specified option or extension for
    implementations that permit <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> to edit files of type
    other than text if such files are not otherwise identified by the system. It
    was agreed that the ability to edit files of arbitrary type can be useful,
    but it was not considered necessary to mandate that an <i>ex</i> or
    <i>vi</i> implementation be required to handle files other than text
  files.</p>
<p class="Pp">The paragraph in the INPUT FILES section, ``By default, ...'', is
    intended to close a long-standing security problem in <i>ex</i> and
    <i>vi</i>; that of the ``modeline'' or ``modelines'' edit option. This
    feature allows any line in the first or last five lines of the file
    containing the strings <b>"ex:"</b> or <b>"vi:"</b>
    (and, apparently, <b>"ei:"</b> or <b>"vx:"</b>) to be a
    line containing editor commands, and <i>ex</i> interprets all the text up to
    the next <b>':'</b> or &lt;newline&gt; as a command. Consider the
    consequences, for example, of an unsuspecting user using <i>ex</i> or
    <i>vi</i> as the editor when replying to a mail message in which a line such
    as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>ex:! rm -rf :</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">appeared in the signature lines. The standard developers believed
    strongly that an editor should not by default interpret any lines of a file.
    Vendors are strongly urged to delete this feature from their implementations
    of <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i>.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Asynchronous_Events"><a class="permalink" href="#Asynchronous_Events">Asynchronous
  Events</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The intention of the phrase ``complete write'' is that the entire
    edit buffer be written to stable storage. The note regarding temporary files
    is intended for implementations that use temporary files to back edit
    buffers unnamed by the user.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, SIGQUIT was ignored by <i>ex</i>, but was the
    equivalent of the <b>Q</b> command in visual mode; that is, it exited visual
    mode and entered <i>ex</i> mode. POSIX.1‐2008 permits, but does not
    require, this behavior. Historically, SIGINT was often used by <i>vi</i>
    users to terminate text input mode (&lt;control&gt;‐C is often easier
    to enter than &lt;ESC&gt;). Some implementations of <i>vi</i> alerted the
    terminal on this event, and some did not. POSIX.1‐2008 requires that
    SIGINT behave identically to &lt;ESC&gt;, and that the terminal not be
    alerted.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, suspending the <i>ex</i> editor during text input
    mode was similar to SIGINT, as completed lines were retained, but any
    partial line discarded, and the editor returned to command mode.
    POSIX.1‐2008 is silent on this issue; implementations are encouraged
    to follow historical practice, where possible.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <i>vi</i> editor did not treat SIGTSTP as an
    asynchronous event, and it was therefore impossible to suspend the editor in
    visual text input mode. There are two major reasons for this. The first is
    that SIGTSTP is a broadcast signal on UNIX systems, and the chain of events
    where the shell <i>exec</i>s an application that then <i>exec</i>s <i>vi</i>
    usually caused confusion for the terminal state if SIGTSTP was delivered to
    the process group in the default manner. The second was that most
    implementations of the UNIX <i>curses</i> package did not handle SIGTSTP
    safely, and the receipt of SIGTSTP at the wrong time would cause them to
    crash. POSIX.1‐2008 is silent on this issue; implementations are
    encouraged to treat suspension as an asynchronous event if possible.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, modifications to the edit buffer made before SIGINT
    interrupted an operation were retained; that is, anywhere from zero to all
    of the lines to be modified might have been modified by the time the SIGINT
    arrived. These changes were not discarded by the arrival of SIGINT.
    POSIX.1‐2008 permits this behavior, noting that the <b>undo</b>
    command is required to be able to undo these partially completed
  commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">The action taken for signals other than SIGINT, SIGCONT, SIGHUP,
    and SIGTERM is unspecified because some implementations attempt to save the
    edit buffer in a useful state when other signals are received.</p>

<h2 class="Ss">Initialization in ex and vi</h2>
<p class="Pp">If an <i>ex</i> command (other than <b>cd</b>, <b>chdir</b>, or
    <b>source</b>) has a filename argument, one or both of the alternate and
    current pathnames will be set. Informally, they are set as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> 1.</dt>
  <dd>If the <i>ex</i> command is one that replaces the contents of the edit
      buffer, and it succeeds, the current pathname will be set to the filename
      argument (the first filename argument in the case of the <b>next</b>
      command) and the alternate pathname will be set to the previous current
      pathname, if there was one.</dd>
  <dt> 2.</dt>
  <dd>In the case of the file read/write forms of the <b>read</b> and
      <b>write</b> commands, if there is no current pathname, the current
      pathname will be set to the filename argument.</dd>
  <dt> 3.</dt>
  <dd>Otherwise, the alternate pathname will be set to the filename
    argument.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">For example, <b>:edit foo</b> and <b>:recover foo</b>, when
    successful, set the current pathname, and, if there was a previous current
    pathname, the alternate pathname. The commands <b>:write</b>,
    <b>!command</b>, and <b>:edit</b> set neither the current or alternate
    pathnames. If the <b>:edit foo</b> command were to fail for some reason, the
    alternate pathname would be set. The <b>read</b> and <b>write</b> commands
    set the alternate pathname to their <i>file</i> argument, unless the current
    pathname is not set, in which case they set the current pathname to their
    <i>file</i> arguments. The alternate pathname was not historically set by
    the <b>:source</b> command. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to
    historical practice. Implementations adding commands that take filenames as
    arguments are encouraged to set the alternate pathname as described
  here.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> read the <b>.exrc</b> file
    in the <i>$HOME</i> directory twice, if the editor was executed in the
    <i>$HOME</i> directory. POSIX.1‐2008 prohibits this behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the 4 BSD <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> read the
    <i>$HOME</i> and local <b>.exrc</b> files if they were owned by the real ID
    of the user, or the <b>sourceany</b> option was set, regardless of other
    considerations. This was a security problem because it is possible to put
    normal UNIX system commands inside a <b>.exrc</b> file. POSIX.1‐2008
    does not specify the <b>sourceany</b> option, and historical implementations
    are encouraged to delete it.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>.exrc</b> files must be owned by the real ID of the user,
    and not writable by anyone other than the owner. The appropriate privileges
    exception is intended to permit users to acquire special privileges, but
    continue to use the <b>.exrc</b> files in their home directories.</p>
<p class="Pp">System V Release 3.2 and later <i>vi</i> implementations added the
    option <b>[no]exrc</b>. The behavior is that local <b>.exrc</b> files are
    read-only if the <b>exrc</b> option is set. The default for the <b>exrc</b>
    option was off, so by default, local <b>.exrc</b> files were not read. The
    problem this was intended to solve was that System V permitted users to give
    away files, so there is no possible ownership or writeability test to ensure
    that the file is safe. This is still a security problem on systems where
    users can give away files, but there is nothing additional that
    POSIX.1‐2008 can do. The implementation-defined exception is intended
    to permit groups to have local <b>.exrc</b> files that are shared by users,
    by creating pseudo-users to own the shared files.</p>
<p class="Pp">POSIX.1‐2008 does not mention system-wide <i>ex</i> and
    <i>vi</i> start-up files. While they exist in several implementations of
    <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i>, they are not present in any implementations
    considered historical practice by POSIX.1‐2008. Implementations that
    have such files should use them only if they are owned by the real user ID
    or an appropriate user (for example, root on UNIX systems) and if they are
    not writable by any user other than their owner. System-wide start-up files
    should be read before the <i>EXINIT</i> variable, <b>$HOME/.exrc</b>, or
    local <b>.exrc</b> files are evaluated.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, any <i>ex</i> command could be entered in the
    <i>EXINIT</i> variable or the <b>.exrc</b> file, although ones requiring
    that the edit buffer already contain lines of text generally caused
    historical implementations of the editor to drop <b>core</b>.
    POSIX.1‐2008 requires that any <i>ex</i> command be permitted in the
    <i>EXINIT</i> variable and <b>.exrc</b> files, for simplicity of
    specification and consistency, although many of them will obviously fail
    under many circumstances.</p>
<p class="Pp">The initialization of the contents of the edit buffer uses the
    phrase ``the effect shall be'' with regard to various <i>ex</i> commands.
    The intent of this phrase is that edit buffer contents loaded during the
    initialization phase not be lost; that is, loading the edit buffer should
    fail if the <b>.exrc</b> file read in the contents of a file and did not
    subsequently write the edit buffer. An additional intent of this phrase is
    to specify that the initial current line and column is set as specified for
    the individual <i>ex</i> commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>-t</b> option behaved as if the tag search
    were a <b>+</b><i>command</i>; that is, it was executed from the last line
    of the file specified by the tag. This resulted in the search failing if the
    pattern was a forward search pattern and the <b>wrapscan</b> edit option was
    not set. POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior, requiring that
    the search for the tag pattern be performed on the entire file, and, if not
    found, that the current line be set to a more reasonable location in the
    file.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the empty edit buffer presented for editing when a
    file was not specified by the user was unnamed. This is permitted by
    POSIX.1‐2008; however, implementations are encouraged to provide
    users a temporary filename for this buffer because it permits them the use
    of <i>ex</i> commands that use the current pathname during temporary edit
    sessions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the file specified using the <b>-t</b> option was
    not part of the current argument list. This practice is permitted by
    POSIX.1‐2008; however, implementations are encouraged to include its
    name in the current argument list for consistency.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>-c</b> command was generally not executed
    until a file that already exists was edited. POSIX.1‐2008 requires
    conformance to this historical practice. Commands that could cause the
    <b>-c</b> command to be executed include the <i>ex</i> commands <b>edit</b>,
    <b>next</b>, <b>recover</b>, <b>rewind</b>, and <b>tag</b>, and the
    <i>vi</i> commands &lt;control&gt;‐^ and &lt;control&gt;‐].
    Historically, reading a file into an edit buffer did not cause the <b>-c</b>
    command to be executed (even though it might set the current pathname) with
    the exception that it did cause the <b>-c</b> command to be executed if: the
    editor was in <i>ex</i> mode, the edit buffer had no current pathname, the
    edit buffer was empty, and no read commands had yet been attempted. For
    consistency and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1‐2008 does not
    permit this behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>-r</b> option was the same as a normal edit
    session if there was no recovery information available for the file. This
    allowed users to enter:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>vi -r *.c</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">and recover whatever files were recoverable. In some
    implementations, recovery was attempted only on the first file named, and
    the file was not entered into the argument list; in others, recovery was
    attempted for each file named. In addition, some historical implementations
    ignored <b>-r</b> if <b>-t</b> was specified or did not support command line
    <i>file</i> arguments with the <b>-t</b> option. For consistency and
    simplicity of specification, POSIX.1‐2008 disallows these special
    cases, and requires that recovery be attempted the first time each file is
    edited.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, <i>vi</i> initialized the <b>`</b> and <b>'</b>
    marks, but <i>ex</i> did not. This meant that if the first command in
    <i>ex</i> mode was <b>visual</b> or if an <i>ex</i> command was executed
    first (for example, <i>vi</i> +10 <i>file</i>), <i>vi</i> was entered
    without the marks being initialized. Because the standard developers
    believed the marks to be generally useful, and for consistency and
    simplicity of specification, POSIX.1‐2008 requires that they always
    be initialized if in open or visual mode, or if in <i>ex</i> mode and the
    edit buffer is not empty. Not initializing it in <i>ex</i> mode if the edit
    buffer is empty is historical practice; however, it has always been possible
    to set (and use) marks in empty edit buffers in open and visual mode edit
    sessions.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Addressing"><a class="permalink" href="#Addressing">Addressing</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> accepted the additional
    addressing forms <b>'\/'</b> and <b>'\?'</b>. They were equivalent to
    <b>"//"</b> and <b>"??"</b>, respectively. They are not
    required by POSIX.1‐2008, mostly because nobody can remember whether
    they ever did anything different historically.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> permitted an address of zero
    for several commands, and permitted the <b>%</b> address in empty files for
    others. For consistency, POSIX.1‐2008 requires support for the former
    in the few commands where it makes sense, and disallows it otherwise. In
    addition, because POSIX.1‐2008 requires that <b>%</b> be logically
    equivalent to <b>"1,$"</b>, it is also supported where it makes
    sense and disallowed otherwise.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>%</b> address could not be followed by
    further addresses. For consistency and simplicity of specification,
    POSIX.1‐2008 requires that additional addresses be supported.</p>
<p class="Pp">All of the following are valid <i>addresses</i>:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>+++</dt>
  <dd>Three lines after the current line.</dd>
  <dt>/<i>re</i>/-</dt>
  <dd>One line before the next occurrence of <i>re</i>.</dd>
  <dt>-2</dt>
  <dd>Two lines before the current line.</dd>
  <dt>3&nbsp;----&nbsp;2</dt>
  <dd>Line one (note intermediate negative address).</dd>
  <dt>1&nbsp;2&nbsp;3</dt>
  <dd>Line six.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Any number of addresses can be provided to commands taking
    addresses; for example, <b>"1,2,3,4,5p"</b> prints lines 4 and 5,
    because two is the greatest valid number of addresses accepted by the
    <b>print</b> command. This, in combination with the &lt;semicolon&gt;
    delimiter, permits users to create commands based on ordered patterns in the
    file. For example, the command <b>3;/foo/;+2print</b> will display the first
    line after line 3 that contains the pattern <i>foo</i>, plus the next two
    lines. Note that the address <b>3;</b> must be evaluated before being
    discarded because the search origin for the <b>/foo/</b> command depends on
    this.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, values could be added to addresses by including them
    after one or more &lt;blank&gt; characters; for example,
    <b>3&nbsp;-&nbsp;5p</b> wrote the seventh line of the file, and
    <b>/foo/&nbsp;5</b> was the same as <b>/foo/+5</b>. However, only absolute
    values could be added; for example, <b>5&nbsp;/foo/</b> was an error.
    POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical practice. Address
    offsets are separately specified from addresses because they could
    historically be provided to visual mode search commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, any missing addresses defaulted to the current line.
    This was true for leading and trailing &lt;comma&gt;-delimited addresses,
    and for trailing &lt;semicolon&gt;-delimited addresses. For consistency,
    POSIX.1‐2008 requires it for leading &lt;semicolon&gt; addresses as
    well.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> accepted the <b>'^'</b>
    character as both an address and as a flag offset for commands. In both
    cases it was identical to the <b>'-'</b> character. POSIX.1‐2008 does
    not require or prohibit this behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the enhancements to basic regular expressions could
    be used in addressing; for example, <b>'~'</b>, <b>'\&lt;'</b>, and
    <b>'\&gt;'</b>. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical
    practice; that is, that regular expression usage be consistent, and that
    regular expression enhancements be supported wherever regular expressions
    are used.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">Command Line Parsing in ex</h2>
<p class="Pp">Historical <i>ex</i> command parsing was even more complex than
    that described here. POSIX.1‐2008 requires the subset of the command
    parsing that the standard developers believed was documented and that users
    could reasonably be expected to use in a portable fashion, and that was
    historically consistent between implementations. (The discarded
    functionality is obscure, at best.) Historical implementations will require
    changes in order to comply with POSIX.1‐2008; however, users are not
    expected to notice any of these changes. Most of the complexity in <i>ex</i>
    parsing is to handle three special termination cases:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> 1.</dt>
  <dd>The <b>!</b>, <b>global</b>, <b>v</b>, and the filter versions of the
      <b>read</b> and <b>write</b> commands are delimited by &lt;newline&gt;
      characters (they can contain &lt;vertical-line&gt; characters that are
      usually shell pipes).</dd>
  <dt> 2.</dt>
  <dd>The <b>ex</b>, <b>edit</b>, <b>next</b>, and <b>visual</b> in open and
      visual mode commands all take <i>ex</i> commands, optionally containing
      &lt;vertical-line&gt; characters, as their first arguments.</dd>
  <dt> 3.</dt>
  <dd>The <b>s</b> command takes a regular expression as its first argument, and
      uses the delimiting characters to delimit the command.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Historically, &lt;vertical-line&gt; characters in the
    <b>+</b><i>command</i> argument of the <b>ex</b>, <b>edit</b>, <b>next</b>,
    <b>vi</b>, and <b>visual</b> commands, and in the <i>pattern</i> and
    <i>replacement</i> parts of the <b>s</b> command, did not delimit the
    command, and in the filter cases for <b>read</b> and <b>write</b>, and the
    <b>!</b>, <b>global</b>, and <b>v</b> commands, they did not delimit the
    command at all. For example, the following commands are all valid:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre><b>:</b>edit +25 | s/abc/ABC/ file.c
<b>:</b>s/ | /PIPE/
<b>:</b>read !spell % | columnate
<b>:</b>global/pattern/p | l
<b>:</b>s/a/b/ | s/c/d | set</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Historically, empty or &lt;blank&gt; filled lines in <b>.exrc</b>
    files and <b>source</b>d files (as well as <i>EXINIT</i> variables and
    <i>ex</i> command scripts) were treated as default commands; that is,
    <b>print</b> commands. POSIX.1‐2008 specifically requires that they
    be ignored when encountered in <b>.exrc</b> and <b>source</b>d files to
    eliminate a common source of new user error.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, <i>ex</i> commands with multiple adjacent (or
    &lt;blank&gt;-separated) vertical lines were handled oddly when executed
    from <i>ex</i> mode. For example, the command <b>|||</b>
    &lt;carriage-return&gt;, when the cursor was on line 1, displayed lines 2,
    3, and 5 of the file. In addition, the command <b>|</b> would only display
    the line after the next line, instead of the next two lines. The former
    worked more logically when executed from <i>vi</i> mode, and displayed lines
    2, 3, and 4. POSIX.1‐2008 requires the <i>vi</i> behavior; that is, a
    single default command and line number increment for each command separator,
    and trailing &lt;newline&gt; characters after &lt;vertical-line&gt;
    separators are discarded.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, <i>ex</i> permitted a single extra &lt;colon&gt; as
    a leading command character; for example, <b>:g/pattern/:p</b> was a valid
    command. POSIX.1‐2008 generalizes this to require that any number of
    leading &lt;colon&gt; characters be stripped.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, any prefix of the <b>delete</b> command could be
    followed without intervening &lt;blank&gt; characters by a flag character
    because in the command <b>d&nbsp;p</b>, <i>p</i> is interpreted as the
    buffer <i>p</i>. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical
    practice.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>k</b> command could be followed by the mark
    name without intervening &lt;blank&gt; characters. POSIX.1‐2008
    requires conformance to historical practice.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>s</b> command could be immediately followed
    by flag and option characters; for example, <b>s/e/E/|s|sgc3p</b> was a
    valid command. However, flag characters could not stand alone; for example,
    the commands <b>sp</b> and <b>s&nbsp;l</b> would fail, while the command
    <b>sgp</b> and <b>s&nbsp;gl</b> would succeed. (Obviously, the <b>'#'</b>
    flag character was used as a delimiter character if it followed the
    command.) Another issue was that option characters had to precede flag
    characters even when the command was fully specified; for example, the
    command <b>s/e/E/pg</b> would fail, while the command <b>s/e/E/gp</b> would
    succeed. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical
  practice.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the first command name that had a prefix matching
    the input from the user was the executed command; for example, <b>ve</b>,
    <b>ver</b>, and <b>vers</b> all executed the <b>version</b> command.
    Commands were in a specific order, however, so that <b>a</b> matched
    <b>append</b>, not <b>abbreviate</b>. POSIX.1‐2008 requires
    conformance to historical practice. The restriction on command search order
    for implementations with extensions is to avoid the addition of commands
    such that the historical prefixes would fail to work portably.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historical implementations of <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> did not
    correctly handle multiple <i>ex</i> commands, separated by
    &lt;vertical-line&gt; characters, that entered or exited visual mode or the
    editor. Because implementations of <i>vi</i> exist that do not exhibit this
    failure mode, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit it.</p>
<p class="Pp">The requirement that alphabetic command names consist of all
    following alphabetic characters up to the next non-alphabetic character
    means that alphabetic command names must be separated from their arguments
    by one or more non-alphabetic characters, normally a &lt;blank&gt; or
    <b>'!'</b> character, except as specified for the exceptions, the
    <b>delete</b>, <b>k</b>, and <b>s</b> commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the repeated execution of the <i>ex</i> default
    <b>print</b> commands (&lt;control&gt;‐D, <i>eof</i>,
    &lt;newline&gt;, &lt;carriage-return&gt;) erased any prompting character and
    displayed the next lines without scrolling the terminal; that is,
    immediately below any previously displayed lines. This provided a cleaner
    presentation of the lines in the file for the user. POSIX.1‐2008 does
    not require this behavior because it may be impossible in some situations;
    however, implementations are strongly encouraged to provide this semantic if
    possible.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, it was possible to change files in the middle of a
    command, and have the rest of the command executed in the new file; for
    example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>:edit +25 file.c | s/abc/ABC/ | 1</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">was a valid command, and the substitution was attempted in the
    newly edited file. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical
    practice. The following commands are examples that exercise the <i>ex</i>
    parser:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>echo 'foo | bar' &gt; file1; echo 'foo/bar' &gt; file2;
vi
:edit +1 | s/|/PIPE/ | w file1 | e file2 | 1 | s/\//SLASH/ | wq</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Historically, there was no protection in editor implementations to
    avoid <i>ex</i> <b>global</b>, <b>v</b>, <b>@</b>, or <b>*</b> commands
    changing edit buffers during execution of their associated commands. Because
    this would almost invariably result in catastrophic failure of the editor,
    and implementations exist that do exhibit these problems,
    POSIX.1‐2008 requires that changing the edit buffer during a
    <b>global</b> or <b>v</b> command, or during a <b>@</b> or <b>*</b> command
    for which there will be more than a single execution, be an error.
    Implementations supporting multiple edit buffers simultaneously are strongly
    encouraged to apply the same semantics to switching between buffers as
  well.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>ex</i> command quoting required by POSIX.1‐2008 is a
    superset of the quoting in historical implementations of the editor. For
    example, it was not historically possible to escape a &lt;blank&gt; in a
    filename; for example, <b>:edit&nbsp;foo\\\&nbsp;bar</b> would report
    that too many filenames had been entered for the edit command, and there was
    no method of escaping a &lt;blank&gt; in the first argument of an
    <b>edit</b>, <b>ex</b>, <b>next</b>, or <b>visual</b> command at all.
    POSIX.1‐2008 extends historical practice, requiring that quoting
    behavior be made consistent across all <i>ex</i> commands, except for the
    <b>map</b>, <b>unmap</b>, <b>abbreviate</b>, and <b>unabbreviate</b>
    commands, which historically used &lt;control&gt;‐V instead of
    &lt;backslash&gt; characters for quoting. For those four commands,
    POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical practice.</p>
<p class="Pp">Backslash quoting in <i>ex</i> is non-intuitive.
    &lt;backslash&gt;-escapes are ignored unless they escape a special
    character; for example, when performing <i>file</i> argument expansion, the
    string <b>"\\%"</b> is equivalent to <b>'\%'</b>, not
    "\&lt;<i>current&nbsp;pathname</i>&gt;". This can be confusing
    for users because &lt;backslash&gt; is usually one of the characters that
    causes shell expansion to be performed, and therefore shell quoting rules
    must be taken into consideration. Generally, quoting characters are only
    considered if they escape a special character, and a quoting character must
    be provided for each layer of parsing for which the character is special. As
    another example, only a single &lt;backslash&gt; is necessary for the
    <b>'\l'</b> sequence in substitute replacement patterns, because the
    character <b>'l'</b> is not special to any parsing layer above it.</p>
<p class="Pp">&lt;control&gt;‐V quoting in <i>ex</i> is slightly
    different from backslash quoting. In the four commands where
    &lt;control&gt;‐V quoting applies (<b>abbreviate</b>,
    <b>unabbreviate</b>, <b>map</b>, and <b>unmap</b>), any character may be
    escaped by a &lt;control&gt;‐V whether it would have a special
    meaning or not. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical
    practice.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historical implementations of the editor did not require
    delimiters within character classes to be escaped; for example, the command
    <b>:s/[/]//</b> on the string <b>"xxx/yyy"</b> would delete the
    <b>'/'</b> from the string. POSIX.1‐2008 disallows this historical
    practice for consistency and because it places a large burden on
    implementations by requiring that knowledge of regular expressions be built
    into the editor parser.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, quoting &lt;newline&gt; characters in <i>ex</i>
    commands was handled inconsistently. In most cases, the &lt;newline&gt;
    character always terminated the command, regardless of any preceding escape
    character, because &lt;backslash&gt; characters did not escape
    &lt;newline&gt; characters for most <i>ex</i> commands. However, some
    <i>ex</i> commands (for example, <b>s</b>, <b>map</b>, and
    <b>abbreviation</b>) permitted &lt;newline&gt; characters to be escaped
    (although in the case of <b>map</b> and <b>abbreviation</b>,
    &lt;control&gt;‐V characters escaped them instead of
    &lt;backslash&gt; characters). This was true in not only the command line,
    but also <b>.exrc</b> and <b>source</b>d files. For example, the
  command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>map = foo&lt;control-V&gt;&lt;newline&gt;bar</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">would succeed, although it was sometimes difficult to get the
    &lt;control&gt;‐V and the inserted &lt;newline&gt; passed to the
    <i>ex</i> parser. For consistency and simplicity of specification,
    POSIX.1‐2008 requires that it be possible to escape &lt;newline&gt;
    characters in <i>ex</i> commands at all times, using &lt;backslash&gt;
    characters for most <i>ex</i> commands, and using &lt;control&gt;‐V
    characters for the <b>map</b> and <b>abbreviation</b> commands. For example,
    the command <b>print</b>&lt;newline&gt;<b>list</b> is required to be parsed
    as the single command <b>print</b>&lt;newline&gt;<b>list</b>. While this
    differs from historical practice, POSIX.1‐2008 developers believed it
    unlikely that any script or user depended on the historical behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, an error in a command specified using the <b>-c</b>
    option did not cause the rest of the <b>-c</b> commands to be discarded.
    POSIX.1‐2008 disallows this for consistency with mapped keys, the
    <b>@</b>, <b>global</b>, <b>source</b>, and <b>v</b> commands, the
    <i>EXINIT</i> environment variable, and the <b>.exrc</b> files.</p>

<h2 class="Ss">Input Editing in ex</h2>
<p class="Pp">One of the common uses of the historical <i>ex</i> editor is over
    slow network connections. Editors that run in canonical mode can require far
    less traffic to and from, and far less processing on, the host machine, as
    well as more easily supporting block-mode terminals. For these reasons,
    POSIX.1‐2008 requires that <i>ex</i> be implemented using canonical
    mode input processing, as was done historically.</p>
<p class="Pp">POSIX.1‐2008 does not require the historical 4 BSD input
    editing characters ``word erase'' or ``literal next''. For this reason, it
    is unspecified how they are handled by <i>ex</i>, although they must have
    the required effect. Implementations that resolve them after the line has
    been ended using a &lt;newline&gt; or &lt;control&gt;‐M character,
    and implementations that rely on the underlying system terminal support for
    this processing, are both conforming. Implementations are strongly urged to
    use the underlying system functionality, if at all possible, for
    compatibility with other system text input interfaces.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, when the <i>eof</i> character was used to decrement
    the <b>autoindent</b> level, the cursor moved to display the new end of the
    <b>autoindent</b> characters, but did not move the cursor to a new line, nor
    did it erase the &lt;control&gt;‐D character from the line.
    POSIX.1‐2008 does not specify that the cursor remain on the same line
    or that the rest of the line is erased; however, implementations are
    strongly encouraged to provide the best possible user interface; that is,
    the cursor should remain on the same line, and any &lt;control&gt;‐D
    character on the line should be erased.</p>
<p class="Pp">POSIX.1‐2008 does not require the historical 4 BSD input
    editing character ``reprint'', traditionally &lt;control&gt;‐R, which
    redisplayed the current input from the user. For this reason, and because
    the functionality cannot be implemented after the line has been terminated
    by the user, POSIX.1‐2008 makes no requirements about this
    functionality. Implementations are strongly urged to make this historical
    functionality available, if possible.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, &lt;control&gt;‐Q did not perform a literal
    next function in <i>ex</i>, as it did in <i>vi</i>. POSIX.1‐2008
    requires conformance to historical practice to avoid breaking historical
    <i>ex</i> scripts and <b>.exrc</b> files.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="eof"><a class="permalink" href="#eof">eof</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Whether the <i>eof</i> character immediately modifies the
    <b>autoindent</b> characters in the prompt is left unspecified so that
    implementations can conform in the presence of systems that do not support
    this functionality. Implementations are encouraged to modify the line and
    redisplay it immediately, if possible.</p>
<p class="Pp">The specification of the handling of the <i>eof</i> character
    differs from historical practice only in that <i>eof</i> characters are not
    discarded if they follow normal characters in the text input. Historically,
    they were always discarded.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">Command Descriptions in ex</h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, several commands (for example, <b>global</b>,
    <b>v</b>, <b>visual</b>, <b>s</b>, <b>write</b>, <b>wq</b>, <b>yank</b>,
    <b>!</b>, <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, and <b>~</b>) were
    executable in empty files (that is, the default address(es) were 0), or
    permitted explicit addresses of 0 (for example, 0 was a valid address, or
    0,0 was a valid range). Addresses of 0, or command execution in an empty
    file, make sense only for commands that add new text to the edit buffer or
    write commands (because users may wish to write empty files).
    POSIX.1‐2008 requires this behavior for such commands and disallows
    it otherwise, for consistency and simplicity of specification.</p>
<p class="Pp">A count to an <i>ex</i> command has been historically corrected to
    be no greater than the last line in a file; for example, in a five-line
    file, the command <b>1,6print</b> would fail, but the command
    <b>1print300</b> would succeed. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to
    historical practice.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the use of flags in <i>ex</i> commands could be
    obscure. General historical practice was as described by
    POSIX.1‐2008, but there were some special cases. For instance, the
    <b>list</b>, <b>number</b>, and <b>print</b> commands ignored trailing
    address offsets; for example, <b>3p&nbsp;+++#</b> would display line 3,
    and 3 would be the current line after the execution of the command. The
    <b>open</b> and <b>visual</b> commands ignored both the trailing offsets and
    the trailing flags. Also, flags specified to the <b>open</b> and
    <b>visual</b> commands interacted badly with the <b>list</b> edit option,
    and setting and then unsetting it during the open/visual session would cause
    <i>vi</i> to stop displaying lines in the specified format. For consistency
    and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit any of
    these exceptions to the general rule.</p>
<p class="Pp">POSIX.1‐2008 uses the word <i>copy</i> in several places
    when discussing buffers. This is not intended to imply implementation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, <i>ex</i> users could not specify numeric buffers
    because of the ambiguity this would cause; for example, in the command
    <b>3&nbsp;delete&nbsp;2</b>, it is unclear whether 2 is a buffer name or
    a <i>count</i>. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical
    practice by default, but does not preclude extensions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the contents of the unnamed buffer were frequently
    discarded after commands that did not explicitly affect it; for example,
    when using the <b>edit</b> command to switch files. For consistency and
    simplicity of specification, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this
    behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>ex</i> utility did not historically have access to the
    numeric buffers, and, furthermore, deleting lines in <i>ex</i> did not
    modify their contents. For example, if, after doing a delete in <i>vi</i>,
    the user switched to <i>ex</i>, did another delete, and then switched back
    to <i>vi</i>, the contents of the numeric buffers would not have changed.
    POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical practice. Numeric
    buffers are described in the <i>ex</i> utility in order to confine the
    description of buffers to a single location in POSIX.1‐2008.</p>
<p class="Pp">The metacharacters that trigger shell expansion in <i>file</i>
    arguments match historical practice, as does the method for doing shell
    expansion. Implementations wishing to provide users with the flexibility to
    alter the set of metacharacters are encouraged to provide a <b>shellmeta</b>
    string edit option.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, <i>ex</i> commands executed from <i>vi</i> refreshed
    the screen when it did not strictly need to do so; for example,
    <b>:!date&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;/dev/null</b> does not require a screen refresh
    because the output of the UNIX <i>date</i> command requires only a single
    line of the screen. POSIX.1‐2008 requires that the screen be
    refreshed if it has been overwritten, but makes no requirements as to how an
    implementation should make that determination. Implementations may prompt
    and refresh the screen regardless.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Abbreviate~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Abbreviate~2">Abbreviate</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Historical practice was that characters that were entered as part
    of an abbreviation replacement were subject to <b>map</b> expansions, the
    <b>showmatch</b> edit option, further abbreviation expansions, and so on;
    that is, they were logically pushed onto the terminal input queue, and were
    not a simple replacement. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to
    historical practice. Historical practice was that whenever a non-word
    character (that had not been escaped by a &lt;control&gt;‐V) was
    entered after a word character, <i>vi</i> would check for abbreviations. The
    check was based on the type of the character entered before the word
    character of the word/non-word pair that triggered the check. The word
    character of the word/non-word pair that triggered the check and all
    characters entered before the trigger pair that were of that type were
    included in the check, with the exception of &lt;blank&gt; characters, which
    always delimited the abbreviation.</p>
<p class="Pp">This means that, for the abbreviation to work, the <i>lhs</i> must
    end with a word character, there can be no transitions from word to non-word
    characters (or <i>vice versa</i>) other than between the last and
    next-to-last characters in the <i>lhs</i>, and there can be no &lt;blank&gt;
    characters in the <i>lhs</i>. In addition, because of the historical quoting
    rules, it was impossible to enter a literal &lt;control&gt;‐V in the
    <i>lhs</i>. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical practice.
    Historical implementations did not inform users when abbreviations that
    could never be used were entered; implementations are strongly encouraged to
    do so.
  <br>
</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, the following abbreviations will work:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>:ab (p  REPLACE
:ab p   REPLACE
:ab ((p REPLACE</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The following abbreviations will not work:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>:ab (   REPLACE
:ab (pp REPLACE</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Historical practice is that words on the <i>vi</i> colon command
    line were subject to abbreviation expansion, including the arguments to the
    <b>abbrev</b> (and more interestingly) the <b>unabbrev</b> command. Because
    there are implementations that do not do abbreviation expansion for the
    first argument to those commands, this is permitted, but not required, by
    POSIX.1‐2008. However, the following sequence:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>:ab foo bar
:ab foo baz</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">resulted in the addition of an abbreviation of
    <b>"baz"</b> for the string <b>"bar"</b> in historical
    <i>ex</i>/<i>vi</i>, and the sequence:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>:ab foo1 bar
:ab foo2 bar
:unabbreviate foo2</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">deleted the abbreviation <b>"foo1"</b>, not
    <b>"foo2"</b>. These behaviors are not permitted by
    POSIX.1‐2008 because they clearly violate the expectations of the
    user.</p>
<p class="Pp">It was historical practice that &lt;control&gt;‐V, not
    &lt;backslash&gt;, characters be interpreted as escaping subsequent
    characters in the <b>abbreviate</b> command. POSIX.1‐2008 requires
    conformance to historical practice; however, it should be noted that an
    abbreviation containing a &lt;blank&gt; will never work.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Append~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Append~2">Append</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, any text following a &lt;vertical-line&gt; command
    separator after an <b>append</b>, <b>change</b>, or <b>insert</b> command
    became part of the insert text. For example, in the command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>:g/pattern/append|stuff1</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">a line containing the text <b>"stuff1"</b> would be
    appended to each line matching pattern. It was also historically valid to
    enter:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>:append|stuff1
stuff2
.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">and the text on the <i>ex</i> command line would be appended along
    with the text inserted after it. There was an historical bug, however, that
    the user had to enter two terminating lines (the <b>'.'</b> lines) to
    terminate text input mode in this case. POSIX.1‐2008 requires
    conformance to historical practice, but disallows the historical need for
    multiple terminating lines.</p>

    implementation is known to have been modified such that the cursor is
    positioned on the first address specified, and not on the line before the
    first address. POSIX.1‐2008 disallows this modification for
    consistency.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>change</b> command did not support buffer

    Elements in the <b>cdpath</b> edit option are &lt;colon&gt;-separated. The

<p class="Pp">Historically, command mode maps only applied to command names; for

    character. POSIX.1‐2008 requires this behavior. Historically,
    entering &lt;control&gt;‐V as the first character of a <i>vi</i>
    command was an error. Several implementations have extended the semantics of
    <i>vi</i> such that &lt;control&gt;‐V means that the subsequent
    command character is not mapped. This is permitted, but not required, by
    POSIX.1‐2008. Regardless, using &lt;control&gt;‐V to escape
    the second or later character in a sequence of characters that might match a
    <b>map</b> command, or any character in text input mode, is historical
    practice, and stops the entered keys from matching a map.
    POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical practice.</p>

<p class="Pp">The historical implementation of the <b>map</b> command did not
    permit <b>map</b> commands that were more than a single character in length
    if the first character was printable. This behavior is permitted, but not
    required, by POSIX.1‐2008.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, mapped characters were remapped unless the
    <b>remap</b> edit option was not set, or the prefix of the mapped characters
    matched the mapping characters; for example, in the <b>map</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>:map ab abcd</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">the characters <b>"ab"</b> were used as is and were not
    remapped, but the characters <b>"cd"</b> were mapped if
    appropriate. This can cause infinite loops in the <i>vi</i> mapping
    mechanisms. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical practice,
    and that such loops be interruptible.</p>
<p class="Pp">Text input maps had the same problems with expanding the
    <i>lhs</i> for the <i>ex</i> <b>map!</b> and <b>unmap!</b> command as did
    the <i>ex</i> <b>abbreviate</b> and <b>unabbreviate</b> commands. See the
    RATIONALE for the <i>ex</i> <b>abbreviate</b> command. POSIX.1‐2008
    requires similar modification of some historical practice for the <b>map</b>
    and <b>unmap</b> commands, as described for the <b>abbreviate</b> and
    <b>unabbreviate</b> commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, <b>map</b>s that were subsets of other <b>map</b>s
    behaved differently depending on the order in which they were defined. For
    example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>:map! ab     short
:map! abc    long</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">would always translate the characters <b>"ab"</b> to
    <b>"short"</b>, regardless of how fast the characters
    <b>"abc"</b> were entered. If the entry order was reversed:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>:map! abc    long
:map! ab     short</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">the characters <b>"ab"</b> would cause the editor to
    pause, waiting for the completing <b>'c'</b> character, and the characters
    might never be mapped to <b>"short"</b>. For consistency and
    simplicity of specification, POSIX.1‐2008 requires that the shortest
    match be used at all times.</p>
<p class="Pp">The length of time the editor spends waiting for the characters to
    complete the <i>lhs</i> is unspecified because the timing capabilities of
    systems are often inexact and variable, and it may depend on other factors
    such as the speed of the connection. The time should be long enough for the
    user to be able to complete the sequence, but not long enough for the user
    to have to wait. Some implementations of <i>vi</i> have added a
    <b>keytime</b> option, which permits users to set the number of 0,1 seconds
    the editor waits for the completing characters. Because mapped terminal
    function and cursor keys tend to start with an &lt;ESC&gt; character, and
    &lt;ESC&gt; is the key ending <i>vi</i> text input mode, <b>map</b>s
    starting with &lt;ESC&gt; characters are generally exempted from this
    timeout period, or, at least timed out differently.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Mark~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Mark~2">Mark</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, users were able to set the ``previous context''
    marks explicitly. In addition, the <i>ex</i> commands <b>''</b> and
    <b>'`</b> and the <i>vi</i> commands <b>''</b>, <b>``</b>, <b>`'</b>, and
    <b>'`</b> all referred to the same mark. In addition, the previous context
    marks were not set if the command, with which the address setting the mark
    was associated, failed. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to
    historical practice. Historically, if marked lines were deleted, the mark
    was also deleted, but would reappear if the change was undone.
    POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical practice.</p>
<p class="Pp">The description of the special events that set the <b>`</b> and
    <b>'</b> marks matches historical practice. For example, historically the

    (for example, <b>insert</b> and <b>append</b>) were known to confuse
    historical implementations. POSIX.1‐2008 requires that any command be
    permitted and that it behave as specified. The <b>next</b> command can
    accept more than one file, so usage such as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>next `ls [abc] `</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">is valid; it need not be valid for the <b>edit</b> or <b>read</b>
    commands, for example, because they expect only one filename.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>next</b> command behaved differently from the
    <b>:rewind</b> command in that it ignored the force flag if the
    <b>autowrite</b> flag was set. For consistency, POSIX.1‐2008 does not
    permit this behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>next</b> command positioned the cursor as if
    the file had never been edited before, regardless. POSIX.1‐2008 does
    not permit this behavior, for consistency with the <b>edit</b> command.</p>
<p class="Pp">Implementations wanting to provide a counterpart to the
    <b>next</b> command that edited the previous file have used the command
    <b>prev[ious],</b> which takes no <i>file</i> argument. POSIX.1‐2008
    does not require this command.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Open~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Open~2">Open</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>open</b> command would fail if the
    <b>open</b> edit option was not set. POSIX.1‐2008 does not mention
    the <b>open</b> edit option and does not require this behavior. Some
    historical implementations do not permit entering open mode from open or
    visual mode, only from <i>ex</i> mode. For consistency, POSIX.1‐2008
    does not permit this behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, entering open mode from the command line (that is,
    <i>vi</i> <b>+open</b>) resulted in anomalous behaviors; for example, the
    <i>ex</i> file and <i>set</i> commands, and the <i>vi</i> command
    &lt;control&gt;‐G did not work. For consistency, POSIX.1‐2008
    does not permit this behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>open</b> command only permitted <b>'/'</b>
    characters to be used as the search pattern delimiter. For consistency,
    POSIX.1‐2008 requires that the search delimiters used by the

<p class="Pp">Historical documentation stated that mail was not sent to the user

<h2 class="Ss" id="Print~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Print~2">Print</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The writing of NUL by the <b>print</b> command is not specified as
    a special case because the standard developers did not want to require
    <i>ex</i> to support NUL characters. Historically, characters were displayed
    using the ARPA standard mappings, which are as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> 1.</dt>
  <dd>Printable characters are left alone.</dd>
  <dt> 2.</dt>
  <dd>Control characters less than \177 are represented as <b>'^'</b> followed
      by the character offset from the <b>'@'</b> character in the ASCII map;
      for example, \007 is represented as <b>'^G'</b>.</dd>
  <dt> 3.</dt>
  <dd>\177 is represented as <b>'^'</b> followed by <b>'?'</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The display of characters having their eighth bit set was less
    standard. Existing implementations use hex (0x00), octal (\000), and a
    meta-bit display. (The latter displayed bytes that had their eighth bit set
    as the two characters <b>"M-"</b> followed by the seven-bit
    display as described above.) The latter probably has the best claim to
    historical practice because it was used for the <b>-v</b> option of 4 BSD
    and 4 BSD-derived versions of the <i>cat</i> utility since 1980.</p>
<p class="Pp">No specific display format is required by POSIX.1‐2008.</p>
<p class="Pp">Explicit dependence on the ASCII character set has been avoided
    where possible, hence the use of the phrase an ``implementation-defined
    multi-character sequence'' for the display of non-printable characters in
    preference to the historical usage of, for instance, <b>"^I"</b>
    for the &lt;tab&gt;. Implementations are encouraged to conform to historical
    practice in the absence of any strong reason to diverge.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, all <i>ex</i> commands beginning with the letter
    <b>'p'</b> could be entered using capitalized versions of the commands; for
    example, <b>P[rint]</b>, <b>Pre[serve]</b>, and <b>Pu[t]</b> were all valid
    command names. POSIX.1‐2008 permits, but does not require, this
    historical practice because capital forms of the commands are used by some
    implementations for other purposes.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Put~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Put~2">Put</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, an <i>ex</i> <b>put</b> command, executed from open
    or visual mode, was the same as the open or visual mode <b>P</b> command, if
    the buffer was named and was cut in character mode, and the same as the
    <b>p</b> command if the buffer was named and cut in line mode. If the
    unnamed buffer was the source of the text, the entire line from which the
    text was taken was usually <b>put</b>, and the buffer was handled as if in
    line mode, but it was possible to get extremely anomalous behavior. In
    addition, using the <b>Q</b> command to switch into <i>ex</i> mode, and then
    doing a <b>put</b> often resulted in errors as well, such as appending text
    that was unrelated to the (supposed) contents of the buffer. For consistency
    and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit these
    behaviors. All <i>ex</i> <b>put</b> commands are required to operate in line
    mode, and the contents of the buffers are not altered by changing the mode
    of the editor.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Read~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Read~2">Read</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, an <i>ex</i> <b>read</b> command executed from open
    or visual mode, executed in an empty file, left an empty line as the first
    line of the file. For consistency and simplicity of specification,
    POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior. Historically, a
    <b>read</b> in open or visual mode from a program left the cursor at the
    last line read in, not the first. For consistency, POSIX.1‐2008 does
    not permit this behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historical implementations of <i>ex</i> were unable to undo
    <b>read</b> commands that read from the output of a program. For
    consistency, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> message after a
    successful <b>read</b> or <b>write</b> command specified ``characters'', not
    ``bytes''. POSIX.1‐2008 requires that the number of bytes be
    displayed, not the number of characters, because it may be difficult in
    multi-byte implementations to determine the number of characters read.
    Implementations are encouraged to clarify the message displayed to the
  user.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, reads were not permitted on files other than type
    regular, except that FIFO files could be read (probably only because they
    did not exist when <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> were originally written). Because
    the historical <i>ex</i> evaluated <b>read!</b> and <b>read&nbsp;!</b>
    equivalently, there can be no optional way to force the read.
    POSIX.1‐2008 permits, but does not require, this behavior.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Recover~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Recover~2">Recover</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Some historical implementations of the editor permitted users to
    recover the edit buffer contents from a previous edit session, and then exit
    without saving those contents (or explicitly discarding them). The intent of
    POSIX.1‐2008 in requiring that the edit buffer be treated as already

<p class="Pp">Historical implementations supported the <b>rewind</b> command

    the <b>rewind</b> command would edit. POSIX.1‐2008 requires
    conformance to historical practice.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Substitute~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Substitute~2">Substitute</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, <i>ex</i> accepted an <b>r</b> option to the
    <b>s</b> command. The effect of the <b>r</b> option was to use the last
    regular expression used in any command as the pattern, the same as the
    <b>~</b> command. The <b>r</b> option is not required by
    POSIX.1‐2008. Historically, the <b>c</b> and <b>g</b> options were
    toggled; for example, the command <b>:s/abc/def/</b> was the same as
    <b>s/abc/def/ccccgggg</b>. For simplicity of specification,
    POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">The tilde command is often used to replace the last search RE. For
    example, in the sequence:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>s/red/blue/
/green
~</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">the <b>~</b> command is equivalent to:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>s/green/blue/</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Historically, <i>ex</i> accepted all of the following forms:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>s/abc/def/
s/abc/def
s/abc/
s/abc</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to this historical
    practice.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>s</b> command presumes that the <b>'^'</b> character only
    occupies a single column in the display. Much of the <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i>
    specification presumes that the &lt;space&gt; only occupies a single column
    in the display. There are no known character sets for which this is not
    true.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the final column position for the substitute
    commands was based on previous column movements; a search for a pattern
    followed by a substitution would leave the column position unchanged, while
    a 0 command followed by a substitution would change the column position to
    the first non-&lt;blank&gt;. For consistency and simplicity of
    specification, POSIX.1‐2008 requires that the final column position
    always be set to the first non-&lt;blank&gt;.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Set~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Set~2">Set</a></h2>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Tag~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Tag~2">Tag</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">No requirement is made as to where <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> shall
    look for the file referenced by the tag entry. Historical practice has been
    to look for the path found in the <b>tags</b> file, based on the current
    directory. A useful extension found in some implementations is to look based
    on the directory containing the tags file that held the entry, as well. No
    requirement is made as to which reference for the tag in the tags file is
    used. This is deliberate, in order to permit extensions such as multiple
    entries in a tags file for a tag.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because users often specify many different tags files, some of
    which need not be relevant or exist at any particular time,
    POSIX.1‐2008 requires that error messages about problem tags files be
    displayed only if the requested tag is not found, and then, only once for
    each time that the <b>tag</b> edit option is changed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The requirement that the current edit buffer be unmodified is only
    necessary if the file indicated by the tag entry is not the same as the
    current file (as defined by the current pathname). Historically, the file
    would be reloaded if the filename had changed, as well as if the filename
    was different from the current pathname. For consistency and simplicity of
    specification, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior, requiring
    that the name be the only factor in the decision.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, <i>vi</i> only searched for tags in the current file
    from the current cursor to the end of the file, and therefore, if the
    <b>wrapscan</b> option was not set, tags occurring before the current cursor
    were not found. POSIX.1‐2008 considers this a bug, and
    implementations are required to search for the first occurrence in the file,
    regardless.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Undo~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Undo~2">Undo</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <b>undo</b> description deliberately uses the word
    ``modified''. The <b>undo</b> command is not intended to undo commands that
    replace the contents of the edit buffer, such as <b>edit</b>, <b>next</b>,
    <b>tag</b>, or <b>recover</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Cursor positioning after the <b>undo</b> command was inconsistent
    in the historical <i>vi</i>, sometimes attempting to restore the original
    cursor position (<b>global</b>, <b>undo</b>, and <b>v</b> commands), and
    sometimes, in the presence of maps, placing the cursor on the last line
    added or changed instead of the first. POSIX.1‐2008 requires a
    simplified behavior for consistency and simplicity of specification.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Version~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Version~2">Version</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <b>version</b> command cannot be exactly specified since there

    intelligent.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Write~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Write~2">Write</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> message after a
    successful <b>read</b> or <b>write</b> command specified ``characters'', not
    ``bytes''. POSIX.1‐2008 requires that the number of bytes be
    displayed, not the number of characters because it may be difficult in
    multi-byte implementations to determine the number of characters written.
    Implementations are encouraged to clarify the message displayed to the
  user.</p>
<p class="Pp">Implementation-defined tests are permitted so that implementations
    can make additional checks; for example, for locks or file modification
    times.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, attempting to append to a nonexistent file caused an
    error. It has been left unspecified in POSIX.1‐2008 to permit
    implementations to let the <b>write</b> succeed, so that the append
    semantics are similar to those of the historical <i>csh</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historical <i>vi</i> permitted empty edit buffers to be written.
    However, since the way <i>vi</i> got around dealing with ``empty'' files was
    to always have a line in the edit buffer, no matter what, it wrote them as
    files of a single, empty line. POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this
    behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, <i>ex</i> restored standard output and standard
    error to their values as of when <i>ex</i> was invoked, before writes to
    programs were performed. This could disturb the terminal configuration as
    well as be a security issue for some terminals. POSIX.1‐2008 does not
    permit this, requiring that the program output be captured and displayed as
    if by the <i>ex</i> <b>print</b> command.</p>

<h2 class="Ss">Adjust Window</h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the line count was set to the value of the

    broken on most historical implementations long ago, however, and is not
    documented anywhere. For this reason, POSIX.1‐2008 is resolutely
    silent.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>z</b> command was &lt;blank&gt;-sensitive and
    <b>z&nbsp;+</b> and <b>z&nbsp;-</b> did different things than <b>z+</b>
    and <b>z-</b> because the type could not be distinguished from a flag. (The
    commands <b>z&nbsp;.</b> and <b>z&nbsp;=</b> were historically invalid.)
    POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to this historical practice.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>z</b> command was further
    &lt;blank&gt;-sensitive in that the <i>count</i> could not be
    &lt;blank&gt;-delimited; for example, the commands <b>z=&nbsp;5</b> and
    <b>z-&nbsp;5</b> were also invalid. Because the <i>count</i> is not

    edit buffer. This is not required by POSIX.1‐2008; implementations
    are encouraged to provide it if possible. Historically, the

<h2 class="Ss">Write Line Number</h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <i>ex</i> <b>=</b> command, when executed in

<p class="Pp">Historically, <i>ex</i> did not correctly handle the inclusion of
    text input commands (that is, <b>append</b>, <b>insert</b>, and
    <b>change</b>) in executed buffers. POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this
    exclusion for consistency.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the logical contents of the buffer being executed
    did not change if the buffer itself were modified by the commands being
    executed; that is, buffer execution did not support self-modifying code.
    POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical practice.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>@</b> command took a range of lines, and the
    <b>@</b> buffer was executed once per line, with the current line
    (<b>'.'</b>) set to each specified line. POSIX.1‐2008 requires
    conformance to historical practice.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some historical implementations did not notice if errors occurred
    during buffer execution. This, coupled with the ability to specify a range
    of lines for the <i>ex</i> <b>@</b> command, makes it trivial to cause them
    to drop <b>core</b>. POSIX.1‐2008 requires that implementations stop
    buffer execution if any error occurs, if the specified line doesn't exist,
    or if the contents of the edit buffer itself are replaced (for example, the
    buffer executes the <i>ex</i> <b>:edit</b> command).</p>

    regular expression engine. So, if the characters contained the string
    <b>"a.,"</b> they would match <b>'a'</b> followed by

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="extended"><a class="permalink" href="#extended"><b>extended</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The <b>extended</b> edit option has been used in some implementations of
      <i>vi</i> to provide extended regular expressions instead of basic regular
      expressions This option was omitted from POSIX.1‐2008 because it is
      not widespread historical practice.</dd>
  <dt id="flash"><a class="permalink" href="#flash"><b>flash</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The <b>flash</b> edit option historically caused the screen to flash
      instead of beeping on error. This option was omitted from
      POSIX.1‐2008 because it is not found in some historical
      implementations.</dd>
  <dt id="hardtabs"><a class="permalink" href="#hardtabs"><b>hardtabs</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The <b>hardtabs</b> edit option historically defined the number of columns
      between hardware tab settings. This option was omitted from
      POSIX.1‐2008 because it was believed to no longer be generally
      useful.</dd>
  <dt id="modeline"><a class="permalink" href="#modeline"><b>modeline</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The <b>modeline</b> (sometimes named <b>modelines</b>) edit option
      historically caused <i>ex</i> or <i>vi</i> to read the five first and last
      lines of the file for editor commands. This option is a security problem,
      and vendors are strongly encouraged to delete it from historical
      implementations.</dd>
  <dt id="open"><a class="permalink" href="#open"><b>open</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The <b>open</b> edit option historically disallowed the <i>ex</i>
      <b>open</b> and <b>visual</b> commands. This edit option was omitted
      because these commands are required by POSIX.1‐2008.</dd>
  <dt id="optimize"><a class="permalink" href="#optimize"><b>optimize</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The <b>optimize</b> edit option historically expedited text throughput by
      setting the terminal to not do automatic &lt;carriage-return&gt;
      characters when printing more than one logical line of output. This option
      was omitted from POSIX.1‐2008 because it was intended for terminals
      without addressable cursors, which are rarely, if ever, still used.</dd>
  <dt id="ruler"><a class="permalink" href="#ruler"><b>ruler</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The <b>ruler</b> edit option has been used in some implementations of
      <i>vi</i> to present a current row/column ruler for the user. This option
      was omitted from POSIX.1‐2008 because it is not widespread
      historical practice.</dd>
  <dt id="sourceany"><a class="permalink" href="#sourceany"><b>sourceany</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The <b>sourceany</b> edit option historically caused <i>ex</i> or
      <i>vi</i> to source start-up files that were owned by users other than the
      user running the editor. This option is a security problem, and vendors
      are strongly encouraged to remove it from their implementations.</dd>
  <dt id="timeout"><a class="permalink" href="#timeout"><b>timeout</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The <b>timeout</b> edit option historically enabled the (now standard)
      feature of only waiting for a short period before returning keys that
      could be part of a macro. This feature was omitted from
      POSIX.1‐2008 because its behavior is now standard, it is not widely
      useful, and it was rarely documented.</dd>
  <dt id="verbose"><a class="permalink" href="#verbose"><b>verbose</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The <b>verbose</b> edit option has been used in some implementations of
      <i>vi</i> to cause <i>vi</i> to output error messages for common errors;
      for example, attempting to move the cursor past the beginning or end of
      the line instead of only alerting the screen. (The historical <i>vi</i>
      only alerted the terminal and presented no message for such errors. The
      historical editor option <b>terse</b> did not select when to present error
      messages, it only made existing error messages more or less verbose.) This
      option was omitted from POSIX.1‐2008 because it is not widespread
      historical practice; however, implementors are encouraged to use it if
      they wish to provide error messages for naive users.</dd>
  <dt id="wraplen"><a class="permalink" href="#wraplen"><b>wraplen</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The <b>wraplen</b> edit option has been used in some implementations of
      <i>vi</i> to specify an automatic margin measured from the left margin
      instead of from the right margin. This is useful when multiple screen
      sizes are being used to edit a single file. This option was omitted from
      POSIX.1‐2008 because it is not widespread historical practice;
      however, implementors are encouraged to use it if they add this
      functionality.</dd>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">autoindent, ai</h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the command <b>0a</b> did not do any
    autoindentation, regardless of the current indentation of line 1.
    POSIX.1‐2008 requires that any indentation present in line 1 be
  used.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">autoprint, ap</h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>autoprint</b> edit option was not completely
    consistent or based solely on modifications to the edit buffer. Exceptions
    were the <b>read</b> command (when reading from a file, but not from a
    filter), the <b>append</b>, <b>change</b>, <b>insert</b>, <b>global</b>, and
    <b>v</b> commands, all of which were not affected by <b>autoprint</b>, and
    the <b>tag</b> command, which was affected by <b>autoprint</b>.
    POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical practice.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>autoprint</b> option only applied to the last
    of multiple commands entered using &lt;vertical-line&gt; delimiters; for
    example, <b>delete</b> &lt;newline&gt; was affected by <b>autoprint</b>, but
    <b>delete|version</b> &lt;newline&gt; was not. POSIX.1‐2008 requires
    conformance to historical practice.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">autowrite, aw</h2>
<p class="Pp">Appending the <b>'!'</b> character to the <i>ex</i> <b>next</b>
    command to avoid performing an automatic write was not supported in
    historical implementations. POSIX.1‐2008 requires that the behavior
    match the other <i>ex</i> commands for consistency.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">ignorecase, ic</h2>
<p class="Pp">Historical implementations of case-insensitive matching (the
    <b>ignorecase</b> edit option) lead to counter-intuitive situations when
    uppercase characters were used in range expressions. Historically, the
    process was as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> 1.</dt>
  <dd>Take a line of text from the edit buffer.</dd>
  <dt> 2.</dt>
  <dd>Convert uppercase to lowercase in text line.</dd>
  <dt> 3.</dt>
  <dd>Convert uppercase to lowercase in regular expressions, except in character
      class specifications.</dd>
  <dt> 4.</dt>
  <dd>Match regular expressions against text.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">This would mean that, with <b>ignorecase</b> in effect, the
  text:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>The cat sat on the mat</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">would be matched by</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>/^the/</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">but not by:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>/^[A-Z]he/</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">For consistency with other commands implementing regular
    expressions, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">paragraphs, para</h2>
<p class="Pp">The ISO&nbsp;POSIX‐2:1993 standard made the default
    <b>paragraphs</b> and <b>sections</b> edit options implementation-defined,
    arguing they were historically oriented to the UNIX system <i>troff</i> text
    formatter, and a ``portable user'' could use the <b>{</b>, <b>}</b>,
    <b>[[</b>, <b>]]</b>, <b>(</b>, and <b>)</b> commands in open or visual mode
    and have the cursor stop in unexpected places. POSIX.1‐2008 specifies
    their values in the POSIX locale because the unusual grouping (they only
    work when grouped into two characters at a time) means that they cannot be
    used for general-purpose movement, regardless.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="readonly~2"><a class="permalink" href="#readonly~2">readonly</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Implementations are encouraged to provide the best possible
    information to the user as to the read-only status of the file, with the
    exception that they should not consider the current special privileges of
    the process. This provides users with a safety net because they must force
    the overwrite of read-only files, even when running with additional
    privileges.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>readonly</b> edit option specification largely conforms to
    historical practice. The only difference is that historical implementations
    did not notice that the user had set the <b>readonly</b> edit option in
    cases where the file was already marked read-only for some reason, and would
    therefore reinitialize the <b>readonly</b> edit option the next time the
    contents of the edit buffer were replaced. This behavior is disallowed by
    POSIX.1‐2008.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="report~2"><a class="permalink" href="#report~2">report</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The requirement that lines copied to a buffer interact differently
    than deleted lines is historical practice. For example, if the <b>report</b>
    edit option is set to 3, deleting 3 lines will cause a report to be written,
    but 4 lines must be copied before a report is written.</p>
<p class="Pp">The requirement that the <i>ex</i> <b>global</b>, <b>v</b>,
    <b>open</b>, <b>undo</b>, and <b>visual</b> commands present reports based
    on the total number of lines added or deleted during the command execution,
    and that commands executed by the <b>global</b> and <b>v</b> commands not
    present reports, is historical practice. POSIX.1‐2008 extends
    historical practice by requiring that buffer execution be treated similarly.
    The reasons for this are two-fold. Historically, only the report by the last
    command executed from the buffer would be seen by the user, as each new
    report would overwrite the last. In addition, the standard developers
    believed that buffer execution had more in common with <b>global</b> and
    <b>v</b> commands than it did with other <i>ex</i> commands, and should
    behave similarly, for consistency and simplicity of specification.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">showmatch, sm</h2>
<p class="Pp">The length of time the cursor spends on the matching character is
    unspecified because the timing capabilities of systems are often inexact and
    variable. The time should be long enough for the user to notice, but not
    long enough for the user to become annoyed. Some implementations of
    <i>vi</i> have added a <b>matchtime</b> option that permits users to set the
    number of 0,1 second intervals the cursor pauses on the matching
  character.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="showmode~2"><a class="permalink" href="#showmode~2">showmode</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <b>showmode</b> option has been used in some historical
    implementations of <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> to display the current editing
    mode when in open or visual mode. The editing modes have generally included
    ``command'' and ``input'', and sometimes other modes such as ``replace'' and
    ``change''. The string was usually displayed on the bottom line of the
    screen at the far right-hand corner. In addition, a preceding <b>'*'</b>
    character often denoted whether the contents of the edit buffer had been
    modified. The latter display has sometimes been part of the <b>showmode</b>
    option, and sometimes based on another option. This option was not available
    in the 4 BSD historical implementation of <i>vi</i>, but was viewed as
    generally useful, particularly to novice users, and is required by
    POSIX.1‐2008.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>smd</b> shorthand for the <b>showmode</b> option was not
    present in all historical implementations of the editor. POSIX.1‐2008
    requires it, for consistency.</p>
<p class="Pp">Not all historical implementations of the editor displayed a mode
    string for command mode, differentiating command mode from text input mode
    by the absence of a mode string. POSIX.1‐2008 permits this behavior
    for consistency with historical practice, but implementations are encouraged
    to provide a display string for both modes.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="slowopen~2"><a class="permalink" href="#slowopen~2">slowopen</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>slowopen</b> option was automatically set if
    the terminal baud rate was less than 1200 baud, or if the baud rate was 1200
    baud and the <b>redraw</b> option was not set. The <b>slowopen</b> option
    had two effects. First, when inserting characters in the middle of a line,
    characters after the cursor would not be pushed ahead, but would appear to
    be overwritten. Second, when creating a new line of text, lines after the
    current line would not be scrolled down, but would appear to be overwritten.
    In both cases, ending text input mode would cause the screen to be refreshed
    to match the actual contents of the edit buffer. Finally, terminals that
    were sufficiently intelligent caused the editor to ignore the
    <b>slowopen</b> option. POSIX.1‐2008 permits most historical
    behavior, extending historical practice to require <b>slowopen</b> behaviors
    if the edit option is set by the user.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="tags~2"><a class="permalink" href="#tags~2">tags</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The default path for tags files is left unspecified as
    implementations may have their own <b>tags</b> implementations that do not
    correspond to the historical ones. The default <b>tags</b> option value
    should probably at least include the file <b>./tags</b>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="term~2"><a class="permalink" href="#term~2">term</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Historical implementations of <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> ignored
    changes to the <b>term</b> edit option after the initial terminal
    information was loaded. This is permitted by POSIX.1‐2008; however,
    implementations are encouraged to permit the user to modify their terminal
    type at any time.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="terse~2"><a class="permalink" href="#terse~2">terse</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>terse</b> edit option optionally provided a
    shorter, less descriptive error message, for some error messages. This is
    permitted, but not required, by POSIX.1‐2008. Historically, most
    common visual mode errors (for example, trying to move the cursor past the
    end of a line) did not result in an error message, but simply alerted the
    terminal. Implementations wishing to provide messages for novice users are
    urged to do so based on the <b>edit</b> option <b>verbose</b>, and not
    <b>terse</b>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="window~2"><a class="permalink" href="#window~2">window</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In historical implementations, the default for the <b>window</b>
    edit option was based on the baud rate as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> 1.</dt>
  <dd>If the baud rate was less than 1200, the <b>edit</b> option <b>w300</b>
      set the window value; for example, the line:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>set w300=12</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">would set the window option to 12 if the baud rate was less than
    1200.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> 2.</dt>
  <dd>If the baud rate was equal to 1200, the <b>edit</b> option <b>w1200</b>
      set the window value.</dd>
  <dt> 3.</dt>
  <dd>If the baud rate was greater than 1200, the <b>edit</b> option
      <b>w9600</b> set the window value.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The <b>w300</b>, <b>w1200</b>, and <b>w9600</b> options do not
    appear in POSIX.1‐2008 because of their dependence on specific baud
    rates.</p>
<p class="Pp">In historical implementations, the size of the window displayed by
    various commands was related to, but not necessarily the same as, the
    <b>window</b> edit option. For example, the size of the window was set by
    the <i>ex</i> command <b>visual 10</b>, but it did not change the value of
    the <b>window</b> edit option. However, changing the value of the
    <b>window</b> edit option did change the number of lines that were displayed
    when the screen was repainted. POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this
    behavior in the interests of consistency and simplicity of specification,
    and requires that all commands that change the number of lines that are
    displayed do it by setting the value of the <b>window</b> edit option.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">wrapmargin, wm</h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>wrapmargin</b> option did not affect maps
    inserting characters that also had associated <i>count</i>s; for example
    <b>:map&nbsp;K&nbsp;5aABC&nbsp;DEF</b>. Unfortunately, there are
    widely used maps that depend on this behavior. For consistency and
    simplicity of specification, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this
    behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, <b>wrapmargin</b> was calculated using the column
    display width of all characters on the screen. For example, an
    implementation using <b>"^I"</b> to represent &lt;tab&gt;
    characters when the <b>list</b> edit option was set, where <b>'^'</b> and
    <b>'I'</b> each took up a single column on the screen, would calculate the
    <b>wrapmargin</b> based on a value of 2 for each &lt;tab&gt;. The
    <b>number</b> edit option similarly changed the effective length of the line
    as well. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical
  practice.</p>
<p class="Pp">Earlier versions of this standard allowed for implementations with
    bytes other than eight bits, but this has been modified in this version.</p>
