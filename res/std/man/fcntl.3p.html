<p class="Pp">The <i>fcntl</i>() function shall perform the operations described
    below on open files. The <i>fildes</i> argument is a file descriptor.</p>
<p class="Pp">The available values for <i>cmd</i> are defined in
    <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i> and are as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="F_DUPFD"><a class="permalink" href="#F_DUPFD">F_DUPFD</a></dt>
  <dd>Return a new file descriptor which shall be allocated as described in
      <i>Section 2.14</i>, <i>File Descriptor Allocation</i>, except that it
      shall be the lowest numbered available file descriptor greater than or
      equal to the third argument, <i>arg</i>, taken as an integer of type
      <b>int</b>. The new file descriptor shall refer to the same open file
      description as the original file descriptor, and shall share any locks.
      The FD_CLOEXEC flag associated with the new file descriptor shall be
      cleared to keep the file open across calls to one of the <i>exec</i>
      functions.</dd>

  <dd>Get the file descriptor flags defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i> that are
      associated with the file descriptor <i>fildes</i>. File descriptor flags
      are associated with a single file descriptor and do not affect other file
      descriptors that refer to the same file.</dd>
  <dt id="F_SETFD"><a class="permalink" href="#F_SETFD">F_SETFD</a></dt>
  <dd>Set the file descriptor flags defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>, that are
      associated with <i>fildes</i>, to the third argument, <i>arg</i>, taken as
      type <b>int</b>. If the FD_CLOEXEC flag in the third argument is 0, the
      file descriptor shall remain open across the <i>exec</i> functions;
      otherwise, the file descriptor shall be closed upon successful execution
      of one of the <i>exec</i> functions.</dd>
  <dt id="F_GETFL"><a class="permalink" href="#F_GETFL">F_GETFL</a></dt>
  <dd>Get the file status flags and file access modes, defined in
      <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>, for the file description associated with
      <i>fildes</i>. The file access modes can be extracted from the return
      value using the mask O_ACCMODE, which is defined in
      <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>. File status flags and file access modes are
      associated with the file description and do not affect other file
      descriptors that refer to the same file with different open file
      descriptions. The flags returned may include non-standard file status
      flags which the application did not set, provided that these additional
      flags do not alter the behavior of a conforming application.</dd>
  <dt id="F_SETFL"><a class="permalink" href="#F_SETFL">F_SETFL</a></dt>
  <dd>Set the file status flags, defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>, for the file
      description associated with <i>fildes</i> from the corresponding bits in
      the third argument, <i>arg</i>, taken as type <b>int</b>. Bits
      corresponding to the file access mode and the file creation flags, as
      defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>, that are set in <i>arg</i> shall be
      ignored. If any bits in <i>arg</i> other than those mentioned here are
      changed by the application, the result is unspecified. If <i>fildes</i>
      does not support non-blocking operations, it is unspecified whether the
      O_NONBLOCK flag will be ignored.</dd>
  <dt id="F_GETOWN"><a class="permalink" href="#F_GETOWN">F_GETOWN</a></dt>
  <dd>If <i>fildes</i> refers to a socket, get the process ID or process group
      ID specified to receive SIGURG signals when out-of-band data is available.
      Positive values shall indicate a process ID; negative values, other than
      -1, shall indicate a process group ID; the value zero shall indicate that
      no SIGURG signals are to be sent. If <i>fildes</i> does not refer to a
      socket, the results are unspecified.</dd>
  <dt id="F_SETOWN"><a class="permalink" href="#F_SETOWN">F_SETOWN</a></dt>
  <dd>If <i>fildes</i> refers to a socket, set the process ID or process group
      ID specified to receive SIGURG signals when out-of-band data is available,
      using the value of the third argument, <i>arg</i>, taken as type
      <b>int</b>. Positive values shall indicate a process ID; negative values,
      other than -1, shall indicate a process group ID; the value zero shall
      indicate that no SIGURG signals are to be sent. Each time a SIGURG signal
      is sent to the specified process or process group, permission checks
      equivalent to those performed by <i>kill</i>() shall be performed, as if
      <i>kill</i>() were called by a process with the same real user ID,
      effective user ID, and privileges that the process calling <i>fcntl</i>()
      has at the time of the call; if the <i>kill</i>() call would fail, no
      signal shall be sent. These permission checks may also be performed by the
      <i>fcntl</i>() call. If the process specified by <i>arg</i> later
      terminates, or the process group specified by <i>arg</i> later becomes
      empty, while still being specified to receive SIGURG signals when
      out-of-band data is available from <i>fildes</i>, then no signals shall be
      sent to any subsequently created process that has the same process ID or
      process group ID, regardless of permission; it is unspecified whether this
      is achieved by the equivalent of a <i>fcntl</i>(<i>fildes</i>, F_SETOWN,
      0) call at the time the process terminates or is waited for or the process
      group becomes empty, or by other means. If <i>fildes</i> does not refer to
      a socket, the results are unspecified.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The following values for <i>cmd</i> are available for advisory
    record locking. Record locking shall be supported for regular files, and may
    be supported for other files.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="F_GETLK"><a class="permalink" href="#F_GETLK">F_GETLK</a></dt>
  <dd>Get any lock which blocks the lock description pointed to by the third
      argument, <i>arg</i>, taken as a pointer to type <b>struct flock</b>,
      defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>. The information retrieved shall
      overwrite the information passed to <i>fcntl</i>() in the structure
      <b>flock</b>. If no lock is found that would prevent this lock from being
      created, then the structure shall be left unchanged except for the lock
      type which shall be set to F_UNLCK.</dd>
  <dt id="F_SETLK"><a class="permalink" href="#F_SETLK">F_SETLK</a></dt>
  <dd>Set or clear a file segment lock according to the lock description pointed
      to by the third argument, <i>arg</i>, taken as a pointer to type <b>struct
      flock</b>, defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>. F_SETLK can establish shared
      (or read) locks (F_RDLCK) or exclusive (or write) locks (F_WRLCK), as well
      as to remove either type of lock (F_UNLCK). F_RDLCK, F_WRLCK, and F_UNLCK
      are defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>. If a shared or exclusive lock
      cannot be set, <i>fcntl</i>() shall return immediately with a return value
      of -1.</dd>
  <dt id="F_SETLKW"><a class="permalink" href="#F_SETLKW">F_SETLKW</a></dt>
  <dd>This command shall be equivalent to F_SETLK except that if a shared or
      exclusive lock is blocked by other locks, the thread shall wait until the
      request can be satisfied. If a signal that is to be caught is received
      while <i>fcntl</i>() is waiting for a region, <i>fcntl</i>() shall be
      interrupted. Upon return from the signal handler, <i>fcntl</i>() shall
      return -1 with <i>errno</i> set to <b>[EINTR]</b>, and the lock operation
      shall not be done.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Additional implementation-defined values for <i>cmd</i> may be
    defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>. Their names shall start with F_.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a shared lock is set on a segment of a file, other processes
    shall be able to set shared locks on that segment or a portion of it. A
    shared lock prevents any other process from setting an exclusive lock on any
    portion of the protected area. A request for a shared lock shall fail if the
    file descriptor was not opened with read access.</p>
<p class="Pp">An exclusive lock shall prevent any other process from setting a
    shared lock or an exclusive lock on any portion of the protected area. A
    request for an exclusive lock shall fail if the file descriptor was not
    opened with write access.</p>
<p class="Pp">The structure <b>flock</b> describes the type (<i>l_type</i>),
    starting offset (<i>l_whence</i>), relative offset (<i>l_start</i>), size
    (<i>l_len</i>), and process ID (<i>l_pid</i>) of the segment of the file to
    be affected.</p>
<p class="Pp">The value of <i>l_whence</i> is SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, or SEEK_END,
    to indicate that the relative offset <i>l_start</i> bytes shall be measured
    from the start of the file, current position, or end of the file,
    respectively. The value of <i>l_len</i> is the number of consecutive bytes
    to be locked. The value of <i>l_len</i> may be negative (where the
    definition of <b>off_t</b> permits negative values of <i>l_len</i>). The
    <i>l_pid</i> field is only used with F_GETLK to return the process ID of the
    process holding a blocking lock. After a successful F_GETLK request, when a
    blocking lock is found, the values returned in the <b>flock</b> structure
    shall be as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="l_type"><a class="permalink" href="#l_type"><i>l_type</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Type of blocking lock found.</dd>
  <dt id="l_whence"><a class="permalink" href="#l_whence"><i>l_whence</i></a></dt>
  <dd>SEEK_SET.</dd>
  <dt id="l_start"><a class="permalink" href="#l_start"><i>l_start</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Start of the blocking lock.</dd>
  <dt id="l_len"><a class="permalink" href="#l_len"><i>l_len</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Length of the blocking lock.</dd>
  <dt id="l_pid"><a class="permalink" href="#l_pid"><i>l_pid</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Process ID of the process that holds the blocking lock.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If the command is F_SETLKW and the process must wait for another
    process to release a lock, then the range of bytes to be locked shall be
    determined before the <i>fcntl</i>() function blocks. If the file size or
    file descriptor seek offset change while <i>fcntl</i>() is blocked, this
    shall not affect the range of bytes locked.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>l_len</i> is positive, the area affected shall start at
    <i>l_start</i> and end at <i>l_start</i>+<i>l_len</i>-1. If <i>l_len</i> is
    negative, the area affected shall start at <i>l_start</i>+<i>l_len</i> and
    end at <i>l_start</i>-1. Locks may start and extend beyond the current end
    of a file, but shall not extend before the beginning of the file. A lock
    shall be set to extend to the largest possible value of the file offset for
    that file by setting <i>l_len</i> to 0. If such a lock also has
    <i>l_start</i> set to 0 and <i>l_whence</i> is set to SEEK_SET, the whole
    file shall be locked.</p>
<p class="Pp">There shall be at most one type of lock set for each byte in the
    file. Before a successful return from an F_SETLK or an F_SETLKW request when
    the calling process has previously existing locks on bytes in the region
    specified by the request, the previous lock type for each byte in the
    specified region shall be replaced by the new lock type. As specified above
    under the descriptions of shared locks and exclusive locks, an F_SETLK or an
    F_SETLKW request (respectively) shall fail or block when another process has
    existing locks on bytes in the specified region and the type of any of those
    locks conflicts with the type specified in the request.</p>
<p class="Pp">All locks associated with a file for a given process shall be
    removed when a file descriptor for that file is closed by that process or
    the process holding that file descriptor terminates. Locks are not inherited
    by a child process.</p>
<p class="Pp">A potential for deadlock occurs if a process controlling a locked
    region is put to sleep by attempting to lock the locked region of another
    process. If the system detects that sleeping until a locked region is
    unlocked would cause a deadlock, <i>fcntl</i>() shall fail with an
    <b>[EDEADLK]</b> error.</p>
<p class="Pp">An unlock (F_UNLCK) request in which <i>l_len</i> is non-zero and
    the offset of the last byte of the requested segment is the maximum value
    for an object of type <b>off_t</b>, when the process has an existing lock in
    which <i>l_len</i> is 0 and which includes the last byte of the requested
    segment, shall be treated as a request to unlock from the start of the
    requested segment with an <i>l_len</i> equal to 0. Otherwise, an unlock
    (F_UNLCK) request shall attempt to unlock only the requested segment.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the file descriptor <i>fildes</i> refers to a shared memory
    object, the behavior of <i>fcntl</i>() shall be the same as for a regular
    file except the effect of the following values for the argument <i>cmd</i>
    shall be unspecified: F_SETFL, F_GETLK, F_SETLK, and F_SETLKW.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>fildes</i> refers to a typed memory object, the result of
    the <i>fcntl</i>() function is unspecified.</p>

  USAGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <i>arg</i> values to F_GETFD, F_SETFD, F_GETFL, and F_SETFL
    all represent flag values to allow for future growth. Applications using
    these functions should do a read-modify-write operation on them, rather than
    assuming that only the values defined by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017
    are valid. It is a common error to forget this, particularly in the case of
    F_SETFD. Some implementations set additional file status flags to advise the
    application of default behavior, even though the application did not request
    these flags.</p>
<p class="Pp">On systems which do not perform permission checks at the time of
    an <i>fcntl</i>() call with F_SETOWN, if the permission checks performed at
    the time the signal is sent disallow sending the signal to any process, the
    process that called <i>fcntl</i>() has no way of discovering that this has
    happened. A call to <i>kill</i>() with signal 0 can be used as a prior check
    of permissions, although this is no guarantee that permission will be
    granted at the time a signal is sent, since the target process(es) could
    change user IDs or privileges in the meantime.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="permalink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The ellipsis in the SYNOPSIS is the syntax specified by the
    ISO&nbsp;C standard for a variable number of arguments. It is used because
    System V uses pointers for the implementation of file locking functions.</p>
<p class="Pp">This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 permits concurrent read and
    write access to file data using the <i>fcntl</i>() function; this is a
    change from the 1984 /usr/group standard and early proposals. Without
    concurrency controls, this feature may not be fully utilized without
    occasional loss of data.</p>
<p class="Pp">Data losses occur in several ways. One case occurs when several
    processes try to update the same record, without sequencing controls;
    several updates may occur in parallel and the last writer ``wins''. Another
    case is a bit-tree or other internal list-based database that is undergoing
    reorganization. Without exclusive use to the tree segment by the updating
    process, other reading processes chance getting lost in the database when
    the index blocks are split, condensed, inserted, or deleted. While
    <i>fcntl</i>() is useful for many applications, it is not intended to be
    overly general and does not handle the bit-tree example well.</p>
<p class="Pp">This facility is only required for regular files because it is not
    appropriate for many devices such as terminals and network connections.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since <i>fcntl</i>() works with ``any file descriptor associated
    with that file, however it is obtained'', the file descriptor may have been
    inherited through a <i>fork</i>() or <i>exec</i> operation and thus may
    affect a file that another process also has open.</p>
<p class="Pp">The use of the open file description to identify what to lock
    requires extra calls and presents problems if several processes are sharing
    an open file description, but there are too many implementations of the
    existing mechanism for this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 to use different
    specifications.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another consequence of this model is that closing any file
    descriptor for a given file (whether or not it is the same open file
    description that created the lock) causes the locks on that file to be
    relinquished for that process. Equivalently, any close for any file/process
    pair relinquishes the locks owned on that file for that process. But note
    that while an open file description may be shared through <i>fork</i>(),
    locks are not inherited through <i>fork</i>(). Yet locks may be inherited
    through one of the <i>exec</i> functions.</p>
<p class="Pp">The identification of a machine in a network environment is
    outside the scope of this volume of POSIX.1‐2017. Thus, an
    <i>l_sysid</i> member, such as found in System V, is not included in the
    locking structure.</p>
<p class="Pp">Changing of lock types can result in a previously locked region
    being split into smaller regions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Mandatory locking was a major feature of the 1984 /usr/group
    standard.</p>
<p class="Pp">For advisory file record locking to be effective, all processes
    that have access to a file must cooperate and use the advisory mechanism
    before doing I/O on the file. Enforcement-mode record locking is important
    when it cannot be assumed that all processes are cooperating. For example,
    if one user uses an editor to update a file at the same time that a second
    user executes another process that updates the same file and if only one of
    the two processes is using advisory locking, the processes are not
    cooperating. Enforcement-mode record locking would protect against
    accidental collisions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Secondly, advisory record locking requires a process using locking
    to bracket each I/O operation with lock (or test) and unlock operations.
    With enforcement-mode file and record locking, a process can lock the file
    once and unlock when all I/O operations have been completed.
    Enforcement-mode record locking provides a base that can be enhanced; for
    example, with sharable locks. That is, the mechanism could be enhanced to
    allow a process to lock a file so other processes could read it, but none of
    them could write it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Mandatory locks were omitted for several reasons:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> 1.</dt>
  <dd>Mandatory lock setting was done by multiplexing the set-group-ID bit in
      most implementations; this was confusing, at best.</dd>
  <dt> 2.</dt>
  <dd>The relationship to file truncation as supported in 4.2 BSD was not well
      specified.</dd>
  <dt> 3.</dt>
  <dd>Any publicly readable file could be locked by anyone. Many historical
      implementations keep the password database in a publicly readable file. A
      malicious user could thus prohibit logins. Another possibility would be to
      hold open a long-distance telephone line.</dd>
  <dt> 4.</dt>
  <dd>Some demand-paged historical implementations offer memory mapped files,
      and enforcement cannot be done on that type of file.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Since sleeping on a region is interrupted with any signal,
    <i>alarm</i>() may be used to provide a timeout facility in applications
    requiring it. This is useful in deadlock detection. Since implementation of
    full deadlock detection is not always feasible, the <b>[EDEADLK]</b> error
    was made optional.</p>
