<p class="Pp">The <i>ar</i> utility is part of the Software Development
    Utilities option.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>ar</i> utility can be used to create and maintain groups of
    files combined into an archive. Once an archive has been created, new files
    can be added, and existing files in an archive can be extracted, deleted, or
    replaced. When an archive consists entirely of valid object files, the
    implementation shall format the archive so that it is usable as a library
    for link editing (see <i>c99</i> and <i>fort77</i>). When some of the
    archived files are not valid object files, the suitability of the archive
    for library use is undefined. If an archive consists entirely of printable
    files, the entire archive shall be printable.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <i>ar</i> creates an archive, it creates administrative
    information indicating whether a symbol table is present in the archive.
    When there is at least one object file that <i>ar</i> recognizes as such in
    the archive, an archive symbol table shall be created in the archive and
    maintained by <i>ar</i>; it is used by the link editor to search the
    archive. Whenever the <i>ar</i> utility is used to create or update the
    contents of such an archive, the symbol table shall be rebuilt. The
    <b>-s</b> option shall force the symbol table to be rebuilt.</p>
<p class="Pp">All <i>file</i> operands can be pathnames. However, files within
    archives shall be named by a filename, which is the last component of the
    pathname used when the file was entered into the archive. The comparison of
    <i>file</i> operands to the names of files in archives shall be performed by
    comparing the last component of the operand to the name of the file in the
    archive.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is unspecified whether multiple files in the archive may be
    identically named. In the case of such files, however, each <i>file</i> and
    <i>posname</i> operand shall match only the first file in the archive having
    a name that is the same as the last component of the operand.</p>

<p class="Pp">The <i>ar</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume
    of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 12.2</i>, <i>Utility Syntax
    Guidelines</i>, except for Guideline 9.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following options shall be supported:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="a"><a class="permalink" href="#a"><b>-a</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Position new files in the archive after the file named by the
      <i>posname</i> operand.</dd>
  <dt id="b"><a class="permalink" href="#b"><b>-b</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Position new files in the archive before the file named by the
      <i>posname</i> operand.</dd>
  <dt id="c"><a class="permalink" href="#c"><b>-c</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Suppress the diagnostic message that is written to standard error by
      default when the archive <i>archive</i> is created.</dd>
  <dt id="C"><a class="permalink" href="#C"><b>-C</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Prevent extracted files from replacing like-named files in the file
      system. This option is useful when <b>-T</b> is also used, to prevent
      truncated filenames from replacing files with the same prefix.</dd>
  <dt id="d"><a class="permalink" href="#d"><b>-d</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Delete one or more <i>file</i>s from <i>archive</i>.</dd>
  <dt id="i"><a class="permalink" href="#i"><b>-i</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Position new files in the archive before the file in the archive named by
      the <i>posname</i> operand (equivalent to <b>-b</b>).</dd>
  <dt id="m"><a class="permalink" href="#m"><b>-m</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Move the named files in the archive. The <b>-a</b>, <b>-b</b>, or
      <b>-i</b> options with the <i>posname</i> operand indicate the position;
      otherwise, move the names files in the archive to the end of the
    archive.</dd>
  <dt id="p"><a class="permalink" href="#p"><b>-p</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Write the contents of the <i>file</i>s in the archive named by <i>file</i>
      operands from <i>archive</i> to the standard output. If no <i>file</i>
      operands are specified, the contents of all files in the archive shall be
      written in the order of the archive.</dd>
  <dt id="q"><a class="permalink" href="#q"><b>-q</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Append the named files to the end of the archive. In this case <i>ar</i>
      does not check whether the added files are already in the archive. This is
      useful to bypass the searching otherwise done when creating a large
      archive piece by piece.</dd>
  <dt id="r"><a class="permalink" href="#r"><b>-r</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Replace or add <i>file</i>s to <i>archive</i>. If the archive named by
      <i>archive</i> does not exist, a new archive shall be created and a
      diagnostic message shall be written to standard error (unless the
      <b>-c</b> option is specified). If no <i>file</i>s are specified and the
      <i>archive</i> exists, the results are undefined. Files that replace
      existing files in the archive shall not change the order of the archive.
      Files that do not replace existing files in the archive shall be appended
      to the archive unless a <b>-a</b>, <b>-b</b>, or <b>-i</b> option
      specifies another position.</dd>
  <dt id="s"><a class="permalink" href="#s"><b>-s</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Force the regeneration of the archive symbol table even if <i>ar</i> is
      not invoked with an option that modifies the archive contents. This option
      is useful to restore the archive symbol table after it has been stripped;
      see <i>strip</i>.</dd>
  <dt id="t"><a class="permalink" href="#t"><b>-t</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Write a table of contents of <i>archive</i> to the standard output. Only
      the files specified by the <i>file</i> operands shall be included in the
      written list. If no <i>file</i> operands are specified, all files in
      <i>archive</i> shall be included in the order of the archive.</dd>
  <dt id="T"><a class="permalink" href="#T"><b>-T</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Allow filename truncation of extracted files whose archive names are
      longer than the file system can support. By default, extracting a file
      with a name that is too long shall be an error; a diagnostic message shall
      be written and the file shall not be extracted.</dd>
  <dt id="u"><a class="permalink" href="#u"><b>-u</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Update older files in the archive. When used with the <b>-r</b> option,
      files in the archive shall be replaced only if the corresponding
      <i>file</i> has a modification time that is at least as new as the
      modification time of the file in the archive.</dd>
  <dt id="v"><a class="permalink" href="#v"><b>-v</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Give verbose output. When used with the option characters <b>-d</b>,
      <b>-r</b>, or <b>-x</b>, write a detailed file-by-file description of the
      archive creation and maintenance activity, as described in the STDOUT

<p class="Pp">The archive format is not described. It is recognized that there
    are several known <i>ar</i> formats, which are not compatible. The <i>ar</i>
    utility is included, however, to allow creation of archives that are
    intended for use only on one machine. The archive is specified as a file,
    and it can be moved as a file. This does allow an archive to be moved from
    one machine to another machine that uses the same implementation of
    <i>ar</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Utilities such as <i>pax</i> (and its forebears <i>tar</i> and
    <i>cpio</i>) also provide portable ``archives''. This is a not a
    duplication; the <i>ar</i> utility is included to provide an interface
    primarily for <i>make</i> and the compilers, based on a historical
  model.</p>
<p class="Pp">In historical implementations, the <b>-q</b> option (available on
    XSI-conforming systems) is known to execute quickly because <i>ar</i> does
    not check on whether the added members are already in the archive. This is
    useful to bypass the searching otherwise done when creating a large archive
    piece-by-piece. These remarks may but need not remain true for a brand new
    implementation of this utility; hence, these remarks have been moved into
    the RATIONALE.</p>
<p class="Pp">BSD implementations historically required applications to provide
    the <b>-s</b> option whenever the archive was supposed to contain a symbol
    table. As in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, System V historically
    creates or updates an archive symbol table whenever an object file is
    removed from, added to, or updated in the archive.</p>
<p class="Pp">The OPERANDS section requires what might seem to be true without
    specifying it: the archive cannot truncate the filenames below {NAME_MAX}.
    Some historical implementations do so, however, causing unexpected results
    for the application. Therefore, this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 makes the
    requirement explicit to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<p class="Pp">According to the System V documentation, the options
    <b>-dmpqrtx</b> are not required to begin with a &lt;hyphen-minus&gt;
    (<b>'-'</b>). This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires that a conforming
    application use the leading &lt;hyphen-minus&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The archive format used by the 4.4 BSD implementation is
    documented in this RATIONALE as an example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A file created by <i>ar</i> begins with the ``magic''
  string <b>"!&lt;arch&gt;\n"</b>. The rest of the archive is made up
  of objects, each of which is composed of a header for a file, a possible
  filename, and the file contents. The header is portable between machine
  architectures, and, if the file contents are printable, the archive is itself
  printable.
<p class="Pp">The header is made up of six ASCII fields, followed by a
    two-character trailer. The fields are the object name (16 characters), the
    file last modification time (12 characters), the user and group IDs (each 6
    characters), the file mode (8 characters), and the file size (10
    characters). All numeric fields are in decimal, except for the file mode,
    which is in octal.</p>
<p class="Pp">The modification time is the file <i>st_mtime</i> field. The user
    and group IDs are the file <i>st_uid</i> and <i>st_gid</i> fields. The file
    mode is the file <i>st_mode</i> field. The file size is the file
    <i>st_size</i> field. The two-byte trailer is the string
    <b>"`&lt;newline&gt;"</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Only the name field has any provision for overflow. If any
    filename is more than 16 characters in length or contains an embedded space,
    the string <b>"#1/"</b> followed by the ASCII length of the name
    is written in the name field. The file size (stored in the archive header)
    is incremented by the length of the name. The name is then written
    immediately following the archive header.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any unused characters in any of these fields are written as
    &lt;space&gt; characters. If any fields are their particular maximum number
    of characters in length, there is no separation between the fields.</p>
<p class="Pp">Objects in the archive are always an even number of bytes long;
    files that are an odd number of bytes long are padded with a
    &lt;newline&gt;, although the size in the header does not reflect this.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <i>ar</i> utility description requires that (when all its
    members are valid object files) <i>ar</i> produce an object code library,
    which the linkage editor can use to extract object modules. If the linkage
    editor needs a symbol table to permit random access to the archive,
    <i>ar</i> must provide it; however, <i>ar</i> does not require a symbol
    table.</p>
<p class="Pp">The BSD <b>-o</b> option was omitted. It is a rare conforming
    application that uses <i>ar</i> to extract object code from a library with
    concern for its modification time, since this can only be of importance to
    <i>make</i>. Hence, since this functionality is not deemed important for
    applications portability, the modification time of the extracted files is
    set to the current time.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is at least one known implementation (for a small computer)
    that can accommodate only object files for that system, disallowing mixed
    object and other files. The ability to handle any type of file is not only
    historical practice for most implementations, but is also a reasonable
    expectation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Consideration was given to changing the output format of <i>ar</i>
    <b>-tv</b> to the same format as the output of <i>ls</i> <b>-l</b>. This
    would have made parsing the output of <i>ar</i> the same as that of
    <i>ls</i>. This was rejected in part because the current <i>ar</i> format is
    commonly used and changes would break historical usage. Second, <i>ar</i>
    gives the user ID and group ID in numeric format separated by a
    &lt;slash&gt;. Changing this to be the user name and group name would not be
    correct if the archive were moved to a machine that contained a different
    user database. Since <i>ar</i> cannot know whether the archive was generated
    on the same machine, it cannot tell what to report.</p>
<p class="Pp">The text on the <b>-ur</b> option combination is historical
    practice—since one filename can easily represent two different files
    (for example, <b>/a/foo</b> and <b>/b/foo</b>), it is reasonable to replace
    the file in the archive even when the modification time in the archive is
    identical to that in the file system.</p>
