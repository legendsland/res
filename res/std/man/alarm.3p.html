<p class="Pp">The <i>alarm</i>() function shall cause the system to generate a
    SIGALRM signal for the process after the number of realtime seconds
    specified by <i>seconds</i> have elapsed. Processor scheduling delays may
    prevent the process from handling the signal as soon as it is generated.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>seconds</i> is 0, a pending alarm request, if any, is
    canceled.</p>
<p class="Pp">Alarm requests are not stacked; only one SIGALRM generation can be
    scheduled in this manner. If the SIGALRM signal has not yet been generated,
    the call shall result in rescheduling the time at which the SIGALRM signal
    is generated.</p>
<p class="Pp">Interactions between <i>alarm</i>() and <i>setitimer</i>() are
    unspecified.</p>

<p class="Pp">If there is a previous <i>alarm</i>() request with time remaining,
    <i>alarm</i>() shall return a non-zero value that is the number of seconds
    until the previous request would have generated a SIGALRM signal. Otherwise,
    <i>alarm</i>() shall return 0.</p>

  USAGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <i>fork</i>() function clears pending alarms in the child
    process. A new process image created by one of the <i>exec</i> functions
    inherits the time left to an alarm signal in the image of the old
  process.</p>
<p class="Pp">Application developers should note that the type of the argument
    <i>seconds</i> and the return value of <i>alarm</i>() is <b>unsigned</b>.
    That means that a Strictly Conforming POSIX System Interfaces Application
    cannot pass a value greater than the minimum guaranteed value for
    {UINT_MAX}, which the ISO&nbsp;C standard sets as 65535, and any
    application passing a larger value is restricting its portability. A
    different type was considered, but historical implementations, including
    those with a 16-bit <b>int</b> type, consistently use either <b>unsigned</b>
    or <b>int</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Application developers should be aware of possible interactions
    when the same process uses both the <i>alarm</i>() and <i>sleep</i>()
    functions.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="permalink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Many historical implementations (including Version 7 and System V)
    allow an alarm to occur up to a second early. Other implementations allow
    alarms up to half a second or one clock tick early or do not allow them to
    occur early at all. The latter is considered most appropriate, since it
    gives the most predictable behavior, especially since the signal can always
    be delayed for an indefinite amount of time due to scheduling. Applications
    can thus choose the <i>seconds</i> argument as the minimum amount of time
    they wish to have elapse before the signal.</p>
<p class="Pp">The term ``realtime'' here and elsewhere (<i>sleep</i>(),
    <i>times</i>()) is intended to mean ``wall clock'' time as common English
    usage, and has nothing to do with ``realtime operating systems''. It is in
    contrast to <i>virtual time</i>, which could be misinterpreted if just
    <i>time</i> were used.</p>
<p class="Pp">In some implementations, including 4.3 BSD, very large values of
    the <i>seconds</i> argument are silently rounded down to an
    implementation-specific maximum value. This maximum is large enough (to the
    order of several months) that the effect is not noticeable.</p>
<p class="Pp">There were two possible choices for alarm generation in
    multi-threaded applications: generation for the calling thread or generation
    for the process. The first option would not have been particularly useful
    since the alarm state is maintained on a per-process basis and the alarm
    that is established by the last invocation of <i>alarm</i>() is the only one
    that would be active.</p>
<p class="Pp">Furthermore, allowing generation of an asynchronous signal for a
    thread would have introduced an exception to the overall signal model. This
    requires a compelling reason in order to be justified.</p>
