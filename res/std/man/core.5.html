<p class="Pp">The default action of certain signals is to cause a process to
    terminate and produce a <i>core dump file</i>, a file containing an image of
    the process's memory at the time of termination. This image can be used in a
    debugger (e.g., <b>gdb</b>(1)) to inspect the state of the program at the
    time that it terminated. A list of the signals which cause a process to dump
    core can be found in <b>signal</b>(7).</p>
<p class="Pp">A process can set its soft <b>RLIMIT_CORE</b> resource limit to
    place an upper limit on the size of the core dump file that will be produced
    if it receives a "core dump" signal; see <b>getrlimit</b>(2) for
    details.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are various circumstances in which a core dump file is not
    produced:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>The process does not have permission to write the core file. (By default,
      the core file is called <i>core</i> or <i>core.pid</i>, where <i>pid</i>
      is the ID of the process that dumped core, and is created in the current
      working directory. See below for details on naming.) Writing the core file
      fails if the directory in which it is to be created is not writable, or if
      a file with the same name exists and is not writable or is not a regular
      file (e.g., it is a directory or a symbolic link).</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>A (writable, regular) file with the same name as would be used for the
      core dump already exists, but there is more than one hard link to that
      file.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>The filesystem where the core dump file would be created is full; or has
      run out of inodes; or is mounted read-only; or the user has reached their
      quota for the filesystem.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>The directory in which the core dump file is to be created does not
    exist.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>The <b>RLIMIT_CORE</b> (core file size) or <b>RLIMIT_FSIZE</b> (file size)
      resource limits for the process are set to zero; see <b>getrlimit</b>(2)
      and the documentation of the shell's <i>ulimit</i> command (<i>limit</i>
      in <b>csh</b>(1)). However, <b>RLIMIT_CORE</b> will be ignored if the
      system is configured to pipe core dumps to a program.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>The binary being executed by the process does not have read permission
      enabled. (This is a security measure to ensure that an executable whose
      contents are not readable does not produce a—possibly
      readable—core dump containing an image of the executable.)</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>The process is executing a set-user-ID (set-group-ID) program that is
      owned by a user (group) other than the real user (group) ID of the
      process, or the process is executing a program that has file capabilities
      (see <b>capabilities</b>(7)). (However, see the description of the
      <b>prctl</b>(2) <b>PR_SET_DUMPABLE</b> operation, and the description of
      the <i>/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable</i> file in <b>proc</b>(5).)</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd><i>/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern</i> is empty and
      <i>/proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid</i> contains the value 0. (These files
      are described below.) Note that if <i>/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern</i> is
      empty and <i>/proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid</i> contains the value 1, core
      dump files will have names of the form <i>.pid</i>, and such files are
      hidden unless one uses the <b>ls</b>(1) <i>-a</i> option.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>(Since Linux 3.7) The kernel was configured without the
      <b>CONFIG_COREDUMP</b> option.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">In addition, a core dump may exclude part of the address space of
    the process if the <b>madvise</b>(2) <b>MADV_DONTDUMP</b> flag was
  employed.</p>
<p class="Pp">On systems that employ <b>systemd</b>(1) as the <i>init</i>
    framework, core dumps may instead be placed in a location determined by
    <b>systemd</b>(1). See below for further details.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Naming_of_core_dump_files"><a class="permalink" href="#Naming_of_core_dump_files">Naming
  of core dump files</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">By default, a core dump file is named <i>core</i>, but the
    <i>/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern</i> file (since Linux 2.6 and 2.4.21) can
    be set to define a template that is used to name core dump files. The
    template can contain % specifiers which are substituted by the following
    values when a core file is created:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>%%</dt>
  <dd>A single % character.</dd>
  <dt>%c</dt>
  <dd>Core file size soft resource limit of crashing process (since Linux
      2.6.24).</dd>
  <dt>%d</dt>
  <dd>Dump mode—same as value returned by <b>prctl</b>(2)
      <b>PR_GET_DUMPABLE</b> (since Linux 3.7).</dd>
  <dt>%e</dt>
  <dd>The process or thread's <i>comm</i> value, which typically is the same as
      the executable filename (without path prefix, and truncated to a maximum
      of 15 characters), but may have been modified to be something different;
      see the discussion of <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/comm</i> and
      <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/task/</i>tid<i>/comm</i> in <b>proc</b>(5).</dd>
  <dt>%E</dt>
  <dd>Pathname of executable, with slashes ('/') replaced by exclamation marks
      ('!') (since Linux 3.0).</dd>
  <dt>%g</dt>
  <dd>Numeric real GID of dumped process.</dd>
  <dt>%h</dt>
  <dd>Hostname (same as <i>nodename</i> returned by <b>uname</b>(2)).</dd>
  <dt>%i</dt>
  <dd>TID of thread that triggered core dump, as seen in the PID namespace in
      which the thread resides (since Linux 3.18).</dd>
  <dt>%I</dt>
  <dd>TID of thread that triggered core dump, as seen in the initial PID
      namespace (since Linux 3.18).</dd>
  <dt>%p</dt>
  <dd>PID of dumped process, as seen in the PID namespace in which the process
      resides.</dd>
  <dt>%P</dt>
  <dd>PID of dumped process, as seen in the initial PID namespace (since Linux
      3.12).</dd>
  <dt>%s</dt>
  <dd>Number of signal causing dump.</dd>
  <dt>%t</dt>
  <dd>Time of dump, expressed as seconds since the Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00
      +0000 (UTC).</dd>
  <dt>%u</dt>
  <dd>Numeric real UID of dumped process.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">A single % at the end of the template is dropped from the core
    filename, as is the combination of a % followed by any character other than
    those listed above. All other characters in the template become a literal
    part of the core filename. The template may include '/' characters, which
    are interpreted as delimiters for directory names. The maximum size of the
    resulting core filename is 128 bytes (64 bytes before Linux 2.6.19). The
    default value in this file is "core". For backward compatibility,
    if <i>/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern</i> does not include <i>%p</i> and
    <i>/proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid</i> (see below) is nonzero, then .PID will
    be appended to the core filename.</p>
<p class="Pp">Paths are interpreted according to the settings that are active
    for the crashing process. That means the crashing process's mount namespace
    (see <b>mount_namespaces</b>(7)), its current working directory (found via
    <b>getcwd</b>(2)), and its root directory (see <b>chroot</b>(2)).</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 2.4, Linux has also provided a more primitive method
    of controlling the name of the core dump file. If the
    <i>/proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid</i> file contains the value 0, then a core
    dump file is simply named <i>core</i>. If this file contains a nonzero
    value, then the core dump file includes the process ID in a name of the form
    <i>core.PID</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 3.6, if <i>/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable</i> is set to 2
    ("suidsafe"), the pattern must be either an absolute pathname
    (starting with a leading '/' character) or a pipe, as defined below.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Piping_core_dumps_to_a_program"><a class="permalink" href="#Piping_core_dumps_to_a_program">Piping
  core dumps to a program</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 2.6.19, Linux supports an alternate syntax for the
    <i>/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern</i> file. If the first character of this
    file is a pipe symbol (<b>|</b>), then the remainder of the line is
    interpreted as the command-line for a user-space program (or script) that is
    to be executed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 5.3.0, the pipe template is split on spaces into an
    argument list <i>before</i> the template parameters are expanded. In earlier
    kernels, the template parameters are expanded first and the resulting string
    is split on spaces into an argument list. This means that in earlier kernels
    executable names added by the <i>%e</i> and <i>%E</i> template parameters
    could get split into multiple arguments. So the core dump handler needs to
    put the executable names as the last argument and ensure it joins all parts
    of the executable name using spaces. Executable names with multiple spaces
    in them are not correctly represented in earlier kernels, meaning that the
    core dump handler needs to use mechanisms to find the executable name.</p>
<p class="Pp">Instead of being written to a file, the core dump is given as
    standard input to the program. Note the following points:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>The program must be specified using an absolute pathname (or a pathname
      relative to the root directory, <i>/</i>), and must immediately follow the
      '|' character.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>The command-line arguments can include any of the % specifiers listed
      above. For example, to pass the PID of the process that is being dumped,
      specify <i>%p</i> in an argument.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>The process created to run the program runs as user and group
    <i>root</i>.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>Running as <i>root</i> does not confer any exceptional security bypasses.
      Namely, LSMs (e.g., SELinux) are still active and may prevent the handler
      from accessing details about the crashed process via
    <i>/proc/</i>pid.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>The program pathname is interpreted with respect to the initial mount
      namespace as it is always executed there. It is not affected by the
      settings (e.g., root directory, mount namespace, current working
      directory) of the crashing process.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>The process runs in the initial namespaces (PID, mount, user, and so on)
      and not in the namespaces of the crashing process. One can utilize
      specifiers such as <i>%P</i> to find the right <i>/proc/</i>pid directory
      and probe/enter the crashing process's namespaces if needed.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>The process starts with its current working directory as the root
      directory. If desired, it is possible change to the working directory of
      the dumping process by employing the value provided by the <i>%P</i>
      specifier to change to the location of the dumping process via
      <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/cwd</i>.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>Command-line arguments can be supplied to the program (since Linux
      2.6.24), delimited by white space (up to a total line length of 128
      bytes).</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>The <b>RLIMIT_CORE</b> limit is not enforced for core dumps that are piped
      to a program via this mechanism.</dd>

<h2 class="Ss" id="/proc/sys/kernel/core_pipe_limit"><a class="permalink" href="#/proc/sys/kernel/core_pipe_limit">/proc/sys/kernel/core_pipe_limit</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When collecting core dumps via a pipe to a user-space program, it
    can be useful for the collecting program to gather data about the crashing
    process from that process's <i>/proc/</i>pid directory. In order to do this
    safely, the kernel must wait for the program collecting the core dump to
    exit, so as not to remove the crashing process's <i>/proc/</i>pid files
    prematurely. This in turn creates the possibility that a misbehaving
    collecting program can block the reaping of a crashed process by simply
    never exiting.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 2.6.32, the <i>/proc/sys/kernel/core_pipe_limit</i>
    can be used to defend against this possibility. The value in this file
    defines how many concurrent crashing processes may be piped to user-space
    programs in parallel. If this value is exceeded, then those crashing
    processes above this value are noted in the kernel log and their core dumps
    are skipped.</p>
<p class="Pp">A value of 0 in this file is special. It indicates that unlimited
    processes may be captured in parallel, but that no waiting will take place
    (i.e., the collecting program is not guaranteed access to
    <i>/proc/&lt;crashing-PID&gt;</i>). The default value for this file is
  0.</p>

  which mappings are written to the core dump</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 2.6.23, the Linux-specific
    <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/coredump_filter</i> file can be used to control which
    memory segments are written to the core dump file in the event that a core
    dump is performed for the process with the corresponding process ID.</p>
<p class="Pp">The value in the file is a bit mask of memory mapping types (see
    <b>mmap</b>(2)). If a bit is set in the mask, then memory mappings of the
    corresponding type are dumped; otherwise they are not dumped. The bits in
    this file have the following meanings:</p>

<p class="Pp">By default, the following bits are set: 0, 1, 4 (if the
    <b>CONFIG_CORE_DUMP_DEFAULT_ELF_HEADERS</b> kernel configuration option is

<p class="Pp">On systems using the <b>systemd</b>(1) <i>init</i> framework, core
    dumps may be placed in a location determined by <b>systemd</b>(1). To do
    this, <b>systemd</b>(1) employs the <i>core_pattern</i> feature that allows
    piping core dumps to a program. One can verify this by checking whether core
    dumps are being piped to the <b>systemd-coredump</b>(8) program:</p>
<p class="Pp">

</p>
<pre>$ <b>cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern</b>

    in the directory <i>/var/lib/systemd/coredump/</i>. One can list the core

<p class="Pp">The information shown for each core dump includes the date and
    time of the dump, the PID, UID, and GID of the dumping process, the signal
    number that caused the core dump, and the pathname of the executable that
    was being run by the dumped process. Various options to
    <b>coredumpctl</b>(1) allow a specified coredump file to be pulled from the
    <b>systemd</b>(1) location into a specified file. For example, to extract
    the core dump for PID 2955 shown above to a file named <i>core</i> in the

<p class="Pp">To (persistently) disable the <b>systemd</b>(1) mechanism that
