<p class="Pp">The timezone information files used by <b>tzset</b>(3) are
    typically found under a directory with a name like
    <i>/usr/share/zoneinfo</i>. These files use the format described in Internet
    RFC 8536. Each file is a sequence of 8-bit bytes. In a file, a binary
    integer is represented by a sequence of one or more bytes in network order
    (bigendian, or high-order byte first), with all bits significant, a signed
    binary integer is represented using two's complement, and a boolean is
    represented by a one-byte binary integer that is either 0 (false) or 1
    (true). The format begins with a 44-byte header containing the following
    fields:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The magic four-byte ASCII sequence “TZif” identifies the
      file as a timezone information file.</li>
  <li>A byte identifying the version of the file's format (as of 2021, either an
      ASCII NUL, “2”, “3”, or
    “4”).</li>
  <li>Fifteen bytes containing zeros reserved for future use.</li>
  <li>Six four-byte integer values, in the following order:</li>

</div>
<p class="Pp">The above header is followed by the following fields, whose
    lengths depend on the contents of the header:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><b>tzh_timecnt</b> four-byte signed integer values sorted in ascending
      order. These values are written in network byte order. Each is used as a
      transition time (as returned by <b>time</b>(2)) at which the rules for
      computing local time change.</li>
  <li><b>tzh_timecnt</b> one-byte unsigned integer values; each one but the last
      tells which of the different types of local time types described in the
      file is associated with the time period starting with the same-indexed
      transition time and continuing up to but not including the next transition
      time. (The last time type is present only for consistency checking with
      the POSIX-style TZ string described below.) These values serve as indices
      into the next field.</li>
  <li><b>tzh_typecnt</b> <b>ttinfo</b> entries, each defined as follows:
    <br>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>struct ttinfo {
	int32_t	tt_utoff;
	unsigned char	tt_isdst;
	unsigned char	tt_desigidx;
};
<br>
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Each structure is written as a four-byte signed integer value
        for <b>tt_utoff</b>, in network byte order, followed by a one-byte
        boolean for <b>tt_isdst</b> and a one-byte value for <b>tt_desigidx</b>.
        In each structure, <b>tt_utoff</b> gives the number of seconds to be
        added to UT, <b>tt_isdst</b> tells whether <b>tm_isdst</b> should be set
        by <b>localtime</b>(3) and <b>tt_desigidx</b> serves as an index into
        the array of time zone abbreviation bytes that follow the <b>ttinfo</b>
        entries in the file; if the designated string is
        "<span class="Li">-</span>00", the <b>ttinfo</b> entry is a
        placeholder indicating that local time is unspecified. The
        <b>tt_utoff</b> value is never equal to -2**31, to let 32-bit clients
        negate it without overflow. Also, in realistic applications
        <b>tt_utoff</b> is in the range [-89999, 93599] (i.e., more than -25
        hours and less than 26 hours); this allows easy support by
        implementations that already support the POSIX-required range
        [-24:59:59, 25:59:59].</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>tzh_charcnt</b> bytes that represent time zone designations, which are
      null-terminated byte strings, each indexed by the <b>tt_desigidx</b>
      values mentioned above. The byte strings can overlap if one is a suffix of
      the other. The encoding of these strings is not specified.</li>
  <li><b>tzh_leapcnt</b> pairs of four-byte values, written in network byte
      order; the first value of each pair gives the nonnegative time (as
      returned by <b>time</b>(2)) at which a leap second occurs or at which the
      leap second table expires; the second is a signed integer specifying the
      correction, which is the <i>total</i> number of leap seconds to be applied
      during the time period starting at the given time. The pairs of values are
      sorted in strictly ascending order by time. Each pair denotes one leap
      second, either positive or negative, except that if the last pair has the
      same correction as the previous one, the last pair denotes the leap second
      table's expiration time. Each leap second is at the end of a UTC calendar
      month. The first leap second has a nonnegative occurrence time, and is a
      positive leap second if and only if its correction is positive; the
      correction for each leap second after the first differs from the previous
      leap second by either 1 for a positive leap second, or -1 for a negative
      leap second. If the leap second table is empty, the leap-second correction
      is zero for all timestamps; otherwise, for timestamps before the first
      occurrence time, the leap-second correction is zero if the first pair's
      correction is 1 or -1, and is unspecified otherwise (which can happen only
      in files truncated at the start).</li>
  <li><b>tzh_ttisstdcnt</b> standard/wall indicators, each stored as a one-byte
      boolean; they tell whether the transition times associated with local time
      types were specified as standard time or local (wall clock) time.</li>
  <li><b>tzh_ttisutcnt</b> UT/local indicators, each stored as a one-byte
      boolean; they tell whether the transition times associated with local time
      types were specified as UT or local time. If a UT/local indicator is set,
      the corresponding standard/wall indicator must also be set.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">The standard/wall and UT/local indicators were designed for
    transforming a TZif file's transition times into transitions appropriate for
    another time zone specified via a POSIX-style TZ string that lacks rules.
    For example, when TZ="EET<span class="Li">-</span>2EEST" and there
    is no TZif file "EET<span class="Li">-</span>2EEST", the idea was
    to adapt the transition times from a TZif file with the well-known name
    "posixrules" that is present only for this purpose and is a copy
    of the file "Europe/Brussels", a file with a different UT offset.
    POSIX does not specify this obsolete transformational behavior, the default
    rules are installation-dependent, and no implementation is known to support
    this feature for timestamps past 2037, so users desiring (say) Greek time
    should instead specify TZ="Europe/Athens" for better historical
    coverage, falling back on
    TZ="EET<span class="Li">-</span>2EEST,M3.5.0/3,M10.5.0/4" if POSIX
    conformance is required and older timestamps need not be handled
  accurately.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>localtime</b>(3) function normally uses the first
    <b>ttinfo</b> structure in the file if either <b>tzh_timecnt</b> is zero or
    the time argument is less than the first transition time recorded in the
    file.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Version_2_format"><a class="permalink" href="#Version_2_format">Version
  2 format</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">For version-2-format timezone files, the above header and data are
    followed by a second header and data, identical in format except that eight
    bytes are used for each transition time or leap second time. (Leap second
    counts remain four bytes.) After the second header and data comes a
    newline-enclosed, POSIX-TZ-environment-variable-style string for use in
    handling instants after the last transition time stored in the file or for
    all instants if the file has no transitions. The POSIX-style TZ string is
    empty (i.e., nothing between the newlines) if there is no POSIX-style
    representation for such instants. If nonempty, the POSIX-style TZ string
    must agree with the local time type after the last transition time if
    present in the eight-byte data; for example, given the string
    “WET0WEST,M3.5.0/1,M10.5.0” then if a last transition time is
    in July, the transition's local time type must specify a daylight-saving
    time abbreviated “WEST” that is one hour east of UT. Also, if
    there is at least one transition, time type 0 is associated with the time
    period from the indefinite past up to but not including the earliest
    transition time.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Version_3_format"><a class="permalink" href="#Version_3_format">Version
  3 format</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">For version-3-format timezone files, the POSIX-TZ-style string may
    use two minor extensions to the POSIX TZ format, as described in
    <b>newtzset</b>(3). First, the hours part of its transition times may be
    signed and range from -167 through 167 instead of the POSIX-required
    unsigned values from 0 through 24. Second, DST is in effect all year if it
    starts January 1 at 00:00 and ends December 31 at 24:00 plus the difference
    between daylight saving and standard time.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Version_4_format"><a class="permalink" href="#Version_4_format">Version
  4 format</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">For version-4-format TZif files, the first leap second record can
    have a correction that is neither +1 nor -1, to represent truncation of the
    TZif file at the start. Also, if two or more leap second transitions are
    present and the last entry's correction equals the previous one, the last
    entry denotes the expiration of the leap second table instead of a leap
    second; timestamps after this expiration are unreliable in that future
    releases will likely add leap second entries after the expiration, and the
    added leap seconds will change how post-expiration timestamps are
  treated.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Interoperability_considerations"><a class="permalink" href="#Interoperability_considerations">Interoperability
  considerations</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Future changes to the format may append more data.</p>
<p class="Pp">Version 1 files are considered a legacy format and should not be
    generated, as they do not support transition times after the year 2038.
    Readers that understand only Version 1 must ignore any data that extends
    beyond the calculated end of the version 1 data block.</p>
<p class="Pp">Other than version 1, writers should generate the lowest version
    number needed by a file's data. For example, a writer should generate a
    version 4 file only if its leap second table either expires or is truncated
    at the start. Likewise, a writer not generating a version 4 file should
    generate a version 3 file only if TZ string extensions are necessary to
    accurately model transition times.</p>
<p class="Pp">The sequence of time changes defined by the version 1 header and
    data block should be a contiguous sub-sequence of the time changes defined
    by the version 2+ header and data block, and by the footer. This guideline
    helps obsolescent version 1 readers agree with current readers about
    timestamps within the contiguous sub-sequence. It also lets writers not
    supporting obsolescent readers use a <b>tzh_timecnt</b> of zero in the
    version 1 data block to save space.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a TZif file contains a leap second table expiration time,
    TZif readers should either refuse to process post-expiration timestamps, or
    process them as if the expiration time did not exist (possibly with an error
    indication).</p>
<p class="Pp">Time zone designations should consist of at least three (3) and no
    more than six (6) ASCII characters from the set of alphanumerics,
    “<span class="Li">-</span>”, and “+”. This is
    for compatibility with POSIX requirements for time zone abbreviations.</p>
<p class="Pp">When reading a version 2 or higher file, readers should ignore the
    version 1 header and data block except for the purpose of skipping over
    them.</p>
<p class="Pp">Readers should calculate the total lengths of the headers and data
    blocks and check that they all fit within the actual file size, as part of a
    validity check for the file.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a positive leap second occurs, readers should append an extra
    second to the local minute containing the second just before the leap
    second. If this occurs when the UTC offset is not a multiple of 60 seconds,
    the leap second occurs earlier than the last second of the local minute and
    the minute's remaining local seconds are numbered through 60 instead of the
    usual 59; the UTC offset is unaffected.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Common_interoperability_issues"><a class="permalink" href="#Common_interoperability_issues">Common
  interoperability issues</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This section documents common problems in reading or writing TZif
    files. Most of these are problems in generating TZif files for use by older
    readers. The goals of this section are:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>to help TZif writers output files that avoid common pitfalls in older or
      buggy TZif readers,</li>
  <li>to help TZif readers avoid common pitfalls when reading files generated by
      future TZif writers, and</li>
  <li>to help any future specification authors see what sort of problems arise
      when the TZif format is changed.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">When new versions of the TZif format have been defined, a design
    goal has been that a reader can successfully use a TZif file even if the
    file is of a later TZif version than what the reader was designed for. When
    complete compatibility was not achieved, an attempt was made to limit
    glitches to rarely used timestamps and allow simple partial workarounds in
    writers designed to generate new-version data useful even for older-version
    readers. This section attempts to document these compatibility issues and
    workarounds, as well as to document other common bugs in readers.</p>
<p class="Pp">Interoperability problems with TZif include the following:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Some readers examine only version 1 data. As a partial workaround, a
      writer can output as much version 1 data as possible. However, a reader
      should ignore version 1 data, and should use version 2+ data even if the
      reader's native timestamps have only 32 bits.</li>
  <li>Some readers designed for version 2 might mishandle timestamps after a
      version 3 or higher file's last transition, because they cannot parse
      extensions to POSIX in the TZ-like string. As a partial workaround, a
      writer can output more transitions than necessary, so that only far-future
      timestamps are mishandled by version 2 readers.</li>
  <li>Some readers designed for version 2 do not support permanent daylight
      saving time with transitions after 24:00 – e.g., a TZ string
      “EST5EDT,0/0,J365/25” denoting permanent Eastern Daylight
      Time (-04). As a workaround, a writer can substitute standard time for two
      time zones east, e.g., “XXX3EDT4,0/0,J365/23” for a time
      zone with a never-used standard time (XXX, -03) and negative daylight
      saving time (EDT, -04) all year. Alternatively, as a partial workaround a
      writer can substitute standard time for the next time zone east –
      e.g., “AST4” for permanent Atlantic Standard Time
    (-04).</li>
  <li>Some readers designed for version 2 or 3, and that require strict
      conformance to RFC 8536, reject version 4 files whose leap second tables
      are truncated at the start or that end in expiration times.</li>
  <li>Some readers ignore the footer, and instead predict future timestamps from
      the time type of the last transition. As a partial workaround, a writer
      can output more transitions than necessary.</li>
  <li>Some readers do not use time type 0 for timestamps before the first
      transition, in that they infer a time type using a heuristic that does not
      always select time type 0. As a partial workaround, a writer can output a
      dummy (no-op) first transition at an early time.</li>
  <li>Some readers mishandle timestamps before the first transition that has a
      timestamp not less than -2**31. Readers that support only 32-bit
      timestamps are likely to be more prone to this problem, for example, when
      they process 64-bit transitions only some of which are representable in 32
      bits. As a partial workaround, a writer can output a dummy transition at
      timestamp -2**31.</li>
  <li>Some readers mishandle a transition if its timestamp has the minimum
      possible signed 64-bit value. Timestamps less than -2**59 are not
      recommended.</li>
  <li>Some readers mishandle POSIX-style TZ strings that contain
      “&lt;” or “&gt;”. As a partial workaround, a
      writer can avoid using “&lt;” or “&gt;” for
      time zone abbreviations containing only alphabetic characters.</li>
  <li>Many readers mishandle time zone abbreviations that contain non-ASCII
      characters. These characters are not recommended.</li>
  <li>Some readers may mishandle time zone abbreviations that contain fewer than
      3 or more than 6 characters, or that contain ASCII characters other than
      alphanumerics, “<span class="Li">-</span>”, and
      “+”. These abbreviations are not recommended.</li>
  <li>Some readers mishandle TZif files that specify daylight-saving time UT
      offsets that are less than the UT offsets for the corresponding standard
      time. These readers do not support locations like Ireland, which uses the
      equivalent of the POSIX TZ string
      “IST<span class="Li">-</span>1GMT0,M10.5.0,M3.5.0/1”,
      observing standard time (IST, +01) in summer and daylight saving time
      (GMT, +00) in winter. As a partial workaround, a writer can output data
      for the equivalent of the POSIX TZ string
      “GMT0IST,M3.5.0/1,M10.5.0”, thus swapping standard and
      daylight saving time. Although this workaround misidentifies which part of
      the year uses daylight saving time, it records UT offsets and time zone
      abbreviations correctly.</li>
  <li>Some readers generate ambiguous timestamps for positive leap seconds that
      occur when the UTC offset is not a multiple of 60 seconds. For example, in
      a timezone with UTC offset +01:23:45 and with a positive leap second
      78796801 (1972-06-30 23:59:60 UTC), some readers will map both 78796800
      and 78796801 to 01:23:45 local time the next day instead of mapping the
      latter to 01:23:46, and they will map 78796815 to 01:23:59 instead of to
      01:23:60. This has not yet been a practical problem, since no civil
      authority has observed such UTC offsets since leap seconds were introduced
      in 1972.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Some interoperability problems are reader bugs that are listed
    here mostly as warnings to developers of readers.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Some readers do not support negative timestamps. Developers of distributed
      applications should keep this in mind if they need to deal with pre-1970
      data.</li>
  <li>Some readers mishandle timestamps before the first transition that has a
      nonnegative timestamp. Readers that do not support negative timestamps are
      likely to be more prone to this problem.</li>
  <li>Some readers mishandle time zone abbreviations like
      “<span class="Li">-</span>08” that contain
      “+”, “<span class="Li">-</span>”, or
    digits.</li>
  <li>Some readers mishandle UT offsets that are out of the traditional range of
      -12 through +12 hours, and so do not support locations like Kiritimati
      that are outside this range.</li>
  <li>Some readers mishandle UT offsets in the range [-3599, -1] seconds from
      UT, because they integer-divide the offset by 3600 to get 0 and then
      display the hour part as “+00”.</li>
  <li>Some readers mishandle UT offsets that are not a multiple of one hour, or
      of 15 minutes, or of 1 minute.</li>
</ul>
