<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
    the ISO&nbsp;C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
    here and the ISO&nbsp;C standard is unintentional. This volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO&nbsp;C standard.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>fwscanf</i>() function shall read from the named input
    <i>stream</i>. The <i>wscanf</i>() function shall read from the standard
    input stream <i>stdin</i>. The <i>swscanf</i>() function shall read from the
    wide-character string <i>ws</i>. Each function reads wide characters,
    interprets them according to a format, and stores the results in its
    arguments. Each expects, as arguments, a control wide-character string
    <i>format</i> described below, and a set of <i>pointer</i> arguments
    indicating where the converted input should be stored. The result is
    undefined if there are insufficient arguments for the format. If the
    <i>format</i> is exhausted while arguments remain, the excess arguments are
    evaluated but are otherwise ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">Conversions can be applied to the <i>n</i>th argument after the
    <i>format</i> in the argument list, rather than to the next unused argument.
    In this case, the conversion specifier wide character <b>%</b> (see below)
    is replaced by the sequence <b>"%n$"</b>, where <i>n</i> is a
    decimal integer in the range [1,{NL_ARGMAX}]. This feature provides for the
    definition of <i>format</i> wide-character strings that select arguments in
    an order appropriate to specific languages. In <i>format</i> wide-character
    strings containing the "%<i>n</i>$" form of conversion
    specifications, it is unspecified whether numbered arguments in the argument
    list can be referenced from the <i>format</i> wide-character string more
    than once.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>format</i> can contain either form of a conversion
    specification—that is, <b>%</b> or "%<i>n</i>$"— but
    the two forms cannot normally be mixed within a single <i>format</i>
    wide-character string. The only exception to this is that <b>%%</b> or
    <b>%*</b> can be mixed with the "%<i>n</i>$" form. When numbered
    argument specifications are used, specifying the <i>N</i>th argument
    requires that all the leading arguments, from the first to the
    (<i>N</i>-1)th, are pointers.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>fwscanf</i>() function in all its forms allows for
    detection of a language-dependent radix character in the input string,
    encoded as a wide-character value. The radix character is defined in the
    current locale (category <i>LC_NUMERIC</i>). In the POSIX locale, or in a
    locale where the radix character is not defined, the radix character shall
    default to a &lt;period&gt; (<b>'.'</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>format</i> is a wide-character string composed of zero or
    more directives. Each directive is composed of one of the following: one or
    more white-space wide characters (&lt;space&gt;, &lt;tab&gt;,
    &lt;newline&gt;, &lt;vertical-tab&gt;, or &lt;form-feed&gt;); an ordinary
    wide character (neither <b>'%'</b> nor a white-space character); or a
    conversion specification. It is unspecified whether an encoding error occurs
    if the format string contains <b>wchar_t</b> values that do not correspond
    to members of the character set of the current locale and the specified
    semantics do not require that value to be processed by <i>wcrtomb</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">Each conversion specification is introduced by the <b>'%'</b> or
    by the character sequence "%<i>n</i>$", after which the following
    appear in sequence:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>An optional assignment-suppressing character <b>'*'</b>.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>An optional non-zero decimal integer that specifies the maximum field
      width.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>An optional assignment-allocation character <b>'m'</b>.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>An optional length modifier that specifies the size of the receiving
      object.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>A conversion specifier wide character that specifies the type of
      conversion to be applied. The valid conversion specifiers are described
      below.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The <i>fwscanf</i>() functions shall execute each directive of the
    format in turn. If a directive fails, as detailed below, the function shall
    return. Failures are described as input failures (due to the unavailability
    of input bytes) or matching failures (due to inappropriate input).</p>
<p class="Pp">A directive composed of one or more white-space wide characters is
    executed by reading input until no more valid input can be read, or up to
    the first wide character which is not a white-space wide character, which
    remains unread.</p>
<p class="Pp">A directive that is an ordinary wide character shall be executed
    as follows. The next wide character is read from the input and compared with
    the wide character that comprises the directive; if the comparison shows
    that they are not equivalent, the directive shall fail, and the differing
    and subsequent wide characters remain unread. Similarly, if end-of-file, an
    encoding error, or a read error prevents a wide character from being read,
    the directive shall fail.</p>
<p class="Pp">A directive that is a conversion specification defines a set of
    matching input sequences, as described below for each conversion wide
    character. A conversion specification is executed in the following
  steps.</p>
<p class="Pp">Input white-space wide characters (as specified by
    <i><i>iswspace</i>()</i>) shall be skipped, unless the conversion
    specification includes a <b>[</b>, <b>c</b>, or <b>n</b> conversion
    specifier.</p>
<p class="Pp">An item shall be read from the input, unless the conversion
    specification includes an <b>n</b> conversion specifier wide character. An
    input item is defined as the longest sequence of input wide characters, not
    exceeding any specified field width, which is an initial subsequence of a
    matching sequence. The first wide character, if any, after the input item
    shall remain unread. If the length of the input item is zero, the execution
    of the conversion specification shall fail; this condition is a matching
    failure, unless end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read error prevented
    input from the stream, in which case it is an input failure.</p>
<p class="Pp">Except in the case of a <b>%</b> conversion specifier, the input
    item (or, in the case of a <b>%n</b> conversion specification, the count of
    input wide characters) shall be converted to a type appropriate to the
    conversion wide character. If the input item is not a matching sequence, the
    execution of the conversion specification shall fail; this condition is a
    matching failure. Unless assignment suppression was indicated by a
    <b>'*'</b>, the result of the conversion shall be placed in the object
    pointed to by the first argument following the <i>format</i> argument that
    has not already received a conversion result if the conversion specification
    is introduced by <b>%</b>, or in the <i>n</i>th argument if introduced by
    the wide-character sequence "%<i>n</i>$". If this object does not
    have an appropriate type, or if the result of the conversion cannot be
    represented in the space provided, the behavior is undefined.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>%c</b>, <b>%s</b>, and <b>%[</b> conversion specifiers
    shall accept an optional assignment-allocation character <b>'m'</b>, which
    shall cause a memory buffer to be allocated to hold the wide-character
    string converted including a terminating null wide character. In such a
    case, the argument corresponding to the conversion specifier should be a
    reference to a pointer value that will receive a pointer to the allocated
    buffer. The system shall allocate a buffer as if <i>malloc</i>() had been
    called. The application shall be responsible for freeing the memory after
    usage. If there is insufficient memory to allocate a buffer, the function
    shall set <i>errno</i> to <b>[ENOMEM]</b> and a conversion error shall
    result. If the function returns EOF, any memory successfully allocated for
    parameters using assignment-allocation character <b>'m'</b> by this call
    shall be freed before the function returns.

<p class="Pp">Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the
    number of successfully matched and assigned input items; this number can be
    zero in the event of an early matching failure. If the input ends before the
    first conversion (if any) has completed, and without a matching failure
    having occurred, EOF shall be returned. If an error occurs before the first
    conversion (if any) has completed, and without a matching failure having
    occurred, EOF shall be returned and <i>errno</i> shall be set to indicate
    the error. If a read error occurs, the error indicator for the stream shall
    be set.</p>

<p class="Pp">In format strings containing the <b>'%'</b> form of conversion
    specifications, each argument in the argument list is used exactly once.</p>
<p class="Pp">For functions that allocate memory as if by <i>malloc</i>(), the
    application should release such memory when it is no longer required by a
    call to <i>free</i>(). For <i>fwscanf</i>(), this is memory allocated via
    use of the <b>'m'</b> assignment-allocation character.</p>
