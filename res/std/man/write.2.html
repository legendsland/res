   2007-06-18 mtk:
      	Added details about seekable files and file offset.
  	Noted that write() may write less than 'count' bytes, and
  	gave some examples of why this might occur.
  	Noted what happens if write() is interrupted by a signal.

<p class="Pp"><b>write</b>() writes up to <i>count</i> bytes from the buffer
    starting at <i>buf</i> to the file referred to by the file descriptor
    <i>fd</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The number of bytes written may be less than <i>count</i> if, for
    example, there is insufficient space on the underlying physical medium, or
    the <b>RLIMIT_FSIZE</b> resource limit is encountered (see
    <b>setrlimit</b>(2)), or the call was interrupted by a signal handler after
    having written less than <i>count</i> bytes. (See also <b>pipe</b>(7).)</p>
<p class="Pp">For a seekable file (i.e., one to which <b>lseek</b>(2) may be
    applied, for example, a regular file) writing takes place at the file
    offset, and the file offset is incremented by the number of bytes actually
    written. If the file was <b>open</b>(2)ed with <b>O_APPEND</b>, the file
    offset is first set to the end of the file before writing. The adjustment of
    the file offset and the write operation are performed as an atomic step.</p>
<p class="Pp">POSIX requires that a <b>read</b>(2) that can be proved to occur
    after a <b>write</b>() has returned will return the new data. Note that not
    all filesystems are POSIX conforming.</p>
<p class="Pp">According to POSIX.1, if <i>count</i> is greater than
    <b>SSIZE_MAX</b>, the result is implementation-defined; see NOTES for the
    upper limit on Linux.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="RETURN_VALUE"><a class="permalink" href="#RETURN_VALUE">RETURN
  VALUE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">On success, the number of bytes written is returned. On error, -1
    is returned, and <i>errno</i> is set to indicate the error.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that a successful <b>write</b>() may transfer fewer than
    <i>count</i> bytes. Such partial writes can occur for various reasons; for
    example, because there was insufficient space on the disk device to write
    all of the requested bytes, or because a blocked <b>write</b>() to a socket,
    pipe, or similar was interrupted by a signal handler after it had
    transferred some, but before it had transferred all of the requested bytes.
    In the event of a partial write, the caller can make another <b>write</b>()
    call to transfer the remaining bytes. The subsequent call will either
    transfer further bytes or may result in an error (e.g., if the disk is now
    full).</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>count</i> is zero and <i>fd</i> refers to a regular file,
    then <b>write</b>() may return a failure status if one of the errors below
    is detected. If no errors are detected, or error detection is not performed,
    0 is returned without causing any other effect. If <i>count</i> is zero and
    <i>fd</i> refers to a file other than a regular file, the results are not
    specified.</p>

  <dd>A low-level I/O error occurred while modifying the inode. This error may
      relate to the write-back of data written by an earlier <b>write</b>(),
      which may have been issued to a different file descriptor on the same
      file. Since Linux 4.13, errors from write-back come with a promise that
      they <i>may</i> be reported by subsequent. <b>write</b>() requests, and
      <i>will</i> be reported by a subsequent <b>fsync</b>(2) (whether or not
      they were also reported by <b>write</b>()). An alternate cause of
      <b>EIO</b> on networked filesystems is when an advisory lock had been
      taken out on the file descriptor and this lock has been lost. See the

<p class="Pp">The types <i>size_t</i> and <i>ssize_t</i> are, respectively,
    unsigned and signed integer data types specified by POSIX.1.</p>
<p class="Pp">A successful return from <b>write</b>() does not make any
    guarantee that data has been committed to disk. On some filesystems,
    including NFS, it does not even guarantee that space has successfully been
    reserved for the data. In this case, some errors might be delayed until a
    future <b>write</b>(), <b>fsync</b>(2), or even <b>close</b>(2). The only
    way to be sure is to call <b>fsync</b>(2) after you are done writing all
    your data.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a <b>write</b>() is interrupted by a signal handler before any
    bytes are written, then the call fails with the error <b>EINTR</b>; if it is
    interrupted after at least one byte has been written, the call succeeds, and
    returns the number of bytes written.</p>
<p class="Pp">On Linux, <b>write</b>() (and similar system calls) will transfer
    at most 0x7ffff000 (2,147,479,552) bytes, returning the number of bytes
    actually transferred. (This is true on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.)</p>
<p class="Pp">An error return value while performing <b>write</b>() using direct
    I/O does not mean the entire write has failed. Partial data may be written
    and the data at the file offset on which the <b>write</b>() was attempted
    should be considered inconsistent.</p>

<p class="Pp">According to POSIX.1-2008/SUSv4 Section XSI 2.9.7 ("Thread
    Interactions with Regular File Operations"):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">All of the following functions shall be atomic with
  respect to each other in the effects specified in POSIX.1-2008 when they
  operate on regular files or symbolic links: ...</div>
<p class="Pp">Among the APIs subsequently listed are <b>write</b>() and
    <b>writev</b>(2). And among the effects that should be atomic across threads
    (and processes) are updates of the file offset. However, before Linux 3.14,
    this was not the case: if two processes that share an open file description
    (see <b>open</b>(2)) perform a <b>write</b>() (or <b>writev</b>(2)) at the
    same time, then the I/O operations were not atomic with respect to updating
    the file offset, with the result that the blocks of data output by the two
    processes might (incorrectly) overlap. This problem was fixed in Linux
  3.14.</p>
