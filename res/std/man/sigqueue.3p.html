<p class="Pp">The <i>sigqueue</i>() function shall cause the signal specified by
    <i>signo</i> to be sent with the value specified by <i>value</i> to the
    process specified by <i>pid</i>. If <i>signo</i> is zero (the null signal),
    error checking is performed but no signal is actually sent. The null signal
    can be used to check the validity of <i>pid</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The conditions required for a process to have permission to queue
    a signal to another process are the same as for the <i>kill</i>()
  function.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>sigqueue</i>() function shall return immediately. If
    SA_SIGINFO is set for <i>signo</i> and if the resources were available to
    queue the signal, the signal shall be queued and sent to the receiving
    process. If SA_SIGINFO is not set for <i>signo</i>, then <i>signo</i> shall
    be sent at least once to the receiving process; it is unspecified whether
    <i>value</i> shall be sent to the receiving process as a result of this
    call.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the value of <i>pid</i> causes <i>signo</i> to be generated for
    the sending process, and if <i>signo</i> is not blocked for the calling
    thread and if no other thread has <i>signo</i> unblocked or is waiting in a
    <i>sigwait</i>() function for <i>signo</i>, either <i>signo</i> or at least
    the pending, unblocked signal shall be delivered to the calling thread
    before the <i>sigqueue</i>() function returns. Should any multiple pending
    signals in the range SIGRTMIN to SIGRTMAX be selected for delivery, it shall
    be the lowest numbered one. The selection order between realtime and
    non-realtime signals, or between multiple pending non-realtime signals, is
    unspecified.</p>

<p class="Pp">The <i>sigqueue</i>() function allows an application to queue a
    realtime signal to itself or to another process, specifying the
    application-defined value. This is common practice in realtime applications
    on existing realtime systems. It was felt that specifying another function
    in the <i>sig</i>... name space already carved out for signals was
    preferable to extending the interface to <i>kill</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">Such a function became necessary when the put/get event function
    of the message queues was removed. It should be noted that the
    <i>sigqueue</i>() function implies reduced performance in a
    security-conscious implementation as the access permissions between the
    sender and receiver have to be checked on each send when the <i>pid</i> is
    resolved into a target process. Such access checks were necessary only at
    message queue open in the previous interface.</p>
<p class="Pp">The standard developers required that <i>sigqueue</i>() have the
    same semantics with respect to the null signal as <i>kill</i>(), and that
    the same permission checking be used. But because of the difficulty of
    implementing the ``broadcast'' semantic of <i>kill</i>() (for example, to
    process groups) and the interaction with resource allocation, this semantic
    was not adopted. The <i>sigqueue</i>() function queues a signal to a single
    process specified by the <i>pid</i> argument.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>sigqueue</i>() function can fail if the system has
    insufficient resources to queue the signal. An explicit limit on the number
    of queued signals that a process could send was introduced. While the limit
    is ``per-sender'', this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify that
    the resources be part of the state of the sender. This would require either
    that the sender be maintained after exit until all signals that it had sent
    to other processes were handled or that all such signals that had not yet
    been acted upon be removed from the queue(s) of the receivers. This volume
    of POSIX.1‐2017 does not preclude this behavior, but an
    implementation that allocated queuing resources from a system-wide pool
    (with per-sender limits) and that leaves queued signals pending after the
    sender exits is also permitted.</p>
