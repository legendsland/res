<p class="Pp">The <i>wait</i>() and <i>waitpid</i>() functions shall obtain
    status information (see <i>Section 2.13</i>, <i>Status Information</i>)
    pertaining to one of the caller's child processes. The <i>wait</i>()
    function obtains status information for process termination from any child
    process. The <i>waitpid</i>() function obtains status information for
    process termination, and optionally process stop and/or continue, from a
    specified subset of the child processes.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>wait</i>() function shall cause the calling thread to
    become blocked until status information generated by child process
    termination is made available to the thread, or until delivery of a signal
    whose action is either to execute a signal-catching function or to terminate
    the process, or an error occurs. If termination status information is
    available prior to the call to <i>wait</i>(), return shall be immediate. If
    termination status information is available for two or more child processes,
    the order in which their status is reported is unspecified.</p>
<p class="Pp">As described in <i>Section 2.13</i>, <i>Status Information</i>,
    the <i>wait</i>() and <i>waitpid</i>() functions consume the status
    information they obtain.</p>
<p class="Pp">The behavior when multiple threads are blocked in <i>wait</i>(),
    <i>waitid</i>(), or <i>waitpid</i>() is described in <i>Section 2.13</i>,
    <i>Status Information</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>waitpid</i>() function shall be equivalent to <i>wait</i>()
    if the <i>pid</i> argument is (<b>pid_t</b>)-1 and the <i>options</i>
    argument is 0. Otherwise, its behavior shall be modified by the values of
    the <i>pid</i> and <i>options</i> arguments.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>pid</i> argument specifies a set of child processes for
    which <i>status</i> is requested. The <i>waitpid</i>() function shall only
    return the status of a child process from this set:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>If <i>pid</i> is equal to (<b>pid_t</b>)-1, <i>status</i> is requested for
      any child process. In this respect, <i>waitpid</i>() is then equivalent to
      <i>wait</i>().</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>If <i>pid</i> is greater than 0, it specifies the process ID of a single
      child process for which <i>status</i> is requested.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>If <i>pid</i> is 0, <i>status</i> is requested for any child process whose
      process group ID is equal to that of the calling process.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>If <i>pid</i> is less than (<b>pid_t</b>)-1, <i>status</i> is requested
      for any child process whose process group ID is equal to the absolute
      value of <i>pid</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The <i>options</i> argument is constructed from the
    bitwise-inclusive OR of zero or more of the following flags, defined in the
    <i>&lt;sys/wait.h&gt;</i> header:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="WCONTINUED"><a class="permalink" href="#WCONTINUED">WCONTINUED</a></dt>
  <dd>The <i>waitpid</i>() function shall report the status of any continued
      child process specified by <i>pid</i> whose status has not been reported
      since it continued from a job control stop.</dd>
  <dt id="WNOHANG"><a class="permalink" href="#WNOHANG">WNOHANG</a></dt>
  <dd>The <i>waitpid</i>() function shall not suspend execution of the calling
      thread if <i>status</i> is not immediately available for one of the child
      processes specified by <i>pid</i>.</dd>
  <dt id="WUNTRACED"><a class="permalink" href="#WUNTRACED">WUNTRACED</a></dt>
  <dd>The status of any child processes specified by <i>pid</i> that are
      stopped, and whose status has not yet been reported since they stopped,
      shall also be reported to the requesting process.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If <i>wait</i>() or <i>waitpid</i>() return because the status of
    a child process is available, these functions shall return a value equal to
    the process ID of the child process. In this case, if the value of the
    argument <i>stat_loc</i> is not a null pointer, information shall be stored
    in the location pointed to by <i>stat_loc</i>. The value stored at the
    location pointed to by <i>stat_loc</i> shall be 0 if and only if the status
    returned is from a terminated child process that terminated by one of the
    following means:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> 1.</dt>
  <dd>The process returned 0 from <i>main</i>().</dd>
  <dt> 2.</dt>
  <dd>The process called <i>_exit</i>() or <i>exit</i>() with a <i>status</i>
      argument of 0.</dd>
  <dt> 3.</dt>
  <dd>The process was terminated because the last thread in the process
      terminated.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Regardless of its value, this information may be interpreted using
    the following macros, which are defined in <i>&lt;sys/wait.h&gt;</i> and
    evaluate to integral expressions; the <i>stat_val</i> argument is the
    integer value pointed to by <i>stat_loc</i>.</p>

<p class="Pp">Calls to <i>wait</i>() will collect information about any child
    process. This may result in interactions with other interfaces that may be
    waiting for their own children (such as by use of <i>system</i>()). For this
    and other reasons it is recommended that portable applications not use
    <i>wait</i>(), but instead use <i>waitpid</i>(). For these same reasons, the
    use of <i>waitpid</i>() with a <i>pid</i> argument of -1, and the use of
    <i>waitid</i>() with the <i>idtype</i> argument set to P_ALL, are also not
    recommended for portable applications.</p>
<p class="Pp">As specified in <i>Consequences of Process Termination</i>, if the
    calling process has SA_NOCLDWAIT set or has SIGCHLD set to SIG_IGN, then the
    termination of a child process will not cause status information to become
    available to a thread blocked in <i>wait</i>(), <i>waitid</i>(), or
    <i>waitpid</i>(). Thus, a thread blocked in one of the wait functions will
    remain blocked unless some other condition causes the thread to resume
    execution (such as an <b>[ECHILD]</b> failure due to no remaining children
    in the set of waited-for children).</p>

    that is, a child that was produced by a single <i>fork</i>() call (perhaps
    followed by an <i>exec</i> or other function calls) from the parent. If a
    child produces grandchildren by further use of <i>fork</i>(), none of those
    grandchildren nor any of their descendants affect the behavior of a
    <i>wait</i>() from the original parent process. Nothing in this volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017 prevents an implementation from providing extensions
    that permit a process to get <i>status</i> from a grandchild or any other
    process, but a process that does not use such extensions must be guaranteed
    to see <i>status</i> from only its direct children.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>waitpid</i>() function is provided for three reasons:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> 1.</dt>
  <dd>To support job control</dd>
  <dt> 2.</dt>
  <dd>To permit a non-blocking version of the <i>wait</i>() function</dd>
  <dt> 3.</dt>
  <dd>To permit a library routine, such as <i>system</i>() or <i>pclose</i>(),
      to wait for its children without interfering with other terminated
      children for which the process has not waited</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The first two of these facilities are based on the <i>wait3</i>()
    function provided by 4.3 BSD. The function uses the <i>options</i> argument,
    which is equivalent to an argument to <i>wait3</i>(). The WUNTRACED flag is
    used only in conjunction with job control on systems supporting job control.
    Its name comes from 4.3 BSD and refers to the fact that there are two types
    of stopped processes in that implementation: processes being traced via the
    <i>ptrace</i>() debugging facility and (untraced) processes stopped by job
    control signals. Since <i>ptrace</i>() is not part of this volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017, only the second type is relevant. The name WUNTRACED
    was retained because its usage is the same, even though the name is not
    intuitively meaningful in this context.</p>
<p class="Pp">The third reason for the <i>waitpid</i>() function is to permit
    independent sections of a process to spawn and wait for children without
    interfering with each other. For example, the following problem occurs in
    developing a portable shell, or command interpreter:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>stream = popen("/bin/true");
(void) system("sleep 100");
(void) pclose(stream);</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">On all historical implementations, the final <i>pclose</i>() fails
    to reap the <i>wait</i>() <i>status</i> of the <i>popen</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">The status values are retrieved by macros, rather than given as
    specific bit encodings as they are in most historical implementations (and
    thus expected by existing programs). This was necessary to eliminate a
    limitation on the number of signals an implementation can support that was
    inherent in the traditional encodings. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017
    does require that a <i>status</i> value of zero corresponds to a process
    calling <i>_exit</i>(0), as this is the most common encoding expected by
    existing programs. Some of the macro names were adopted from 4.3 BSD.</p>
<p class="Pp">These macros syntactically operate on an arbitrary integer value.
    The behavior is undefined unless that value is one stored by a successful
    call to <i>wait</i>() or <i>waitpid</i>() in the location pointed to by the
    <i>stat_loc</i> argument. An early proposal attempted to make this clearer
    by specifying each argument as *<i>stat_loc</i> rather than <i>stat_val</i>.
    However, that did not follow the conventions of other specifications in this
    volume of POSIX.1‐2017 or traditional usage. It also could have
    implied that the argument to the macro must literally be *<i>stat_loc</i>;
    in fact, that value can be stored or passed as an argument to other
    functions before being interpreted by these macros.</p>
<p class="Pp">The extension that affects <i>wait</i>() and <i>waitpid</i>() and
    is common in historical implementations is the <i>ptrace</i>() function. It
    is called by a child process and causes that child to stop and return a
    <i>status</i> that appears identical to the <i>status</i> indicated by
    WIFSTOPPED. The <i>status</i> of <i>ptrace</i>() children is traditionally
    returned regardless of the WUNTRACED flag (or by the <i>wait</i>()
    function). Most applications do not need to concern themselves with such
    extensions because they have control over what extensions they or their
    children use. However, applications, such as command interpreters, that
    invoke arbitrary processes may see this behavior when those arbitrary
    processes misuse such extensions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Implementations that support <b>core</b> file creation or other
    implementation-defined actions on termination of some processes
    traditionally provide a bit in the <i>status</i> returned by <i>wait</i>()
    to indicate that such actions have occurred.</p>
<p class="Pp">Allowing the <i>wait</i>() family of functions to discard a
    pending SIGCHLD signal that is associated with a successfully waited-for
    child process puts them into the <i>sigwait</i>() and <i>sigwaitinfo</i>()
    category with respect to SIGCHLD.</p>
<p class="Pp">This definition allows implementations to treat a pending SIGCHLD
    signal as accepted by the process in <i>wait</i>(), with the same meaning of
    ``accepted'' as when that word is applied to the <i>sigwait</i>() family of
    functions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Allowing the <i>wait</i>() family of functions to behave this way
    permits an implementation to be able to deal precisely with SIGCHLD
  signals.</p>
<p class="Pp">In particular, an implementation that does accept (discard) the
    SIGCHLD signal can make the following guarantees regardless of the queuing
    depth of signals in general (the list of waitable children can hold the
    SIGCHLD queue):</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> 1.</dt>
  <dd>If a SIGCHLD signal handler is established via <i>sigaction</i>() without
      the SA_RESETHAND flag, SIGCHLD signals can be accurately counted; that is,
      exactly one SIGCHLD signal will be delivered to or accepted by the process
      for every child process that terminates.</dd>
  <dt> 2.</dt>
  <dd>A single <i>wait</i>() issued from a SIGCHLD signal handler can be
      guaranteed to return immediately with status information for a child
      process.</dd>
  <dt> 3.</dt>
  <dd>When SA_SIGINFO is requested, the SIGCHLD signal handler can be guaranteed
      to receive a non-null pointer to a <b>siginfo_t</b> structure that
      describes a child process for which a wait via <i>waitpid</i>() or
      <i>waitid</i>() will not block or fail.</dd>
  <dt> 4.</dt>
  <dd>The <i>system</i>() function will not cause the SIGCHLD handler of a
      process to be called as a result of the <i>fork</i>()/<i>exec</i> executed
      within <i>system</i>() because <i>system</i>() will accept the SIGCHLD
      signal when it performs a <i>waitpid</i>() for its child process. This is
      a desirable behavior of <i>system</i>() so that it can be used in a
      library without causing side-effects to the application linked with the
      library.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">An implementation that does not permit the <i>wait</i>() family of
    functions to accept (discard) a pending SIGCHLD signal associated with a
    successfully waited-for child, cannot make the guarantees described above
    for the following reasons:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Guarantee"><a class="permalink" href="#Guarantee">Guarantee
    #1</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br>
    Although it might be assumed that reliable queuing of all SIGCHLD signals
      generated by the system can make this guarantee, the counter-example is
      the case of a process that blocks SIGCHLD and performs an indefinite loop
      of <i>fork</i>()/<i>wait</i>() operations. If the implementation supports
      queued signals, then eventually the system will run out of memory for the
      queue. The guarantee cannot be made because there must be some limit to
      the depth of queuing.</dd>
  <dt id="Guarantees"><a class="permalink" href="#Guarantees">Guarantees #2 and
    #3</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br>
    These cannot be guaranteed unless the <i>wait</i>() family of functions
      accepts the SIGCHLD signal. Otherwise, a <i>fork</i>()/<i>wait</i>()
      executed while SIGCHLD is blocked (as in the <i>system</i>() function)
      will result in an invocation of the handler when SIGCHLD is unblocked,
      after the process has disappeared.</dd>
  <dt id="Guarantee~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Guarantee~2">Guarantee
    #4</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <br>
    Although possible to make this guarantee, <i>system</i>() would have to set
      the SIGCHLD handler to SIG_DFL so that the SIGCHLD signal generated by its
      <i>fork</i>() would be discarded (the SIGCHLD default action is to be
      ignored), then restore it to its previous setting. This would have the
      undesirable side-effect of discarding all SIGCHLD signals pending to the
      process.</dd>
