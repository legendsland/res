<p class="Pp">The <i>open</i>() function shall establish the connection between
    a file and a file descriptor. It shall create an open file description that
    refers to a file and a file descriptor that refers to that open file
    description. The file descriptor is used by other I/O functions to refer to
    that file. The <i>path</i> argument points to a pathname naming the
  file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>open</i>() function shall return a file descriptor for the
    named file, allocated as described in <i>Section 2.14</i>, <i>File
    Descriptor Allocation</i>. The open file description is new, and therefore
    the file descriptor shall not share it with any other process in the system.
    The FD_CLOEXEC file descriptor flag associated with the new file descriptor
    shall be cleared unless the O_CLOEXEC flag is set in <i>oflag</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The file offset used to mark the current position within the file
    shall be set to the beginning of the file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The file status flags and file access modes of the open file
    description shall be set according to the value of <i>oflag</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Values for <i>oflag</i> are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive OR
    of flags from the following list, defined in <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i>.

    modes) below in the value of <i>oflag</i>:</p>

  <dd>If the file exists, this flag has no effect except as noted under O_EXCL

      regular file; the user ID of the file shall be set to the effective user
      ID of the process; the group ID of the file shall be set to the group ID
      of the file's parent directory or to the effective group ID of the
      process; and the access permission bits (see <i>&lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</i>) of
      the file mode shall be set to the value of the argument following the
      <i>oflag</i> argument taken as type <b>mode_t</b> modified as follows: a
      bitwise AND is performed on the file-mode bits and the corresponding bits
      in the complement of the process' file mode creation mask. Thus, all bits
      in the file mode whose corresponding bit in the file mode creation mask is
      set are cleared. When bits other than the file permission bits are set,
      the effect is unspecified. The argument following the <i>oflag</i>
      argument does not affect whether the file is open for reading, writing, or
      for both. Implementations shall provide a way to initialize the file's
      group ID to the group ID of the parent directory. Implementations may, but
      need not, provide an implementation-defined way to initialize the file's

<p class="Pp">The application shall ensure that it specifies the O_TTY_INIT flag
    on the first open of a terminal device since system boot or since the device
    was closed by the process that last had it open. The application need not
    specify the O_TTY_INIT flag when opening pseudo-terminals. If <i>path</i>
    names the master side of a pseudo-terminal device, then it is unspecified

    current working directory. If the access mode of the open file description
    associated with the file descriptor is not O_SEARCH, the function shall

<h1 class="Sh" id="APPLICATION_USAGE"><a class="permalink" href="#APPLICATION_USAGE">APPLICATION
  USAGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">POSIX.1‐2008 does not require that terminal parameters be
    automatically set to any state on first open, nor that they be reset after
    the last close. It is possible for a non-conforming application to leave a
    terminal device in a state where the next process to use that device finds
    it in a non-conforming state, but has no way of determining this. To ensure
    that the device is set to a conforming initial state, applications which
    perform a first open of a terminal (other than a pseudo-terminal) should do
    so using the O_TTY_INIT flag to set the parameters associated with the
    terminal to a conforming state.</p>
<p class="Pp">Except as specified in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, the
    flags allowed in <i>oflag</i> are not mutually-exclusive and any number of
    them may be used simultaneously. Not all combinations of flags make sense.
    For example, using O_SEARCH | O_CREAT will successfully open a pre-existing
    directory for searching, but if there is no existing file by that name, then
    it is unspecified whether a regular file will be created. Likewise, if a
    non-directory file descriptor is successfully returned, it is unspecified
    whether that descriptor will have execute permissions as if by O_EXEC (note
    that it is unspecified whether O_EXEC and O_SEARCH have the same value).</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="permalink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Some implementations permit opening FIFOs with O_RDWR. Since FIFOs
    could be implemented in other ways, and since two file descriptors can be
    used to the same effect, this possibility is left as undefined.</p>
<p class="Pp">See <i><i>getgroups</i>()</i> about the group of a newly created
    file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The use of <i>open</i>() to create a regular file is preferable to
    the use of <i>creat</i>(), because the latter is redundant and included only
    for historical reasons.</p>
<p class="Pp">The use of the O_TRUNC flag on FIFOs and directories (pipes cannot
    be <i>open</i>()-ed) must be permissible without unexpected side-effects
    (for example, <i>creat</i>() on a FIFO must not remove data). Since terminal
    special files might have type-ahead data stored in the buffer, O_TRUNC
    should not affect their content, particularly if a program that normally
    opens a regular file should open the current controlling terminal instead.
    Other file types, particularly implementation-defined ones, are left
    implementation-defined.</p>
<p class="Pp">POSIX.1‐2008 permits <b>[EACCES]</b> to be returned for
    conditions other than those explicitly listed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The O_NOCTTY flag was added to allow applications to avoid
    unintentionally acquiring a controlling terminal as a side-effect of opening
    a terminal file. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify how a
    controlling terminal is acquired, but it allows an implementation to provide
    this on <i>open</i>() if the O_NOCTTY flag is not set and other conditions
    specified in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter
    11</i>, <i>General Terminal Interface</i> are met.</p>
<p class="Pp">In historical implementations the value of O_RDONLY is zero.
    Because of that, it is not possible to detect the presence of O_RDONLY and
    another option. Future implementations should encode O_RDONLY and O_WRONLY
    as bit flags so that:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>O_RDONLY | O_WRONLY == O_RDWR</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">O_EXEC and O_SEARCH are specified as two of the five file access
    modes. Since O_EXEC does not apply to directories, and O_SEARCH only applies
    to directories, their values need not be distinct. Since O_RDONLY has
    historically had the value zero, implementations are not able to distinguish
    between O_SEARCH and O_SEARCH | O_RDONLY, and similarly for O_EXEC.</p>
<p class="Pp">In general, the <i>open</i>() function follows the symbolic link
    if <i>path</i> names a symbolic link. However, the <i>open</i>() function,
    when called with O_CREAT and O_EXCL, is required to fail with
    <b>[EEXIST]</b> if <i>path</i> names an existing symbolic link, even if the
    symbolic link refers to a nonexistent file. This behavior is required so
    that privileged applications can create a new file in a known location
    without the possibility that a symbolic link might cause the file to be
    created in a different location.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, a privileged application that must create a file with
    a predictable name in a user-writable directory, such as the user's home
    directory, could be compromised if the user creates a symbolic link with
    that name that refers to a nonexistent file in a system directory. If the
    user can influence the contents of a file, the user could compromise the
    system by creating a new system configuration or spool file that would then
    be interpreted by the system. The test for a symbolic link which refers to a
    nonexisting file must be atomic with the creation of a new file.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition, the <i>open</i>() function refuses to open
    non-directories if the O_DIRECTORY flag is set. This avoids race conditions
    whereby a user might compromise the system by substituting a hard link to a
    sensitive file (e.g., a device or a FIFO) while a privileged application is
    running, where opening a file even for read access might have undesirable
    side-effects.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition, the <i>open</i>() function does not follow symbolic
    links if the O_NOFOLLOW flag is set. This avoids race conditions whereby a
    user might compromise the system by substituting a symbolic link to a
    sensitive file (e.g., a device) while a privileged application is running,
    where opening a file even for read access might have undesirable
    side-effects.</p>
<p class="Pp">The POSIX.1‐1990 standard required that the group ID of a
    newly created file be set to the group ID of its parent directory or to the
    effective group ID of the creating process. FIPS 151‐2 required that
    implementations provide a way to have the group ID be set to the group ID of
    the containing directory, but did not prohibit implementations also
    supporting a way to set the group ID to the effective group ID of the
    creating process. Conforming applications should not assume which group ID
    will be used. If it matters, an application can use <i>chown</i>() to set
    the group ID after the file is created, or determine under what conditions
    the implementation will set the desired group ID.</p>
<p class="Pp">The purpose of the <i>openat</i>() function is to enable opening
    files in directories other than the current working directory without
    exposure to race conditions. Any part of the path of a file could be changed
    in parallel to a call to <i>open</i>(), resulting in unspecified behavior.
    By opening a file descriptor for the target directory and using the
    <i>openat</i>() function it can be guaranteed that the opened file is
    located relative to the desired directory. Some implementations use the
    <i>openat</i>() function for other purposes as well. In some cases, if the
    <i>oflag</i> parameter has the O_XATTR bit set, the returned file descriptor
    provides access to extended attributes. This functionality is not
    standardized here.</p>
