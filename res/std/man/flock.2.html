   FIXME Maybe document LOCK_MAND, LOCK_RW, LOCK_READ, LOCK_WRITE
   which only have effect for SAMBA.

<p class="Pp">A call to <b>flock</b>() may block if an incompatible lock is held
    by another process. To make a nonblocking request, include <b>LOCK_NB</b>
    (by ORing) with any of the above operations.</p>
<p class="Pp">A single file may not simultaneously have both shared and
    exclusive locks.</p>
<p class="Pp">Locks created by <b>flock</b>() are associated with an open file
    description (see <b>open</b>(2)). This means that duplicate file descriptors
    (created by, for example, <b>fork</b>(2) or <b>dup</b>(2)) refer to the same
    lock, and this lock may be modified or released using any of these file
    descriptors. Furthermore, the lock is released either by an explicit
    <b>LOCK_UN</b> operation on any of these duplicate file descriptors, or when
    all such file descriptors have been closed.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a process uses <b>open</b>(2) (or similar) to obtain more than
    one file descriptor for the same file, these file descriptors are treated
    independently by <b>flock</b>(). An attempt to lock the file using one of
    these file descriptors may be denied by a lock that the calling process has
    already placed via another file descriptor.</p>
<p class="Pp">A process may hold only one type of lock (shared or exclusive) on
    a file. Subsequent <b>flock</b>() calls on an already locked file will
    convert an existing lock to the new lock mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">Locks created by <b>flock</b>() are preserved across an
    <b>execve</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp">A shared or exclusive lock can be placed on a file regardless of
    the mode in which the file was opened.</p>

<p class="Pp">4.4BSD (the <b>flock</b>() call first appeared in 4.2BSD). A
    version of <b>flock</b>(), possibly implemented in terms of <b>fcntl</b>(2),
    appears on most UNIX systems.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 2.0, <b>flock</b>() is implemented as a system call in
    its own right rather than being emulated in the GNU C library as a call to
    <b>fcntl</b>(2). With this implementation, there is no interaction between
    the types of lock placed by <b>flock</b>() and <b>fcntl</b>(2), and
    <b>flock</b>() does not detect deadlock. (Note, however, that on some
    systems, such as the modern BSDs, <b>flock</b>() and <b>fcntl</b>(2) locks
    <i>do</i> interact with one another.)</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>flock</b>() places advisory locks only; given suitable
    permissions on a file, a process is free to ignore the use of <b>flock</b>()
    and perform I/O on the file.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>flock</b>() and <b>fcntl</b>(2) locks have different semantics
    with respect to forked processes and <b>dup</b>(2). On systems that
    implement <b>flock</b>() using <b>fcntl</b>(2), the semantics of
    <b>flock</b>() will be different from those described in this manual
  page.</p>
<p class="Pp">Converting a lock (shared to exclusive, or vice versa) is not
    guaranteed to be atomic: the existing lock is first removed, and then a new
    lock is established. Between these two steps, a pending lock request by
    another process may be granted, with the result that the conversion either
    blocks, or fails if <b>LOCK_NB</b> was specified. (This is the original BSD
    behavior, and occurs on many other implementations.)</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="NFS_details"><a class="permalink" href="#NFS_details">NFS
  details</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Up to Linux 2.6.11, <b>flock</b>() does not lock files over NFS
    (i.e., the scope of locks was limited to the local system). Instead, one
    could use <b>fcntl</b>(2) byte-range locking, which does work over NFS,
    given a sufficiently recent version of Linux and a server which supports
    locking.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 2.6.12, NFS clients support <b>flock</b>() locks by
    emulating them as <b>fcntl</b>(2) byte-range locks on the entire file. This
    means that <b>fcntl</b>(2) and <b>flock</b>() locks <i>do</i> interact with
    one another over NFS. It also means that in order to place an exclusive
    lock, the file must be opened for writing.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 2.6.37, the kernel supports a compatibility mode that
    allows <b>flock</b>() locks (and also <b>fcntl</b>(2) byte region locks) to
    be treated as local; see the discussion of the <i>local_lock</i> option in
    <b>nfs</b>(5).</p>

<p class="Pp">Up to Linux 5.4, <b>flock</b>() is not propagated over SMB. A file
    with such locks will not appear locked for remote clients.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 5.5, <b>flock</b>() locks are emulated with SMB
    byte-range locks on the entire file. Similarly to NFS, this means that
    <b>fcntl</b>(2) and <b>flock</b>() locks interact with one another. Another
    important side-effect is that the locks are not advisory anymore: any IO on
    a locked file will always fail with <b>EACCES</b> when done from a separate
    file descriptor. This difference originates from the design of locks in the
    SMB protocol, which provides mandatory locking semantics.</p>
<p class="Pp">Remote and mandatory locking semantics may vary with SMB protocol,
    mount options and server type. See <b>mount.cifs</b>(8) for additional
    information.</p>
