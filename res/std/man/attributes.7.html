<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><i>Note</i>: the text of this man page is based on the material
    taken from the "POSIX Safety Concepts" section of the GNU C
    Library manual. Further details on the topics described here can be found in
    that manual.</p>
<p class="Pp">Various function manual pages include a section ATTRIBUTES that
    describes the safety of calling the function in various contexts. This
    section annotates functions with the following safety markings:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="MT-Safe"><a class="permalink" href="#MT-Safe"><i>MT-Safe</i></a></dt>
  <dd><i>MT-Safe</i> or Thread-Safe functions are safe to call in the presence
      of other threads. MT, in MT-Safe, stands for Multi Thread.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Being MT-Safe does not imply a function is atomic, nor that it uses any of
      the memory synchronization mechanisms POSIX exposes to users. It is even
      possible that calling MT-Safe functions in sequence does not yield an
      MT-Safe combination. For example, having a thread call two MT-Safe
      functions one right after the other does not guarantee behavior equivalent
      to atomic execution of a combination of both functions, since concurrent
      calls in other threads may interfere in a destructive way.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Whole-program optimizations that could inline functions across library
      interfaces may expose unsafe reordering, and so performing inlining across
      the GNU C Library interface is not recommended. The documented MT-Safety
      status is not guaranteed under whole-program optimization. However,
      functions defined in user-visible headers are designed to be safe for
      inlining.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="MT-Unsafe"><a class="permalink" href="#MT-Unsafe"><i>MT-Unsafe</i></a></dt>
  <dd><i>MT-Unsafe</i> functions are not safe to call in a multithreaded
      programs.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Other keywords that appear in safety notes are defined in
    subsequent sections.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Conditionally_safe_features"><a class="permalink" href="#Conditionally_safe_features">Conditionally
  safe features</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">For some features that make functions unsafe to call in certain
    contexts, there are known ways to avoid the safety problem other than
    refraining from calling the function altogether. The keywords that follow
    refer to such features, and each of their definitions indicates how the
    whole program needs to be constrained in order to remove the safety problem
    indicated by the keyword. Only when all the reasons that make a function
    unsafe are observed and addressed, by applying the documented constraints,
    does the function become safe to call in a context.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="init"><a class="permalink" href="#init"><i>init</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Functions marked with <i>init</i> as an MT-Unsafe feature perform
      MT-Unsafe initialization when they are first called.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Calling such a function at least once in single-threaded mode removes this
      specific cause for the function to be regarded as MT-Unsafe. If no other
      cause for that remains, the function can then be safely called after other
      threads are started.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="race"><a class="permalink" href="#race"><i>race</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Functions annotated with <i>race</i> as an MT-Safety issue operate on
      objects in ways that may cause data races or similar forms of destructive
      interference out of concurrent execution. In some cases, the objects are
      passed to the functions by users; in others, they are used by the
      functions to return values to users; in others, they are not even exposed
      to users.</dd>
  <dt id="const"><a class="permalink" href="#const"><i>const</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Functions marked with <i>const</i> as an MT-Safety issue non-atomically
      modify internal objects that are better regarded as constant, because a
      substantial portion of the GNU C Library accesses them without
      synchronization. Unlike <i>race</i>, which causes both readers and writers
      of internal objects to be regarded as MT-Unsafe, this mark is applied to
      writers only. Writers remain MT-Unsafe to call, but the then-mandatory
      constness of objects they modify enables readers to be regarded as MT-Safe
      (as long as no other reasons for them to be unsafe remain), since the lack
      of synchronization is not a problem when the objects are effectively
      constant.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The identifier that follows the <i>const</i> mark will appear by itself as
      a safety note in readers. Programs that wish to work around this safety
      issue, so as to call writers, may use a non-recursive read-write lock
      associated with the identifier, and guard <i>all</i> calls to functions
      marked with <i>const</i> followed by the identifier with a write lock, and
      <i>all</i> calls to functions marked with the identifier by itself with a
      read lock.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="sig"><a class="permalink" href="#sig"><i>sig</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Functions marked with <i>sig</i> as a MT-Safety issue may temporarily
      install a signal handler for internal purposes, which may interfere with
      other uses of the signal, identified after a colon.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>This safety problem can be worked around by ensuring that no other uses of
      the signal will take place for the duration of the call. Holding a
      non-recursive mutex while calling all functions that use the same
      temporary signal; blocking that signal before the call and resetting its
      handler afterwards is recommended.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="term"><a class="permalink" href="#term"><i>term</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Functions marked with <i>term</i> as an MT-Safety issue may change the
      terminal settings in the recommended way, namely: call
      <b>tcgetattr</b>(3), modify some flags, and then call <b>tcsetattr</b>(3),
      this creates a window in which changes made by other threads are lost.
      Thus, functions marked with <i>term</i> are MT-Unsafe.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>It is thus advisable for applications using the terminal to avoid
      concurrent and reentrant interactions with it, by not using it in signal
      handlers or blocking signals that might use it, and holding a lock while
      calling these functions and interacting with the terminal. This lock
      should also be used for mutual exclusion with functions marked with
      <i>race:tcattr(fd)</i>, where <i>fd</i> is a file descriptor for the
      controlling terminal. The caller may use a single mutex for simplicity, or
      use one mutex per terminal, even if referenced by different file
      descriptors.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Other_safety_remarks"><a class="permalink" href="#Other_safety_remarks">Other
  safety remarks</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Additional keywords may be attached to functions, indicating
    features that do not make a function unsafe to call, but that may need to be
    taken into account in certain classes of programs:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="locale"><a class="permalink" href="#locale"><i>locale</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Functions annotated with <i>locale</i> as an MT-Safety issue read from the
      locale object without any form of synchronization. Functions annotated
      with <i>locale</i> called concurrently with locale changes may behave in
      ways that do not correspond to any of the locales active during their
      execution, but an unpredictable mix thereof.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>We do not mark these functions as MT-Unsafe, however, because functions
      that modify the locale object are marked with <i>const:locale</i> and
      regarded as unsafe. Being unsafe, the latter are not to be called when
      multiple threads are running or asynchronous signals are enabled, and so
      the locale can be considered effectively constant in these contexts, which
      makes the former safe.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="env"><a class="permalink" href="#env"><i>env</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Functions marked with <i>env</i> as an MT-Safety issue access the
      environment with <b>getenv</b>(3) or similar, without any guards to ensure
      safety in the presence of concurrent modifications.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>We do not mark these functions as MT-Unsafe, however, because functions
      that modify the environment are all marked with <i>const:env</i> and
      regarded as unsafe. Being unsafe, the latter are not to be called when
      multiple threads are running or asynchronous signals are enabled, and so
      the environment can be considered effectively constant in these contexts,
      which makes the former safe.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="hostid"><a class="permalink" href="#hostid"><i>hostid</i></a></dt>
  <dd>The function marked with <i>hostid</i> as an MT-Safety issue reads from
      the system-wide data structures that hold the "host ID" of the
      machine. These data structures cannot generally be modified atomically.
      Since it is expected that the "host ID" will not normally
      change, the function that reads from it (<b>gethostid</b>(3)) is regarded
      as safe, whereas the function that modifies it (<b>sethostid</b>(3)) is
      marked with <i>const:hostid</i>, indicating it may require special care if
      it is to be called. In this specific case, the special care amounts to
      system-wide (not merely intra-process) coordination.</dd>
  <dt id="sigintr"><a class="permalink" href="#sigintr"><i>sigintr</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Functions marked with <i>sigintr</i> as an MT-Safety issue access the GNU
      C Library <i>_sigintr</i> internal data structure without any guards to
      ensure safety in the presence of concurrent modifications.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>We do not mark these functions as MT-Unsafe, however, because functions
      that modify this data structure are all marked with <i>const:sigintr</i>
      and regarded as unsafe. Being unsafe, the latter are not to be called when
      multiple threads are running or asynchronous signals are enabled, and so
      the data structure can be considered effectively constant in these
      contexts, which makes the former safe.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="cwd"><a class="permalink" href="#cwd"><i>cwd</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Functions marked with <i>cwd</i> as an MT-Safety issue may temporarily
      change the current working directory during their execution, which may
      cause relative pathnames to be resolved in unexpected ways in other
      threads or within asynchronous signal or cancelation handlers.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>This is not enough of a reason to mark so-marked functions as MT-Unsafe,
      but when this behavior is optional (e.g., <b>nftw</b>(3) with
      <b>FTW_CHDIR</b>), avoiding the option may be a good alternative to using
      full pathnames or file descriptor-relative (e.g., <b>openat</b>(2)) system
      calls.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>:identifier</i></dt>
  <dd>Annotations may sometimes be followed by identifiers, intended to group
      several functions that, for example, access the data structures in an
      unsafe way, as in <i>race</i> and <i>const</i>, or to provide more
      specific information, such as naming a signal in a function marked with
      <i>sig</i>. It is envisioned that it may be applied to <i>lock</i> and
      <i>corrupt</i> as well in the future.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>In most cases, the identifier will name a set of functions, but it may
      name global objects or function arguments, or identifiable properties or
      logical components associated with them, with a notation such as, for
      example, <i>:buf(arg)</i> to denote a buffer associated with the argument
      <i>arg</i>, or <i>:tcattr(fd)</i> to denote the terminal attributes of a
      file descriptor <i>fd</i>.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The most common use for identifiers is to provide logical groups of
      functions and arguments that need to be protected by the same
      synchronization primitive in order to ensure safe operation in a given
      context.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>/condition</i></dt>
  <dd>Some safety annotations may be conditional, in that they only apply if a
      boolean expression involving arguments, global variables or even the
      underlying kernel evaluates to true. For example, <i>/!ps</i> and
      <i>/one_per_line</i> indicate the preceding marker only applies when
      argument <i>ps</i> is NULL, or global variable <i>one_per_line</i> is
      nonzero.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>When all marks that render a function unsafe are adorned with such
      conditions, and none of the named conditions hold, then the function can
      be regarded as safe.</dd>
