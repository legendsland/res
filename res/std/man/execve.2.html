<p class="Pp"><b>execve</b>() executes the program referred to by
    <i>pathname</i>. This causes the program that is currently being run by the
    calling process to be replaced with a new program, with newly initialized
    stack, heap, and (initialized and uninitialized) data segments.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>pathname</i> must be either a binary executable, or a script
    starting with a line of the form:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre><b>#!</b><i>interpreter </i>[optional-arg]
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">For details of the latter case, see "Interpreter
    scripts" below.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>argv</i> is an array of pointers to strings passed to the new
    program as its command-line arguments. By convention, the first of these
    strings (i.e., <i>argv[0]</i>) should contain the filename associated with
    the file being executed. The <i>argv</i> array must be terminated by a NULL
    pointer. (Thus, in the new program, <i>argv[argc]</i> will be NULL.)</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>envp</i> is an array of pointers to strings, conventionally of
    the form <b>key=value</b>, which are passed as the environment of the new
    program. The <i>envp</i> array must be terminated by a NULL pointer.</p>
<p class="Pp">This manual page describes the Linux system call in detail; for an
    overview of the nomenclature and the many, often preferable, standardised
    variants of this function provided by libc, including ones that search the
    <b>PATH</b> environment variable, see <b>exec</b>(3).</p>
<p class="Pp">The argument vector and environment can be accessed by the new
    program's main function, when it is defined as:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>int main(int argc, char *argv[], char *envp[])
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">Note, however, that the use of a third argument to the main
    function is not specified in POSIX.1; according to POSIX.1, the environment
    should be accessed via the external variable <b>environ</b>(7).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>execve</b>() does not return on success, and the text,
    initialized data, uninitialized data (bss), and stack of the calling process
    are overwritten according to the contents of the newly loaded program.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the current program is being ptraced, a <b>SIGTRAP</b> signal
    is sent to it after a successful <b>execve</b>().</p>
<p class="Pp">If the set-user-ID bit is set on the program file referred to by
    <i>pathname</i>, then the effective user ID of the calling process is
    changed to that of the owner of the program file. Similarly, if the
    set-group-ID bit is set on the program file, then the effective group ID of
    the calling process is set to the group of the program file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The aforementioned transformations of the effective IDs are
    <i>not</i> performed (i.e., the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits are
    ignored) if any of the following is true:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>the <i>no_new_privs</i> attribute is set for the calling thread (see
      <b>prctl</b>(2));</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>the underlying filesystem is mounted <i>nosuid</i> (the <b>MS_NOSUID</b>
      flag for <b>mount</b>(2)); or</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>the calling process is being ptraced.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The capabilities of the program file (see <b>capabilities</b>(7))
    are also ignored if any of the above are true.</p>
<p class="Pp">The effective user ID of the process is copied to the saved
    set-user-ID; similarly, the effective group ID is copied to the saved
    set-group-ID. This copying takes place after any effective ID changes that
    occur because of the set-user-ID and set-group-ID mode bits.</p>
<p class="Pp">The process's real UID and real GID, as well as its supplementary
    group IDs, are unchanged by a call to <b>execve</b>().</p>
<p class="Pp">If the executable is an a.out dynamically linked binary executable
    containing shared-library stubs, the Linux dynamic linker <b>ld.so</b>(8) is
    called at the start of execution to bring needed shared objects into memory
    and link the executable with them.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the executable is a dynamically linked ELF executable, the
    interpreter named in the PT_INTERP segment is used to load the needed shared
    objects. This interpreter is typically <i>/lib/ld-linux.so.2</i> for
    binaries linked with glibc (see <b>ld-linux.so</b>(8)).</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Effect_on_process_attributes"><a class="permalink" href="#Effect_on_process_attributes">Effect
  on process attributes</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">All process attributes are preserved during an <b>execve</b>(),
    except the following:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>The dispositions of any signals that are being caught are reset to the

</dl>
<p class="Pp">The process attributes in the preceding list are all specified in

    preserved during an <b>execve</b>():</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>The process's "dumpable" attribute is set to the value 1, unless
      a set-user-ID program, a set-group-ID program, or a program with
      capabilities is being executed, in which case the dumpable flag may
      instead be reset to the value in <i>/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable</i>, in the
      circumstances described under <b>PR_SET_DUMPABLE</b> in <b>prctl</b>(2).
      Note that changes to the "dumpable" attribute may cause
      ownership of files in the process's <i>/proc/</i>pid directory to change
      to <i>root:root</i>, as described in <b>proc</b>(5).</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>The <b>prctl</b>(2) <b>PR_SET_KEEPCAPS</b> flag is cleared.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>(Since Linux 2.4.36 / 2.6.23) If a set-user-ID or set-group-ID program is
      being executed, then the parent death signal set by <b>prctl</b>(2)
      <b>PR_SET_PDEATHSIG</b> flag is cleared.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>The process name, as set by <b>prctl</b>(2) <b>PR_SET_NAME</b> (and

<p class="Pp">Note the following further points:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>All threads other than the calling thread are destroyed during an

  <dd>The equivalent of <i>setlocale(LC_ALL, "C")</i> is executed at
      program start-up.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>POSIX.1 specifies that the dispositions of any signals that are ignored or
      set to the default are left unchanged. POSIX.1 specifies one exception: if
      <b>SIGCHLD</b> is being ignored, then an implementation may leave the
      disposition unchanged or reset it to the default; Linux does the
    former.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>Any outstanding asynchronous I/O operations are canceled
      (<b>aio_read</b>(3), <b>aio_write</b>(3)).</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>For the handling of capabilities during <b>execve</b>(), see
      <b>capabilities</b>(7).</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>By default, file descriptors remain open across an <b>execve</b>(). File
      descriptors that are marked close-on-exec are closed; see the description
      of <b>FD_CLOEXEC</b> in <b>fcntl</b>(2). (If a file descriptor is closed,
      this will cause the release of all record locks obtained on the underlying
      file by this process. See <b>fcntl</b>(2) for details.) POSIX.1 says that
      if file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 would otherwise be closed after a
      successful <b>execve</b>(), and the process would gain privilege because
      the set-user-ID or set-group-ID mode bit was set on the executed file,
      then the system may open an unspecified file for each of these file
      descriptors. As a general principle, no portable program, whether
      privileged or not, can assume that these three file descriptors will
      remain closed across an <b>execve</b>().</dd>

<h2 class="Ss">Interpreter scripts</h2>
<p class="Pp">An interpreter script is a text file that has execute permission
    enabled and whose first line is of the form:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre><b>#!</b><i>interpreter </i>[optional-arg]
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">The <i>interpreter</i> must be a valid pathname for an executable
    file.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>pathname</i> argument of <b>execve</b>() specifies an
    interpreter script, then <i>interpreter</i> will be invoked with the
    following arguments:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre><i>interpreter</i> [optional-arg] <i>pathname</i> arg...
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">where <i>pathname</i> is the pathname of the file specified as the
    first argument of <b>execve</b>(), and <i>arg...</i> is the series of words
    pointed to by the <i>argv</i> argument of <b>execve</b>(), starting at
    <i>argv[1]</i>. Note that there is no way to get the <i>argv[0]</i> that was
    passed to the <b>execve</b>() call.</p>
<p class="Pp">For portable use, <i>optional-arg</i> should either be absent, or
    be specified as a single word (i.e., it should not contain white space); see
    NOTES below.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 2.6.28, the kernel permits the interpreter of a script
    to itself be a script. This permission is recursive, up to a limit of four
    recursions, so that the interpreter may be a script which is interpreted by
    a script, and so on.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Limits_on_size_of_arguments_and_environment"><a class="permalink" href="#Limits_on_size_of_arguments_and_environment">Limits
  on size of arguments and environment</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Most UNIX implementations impose some limit on the total size of
    the command-line argument (<i>argv</i>) and environment (<i>envp</i>)
    strings that may be passed to a new program. POSIX.1 allows an
    implementation to advertise this limit using the <b>ARG_MAX</b> constant
    (either defined in <i>&lt;limits.h&gt;</i> or available at run time using
    the call <i>sysconf(_SC_ARG_MAX)</i>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Before Linux 2.6.23, the memory used to store the environment and
    argument strings was limited to 32 pages (defined by the kernel constant
    <b>MAX_ARG_PAGES</b>). On architectures with a 4-kB page size, this yields a
    maximum size of 128&nbsp;kB.</p>
<p class="Pp">On Linux 2.6.23 and later, most architectures support a size limit
    derived from the soft <b>RLIMIT_STACK</b> resource limit (see
    <b>getrlimit</b>(2)) that is in force at the time of the <b>execve</b>()
    call. (Architectures with no memory management unit are excepted: they
    maintain the limit that was in effect before Linux 2.6.23.) This change
    allows programs to have a much larger argument and/or environment list. For
    these architectures, the total size is limited to 1/4 of the allowed stack
    size. (Imposing the 1/4-limit ensures that the new program always has some
    stack space.) Additionally, the total size is limited to 3/4 of the value of
    the kernel constant <b>_STK_LIM</b> (8 MiB). Since Linux 2.6.25, the kernel
    also places a floor of 32 pages on this size limit, so that, even when
    <b>RLIMIT_STACK</b> is set very low, applications are guaranteed to have at
    least as much argument and environment space as was provided by Linux 2.6.22
    and earlier. (This guarantee was not provided in Linux 2.6.23 and 2.6.24.)
    Additionally, the limit per string is 32 pages (the kernel constant
    <b>MAX_ARG_STRLEN</b>), and the maximum number of strings is 0x7FFFFFFF.</p>

<p class="Pp">One sometimes sees <b>execve</b>() (and the related functions
    described in <b>exec</b>(3)) described as "executing a <i>new</i>
    process" (or similar). This is a highly misleading description: there
    is no new process; many attributes of the calling process remain unchanged
    (in particular, its PID). All that <b>execve</b>() does is arrange for an
    existing process (the calling process) to execute a new program.</p>
<p class="Pp">Set-user-ID and set-group-ID processes can not be
    <b>ptrace</b>(2)d.</p>
<p class="Pp">The result of mounting a filesystem <i>nosuid</i> varies across
    Linux kernel versions: some will refuse execution of set-user-ID and
    set-group-ID executables when this would give the user powers they did not
    have already (and return <b>EPERM</b>), some will just ignore the
    set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits and <b>exec</b>() successfully.</p>
<p class="Pp">On Linux, <i>argv</i> and <i>envp</i> can be specified as NULL. In
    both cases, this has the same effect as specifying the argument as a pointer
    to a list containing a single null pointer. <b>Do not take advantage of this
    nonstandard and nonportable misfeature!</b> On many other UNIX systems,
    specifying <i>argv</i> as NULL will result in an error (<b>EFAULT</b>).
    <i>Some</i> other UNIX systems treat the <i>envp==NULL</i> case the same as
    Linux.</p>
<p class="Pp">POSIX.1 says that values returned by <b>sysconf</b>(3) should be
    invariant over the lifetime of a process. However, since Linux 2.6.23, if
    the <b>RLIMIT_STACK</b> resource limit changes, then the value reported by
    <b>_SC_ARG_MAX</b> will also change, to reflect the fact that the limit on
    space for holding command-line arguments and environment variables has
    changed.</p>
<p class="Pp">In most cases where <b>execve</b>() fails, control returns to the
    original executable image, and the caller of <b>execve</b>() can then handle
    the error. However, in (rare) cases (typically caused by resource
    exhaustion), failure may occur past the point of no return: the original
    executable image has been torn down, but the new image could not be
    completely built. In such cases, the kernel kills the process with a
    <b>SIGSEGV</b> (<b>SIGKILL</b> until Linux 3.17) signal.</p>

<p class="Pp">The kernel imposes a maximum length on the text that follows the
    "#!" characters at the start of a script; characters beyond the
    limit are ignored. Before Linux 5.1, the limit is 127 characters. Since
    Linux 5.1, the limit is 255 characters.</p>
<p class="Pp">The semantics of the <i>optional-arg</i> argument of an
    interpreter script vary across implementations. On Linux, the entire string
    following the <i>interpreter</i> name is passed as a single argument to the
    interpreter, and this string can include white space. However, behavior
    differs on some other systems. Some systems use the first white space to
    terminate <i>optional-arg</i>. On some systems, an interpreter script can
    have multiple arguments, and white spaces in <i>optional-arg</i> are used to
    delimit the arguments.</p>
<p class="Pp">Linux (like most other modern UNIX systems) ignores the
    set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits on scripts.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="execve()_and_EAGAIN"><a class="permalink" href="#execve()_and_EAGAIN">execve()
  and EAGAIN</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A more detailed explanation of the <b>EAGAIN</b> error that can
    occur (since Linux 3.1) when calling <b>execve</b>() is as follows.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>EAGAIN</b> error can occur when a <i>preceding</i> call to
    <b>setuid</b>(2), <b>setreuid</b>(2), or <b>setresuid</b>(2) caused the real
    user ID of the process to change, and that change caused the process to
    exceed its <b>RLIMIT_NPROC</b> resource limit (i.e., the number of processes
    belonging to the new real UID exceeds the resource limit). From Linux 2.6.0
    to Linux 3.0, this caused the <b>set*uid</b>() call to fail. (Before Linux
    2.6, the resource limit was not imposed on processes that changed their user
    IDs.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 3.1, the scenario just described no longer causes the
    <b>set*uid</b>() call to fail, because it too often led to security holes
    where buggy applications didn't check the return status and assumed
    that—if the caller had root privileges—the call would always
    succeed. Instead, the <b>set*uid</b>() calls now successfully change the
    real UID, but the kernel sets an internal flag, named
    <b>PF_NPROC_EXCEEDED</b>, to note that the <b>RLIMIT_NPROC</b> resource
    limit has been exceeded. If the <b>PF_NPROC_EXCEEDED</b> flag is set and the
    resource limit is still exceeded at the time of a subsequent <b>execve</b>()
    call, that call fails with the error <b>EAGAIN</b>. This kernel logic
    ensures that the <b>RLIMIT_NPROC</b> resource limit is still enforced for
    the common privileged daemon workflow—namely, <b>fork</b>(2) +
    <b>set*uid</b>() + <b>execve</b>().</p>
<p class="Pp">If the resource limit was not still exceeded at the time of the
    <b>execve</b>() call (because other processes belonging to this real UID
    terminated between the <b>set*uid</b>() call and the <b>execve</b>() call),
    then the <b>execve</b>() call succeeds and the kernel clears the
    <b>PF_NPROC_EXCEEDED</b> process flag. The flag is also cleared if a
    subsequent call to <b>fork</b>(2) by this process succeeds.</p>

<p class="Pp">With UNIX&nbsp;V6, the argument list of an <b>exec</b>() call
    was ended by 0, while the argument list of <i>main</i> was ended by -1.
    Thus, this argument list was not directly usable in a further <b>exec</b>()
    call. Since UNIX&nbsp;V7, both are NULL.</p>

<p class="Pp">The following program is designed to be execed by the second
    program below. It just echoes its command-line arguments, one per line.</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>/* myecho.c */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
<br>
    for (size_t j = 0; j &lt; argc; j++)
<br>
        printf("argv[%zu]: %s\n", j, argv[j]);
<br>
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">This program can be used to exec the program named in its
    command-line argument:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>/* execve.c */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
<br>
    static char *newargv[] = { NULL, "hello", "world", NULL };
<br>
    static char *newenviron[] = { NULL };
<br>
    if (argc != 2) {
<br>
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s &lt;file-to-exec&gt;\n", argv[0]);
<br>
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
<br>
    }
<br>
    newargv[0] = argv[1];
<br>
    execve(argv[1], newargv, newenviron);
<br>
    perror("execve");   /* execve() returns only on error */
<br>
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">We can use the second program to exec the first as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>$<b> cc myecho.c -o myecho</b>
$<b> cc execve.c -o execve</b>
$<b> ./execve ./myecho</b>
argv[0]: ./myecho
argv[1]: hello
argv[2]: world
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">We can also use these programs to demonstrate the use of a script
    interpreter. To do this we create a script whose "interpreter" is
    our <i>myecho</i> program:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>$<b> cat &gt; script</b>
<b>#!./myecho script-arg</b>
<b>^D</b>
$<b> chmod +x script</b>
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">We can then use our program to exec the script:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>$<b> ./execve ./script</b>
argv[0]: ./myecho
argv[1]: script-arg
argv[2]: ./script
argv[3]: hello
argv[4]: world
</pre>
