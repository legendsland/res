<p class="Pp">The <i>pthread_create</i>() function shall create a new thread,
    with attributes specified by <i>attr</i>, within a process. If <i>attr</i>
    is NULL, the default attributes shall be used. If the attributes specified
    by <i>attr</i> are modified later, the thread's attributes shall not be
    affected. Upon successful completion, <i>pthread_create</i>() shall store
    the ID of the created thread in the location referenced by
  <i>thread</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The thread is created executing <i>start_routine</i> with
    <i>arg</i> as its sole argument. If the <i>start_routine</i> returns, the
    effect shall be as if there was an implicit call to <i>pthread_exit</i>()
    using the return value of <i>start_routine</i> as the exit status. Note that
    the thread in which <i>main</i>() was originally invoked differs from this.
    When it returns from <i>main</i>(), the effect shall be as if there was an
    implicit call to <i>exit</i>() using the return value of <i>main</i>() as
    the exit status.</p>
<p class="Pp">The signal state of the new thread shall be initialized as
    follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>The signal mask shall be inherited from the creating thread.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>The set of signals pending for the new thread shall be empty.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The thread-local current locale and the alternate stack shall not
    be inherited.</p>
<p class="Pp">The floating-point environment shall be inherited from the
    creating thread.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>pthread_create</i>() fails, no new thread is created and the
    contents of the location referenced by <i>thread</i> are undefined.</p>
<p class="Pp">If _POSIX_THREAD_CPUTIME is defined, the new thread shall have a
    CPU-time clock accessible, and the initial value of this clock shall be set
    to zero.</p>
<p class="Pp">The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the
    <i>attr</i> argument to <i>pthread_create</i>() does not refer to an
    initialized thread attributes object.</p>

<p class="Pp">There is no requirement on the implementation that the ID of the
    created thread be available before the newly created thread starts
    executing. The calling thread can obtain the ID of the created thread
    through the <i>thread</i> argument of the <i>pthread_create</i>() function,
    and the newly created thread can obtain its ID by a call to
    <i>pthread_self</i>().</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="permalink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A suggested alternative to <i>pthread_create</i>() would be to
    define two separate operations: create and start. Some applications would
    find such behavior more natural. Ada, in particular, separates the
    ``creation'' of a task from its ``activation''.</p>
<p class="Pp">Splitting the operation was rejected by the standard developers
    for many reasons:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>The number of calls required to start a thread would increase from one to
      two and thus place an additional burden on applications that do not
      require the additional synchronization. The second call, however, could be
      avoided by the additional complication of a start-up state attribute.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>An extra state would be introduced: ``created but not started''. This
      would require the standard to specify the behavior of the thread
      operations when the target has not yet started executing.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>For those applications that require such behavior, it is possible to
      simulate the two separate steps with the facilities that are currently
      provided. The <i>start_routine</i>() can synchronize by waiting on a
      condition variable that is signaled by the start operation.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">An Ada implementor can choose to create the thread at either of
    two points in the Ada program: when the task object is created, or when the
    task is activated (generally at a ``begin''). If the first approach is
    adopted, the <i>start_routine</i>() needs to wait on a condition variable to
    receive the order to begin ``activation''. The second approach requires no
    such condition variable or extra synchronization. In either approach, a
    separate Ada task control block would need to be created when the task
    object is created to hold rendezvous queues, and so on.</p>
<p class="Pp">An extension of the preceding model would be to allow the state of
    the thread to be modified between the create and start. This would allow the
    thread attributes object to be eliminated. This has been rejected
  because:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>All state in the thread attributes object has to be able to be set for the
      thread. This would require the definition of functions to modify thread
      attributes. There would be no reduction in the number of function calls
      required to set up the thread. In fact, for an application that creates
      all threads using identical attributes, the number of function calls
      required to set up the threads would be dramatically increased. Use of a
      thread attributes object permits the application to make one set of
      attribute setting function calls. Otherwise, the set of attribute setting
      function calls needs to be made for each thread creation.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>Depending on the implementation architecture, functions to set thread
      state would require kernel calls, or for other implementation reasons
      would not be able to be implemented as macros, thereby increasing the cost
      of thread creation.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>The ability for applications to segregate threads by class would be
    lost.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Another suggested alternative uses a model similar to that for
    process creation, such as ``thread fork''. The fork semantics would provide
    more flexibility and the ``create'' function can be implemented simply by
    doing a thread fork followed immediately by a call to the desired ``start
    routine'' for the thread. This alternative has these problems:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>For many implementations, the entire stack of the calling thread would
      need to be duplicated, since in many architectures there is no way to
      determine the size of the calling frame.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>Efficiency is reduced since at least some part of the stack has to be
      copied, even though in most cases the thread never needs the copied
      context, since it merely calls the desired start routine.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
    <i>attr</i> argument to <i>pthread_create</i>() does not refer to an
    initialized thread attributes object, it is recommended that the function
    should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL]</b> error.</p>
