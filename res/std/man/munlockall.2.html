<p class="Pp"><b>mlockall</b>() locks all pages mapped into the address space of
    the calling process. This includes the pages of the code, data, and stack
    segment, as well as shared libraries, user space kernel data, shared memory,
    and memory-mapped files. All mapped pages are guaranteed to be resident in
    RAM when the call returns successfully; the pages are guaranteed to stay in
    RAM until later unlocked.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>flags</i> argument is constructed as the bitwise OR of one

<p class="Pp">If <b>MCL_FUTURE</b> has been specified, then a later system call

<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Memory locking has two main applications: real-time algorithms and
    high-security data processing. Real-time applications require deterministic
    timing, and, like scheduling, paging is one major cause of unexpected
    program execution delays. Real-time applications will usually also switch to
    a real-time scheduler with <b>sched_setscheduler</b>(2). Cryptographic
    security software often handles critical bytes like passwords or secret keys
    as data structures. As a result of paging, these secrets could be
    transferred onto a persistent swap store medium, where they might be
    accessible to the enemy long after the security software has erased the
    secrets in RAM and terminated. (But be aware that the suspend mode on
    laptops and some desktop computers will save a copy of the system's RAM to
    disk, regardless of memory locks.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Real-time processes that are using <b>mlockall</b>() to prevent
    delays on page faults should reserve enough locked stack pages before
    entering the time-critical section, so that no page fault can be caused by
    function calls. This can be achieved by calling a function that allocates a
    sufficiently large automatic variable (an array) and writes to the memory
    occupied by this array in order to touch these stack pages. This way, enough
    pages will be mapped for the stack and can be locked into RAM. The dummy
    writes ensure that not even copy-on-write page faults can occur in the
    critical section.</p>
<p class="Pp">Memory locks are not inherited by a child created via
    <b>fork</b>(2) and are automatically removed (unlocked) during an
    <b>execve</b>(2) or when the process terminates. The <b>mlockall</b>()
    <b>MCL_FUTURE</b> and <b>MCL_FUTURE | MCL_ONFAULT</b> settings are not
    inherited by a child created via <b>fork</b>(2) and are cleared during an
    <b>execve</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that <b>fork</b>(2) will prepare the address space for a
    copy-on-write operation. The consequence is that any write access that
    follows will cause a page fault that in turn may cause high latencies for a
    real-time process. Therefore, it is crucial not to invoke <b>fork</b>(2)
    after an <b>mlockall</b>() or <b>mlock</b>() operation—not even from
    a thread which runs at a low priority within a process which also has a
    thread running at elevated priority.</p>
<p class="Pp">The memory lock on an address range is automatically removed if
    the address range is unmapped via <b>munmap</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp">Memory locks do not stack, that is, pages which have been locked
    several times by calls to <b>mlock</b>(), <b>mlock2</b>(), or
    <b>mlockall</b>() will be unlocked by a single call to <b>munlock</b>() for
    the corresponding range or by <b>munlockall</b>(). Pages which are mapped to
    several locations or by several processes stay locked into RAM as long as
    they are locked at least at one location or by at least one process.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a call to <b>mlockall</b>() which uses the <b>MCL_FUTURE</b>
    flag is followed by another call that does not specify this flag, the
    changes made by the <b>MCL_FUTURE</b> call will be lost.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>mlock2</b>() <b>MLOCK_ONFAULT</b> flag and the
    <b>mlockall</b>() <b>MCL_ONFAULT</b> flag allow efficient memory locking for
    applications that deal with large mappings where only a (small) portion of
    pages in the mapping are touched. In such cases, locking all of the pages in
    a mapping would incur a significant penalty for memory locking.</p>

<p class="Pp">Under Linux, <b>mlock</b>(), <b>mlock2</b>(), and <b>munlock</b>()
    automatically round <i>addr</i> down to the nearest page boundary. However,
    the POSIX.1 specification of <b>mlock</b>() and <b>munlock</b>() allows an
    implementation to require that <i>addr</i> is page aligned, so portable
    applications should ensure this.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>VmLck</i> field of the Linux-specific
    <i>/proc/[pid]/status</i> file shows how many kilobytes of memory the
    process with ID <i>PID</i> has locked using <b>mlock</b>(), <b>mlock2</b>(),

<p class="Pp">In Linux 2.6.8 and earlier, a process must be privileged
    (<b>CAP_IPC_LOCK</b>) in order to lock memory and the <b>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK</b>
    soft resource limit defines a limit on how much memory the process may
  lock.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 2.6.9, no limits are placed on the amount of memory
    that a privileged process can lock and the <b>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK</b> soft
    resource limit instead defines a limit on how much memory an unprivileged
    process may lock.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">In Linux 4.8 and earlier, a bug in the kernel's accounting of
    locked memory for unprivileged processes (i.e., without <b>CAP_IPC_LOCK</b>)
    meant that if the region specified by <i>addr</i> and <i>len</i> overlapped
    an existing lock, then the already locked bytes in the overlapping region
    were counted twice when checking against the limit. Such double accounting
    could incorrectly calculate a "total locked memory" value for the
    process that exceeded the <b>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK</b> limit, with the result that
    <b>mlock</b>() and <b>mlock2</b>() would fail on requests that should have
    succeeded. This bug was fixed in Linux 4.9.</p>
<p class="Pp">In Linux 2.4 series of kernels up to and including Linux 2.4.17, a
    bug caused the <b>mlockall</b>() <b>MCL_FUTURE</b> flag to be inherited
    across a <b>fork</b>(2). This was rectified in Linux 2.4.18.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 2.6.9, if a privileged process calls
    <i>mlockall(MCL_FUTURE)</i> and later drops privileges (loses the
    <b>CAP_IPC_LOCK</b> capability by, for example, setting its effective UID to
    a nonzero value), then subsequent memory allocations (e.g., <b>mmap</b>(2),
    <b>brk</b>(2)) will fail if the <b>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK</b> resource limit is
    encountered.</p>
