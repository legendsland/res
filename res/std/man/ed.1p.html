  DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <i>ed</i> utility shall operate on a copy of the file it is
    editing; changes made to the copy shall have no effect on the file until a
    <b>w</b> (write) command is given. The copy of the text is called the
    <i>buffer</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Commands to <i>ed</i> have a simple and regular structure: zero,
    one, or two <i>addresses</i> followed by a single-character <i>command</i>,
    possibly followed by parameters to that command. These addresses specify one
    or more lines in the buffer. Every command that requires addresses has
    default addresses, so that the addresses very often can be omitted. If the
    <b>-p</b> option is specified, the prompt string shall be written to
    standard output before each command is read.</p>
<p class="Pp">In general, only one command can appear on a line. Certain
    commands allow text to be input. This text is placed in the appropriate
    place in the buffer. While <i>ed</i> is accepting text, it is said to be in
    <i>input mode</i>. In this mode, no commands shall be recognized; all input
    is merely collected. Input mode is terminated by entering a line consisting
    of two characters: a &lt;period&gt; (<b>'.'</b>) followed by a
    &lt;newline&gt;. This line is not considered part of the input text.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Regular_Expressions_in_ed"><a class="permalink" href="#Regular_Expressions_in_ed">Regular
  Expressions in ed</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <i>ed</i> utility shall support basic regular expressions, as
    described in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section
    9.3</i>, <i>Basic Regular Expressions</i>. Since regular expressions in
    <i>ed</i> are always matched against single lines (excluding the terminating
    &lt;newline&gt; characters), never against any larger section of text, there
    is no way for a regular expression to match a &lt;newline&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">A null RE shall be equivalent to the last RE encountered.</p>
<p class="Pp">Regular expressions are used in addresses to specify lines, and in
    some commands (for example, the <b>s</b> substitute command) to specify
    portions of a line to be substituted.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Addresses_in_ed"><a class="permalink" href="#Addresses_in_ed">Addresses
  in ed</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Addressing in <i>ed</i> relates to the current line. Generally,
    the current line is the last line affected by a command. The current line
    number is the address of the current line. If the edit buffer is not empty,
    the initial value for the current line shall be the last line in the edit
    buffer; otherwise, zero.</p>
<p class="Pp">Addresses shall be constructed as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> 1.</dt>
  <dd>The &lt;period&gt; character (<b>'.'</b>) shall address the current
    line.</dd>
  <dt> 2.</dt>
  <dd>The &lt;dollar-sign&gt; character (<b>'$'</b>) shall address the last line
      of the edit buffer.</dd>
  <dt> 3.</dt>
  <dd>The positive decimal number <i>n</i> shall address the <i>n</i>th line of
      the edit buffer.</dd>
  <dt> 4.</dt>
  <dd>The &lt;apostrophe&gt;-x character pair (<b>"'x"</b>) shall
      address the line marked with the mark name character <i>x</i>, which shall
      be a lowercase letter from the portable character set. It shall be an
      error if the character has not been set to mark a line or if the line that
      was marked is not currently present in the edit buffer.</dd>
  <dt> 5.</dt>
  <dd>A BRE enclosed by &lt;slash&gt; characters (<b>'/'</b>) shall address the
      first line found by searching forwards from the line following the current
      line toward the end of the edit buffer and stopping at the first line for
      which the line excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the BRE.
      The BRE consisting of a null BRE delimited by a pair of &lt;slash&gt;
      characters shall address the next line for which the line excluding the
      terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the last BRE encountered. In addition,
      the second &lt;slash&gt; can be omitted at the end of a command line.
      Within the BRE, a &lt;backslash&gt;-&lt;slash&gt; pair
      (<b>"\/"</b>) shall represent a literal &lt;slash&gt; instead of
      the BRE delimiter. If necessary, the search shall wrap around to the
      beginning of the buffer and continue up to and including the current line,
      so that the entire buffer is searched.</dd>
  <dt> 6.</dt>
  <dd>A BRE enclosed by &lt;question-mark&gt; characters (<b>'?'</b>) shall
      address the first line found by searching backwards from the line
      preceding the current line toward the beginning of the edit buffer and
      stopping at the first line for which the line excluding the terminating
      &lt;newline&gt; matches the BRE. The BRE consisting of a null BRE
      delimited by a pair of &lt;question-mark&gt; characters
      (<b>"??"</b>) shall address the previous line for which the line
      excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the last BRE
      encountered. In addition, the second &lt;question-mark&gt; can be omitted
      at the end of a command line. Within the BRE, a
      &lt;backslash&gt;-&lt;question-mark&gt; pair (<b>"\?"</b>) shall
      represent a literal &lt;question-mark&gt; instead of the BRE delimiter. If
      necessary, the search shall wrap around to the end of the buffer and
      continue up to and including the current line, so that the entire buffer
      is searched.</dd>
  <dt> 7.</dt>
  <dd>A &lt;plus-sign&gt; (<b>'+'</b>) or &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; character
      (<b>'-'</b>) followed by a decimal number shall address the current line
      plus or minus the number. A &lt;plus-sign&gt; or &lt;hyphen-minus&gt;
      character not followed by a decimal number shall address the current line
      plus or minus 1.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Addresses can be followed by zero or more address offsets,
    optionally &lt;blank&gt;-separated. Address offsets are constructed as
    follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>A &lt;plus-sign&gt; or &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; character followed by a
      decimal number shall add or subtract, respectively, the indicated number
      of lines to or from the address. A &lt;plus-sign&gt; or
      &lt;hyphen-minus&gt; character not followed by a decimal number shall add
      or subtract 1 to or from the address.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>A decimal number shall add the indicated number of lines to the
    address.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">It shall not be an error for an intermediate address value to be
    less than zero or greater than the last line in the edit buffer. It shall be
    an error for the final address value to be less than zero or greater than
    the last line in the edit buffer. It shall be an error if a search for a BRE
    fails to find a matching line.</p>
<p class="Pp">Commands accept zero, one, or two addresses. If more than the
    required number of addresses are provided to a command that requires zero
    addresses, it shall be an error. Otherwise, if more than the required number
    of addresses are provided to a command, the addresses specified first shall
    be evaluated and then discarded until the maximum number of valid addresses
    remain, for the specified command.</p>
<p class="Pp">Addresses shall be separated from each other by a &lt;comma&gt;
    (<b>','</b>) or &lt;semicolon&gt; character (<b>';'</b>). In the case of a
    &lt;semicolon&gt; separator, the current line (<b>'.'</b>) shall be set to
    the first address, and only then will the second address be calculated. This
    feature can be used to determine the starting line for forwards and
    backwards searches; see rules 5. and 6.</p>
<p class="Pp">Addresses can be omitted on either side of the &lt;comma&gt; or
    &lt;semicolon&gt; separator, in which case the resulting address pairs shall
    be as follows:</p>
<table class="tbl" style="border-style: solid;">

<p class="Pp">In the following list of <i>ed</i> commands, the default addresses
    are shown in parentheses. The number of addresses shown in the default shall
    be the number expected by the command. The parentheses are not part of the
    address; they show that the given addresses are the default.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is generally invalid for more than one command to appear on a
    line. However, any command (except <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>q</b>,
    <b>Q</b>, <b>r</b>, <b>w</b>, and <b>!</b>) can be suffixed by the letter
    <b>l</b>, <b>n</b>, or <b>p</b>; in which case, except for the <b>l</b>,
    <b>n</b>, and <b>p</b> commands, the command shall be executed and then the
    new current line shall be written as described below under the <b>l</b>,
    <b>n</b>, and <b>p</b> commands. When an <b>l</b>, <b>n</b>, or <b>p</b>
    suffix is used with an <b>l</b>, <b>n</b>, or <b>p</b> command, the command
    shall write to standard output as described below, but it is unspecified
    whether the suffix writes the current line again in the requested format or
    whether the suffix has no effect. For example, the <b>pl</b> command (base
    <b>p</b> command with an <b>l</b> suffix) shall either write just the
    current line or write it twice—once as specified for <b>p</b> and
    once as specified for <b>l</b>. Also, the <b>g</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>v</b>, and
    <b>V</b> commands shall take a command as a parameter.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each address component can be preceded by zero or more
    &lt;blank&gt; characters. The command letter can be preceded by zero or more
    &lt;blank&gt; characters. If a suffix letter (<b>l</b>, <b>n</b>, or
    <b>p</b>) is given, the application shall ensure that it immediately follows
    the command.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>r</b>, and <b>w</b> commands
    shall take an optional <i>file</i> parameter, separated from the command
    letter by one or more &lt;blank&gt; characters.</p>
<p class="Pp">If changes have been made in the buffer since the last <b>w</b>
    command that wrote the entire buffer, <i>ed</i> shall warn the user if an
    attempt is made to destroy the editor buffer via the <b>e</b> or <b>q</b>
    commands. The <i>ed</i> utility shall write the string:</p>

    &lt;space&gt; or &lt;newline&gt; can be used instead of a &lt;slash&gt; to
    delimit the RE and the replacement. Within the RE, the RE delimiter itself
    can be used as a literal character if it is preceded by a &lt;backslash&gt;.

<p class="Pp">An &lt;ampersand&gt; (<b>'&amp;'</b>) appearing in the

    suppressed by preceding it by &lt;backslash&gt;. As a more general feature,
    the characters <b>'\n'</b>, where <i>n</i> is a digit, shall be replaced by
    the text matched by the corresponding back-reference expression. If the
    corresponding back-reference expression does not match, then the characters
    <b>'\n'</b> shall be replaced by the empty string. When the character
    <b>'%'</b> is the only character in the <i>replacement</i>, the
    <i>replacement</i> used in the most recent substitute command shall be used
    as the <i>replacement</i> in the current substitute command; if there was no
    previous substitute command, the use of <b>'%'</b> in this manner shall be
    an error. The <b>'%'</b> shall lose its special meaning when it is in a
    replacement string of more than one character or is preceded by a
    &lt;backslash&gt;. For each &lt;backslash&gt; encountered in scanning
    <i>replacement</i> from beginning to end, the following character shall lose
    its special meaning (if any). It is unspecified what special meaning is
    given to any character other than &lt;backslash&gt;, <b>'&amp;'</b>,
    <b>'%'</b>, or digits.</p>
<p class="Pp">A line can be split by substituting a &lt;newline&gt; into it. The
    application shall ensure it escapes the &lt;newline&gt; in the
    <i>replacement</i> by preceding it by &lt;backslash&gt;. Such substitution
    cannot be done as part of a <b>g</b> or <b>v</b> <i>command list</i>. The
    current line number shall be set to the address of the last line on which a
    substitution is performed. If no substitution is performed, the current line
    number shall be unchanged. If a line is split, a substitution shall be
    considered to have been performed on each of the new lines for the purpose

<p class="Pp">The initial description of this utility was adapted from the SVID.
    It contains some features not found in Version 7 or BSD-derived systems.
    Some of the differences between the POSIX and BSD <i>ed</i> utilities
    include, but need not be limited to:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd>The BSD <b>-</b> option does not suppress the <b>'!'</b> prompt after a
      <b>!</b> command.</dd>

  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>BSD allows the command/suffix pairs <b>pp</b>, <b>ll</b>, and so on, which
      are unspecified in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>BSD does not support the <b>'!'</b> character part of the <b>e</b>,
      <b>r</b>, or <b>w</b> commands.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>A failed <b>g</b> command in BSD sets the line number to the last line
      searched if there are no matches.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>BSD does not default the <i>command list</i> to the <b>p</b> command.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>BSD does not support the <b>G</b>, <b>h</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>n</b>, or
      <b>V</b> commands.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>On BSD, if there is no inserted text, the insert command changes the
      current line to the referenced line -1; that is, the line before the
      specified line.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>On BSD, the <i>join</i> command with only a single address changes the
      current line to that address.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>BSD does not support the <b>P</b> command; moreover, in BSD it is
      synonymous with the <b>p</b> command.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>BSD does not support the <i>undo</i> of the commands <b>j</b>, <b>m</b>,
      <b>r</b>, <b>s</b>, or <b>t</b>.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>The Version 7 <i>ed</i> command <b>W</b>, and the BSD <i>ed</i> commands
      <b>W</b>, <b>wq</b>, and <b>z</b> are not present in this volume of
      POSIX.1‐2017.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-s</b> option was added to allow the functionality of the
    removed <b>-</b> option in a manner compatible with the Utility Syntax
    Guidelines.</p>
<p class="Pp">In early proposals there was a limit, {ED_FILE_MAX}, that
    described the historical limitations of some <i>ed</i> utilities in their
    handling of large files; some of these have had problems with files larger
    than 100000 bytes. It was this limitation that prompted much of the desire
    to include a <i>split</i> command in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.
    Since this limit was removed, this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires
    that implementations document the file size limits imposed by <i>ed</i> in
    the conformance document. The limit {ED_LINE_MAX} was also removed;
    therefore, the global limit {LINE_MAX} is used for input and output
  lines.</p>
<p class="Pp">The manner in which the <b>l</b> command writes non-printable
    characters was changed to avoid the historical backspace-overstrike method.
    On video display terminals, the overstrike is ambiguous because most
    terminals simply replace overstruck characters, making the <b>l</b> format
    not useful for its intended purpose of unambiguously understanding the
    content of the line. The historical &lt;backslash&gt;-escapes were also
    ambiguous. (The string <b>"a\0011"</b> could represent a line
    containing those six characters or a line containing the three characters
    <b>'a'</b>, a byte with a binary value of 1, and a 1.) In the format
    required here, a &lt;backslash&gt; appearing in the line is written as
    <b>"\\"</b> so that the output is truly unambiguous. The method of
    marking the ends of lines was adopted from the <i>ex</i> editor and is
    required for any line ending in &lt;space&gt; characters; the <b>'$'</b> is
    placed on all lines so that a real <b>'$'</b> at the end of a line cannot be
    misinterpreted.</p>
<p class="Pp">Earlier versions of this standard allowed for implementations with
    bytes other than eight bits, but this has been modified in this version.</p>
<p class="Pp">The description of how a NUL is written was removed. The NUL
    character cannot be in text files, and this volume of POSIX.1‐2017
    should not dictate behavior in the case of undefined, erroneous input.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike some of the other editing utilities, the filenames accepted
    by the <b>E</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>R</b>, and <b>r</b> commands are not
  patterns.</p>
<p class="Pp">Early proposals stated that the <b>-p</b> option worked only when
    standard input was associated with a terminal device. This has been changed
    to conform to historical implementations, thereby allowing applications to
    interpose themselves between a user and the <i>ed</i> utility.</p>
<p class="Pp">The form of the substitute command that uses the <b>n</b> suffix
    was limited in some historical documentation (where this was described
    incorrectly as ``backreferencing''). This limit has been omitted because
    there is no reason why an editor processing lines of {LINE_MAX} length
    should have this restriction. The command <b>s/x/X/2047</b> should be able
    to substitute the 2047th occurrence of <b>'x'</b> on a line.</p>
<p class="Pp">The use of printing commands with printing suffixes (such as
    <b>pn</b>, <b>lp</b>, and so on) was made unspecified because BSD-based
    systems allow this, whereas System V does not.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some BSD-based systems exit immediately upon receipt of
    end-of-file if all of the lines in the file have been deleted. Since this
    volume of POSIX.1‐2017 refers to the <b>q</b> command in this
    instance, such behavior is not allowed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some historical implementations returned exit status zero even if
    command errors had occurred; this is not allowed by this volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some historical implementations contained a bug that allowed a
    single &lt;period&gt; to be entered in input mode as &lt;backslash&gt;
    &lt;period&gt; &lt;newline&gt;. This is not allowed by <i>ed</i> because
    there is no description of escaping any of the characters in input mode;
    &lt;backslash&gt; characters are entered into the buffer exactly as typed.
    The typical method of entering a single &lt;period&gt; has been to precede
    it with another character and then use the substitute command to delete that
    character.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is difficult under some modes of some versions of historical
    operating system terminal drivers to distinguish between an end-of-file
    condition and terminal disconnect. POSIX.1‐2008 does not require
    implementations to distinguish between the two situations, which permits
    historical implementations of the <i>ed</i> utility on historical platforms
    to conform. Implementations are encouraged to distinguish between the two,
    if possible, and take appropriate action on terminal disconnect.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, <i>ed</i> accepted a zero address for the <b>a</b>
    and <b>r</b> commands in order to insert text at the start of the edit
    buffer. When the buffer was empty the command <b>.=</b> returned zero.
    POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical practice.</p>
<p class="Pp">For consistency with the <b>a</b> and <b>r</b> commands and better
    user functionality, the <b>i</b> and <b>c</b> commands must also accept an
    address of 0, in which case 0<i>i</i> is treated as 1<i>i</i> and likewise
    for the <b>c</b> command.</p>
<p class="Pp">All of the following are valid addresses:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>+++</dt>
  <dd>Three lines after the current line.</dd>
  <dt>/<i>pattern</i>/-</dt>
  <dd>One line before the next occurrence of pattern.</dd>
  <dt>-2</dt>
  <dd>Two lines before the current line.</dd>
  <dt>3&nbsp;----&nbsp;2</dt>
  <dd>Line one (note the intermediate negative address).</dd>
  <dt>1&nbsp;2&nbsp;3</dt>
  <dd>Line six.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Any number of addresses can be provided to commands taking
    addresses; for example, <b>"1,2,3,4,5p"</b> prints lines 4 and 5,
    because two is the greatest valid number of addresses accepted by the
    <b>print</b> command. This, in combination with the &lt;semicolon&gt;
    delimiter, permits users to create commands based on ordered patterns in the
    file. For example, the command <b>"3;/foo/;+2p"</b> will display
    the first line after line 3 that contains the pattern <i>foo</i>, plus the
    next two lines. Note that the address <b>"3;"</b> must still be
    evaluated before being discarded, because the search origin for the
    <b>"/foo/"</b> command depends on this.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, <i>ed</i> disallowed address chains, as discussed
    above, consisting solely of &lt;comma&gt; or &lt;semicolon&gt; separators;
    for example, <b>",,,"</b> or <b>";;;"</b> were
    considered an error. For consistency of address specification, this
    restriction is removed. The following table lists some of the address forms
    now possible:</p>
