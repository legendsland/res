<p class="Pp">The <i>pthread_attr_destroy</i>() function shall destroy a thread
    attributes object. An implementation may cause <i>pthread_attr_destroy</i>()
    to set <i>attr</i> to an implementation-defined invalid value. A destroyed
    <i>attr</i> attributes object can be reinitialized using
    <i>pthread_attr_init</i>(); the results of otherwise referencing the object
    after it has been destroyed are undefined.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>pthread_attr_init</i>() function shall initialize a thread
    attributes object <i>attr</i> with the default value for all of the
    individual attributes used by a given implementation.</p>
<p class="Pp">The resulting attributes object (possibly modified by setting
    individual attribute values) when used by <i>pthread_create</i>() defines
    the attributes of the thread created. A single attributes object can be used
    in multiple simultaneous calls to <i>pthread_create</i>(). Results are
    undefined if <i>pthread_attr_init</i>() is called specifying an already
    initialized <i>attr</i> attributes object.</p>

<p class="Pp">Attributes objects are provided for threads, mutexes, and
    condition variables as a mechanism to support probable future
    standardization in these areas without requiring that the function itself be
    changed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Attributes objects provide clean isolation of the configurable
    aspects of threads. For example, ``stack size'' is an important attribute of
    a thread, but it cannot be expressed portably. When porting a threaded
    program, stack sizes often need to be adjusted. The use of attributes
    objects can help by allowing the changes to be isolated in a single place,
    rather than being spread across every instance of thread creation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Attributes objects can be used to set up ``classes' of threads
    with similar attributes; for example, ``threads with large stacks and high
    priority'' or ``threads with minimal stacks''. These classes can be defined
    in a single place and then referenced wherever threads need to be created.
    Changes to ``class'' decisions become straightforward, and detailed analysis
    of each <i>pthread_create</i>() call is not required.</p>
<p class="Pp">The attributes objects are defined as opaque types as an aid to
    extensibility. If these objects had been specified as structures, adding new
    attributes would force recompilation of all multi-threaded programs when the
    attributes objects are extended; this might not be possible if different
    program components were supplied by different vendors.</p>
<p class="Pp">Additionally, opaque attributes objects present opportunities for
    improving performance. Argument validity can be checked once when attributes
    are set, rather than each time a thread is created. Implementations often
    need to cache kernel objects that are expensive to create. Opaque attributes
    objects provide an efficient mechanism to detect when cached objects become
    invalid due to attribute changes.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since assignment is not necessarily defined on a given opaque
    type, implementation-defined default values cannot be defined in a portable
    way. The solution to this problem is to allow attributes objects to be
    initialized dynamically by attributes object initialization functions, so
    that default values can be supplied automatically by the implementation.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following proposal was provided as a suggested alternative to
    the supplied attributes:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> 1.</dt>
  <dd>Maintain the style of passing a parameter formed by the bitwise-inclusive
      OR of flags to the initialization routines (<i>pthread_create</i>(),
      <i>pthread_mutex_init</i>(), <i>pthread_cond_init</i>()). The parameter
      containing the flags should be an opaque type for extensibility. If no
      flags are set in the parameter, then the objects are created with default
      characteristics. An implementation may specify implementation-defined flag
      values and associated behavior.</dd>
  <dt> 2.</dt>
  <dd>If further specialization of mutexes and condition variables is necessary,
      implementations may specify additional procedures that operate on the
      <b>pthread_mutex_t</b> and <b>pthread_cond_t</b> objects (instead of on
      attributes objects).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The difficulties with this solution are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> 1.</dt>
  <dd>A bitmask is not opaque if bits have to be set into bitvector attributes
      objects using explicitly-coded bitwise-inclusive OR operations. If the set
      of options exceeds an <b>int</b>, application programmers need to know the
      location of each bit. If bits are set or read by encapsulation (that is,
      get and set functions), then the bitmask is merely an implementation of
      attributes objects as currently defined and should not be exposed to the
      programmer.</dd>
  <dt> 2.</dt>
  <dd>Many attributes are not Boolean or very small integral values. For
      example, scheduling policy may be placed in 3-bit or 4-bit, but priority
      requires 5-bit or more, thereby taking up at least 8 bits out of a
      possible 16 bits on machines with 16-bit integers. Because of this, the
      bitmask can only reasonably control whether particular attributes are set
      or not, and it cannot serve as the repository of the value itself. The
      value needs to be specified as a function parameter (which is
      non-extensible), or by setting a structure field (which is non-opaque), or
      by get and set functions (making the bitmask a redundant addition to the
      attributes objects).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Stack size is defined as an optional attribute because the very
    notion of a stack is inherently machine-dependent. Some implementations may
    not be able to change the size of the stack, for example, and others may not
    need to because stack pages may be discontiguous and can be allocated and
    released on demand.</p>
<p class="Pp">The attribute mechanism has been designed in large measure for
    extensibility. Future extensions to the attribute mechanism or to any
    attributes object defined in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 has to be
    done with care so as not to affect binary-compatibility.</p>
<p class="Pp">Attributes objects, even if allocated by means of dynamic
    allocation functions such as <i>malloc</i>(), may have their size fixed at
    compile time. This means, for example, a <i>pthread_create</i>() in an
    implementation with extensions to <b>pthread_attr_t</b> cannot look beyond
    the area that the binary application assumes is valid. This suggests that
    implementations should maintain a size field in the attributes object, as
    well as possibly version information, if extensions in different directions
    (possibly by different vendors) are to be accommodated.</p>
<p class="Pp">If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
    <i>attr</i> argument to <i>pthread_attr_destroy</i>() does not refer to an
    initialized thread attributes object, it is recommended that the function
    should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL]</b> error.</p>
<p class="Pp">If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
    <i>attr</i> argument to <i>pthread_attr_init</i>() refers to an already
    initialized thread attributes object, it is recommended that the function
    should fail and report an <b>[EBUSY]</b> error.</p>
