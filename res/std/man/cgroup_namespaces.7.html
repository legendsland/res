</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">For an overview of namespaces, see <b>namespaces</b>(7).</p>
<p class="Pp">Cgroup namespaces virtualize the view of a process's cgroups (see
    <b>cgroups</b>(7)) as seen via <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/cgroup</i> and
    <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/mountinfo</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each cgroup namespace has its own set of cgroup root directories.
    These root directories are the base points for the relative locations
    displayed in the corresponding records in the <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/cgroup</i>
    file. When a process creates a new cgroup namespace using <b>clone</b>(2) or
    <b>unshare</b>(2) with the <b>CLONE_NEWCGROUP</b> flag, its current cgroups
    directories become the cgroup root directories of the new namespace. (This
    applies both for the cgroups version 1 hierarchies and the cgroups version 2
    unified hierarchy.)</p>
<p class="Pp">When reading the cgroup memberships of a "target"
    process from <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/cgroup</i>, the pathname shown in the third
    field of each record will be relative to the reading process's root
    directory for the corresponding cgroup hierarchy. If the cgroup directory of
    the target process lies outside the root directory of the reading process's
    cgroup namespace, then the pathname will show <i>../</i> entries for each
    ancestor level in the cgroup hierarchy.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following shell session demonstrates the effect of creating a
    new cgroup namespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">First, (as superuser) in a shell in the initial cgroup namespace,
    we create a child cgroup in the <i>freezer</i> hierarchy, and place a
    process in that cgroup that we will use as part of the demonstration
  below:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre># <b>mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/freezer/sub2</b>
# <b>sleep 10000 &amp;</b>     # Create a process that lives for a while
[1] 20124
# <b>echo 20124 &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/freezer/sub2/cgroup.procs</b>
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">We then create another child cgroup in the <i>freezer</i>
    hierarchy and put the shell into that cgroup:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre># <b>mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/freezer/sub</b>
# <b>echo $$</b>                      # Show PID of this shell
30655
# <b>echo 30655 &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/freezer/sub/cgroup.procs</b>
# <b>cat /proc/self/cgroup | grep freezer</b>
7:freezer:/sub
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">Next, we use <b>unshare</b>(1) to create a process running a new
    shell in new cgroup and mount namespaces:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre># <b>PS1="sh2# " unshare -Cm bash</b>
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">From the new shell started by <b>unshare</b>(1), we then inspect
    the <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/cgroup</i> files of, respectively, the new shell, a
    process that is in the initial cgroup namespace (<i>init</i>, with PID 1),
    and the process in the sibling cgroup (<i>sub2</i>):</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>sh2# <b>cat /proc/self/cgroup | grep freezer</b>
7:freezer:/
sh2# <b>cat /proc/1/cgroup | grep freezer</b>
7:freezer:/..
sh2# <b>cat /proc/20124/cgroup | grep freezer</b>
7:freezer:/../sub2
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">From the output of the first command, we see that the freezer
    cgroup membership of the new shell (which is in the same cgroup as the
    initial shell) is shown defined relative to the freezer cgroup root
    directory that was established when the new cgroup namespace was created.
    (In absolute terms, the new shell is in the <i>/sub</i> freezer cgroup, and
    the root directory of the freezer cgroup hierarchy in the new cgroup
    namespace is also <i>/sub</i>. Thus, the new shell's cgroup membership is
    displayed as '/'.)</p>
<p class="Pp">However, when we look in <i>/proc/self/mountinfo</i> we see the
    following anomaly:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>sh2# <b>cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep freezer</b>
155 145 0:32 /.. /sys/fs/cgroup/freezer ...
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">The fourth field of this line (<i>/..</i>) should show the
    directory in the cgroup filesystem which forms the root of this mount. Since
    by the definition of cgroup namespaces, the process's current freezer cgroup
    directory became its root freezer cgroup directory, we should see '/' in
    this field. The problem here is that we are seeing a mount entry for the
    cgroup filesystem corresponding to the initial cgroup namespace (whose
    cgroup filesystem is indeed rooted at the parent directory of <i>sub</i>).
    To fix this problem, we must remount the freezer cgroup filesystem from the
    new shell (i.e., perform the mount from a process that is in the new cgroup
    namespace), after which we see the expected results:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>sh2# <b>mount --make-rslave /</b>     # Don't propagate mount events
<br>
                               # to other namespaces
sh2# <b>umount /sys/fs/cgroup/freezer</b>
sh2# <b>mount -t cgroup -o freezer freezer /sys/fs/cgroup/freezer</b>
sh2# <b>cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep freezer</b>
155 145 0:32 / /sys/fs/cgroup/freezer rw,relatime ...
</pre>

<p class="Pp">Use of cgroup namespaces requires a kernel that is configured with
    the <b>CONFIG_CGROUPS</b> option.</p>
<p class="Pp">The virtualization provided by cgroup namespaces serves a number
    of purposes:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>It prevents information leaks whereby cgroup directory paths outside of a
      container would otherwise be visible to processes in the container. Such
      leakages could, for example, reveal information about the container
      framework to containerized applications.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>It eases tasks such as container migration. The virtualization provided by
      cgroup namespaces allows containers to be isolated from knowledge of the
      pathnames of ancestor cgroups. Without such isolation, the full cgroup
      pathnames (displayed in <i>/proc/self/cgroups</i>) would need to be
      replicated on the target system when migrating a container; those
      pathnames would also need to be unique, so that they don't conflict with
      other pathnames on the target system.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>It allows better confinement of containerized processes, because it is
      possible to mount the container's cgroup filesystems such that the
      container processes can't gain access to ancestor cgroup directories.
      Consider, for example, the following scenario:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>We have a cgroup directory, <i>/cg/1</i>, that is owned by user ID
    9000.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>We have a process, <i>X</i>, also owned by user ID 9000, that is
      namespaced under the cgroup <i>/cg/1/2</i> (i.e., <i>X</i> was placed in a
      new cgroup namespace via <b>clone</b>(2) or <b>unshare</b>(2) with the
      <b>CLONE_NEWCGROUP</b> flag).</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>In the absence of cgroup namespacing, because the cgroup directory
      <i>/cg/1</i> is owned (and writable) by UID 9000 and process <i>X</i> is
      also owned by user ID 9000, process <i>X</i> would be able to modify the
      contents of cgroups files (i.e., change cgroup settings) not only in
      <i>/cg/1/2</i> but also in the ancestor cgroup directory <i>/cg/1</i>.
      Namespacing process <i>X</i> under the cgroup directory <i>/cg/1/2</i>, in
      combination with suitable mount operations for the cgroup filesystem (as
      shown above), prevents it modifying files in <i>/cg/1</i>, since it cannot
      even see the contents of that directory (or of further removed cgroup
      ancestor directories). Combined with correct enforcement of hierarchical
      limits, this prevents process <i>X</i> from escaping the limits imposed by
      ancestor cgroups.</dd>
