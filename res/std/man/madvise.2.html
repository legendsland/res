<p class="Pp">The <b>madvise</b>() system call is used to give advice or
    directions to the kernel about the address range beginning at address
    <i>addr</i> and with size <i>length</i>. <b>madvise</b>() only operates on
    whole pages, therefore <i>addr</i> must be page-aligned. The value of
    <i>length</i> is rounded up to a multiple of page size. In most cases, the
    goal of such advice is to improve system or application performance.</p>
<p class="Pp">Initially, the system call supported a set of
    "conventional" <i>advice</i> values, which are also available on
    several other implementations. (Note, though, that <b>madvise</b>() is not
    specified in POSIX.) Subsequently, a number of Linux-specific <i>advice</i>
    values have been added.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Conventional_advice_values"><a class="permalink" href="#Conventional_advice_values">Conventional
  advice values</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <i>advice</i> values listed below allow an application to tell
    the kernel how it expects to use some mapped or shared memory areas, so that
    the kernel can choose appropriate read-ahead and caching techniques. These
    <i>advice</i> values do not influence the semantics of the application
    (except in the case of <b>MADV_DONTNEED</b>), but may influence its
    performance. All of the <i>advice</i> values listed here have analogs in the
    POSIX-specified <b>posix_madvise</b>(3) function, and the values have the
    same meanings, with the exception of <b>MADV_DONTNEED</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The advice is indicated in the <i>advice</i> argument, which is
    one of the following:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd>Expect page references in sequential order. (Hence, pages in the given

  <dt id="MADV_WILLNEED"><a class="permalink" href="#MADV_WILLNEED"><b>MADV_WILLNEED</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Expect access in the near future. (Hence, it might be a good idea to read

  <dt id="MADV_DONTNEED"><a class="permalink" href="#MADV_DONTNEED"><b>MADV_DONTNEED</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Do not expect access in the near future. (For the time being, the
      application is finished with the given range, so the kernel can free
      resources associated with it.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>After a successful <b>MADV_DONTNEED</b> operation, the semantics of memory
      access in the specified region are changed: subsequent accesses of pages
      in the range will succeed, but will result in either repopulating the
      memory contents from the up-to-date contents of the underlying mapped file
      (for shared file mappings, shared anonymous mappings, and shmem-based
      techniques such as System V shared memory segments) or zero-fill-on-demand
      pages for anonymous private mappings.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Note that, when applied to shared mappings, <b>MADV_DONTNEED</b> might not
      lead to immediate freeing of the pages in the range. The kernel is free to
      delay freeing the pages until an appropriate moment. The resident set size
      (RSS) of the calling process will be immediately reduced however.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><b>MADV_DONTNEED</b> cannot be applied to locked pages, or
      <b>VM_PFNMAP</b> pages. (Pages marked with the kernel-internal
      <b>VM_PFNMAP</b> flag are special memory areas that are not managed by the
      virtual memory subsystem. Such pages are typically created by device
      drivers that map the pages into user space.)</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Support for Huge TLB pages was added in Linux v5.18. Addresses within a
      mapping backed by Huge TLB pages must be aligned to the underlying Huge
      TLB page size, and the range length is rounded up to a multiple of the
      underlying Huge TLB page size.</dd>

  <dd>Enable Transparent Huge Pages (THP) for pages in the range specified by

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>This feature is primarily aimed at applications that use large mappings of
      data and access large regions of that memory at a time (e.g.,
      virtualization systems such as QEMU). It can very easily waste memory
      (e.g., a 2&nbsp;MB mapping that only ever accesses 1 byte will result in
      2&nbsp;MB of wired memory instead of one 4&nbsp;KB page). See the
      Linux kernel source file <i>Documentation/admin-guide/mm/transhuge.rst</i>
      for more details.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Most common kernels configurations provide <b>MADV_HUGEPAGE</b>-style
      behavior by default, and thus <b>MADV_HUGEPAGE</b> is normally not
      necessary. It is mostly intended for embedded systems, where
      <b>MADV_HUGEPAGE</b>-style behavior may not be enabled by default in the
      kernel. On such systems, this flag can be used in order to selectively
      enable THP. Whenever <b>MADV_HUGEPAGE</b> is used, it should always be in
      regions of memory with an access pattern that the developer knows in
      advance won't risk to increase the memory footprint of the application
      when transparent hugepages are enabled.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Since Linux 5.4, automatic scan of eligible areas and replacement by huge
      pages works with private anonymous pages (see <b>mmap</b>(2)), shmem
      pages, and file-backed pages. For all memory types, memory may only be
      replaced by huge pages on hugepage-aligned boundaries. For file-mapped
      memory —including tmpfs (see <b>tmpfs</b>(2))— the mapping
      must also be naturally hugepage-aligned within the file. Additionally, for
      file-backed, non-tmpfs memory, the file must not be open for write and the
      mapping must be executable.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The VMA must not be marked <b>VM_NOHUGEPAGE</b>, <b>VM_HUGETLB</b>,
      <b>VM_IO</b>, <b>VM_DONTEXPAND</b>, <b>VM_MIXEDMAP</b>, or
      <b>VM_PFNMAP</b>, nor can it be stack memory or backed by a DAX-enabled
      device (unless the DAX device is hot-plugged as System RAM). The process
      must also not have <b>PR_SET_THP_DISABLE</b> set (see
    <b>prctl</b>(2)).</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The <b>MADV_HUGEPAGE</b>, <b>MADV_NOHUGEPAGE</b>, and <b>MADV_COLLAPSE</b>
      operations are available only if the kernel was configured with
      <b>CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE</b> and file/shmem memory is only supported

  <dt></dt>
  <dd>All non-resident pages covered by the range will first be

      happen in-place. Unmapped pages will have their data directly initialized
