<p class="Pp"><b>read</b>() attempts to read up to <i>count</i> bytes from file
    descriptor <i>fd</i> into the buffer starting at <i>buf</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">On files that support seeking, the read operation commences at the
    file offset, and the file offset is incremented by the number of bytes read.
    If the file offset is at or past the end of file, no bytes are read, and
    <b>read</b>() returns zero.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>count</i> is zero, <b>read</b>() <i>may</i> detect the
    errors described below. In the absence of any errors, or if <b>read</b>()
    does not check for errors, a <b>read</b>() with a <i>count</i> of 0 returns
    zero and has no other effects.</p>
<p class="Pp">According to POSIX.1, if <i>count</i> is greater than
    <b>SSIZE_MAX</b>, the result is implementation-defined; see NOTES for the
    upper limit on Linux.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="RETURN_VALUE"><a class="permalink" href="#RETURN_VALUE">RETURN
  VALUE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">On success, the number of bytes read is returned (zero indicates
    end of file), and the file position is advanced by this number. It is not an
    error if this number is smaller than the number of bytes requested; this may
    happen for example because fewer bytes are actually available right now
    (maybe because we were close to end-of-file, or because we are reading from
    a pipe, or from a terminal), or because <b>read</b>() was interrupted by a
    signal. See also NOTES.</p>
<p class="Pp">On error, -1 is returned, and <i>errno</i> is set to indicate the
    error. In this case, it is left unspecified whether the file position (if
    any) changes.</p>

  <dd>The file descriptor <i>fd</i> refers to a file other than a socket and has

      allows either error to be returned for this case, and does not require
      these constants to have the same value, so a portable application should
      check for both possibilities.</dd>

      either it is ignoring or blocking <b>SIGTTIN</b> or its process group is
      orphaned. It may also occur when there is a low-level I/O error while
      reading from a disk or tape. A further possible cause of <b>EIO</b> on
      networked filesystems is when an advisory lock had been taken out on the
      file descriptor and this lock has been lost. See the <i>Lost locks</i>

<p class="Pp">The types <i>size_t</i> and <i>ssize_t</i> are, respectively,
    unsigned and signed integer data types specified by POSIX.1.</p>
<p class="Pp">On Linux, <b>read</b>() (and similar system calls) will transfer
    at most 0x7ffff000 (2,147,479,552) bytes, returning the number of bytes
    actually transferred. (This is true on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.)</p>
<p class="Pp">On NFS filesystems, reading small amounts of data will update the
    timestamp only the first time, subsequent calls may not do so. This is
    caused by client side attribute caching, because most if not all NFS clients
    leave <i>st_atime</i> (last file access time) updates to the server, and
    client side reads satisfied from the client's cache will not cause
    <i>st_atime</i> updates on the server as there are no server-side reads.
    UNIX semantics can be obtained by disabling client-side attribute caching,
    but in most situations this will substantially increase server load and
    decrease performance.</p>

<div class="Bd-indent">All of the following functions shall be atomic with

<p class="Pp">Among the APIs subsequently listed are <b>read</b>() and
    <b>readv</b>(2). And among the effects that should be atomic across threads
    (and processes) are updates of the file offset. However, before Linux 3.14,
    this was not the case: if two processes that share an open file description
    (see <b>open</b>(2)) perform a <b>read</b>() (or <b>readv</b>(2)) at the
    same time, then the I/O operations were not atomic with respect updating the
    file offset, with the result that the reads in the two processes might
    (incorrectly) overlap in the blocks of data that they obtained. This problem
    was fixed in Linux 3.14.</p>
