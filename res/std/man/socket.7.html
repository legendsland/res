<p class="Pp">This manual page describes the Linux networking socket layer user
    interface. The BSD compatible sockets are the uniform interface between the
    user process and the network protocol stacks in the kernel. The protocol
    modules are grouped into <i>protocol families</i> such as <b>AF_INET</b>,
    <b>AF_IPX</b>, and <b>AF_PACKET</b>, and <i>socket types</i> such as
    <b>SOCK_STREAM</b> or <b>SOCK_DGRAM</b>. See <b>socket</b>(2) for more
    information on families and types.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Socket-layer_functions"><a class="permalink" href="#Socket-layer_functions">Socket-layer
  functions</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">These functions are used by the user process to send or receive
    packets and to do other socket operations. For more information, see their
    respective manual pages.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>socket</b>(2) creates a socket, <b>connect</b>(2) connects a
    socket to a remote socket address, the <b>bind</b>(2) function binds a
    socket to a local socket address, <b>listen</b>(2) tells the socket that new
    connections shall be accepted, and <b>accept</b>(2) is used to get a new
    socket with a new incoming connection. <b>socketpair</b>(2) returns two
    connected anonymous sockets (implemented only for a few local families like
    <b>AF_UNIX</b>)</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>send</b>(2), <b>sendto</b>(2), and <b>sendmsg</b>(2) send data
    over a socket, and <b>recv</b>(2), <b>recvfrom</b>(2), <b>recvmsg</b>(2)
    receive data from a socket. <b>poll</b>(2) and <b>select</b>(2) wait for
    arriving data or a readiness to send data. In addition, the standard I/O
    operations like <b>write</b>(2), <b>writev</b>(2), <b>sendfile</b>(2),
    <b>read</b>(2), and <b>readv</b>(2) can be used to read and write data.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>getsockname</b>(2) returns the local socket address and
    <b>getpeername</b>(2) returns the remote socket address.
    <b>getsockopt</b>(2) and <b>setsockopt</b>(2) are used to set or get socket
    layer or protocol options. <b>ioctl</b>(2) can be used to set or read some
    other options.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>close</b>(2) is used to close a socket. <b>shutdown</b>(2)
    closes parts of a full-duplex socket connection.</p>
<p class="Pp">Seeking, or calling <b>pread</b>(2) or <b>pwrite</b>(2) with a
    nonzero position is not supported on sockets.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is possible to do nonblocking I/O on sockets by setting the
    <b>O_NONBLOCK</b> flag on a socket file descriptor using <b>fcntl</b>(2).
    Then all operations that would block will (usually) return with
    <b>EAGAIN</b> (operation should be retried later); <b>connect</b>(2) will
    return <b>EINPROGRESS</b> error. The user can then wait for various events
    via <b>poll</b>(2) or <b>select</b>(2).</p>

<p class="Pp">An alternative to <b>poll</b>(2) and <b>select</b>(2) is to let
    the kernel inform the application about events via a <b>SIGIO</b> signal.
    For that the <b>O_ASYNC</b> flag must be set on a socket file descriptor via
    <b>fcntl</b>(2) and a valid signal handler for <b>SIGIO</b> must be
    installed via <b>sigaction</b>(2). See the <i>Signals</i> discussion
  below.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Socket_address_structures"><a class="permalink" href="#Socket_address_structures">Socket
  address structures</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Each socket domain has its own format for socket addresses, with a
    domain-specific address structure. Each of these structures begins with an
    integer "family" field (typed as <i>sa_family_t</i>) that
    indicates the type of the address structure. This allows the various system
    calls (e.g., <b>connect</b>(2), <b>bind</b>(2), <b>accept</b>(2),
    <b>getsockname</b>(2), <b>getpeername</b>(2)), which are generic to all
    socket domains, to determine the domain of a particular socket address.</p>
<p class="Pp">To allow any type of socket address to be passed to interfaces in
    the sockets API, the type <i>struct sockaddr</i> is defined. The purpose of
    this type is purely to allow casting of domain-specific socket address types
    to a "generic" type, so as to avoid compiler warnings about type
    mismatches in calls to the sockets API.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition, the sockets API provides the data type <i>struct
    sockaddr_storage</i>. This type is suitable to accommodate all supported
    domain-specific socket address structures; it is large enough and is aligned
    properly. (In particular, it is large enough to hold IPv6 socket addresses.)
    The structure includes the following field, which can be used to identify
    the type of socket address actually stored in the structure:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre><br>
    sa_family_t ss_family;
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">The <i>sockaddr_storage</i> structure is useful in programs that
    must handle socket addresses in a generic way (e.g., programs that must deal
    with both IPv4 and IPv6 socket addresses).</p>
