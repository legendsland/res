<p class="Pp">The set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits are explicitly cleared when
    files are created. This is to prevent users from creating programs that are
    set-user-ID or set-group-ID to them when copying files or to make
    set-user-ID or set-group-ID files accessible to new groups of users. For
    example, if a file is set-user-ID and the copy has a different group ID than
    the source, a new group of users has execute permission to a set-user-ID
    program than did previously. In particular, this is a problem for superusers
    copying users' trees.</p>

<p class="Pp">The <b>-i</b> option exists on BSD systems, giving applications
    and users a way to avoid accidentally removing files when copying. Although
    the 4.3 BSD version does not prompt if the standard input is not a terminal,
    the standard developers decided that use of <b>-i</b> is a request for
    interaction, so when the destination path exists, the utility takes
    instructions from whatever responds on standard input.</p>
<p class="Pp">The exact format of the interactive prompts is unspecified. Only
    the general nature of the contents of prompts are specified because
    implementations may desire more descriptive prompts than those used on
    historical implementations. Therefore, an application using the <b>-i</b>
    option relies on the system to provide the most suitable dialog directly
    with the user, based on the behavior specified.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-p</b> option is historical practice on BSD systems,
    duplicating the time of last data modification and time of last access. This
    volume of POSIX.1‐2017 extends it to preserve the user and group IDs,
    as well as the file permissions. This requirement has obvious problems in
    that the directories are almost certainly modified after being copied. This
    volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires that the modification times be
    preserved. The statement that the order in which the characteristics are
    duplicated is unspecified is to permit implementations to provide the
    maximum amount of security for the user. Implementations should take into
    account the obvious security issues involved in setting the owner, group,
    and mode in the wrong order or creating files with an owner, group, or mode
    different from the final value.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is unspecified whether <i>cp</i> writes diagnostic messages
    when the user and group IDs cannot be set due to the widespread practice of
    users using <b>-p</b> to duplicate some portion of the file characteristics,
    indifferent to the duplication of others. Historic implementations only
    write diagnostic messages on errors other than <b>[EPERM]</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Earlier versions of this standard included support for the
    <b>-r</b> option to copy file hierarchies. The <b>-r</b> option is
    historical practice on BSD and BSD-derived systems. This option is no longer
    specified by POSIX.1‐2008 but may be present in some implementations.
    The <b>-R</b> option was added as a close synonym to the <b>-r</b> option,
    selected for consistency with all other options in this volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017 that do recursive directory descent.</p>
<p class="Pp">The difference between <b>-R</b> and the removed <b>-r</b> option
    is in the treatment by <i>cp</i> of file types other than regular and
    directory. It was implementation-defined how the <b>-</b> option treated
    special files to allow both historical implementations and those that chose
    to support <b>-r</b> with the same abilities as <b>-R</b> defined by this
    volume of POSIX.1‐2017. The original <b>-r</b> flag, for historic
    reasons, did not handle special files any differently from regular files,
    but always read the file and copied its contents. This had obvious problems
    in the presence of special file types; for example, character devices,
    FIFOs, and sockets.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a failure occurs during the copying of a file hierarchy,
    <i>cp</i> is required to attempt to copy files that are on the same level in
    the hierarchy or above the file where the failure occurred. It is
    unspecified if <i>cp</i> shall attempt to copy files below the file where
    the failure occurred (which cannot succeed in any case).</p>
<p class="Pp">Permissions, owners, and groups of created special file types have
    been deliberately left as implementation-defined. This is to allow systems
    to satisfy special requirements (for example, allowing users to create
    character special devices, but requiring them to be owned by a certain
    group). In general, it is strongly suggested that the permissions, owner,
    and group be the same as if the user had run the historical <i>mknod</i>,
    <i>ln</i>, or other utility to create the file. It is also probable that
    additional privileges are required to create block, character, or other
    implementation-defined special file types.</p>
<p class="Pp">Additionally, the <b>-p</b> option explicitly requires that all
    set-user-ID and set-group-ID permissions be discarded if any of the owner or
    group IDs cannot be set. This is to keep users from unintentionally giving
    away special privilege when copying programs.</p>
<p class="Pp">When creating regular files, historical versions of <i>cp</i> use
    the mode of the source file as modified by the file mode creation mask.
    Other choices would have been to use the mode of the source file unmodified
    by the creation mask or to use the same mode as would be given to a new file
    created by the user (plus the execution bits of the source file) and then
    modify it by the file mode creation mask. In the absence of any strong
    reason to change historic practice, it was in large part retained.</p>
<p class="Pp">When creating directories, historical versions of <i>cp</i> use
    the mode of the source directory, plus read, write, and search bits for the
    owner, as modified by the file mode creation mask. This is done so that
    <i>cp</i> can copy trees where the user has read permission, but the owner
    does not. A side-effect is that if the file creation mask denies the owner
    permissions, <i>cp</i> fails. Also, once the copy is done, historical
    versions of <i>cp</i> set the permissions on the created directory to be the
    same as the source directory, unmodified by the file creation mask.</p>
<p class="Pp">This behavior has been modified so that <i>cp</i> is always able
    to create the contents of the directory, regardless of the file creation
    mask. After the copy is done, the permissions are set to be the same as the
    source directory, as modified by the file creation mask. This latter change
    from historical behavior is to prevent users from accidentally creating
    directories with permissions beyond those they would normally set and for
    consistency with the behavior of <i>cp</i> in creating files.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is not a requirement that <i>cp</i> detect attempts to copy a
    file to itself; however, implementations are strongly encouraged to do so.
    Historical implementations have detected the attempt in most cases.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are two methods of copying subtrees in this volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017. The other method is described as part of the <i>pax</i>
    utility (see <i><i>pax</i></i>). Both methods are historical practice. The
    <i>cp</i> utility provides a simpler, more intuitive interface, while
    <i>pax</i> offers a finer granularity of control. Each provides additional
    functionality to the other; in particular, <i>pax</i> maintains the
    hard-link structure of the hierarchy, while <i>cp</i> does not. It is the
    intention of the standard developers that the results be similar (using
    appropriate option combinations in both utilities). The results are not
    required to be identical; there seemed insufficient gain to applications to
    balance the difficulty of implementations having to guarantee that the
    results would be exactly identical.</p>
<p class="Pp">The wording allowing <i>cp</i> to copy a directory to
    implementation-defined file types not specified by the System Interfaces
    volume of POSIX.1‐2017 is provided so that implementations supporting
    symbolic links are not required to prohibit copying directories to symbolic
    links. Other extensions to the System Interfaces volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017 file types may need to use this loophole as well.</p>
