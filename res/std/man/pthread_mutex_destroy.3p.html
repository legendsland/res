    Attempting to destroy a locked mutex, or a mutex that another thread is

<h2 class="Ss" id="Alternate_Implementations_Possible"><a class="permalink" href="#Alternate_Implementations_Possible">Alternate
  Implementations Possible</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 supports several alternative
    implementations of mutexes. An implementation may store the lock directly in
    the object of type <b>pthread_mutex_t</b>. Alternatively, an implementation
    may store the lock in the heap and merely store a pointer, handle, or unique
    ID in the mutex object. Either implementation has advantages or may be
    required on certain hardware configurations. So that portable code can be
    written that is invariant to this choice, this volume of POSIX.1‐2017
    does not define assignment or equality for this type, and it uses the term
    ``initialize'' to reinforce the (more restrictive) notion that the lock may
    actually reside in the mutex object itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that this precludes an over-specification of the type of the
    mutex or condition variable and motivates the opaqueness of the type.</p>
<p class="Pp">An implementation is permitted, but not required, to have
    <i>pthread_mutex_destroy</i>() store an illegal value into the mutex. This
    may help detect erroneous programs that try to lock (or otherwise reference)
    a mutex that has already been destroyed.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Tradeoff_Between_Error_Checks_and_Performance_Supported"><a class="permalink" href="#Tradeoff_Between_Error_Checks_and_Performance_Supported">Tradeoff
  Between Error Checks and Performance Supported</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Many error conditions that can occur are not required to be
    detected by the implementation in order to let implementations trade off
    performance <i>versus</i> degree of error checking according to the needs of
    their specific applications and execution environment. As a general rule,
    conditions caused by the system (such as insufficient memory) are required
    to be detected, but conditions caused by an erroneously coded application
    (such as failing to provide adequate synchronization to prevent a mutex from
    being deleted while in use) are specified to result in undefined
  behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">A wide range of implementations is thus made possible. For
    example, an implementation intended for application debugging may implement
    all of the error checks, but an implementation running a single, provably
    correct application under very tight performance constraints in an embedded
    computer might implement minimal checks. An implementation might even be
    provided in two versions, similar to the options that compilers provide: a
    full-checking, but slower version; and a limited-checking, but faster
    version. To forbid this optionality would be a disservice to users.</p>
<p class="Pp">By carefully limiting the use of ``undefined behavior'' only to
    things that an erroneous (badly coded) application might do, and by defining
    that resource-not-available errors are mandatory, this volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017 ensures that a fully-conforming application is portable
    across the full range of implementations, while not forcing all
    implementations to add overhead to check for numerous things that a correct
    program never does. When the behavior is undefined, no error number is
    specified to be returned on implementations that do detect the condition.
    This is because undefined behavior means <i>anything</i> can happen, which
    includes returning with any value (which might happen to be a valid, but
    different, error number). However, since the error number might be useful to
    application developers when diagnosing problems during application
    development, a recommendation is made in rationale that implementors should
    return a particular error number if their implementation does detect the
    condition.</p>

  No Limits are Defined</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Defining symbols for the maximum number of mutexes and condition
    variables was considered but rejected because the number of these objects
    may change dynamically. Furthermore, many implementations place these
    objects into application memory; thus, there is no explicit maximum.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Static_Initializers_for_Mutexes_and_Condition_Variables"><a class="permalink" href="#Static_Initializers_for_Mutexes_and_Condition_Variables">Static
  Initializers for Mutexes and Condition Variables</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Providing for static initialization of statically allocated
    synchronization objects allows modules with private static synchronization
    variables to avoid runtime initialization tests and overhead. Furthermore,
    it simplifies the coding of self-initializing modules. Such modules are
    common in C libraries, where for various reasons the design calls for
    self-initialization instead of requiring an explicit module initialization
    function to be called. An example use of static initialization follows.</p>
<p class="Pp">Without static initialization, a self-initializing routine
    <i>foo</i>() might look as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>static pthread_once_t foo_once = PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT;
static pthread_mutex_t foo_mutex;</pre>
<pre>void foo_init()
{
<br>
    pthread_mutex_init(&amp;foo_mutex, NULL);
}</pre>
<pre>void foo()
{
<br>
    pthread_once(&amp;foo_once, foo_init);
<br>
    pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;foo_mutex);
<br>
   /* Do work. */
<br>
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;foo_mutex);
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">With static initialization, the same routine could be coded as
    follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>static pthread_mutex_t foo_mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;</pre>
<pre>void foo()
{
<br>
    pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;foo_mutex);
<br>
   /* Do work. */
<br>
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;foo_mutex);
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that the static initialization both eliminates the need for
    the initialization test inside <i>pthread_once</i>() and the fetch of
    &amp;<i>foo_mutex</i> to learn the address to be passed to
    <i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>() or <i>pthread_mutex_unlock</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">Thus, the C code written to initialize static objects is simpler
    on all systems and is also faster on a large class of systems; those where
    the (entire) synchronization object can be stored in application memory.</p>
<p class="Pp">Yet the locking performance question is likely to be raised for
    machines that require mutexes to be allocated out of special memory. Such
    machines actually have to have mutexes and possibly condition variables
    contain pointers to the actual hardware locks. For static initialization to
    work on such machines, <i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>() also has to test whether
    or not the pointer to the actual lock has been allocated. If it has not,
    <i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>() has to initialize it before use. The reservation
    of such resources can be made when the program is loaded, and hence return
    codes have not been added to mutex locking and condition variable waiting to
    indicate failure to complete initialization.</p>
<p class="Pp">This runtime test in <i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>() would at first
    seem to be extra work; an extra test is required to see whether the pointer
    has been initialized. On most machines this would actually be implemented as
    a fetch of the pointer, testing the pointer against zero, and then using the
    pointer if it has already been initialized. While the test might seem to add
    extra work, the extra effort of testing a register is usually negligible
    since no extra memory references are actually done. As more and more
    machines provide caches, the real expenses are memory references, not
    instructions executed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Alternatively, depending on the machine architecture, there are
    often ways to eliminate <i>all</i> overhead in the most important case: on
    the lock operations that occur <i>after</i> the lock has been initialized.
    This can be done by shifting more overhead to the less frequent operation:
    initialization. Since out-of-line mutex allocation also means that an
    address has to be dereferenced to find the actual lock, one technique that
    is widely applicable is to have static initialization store a bogus value
    for that address; in particular, an address that causes a machine fault to
    occur. When such a fault occurs upon the first attempt to lock such a mutex,
    validity checks can be done, and then the correct address for the actual
    lock can be filled in. Subsequent lock operations incur no extra overhead
    since they do not ``fault''. This is merely one technique that can be used
    to support static initialization, while not adversely affecting the
    performance of lock acquisition. No doubt there are other techniques that
    are highly machine-dependent.</p>
<p class="Pp">The locking overhead for machines doing out-of-line mutex
    allocation is thus similar for modules being implicitly initialized, where
    it is improved for those doing mutex allocation entirely inline. The inline
    case is thus made much faster, and the out-of-line case is not significantly
    worse.</p>
<p class="Pp">Besides the issue of locking performance for such machines, a
    concern is raised that it is possible that threads would serialize
    contending for initialization locks when attempting to finish initializing
    statically allocated mutexes. (Such finishing would typically involve taking
    an internal lock, allocating a structure, storing a pointer to the structure
    in the mutex, and releasing the internal lock.) First, many implementations
    would reduce such serialization by hashing on the mutex address. Second,
    such serialization can only occur a bounded number of times. In particular,
    it can happen at most as many times as there are statically allocated
    synchronization objects. Dynamically allocated objects would still be
    initialized via <i>pthread_mutex_init</i>() or
  <i>pthread_cond_init</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, if none of the above optimization techniques for
    out-of-line allocation yields sufficient performance for an application on
    some implementation, the application can avoid static initialization
    altogether by explicitly initializing all synchronization objects with the
    corresponding <i>pthread_*_init</i>() functions, which are supported by all
    implementations. An implementation can also document the tradeoffs and
    advise which initialization technique is more efficient for that particular
    implementation.</p>

<p class="Pp">A mutex can be destroyed immediately after it is unlocked.
    However, since attempting to destroy a locked mutex, or a mutex that another
    thread is attempting to lock, or a mutex that is being used in a
    <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() or <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() call by
    another thread, results in undefined behavior, care must be taken to ensure
