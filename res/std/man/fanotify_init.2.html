<p class="Pp">For an overview of the fanotify API, see <b>fanotify</b>(7).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>fanotify_init</b>() initializes a new fanotify group and
    returns a file descriptor for the event queue associated with the group.</p>
<p class="Pp">The file descriptor is used in calls to <b>fanotify_mark</b>(2) to
    specify the files, directories, mounts, or filesystems for which fanotify
    events shall be created. These events are received by reading from the file
    descriptor. Some events are only informative, indicating that a file has
    been accessed. Other events can be used to determine whether another
    application is permitted to access a file or directory. Permission to access
    filesystem objects is granted by writing to the file descriptor.</p>
<p class="Pp">Multiple programs may be using the fanotify interface at the same
    time to monitor the same files.</p>
<p class="Pp">The number of fanotify groups per user is limited. See
    <b>fanotify</b>(7) for details about this limit.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>flags</i> argument contains a multi-bit field defining the
    notification class of the listening application and further single bit
    fields specifying the behavior of the file descriptor.</p>
<p class="Pp">If multiple listeners for permission events exist, the
    notification class is used to establish the sequence in which the listeners
    receive the events.</p>
<p class="Pp">Only one of the following notification classes may be specified in
    <i>flags</i>:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="FAN_CLASS_PRE_CONTENT"><a class="permalink" href="#FAN_CLASS_PRE_CONTENT"><b>FAN_CLASS_PRE_CONTENT</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This value allows the receipt of events notifying that a file has been
      accessed and events for permission decisions if a file may be accessed. It
      is intended for event listeners that need to access files before they
      contain their final data. This notification class might be used by
      hierarchical storage managers, for example. Use of this flag requires the
      <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> capability.</dd>
  <dt id="FAN_CLASS_CONTENT"><a class="permalink" href="#FAN_CLASS_CONTENT"><b>FAN_CLASS_CONTENT</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This value allows the receipt of events notifying that a file has been
      accessed and events for permission decisions if a file may be accessed. It
      is intended for event listeners that need to access files when they
      already contain their final content. This notification class might be used
      by malware detection programs, for example. Use of this flag requires the
      <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> capability.</dd>
  <dt id="FAN_CLASS_NOTIF"><a class="permalink" href="#FAN_CLASS_NOTIF"><b>FAN_CLASS_NOTIF</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This is the default value. It does not need to be specified. This value
      only allows the receipt of events notifying that a file has been accessed.
      Permission decisions before the file is accessed are not possible.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Listeners with different notification classes will receive events
    in the order <b>FAN_CLASS_PRE_CONTENT</b>, <b>FAN_CLASS_CONTENT</b>,
    <b>FAN_CLASS_NOTIF</b>. The order of notification for listeners in the same
    notification class is undefined.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following bits can additionally be set in <i>flags</i>:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="FAN_CLOEXEC"><a class="permalink" href="#FAN_CLOEXEC"><b>FAN_CLOEXEC</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Set the close-on-exec flag (<b>FD_CLOEXEC</b>) on the new file descriptor.
      See the description of the <b>O_CLOEXEC</b> flag in <b>open</b>(2).</dd>
  <dt id="FAN_NONBLOCK"><a class="permalink" href="#FAN_NONBLOCK"><b>FAN_NONBLOCK</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Enable the nonblocking flag (<b>O_NONBLOCK</b>) for the file descriptor.
      Reading from the file descriptor will not block. Instead, if no data is
      available, <b>read</b>(2) fails with the error <b>EAGAIN</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="FAN_UNLIMITED_QUEUE"><a class="permalink" href="#FAN_UNLIMITED_QUEUE"><b>FAN_UNLIMITED_QUEUE</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Remove the limit on the number of events in the event queue. See
      <b>fanotify</b>(7) for details about this limit. Use of this flag requires
      the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> capability.</dd>
  <dt id="FAN_UNLIMITED_MARKS"><a class="permalink" href="#FAN_UNLIMITED_MARKS"><b>FAN_UNLIMITED_MARKS</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Remove the limit on the number of fanotify marks per user. See
      <b>fanotify</b>(7) for details about this limit. Use of this flag requires
      the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> capability.</dd>
  <dt id="FAN_REPORT_TID"><a class="permalink" href="#FAN_REPORT_TID"><b>FAN_REPORT_TID</b>
    (since Linux 4.20)</a></dt>
  <dd>Report thread ID (TID) instead of process ID (PID) in the <i>pid</i> field
      of the <i>struct fanotify_event_metadata</i> supplied to <b>read</b>(2)
      (see <b>fanotify</b>(7)). Use of this flag requires the
      <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> capability.</dd>
  <dt id="FAN_ENABLE_AUDIT"><a class="permalink" href="#FAN_ENABLE_AUDIT"><b>FAN_ENABLE_AUDIT</b>
    (since Linux 4.15)</a></dt>
  <dd>Enable generation of audit log records about access mediation performed by
      permission events. The permission event response has to be marked with the
      <b>FAN_AUDIT</b> flag for an audit log record to be generated. Use of this
      flag requires the <b>CAP_AUDIT_WRITE</b> capability.</dd>
  <dt id="FAN_REPORT_FID"><a class="permalink" href="#FAN_REPORT_FID"><b>FAN_REPORT_FID</b>
    (since Linux 5.1)</a></dt>
  <dd>This value allows the receipt of events which contain additional
      information about the underlying filesystem object correlated to an event.
      An additional record of type <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_FID</b> encapsulates
      the information about the object and is included alongside the generic
      event metadata structure. The file descriptor that is used to represent
      the object correlated to an event is instead substituted with a file
      handle. It is intended for applications that may find the use of a file
      handle to identify an object more suitable than a file descriptor.
      Additionally, it may be used for applications monitoring a directory or a
      filesystem that are interested in the directory entry modification events
      <b>FAN_CREATE</b>, <b>FAN_DELETE</b>, <b>FAN_MOVE</b>, and
      <b>FAN_RENAME</b>, or in events such as <b>FAN_ATTRIB</b>,
      <b>FAN_DELETE_SELF</b>, and <b>FAN_MOVE_SELF</b>. All the events above
      require an fanotify group that identifies filesystem objects by file
      handles. Note that without the flag <b>FAN_REPORT_TARGET_FID</b>, for the
      directory entry modification events, there is an information record that
      identifies the modified directory and not the created/deleted/moved child
      object. The use of <b>FAN_CLASS_CONTENT</b> or
      <b>FAN_CLASS_PRE_CONTENT</b> is not permitted with this flag and will
      result in the error <b>EINVAL</b>. See <b>fanotify</b>(7) for additional
      details.</dd>
  <dt id="FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID"><a class="permalink" href="#FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID"><b>FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID</b>
    (since Linux 5.9)</a></dt>
  <dd>Events for fanotify groups initialized with this flag will contain (see
      exceptions below) additional information about a directory object
      correlated to an event. An additional record of type
      <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID</b> encapsulates the information about the
      directory object and is included alongside the generic event metadata
      structure. For events that occur on a non-directory object, the additional
      structure includes a file handle that identifies the parent directory
      filesystem object. Note that there is no guarantee that the directory
      filesystem object will be found at the location described by the file
      handle information at the time the event is received. When combined with
      the flag <b>FAN_REPORT_FID</b>, two records may be reported with events
      that occur on a non-directory object, one to identify the non-directory
      object itself and one to identify the parent directory object. Note that
      in some cases, a filesystem object does not have a parent, for example,
      when an event occurs on an unlinked but open file. In that case, with the
      <b>FAN_REPORT_FID</b> flag, the event will be reported with only one
      record to identify the non-directory object itself, because there is no
      directory associated with the event. Without the <b>FAN_REPORT_FID</b>
      flag, no event will be reported. See <b>fanotify</b>(7) for additional
      details.</dd>
  <dt id="FAN_REPORT_NAME"><a class="permalink" href="#FAN_REPORT_NAME"><b>FAN_REPORT_NAME</b>
    (since Linux 5.9)</a></dt>
  <dd>Events for fanotify groups initialized with this flag will contain
      additional information about the name of the directory entry correlated to
      an event. This flag must be provided in conjunction with the flag
      <b>FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID</b>. Providing this flag value without
      <b>FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID</b> will result in the error <b>EINVAL</b>. This
      flag may be combined with the flag <b>FAN_REPORT_FID</b>. An additional
      record of type <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID_NAME</b>, which encapsulates
      the information about the directory entry, is included alongside the
      generic event metadata structure and substitutes the additional
      information record of type <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID</b>. The additional
      record includes a file handle that identifies a directory filesystem
      object followed by a name that identifies an entry in that directory. For
      the directory entry modification events <b>FAN_CREATE</b>,
      <b>FAN_DELETE</b>, and <b>FAN_MOVE</b>, the reported name is that of the
      created/deleted/moved directory entry. The event <b>FAN_RENAME</b> may
      contain two information records. One of type
      <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_OLD_DFID_NAME</b> identifying the old directory
      entry, and another of type <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_NEW_DFID_NAME</b>
      identifying the new directory entry. For other events that occur on a
      directory object, the reported file handle is that of the directory object
      itself and the reported name is '.'. For other events that occur on a
      non-directory object, the reported file handle is that of the parent
      directory object and the reported name is the name of a directory entry
      where the object was located at the time of the event. The rationale
      behind this logic is that the reported directory file handle can be passed
      to <b>open_by_handle_at</b>(2) to get an open directory file descriptor
      and that file descriptor along with the reported name can be used to call
      <b>fstatat</b>(2). The same rule that applies to record type
      <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID</b> also applies to record type
      <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID_NAME</b>: if a non-directory object has no
      parent, either the event will not be reported or it will be reported
      without the directory entry information. Note that there is no guarantee
      that the filesystem object will be found at the location described by the
      directory entry information at the time the event is received. See
      <b>fanotify</b>(7) for additional details.</dd>

    (since Linux 5.17)</a></dt>
  <dd>Events for fanotify groups initialized with this flag will contain
      additional information about the child correlated with directory entry
      modification events. This flag must be provided in conjunction with the
      flags <b>FAN_REPORT_FID</b>, <b>FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID</b> and
      <b>FAN_REPORT_NAME</b>. or else the error <b>EINVAL</b> will be returned.
      For the directory entry modification events <b>FAN_CREATE</b>,
      <b>FAN_DELETE</b>, <b>FAN_MOVE</b>, and <b>FAN_RENAME</b>, an additional
      record of type <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_FID</b>, is reported in addition to
      the information records of type <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID</b>,
      <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID_NAME</b>,
      <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_OLD_DFID_NAME</b>, and
      <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_NEW_DFID_NAME</b>. The additional record includes a
      file handle that identifies the filesystem child object that the directory
      entry is referring to.</dd>

  <dt id="FAN_REPORT_PIDFD"><a class="permalink" href="#FAN_REPORT_PIDFD"><b>FAN_REPORT_PIDFD</b>
    (since Linux 5.15)</a></dt>
  <dd>Events for fanotify groups initialized with this flag will contain an
      additional information record alongside the generic
      <i>fanotify_event_metadata</i> structure. This information record will be
      of type <b>FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_PIDFD</b> and will contain a pidfd for the
      process that was responsible for generating an event. A pidfd returned in
      this information record object is no different to the pidfd that is
      returned when calling <b>pidfd_open</b>(2). Usage of this information
      record are for applications that may be interested in reliably determining
      whether the process responsible for generating an event has been recycled
      or terminated. The use of the <b>FAN_REPORT_TID</b> flag along with
      <b>FAN_REPORT_PIDFD</b> is currently not supported and attempting to do so
      will result in the error <b>EINVAL</b> being returned. This limitation is
      currently imposed by the pidfd API as it currently only supports the
      creation of pidfds for thread-group leaders. Creating pidfds for
      non-thread-group leaders may be supported at some point in the future, so
      this restriction may eventually be lifted. For more details on information
      records, see <b>fanotify</b>(7).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The <i>event_f_flags</i> argument defines the file status flags
    that will be set on the open file descriptions that are created for fanotify
    events. For details of these flags, see the description of the <i>flags</i>
    values in <b>open</b>(2). <i>event_f_flags</i> includes a multi-bit field
