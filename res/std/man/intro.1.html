<p class="Pp">Linux is a flavor of UNIX, and as a first approximation all user
    commands under UNIX work precisely the same under Linux (and FreeBSD and
    lots of other UNIX-like systems).</p>
<p class="Pp">Under Linux, there are GUIs (graphical user interfaces), where you
    can point and click and drag, and hopefully get work done without first
    reading lots of documentation. The traditional UNIX environment is a CLI
    (command line interface), where you type commands to tell the computer what
    to do. That is faster and more powerful, but requires finding out what the
    commands are. Below a bare minimum, to get started.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Login"><a class="permalink" href="#Login">Login</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In order to start working, you probably first have to open a
    session by giving your username and password. The program <b>login</b>(1)
    now starts a <i>shell</i> (command interpreter) for you. In case of a
    graphical login, you get a screen with menus or icons and a mouse click will
    start a shell in a window. See also <b>xterm</b>(1).</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="The_shell"><a class="permalink" href="#The_shell">The
  shell</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">One types commands to the <i>shell</i>, the command interpreter.
    It is not built-in, but is just a program and you can change your shell.
    Everybody has their own favorite one. The standard one is called <i>sh</i>.
    See also <b>ash</b>(1), <b>bash</b>(1), <b>chsh</b>(1), <b>csh</b>(1),
    <b>dash</b>(1), <b>ksh</b>(1), <b>zsh</b>(1).</p>

<p class="Pp">Here typing Control-D ended the session.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>$</b> here was the command prompt—it is the shell's
    way of indicating that it is ready for the next command. The prompt can be
    customized in lots of ways, and one might include stuff like username,
    machine name, current directory, time, and so on. An assignment
    PS1="What next, master? " would change the prompt as
  indicated.</p>
<p class="Pp">We see that there are commands <i>date</i> (that gives date and
    time), and <i>cal</i> (that gives a calendar).</p>
<p class="Pp">The command <i>ls</i> lists the contents of the current
    directory—it tells you what files you have. With a <i>-l</i> option
    it gives a long listing, that includes the owner and size and date of the
    file, and the permissions people have for reading and/or changing the file.
    For example, the file "tel" here is 37 bytes long, owned by aeb
    and the owner can read and write it, others can only read it. Owner and
    permissions can be changed by the commands <i>chown</i> and
  <i>chmod</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The command <i>cat</i> will show the contents of a file. (The name
    is from "concatenate and print": all files given as parameters are
    concatenated and sent to "standard output" (see <b>stdout</b>(3)),
    here the terminal screen.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The command <i>cp</i> (from "copy") will copy a
  file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The command <i>mv</i> (from "move"), on the other hand,
    only renames it.</p>
<p class="Pp">The command <i>diff</i> lists the differences between two files.
    Here there was no output because there were no differences.</p>
<p class="Pp">The command <i>rm</i> (from "remove") deletes the file,
    and be careful! it is gone. No wastepaper basket or anything. Deleted means
    lost.</p>
<p class="Pp">The command <i>grep</i> (from "g/re/p") finds
    occurrences of a string in one or more files. Here it finds Maja's telephone
    number.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Pathnames_and_the_current_directory"><a class="permalink" href="#Pathnames_and_the_current_directory">Pathnames
  and the current directory</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Files live in a large tree, the file hierarchy. Each has a
    <i>pathname</i> describing the path from the root of the tree (which is
    called <i>/</i>) to the file. For example, such a full pathname might be
    <i>/home/aeb/tel</i>. Always using full pathnames would be inconvenient, and
    the name of a file in the current directory may be abbreviated by giving
    only the last component. That is why <i>/home/aeb/tel</i> can be abbreviated
    to <i>tel</i> when the current directory is <i>/home/aeb</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The command <i>pwd</i> prints the current directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">The command <i>cd</i> changes the current directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">Try alternatively <i>cd</i> and <i>pwd</i> commands and explore
    <i>cd</i> usage: "cd", "cd .", "cd ..",
    "cd /", and "cd ~".</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Directories"><a class="permalink" href="#Directories">Directories</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The command <i>mkdir</i> makes a new directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">The command <i>rmdir</i> removes a directory if it is empty, and
    complains otherwise.</p>
<p class="Pp">The command <i>find</i> (with a rather baroque syntax) will find
    files with given name or other properties. For example, "find . -name
    tel" would find the file <i>tel</i> starting in the present directory
    (which is called <i>.</i>). And "find / -name tel" would do the
    same, but starting at the root of the tree. Large searches on a multi-GB
    disk will be time-consuming, and it may be better to use
  <b>locate</b>(1).</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Disks_and_filesystems"><a class="permalink" href="#Disks_and_filesystems">Disks
  and filesystems</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The command <i>mount</i> will attach the filesystem found on some
    disk (or floppy, or CDROM or so) to the big filesystem hierarchy. And
    <i>umount</i> detaches it again. The command <i>df</i> will tell you how
    much of your disk is still free.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Processes"><a class="permalink" href="#Processes">Processes</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">On a UNIX system many user and system processes run
    simultaneously. The one you are talking to runs in the <i>foreground</i>,
    the others in the <i>background</i>. The command <i>ps</i> will show you
    which processes are active and what numbers these processes have. The
    command <i>kill</i> allows you to get rid of them. Without option this is a
    friendly request: please go away. And "kill -9" followed by the
    number of the process is an immediate kill. Foreground processes can often
    be killed by typing Control-C.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Getting_information"><a class="permalink" href="#Getting_information">Getting
  information</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">There are thousands of commands, each with many options.
    Traditionally commands are documented on <i>man pages</i>, (like this one),
    so that the command "man kill" will document the use of the
    command "kill" (and "man man" document the command
    "man"). The program <i>man</i> sends the text through some
    <i>pager</i>, usually <i>less</i>. Hit the space bar to get the next page,
    hit q to quit.</p>
<p class="Pp">In documentation it is customary to refer to man pages by giving
    the name and section number, as in <b>man</b>(1). Man pages are terse, and
    allow you to find quickly some forgotten detail. For newcomers an
    introductory text with more examples and explanations is useful.</p>
<p class="Pp">A lot of GNU/FSF software is provided with info files. Type
    "info info" for an introduction on the use of the program
    <i>info</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Special topics are often treated in HOWTOs. Look in
    <i>/usr/share/doc/howto/en</i> and use a browser if you find HTML files
    there.</p>
