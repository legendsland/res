    the size of the file space allocated to, and the size of the file space
    allocated to each subdirectory of, the file hierarchy rooted in each of the
    specified files. By default, when a symbolic link is encountered on the
    command line or in the file hierarchy, <i>du</i> shall count the size of the
    symbolic link (rather than the file referenced by the link), and shall not
    follow the link to another portion of the file hierarchy. The size of the
    file space allocated to a file of type directory shall be defined as the sum
    total of space allocated to all files in the file hierarchy rooted in the
    directory plus the space allocated to the directory itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <i>du</i> cannot <i>stat</i>() files or <i>stat</i>() or read

    entry. It is implementation-defined whether a file that has a link count no
    greater than 1 is counted and written just once, or is counted and written
    for each occurrence. It is implementation-defined whether a file that occurs
    under one file operand is counted for other file operands. The directory
    entry that is selected in the report is unspecified. By default, file sizes
    shall be written in 512-byte units, rounded up to the next 512-byte

<p class="Pp">The use of 512-byte units is historical practice and maintains
    compatibility with <i>ls</i> and other utilities in this volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017. This does not mandate that the file system itself be
    based on 512-byte blocks. The <b>-k</b> option was added as a compromise
    measure. It was agreed by the standard developers that 512 bytes was the
    best default unit because of its complete historical consistency on System V
    (<i>versus</i> the mixed 512/1024-byte usage on BSD systems), and that a
    <b>-k</b> option to switch to 1024-byte units was a good compromise. Users
    who prefer the 1024-byte quantity can easily alias <i>du</i> to <i>du</i>
    <b>-k</b> without breaking the many historical scripts relying on the
    512-byte units.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-b</b> option was added to an early proposal to provide a
    resolution to the situation where System V and BSD systems give figures for
    file sizes in <i>blocks</i>, which is an implementation-defined concept. (In
    common usage, the block size is 512 bytes for System V and 1024 bytes for
    BSD systems.) However, <b>-b</b> was later deleted, since the default was
    eventually decided as 512-byte units.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historical file systems provided no way to obtain exact figures
    for the space allocation given to files. There are two known areas of
    inaccuracies in historical file systems: cases of <i>indirect blocks</i>
    being used by the file system or <i>sparse</i> files yielding incorrectly
    high values. An indirect block is space used by the file system in the
    storage of the file, but that need not be counted in the space allocated to
    the file. A <i>sparse</i> file is one in which an <i>lseek</i>() call has
    been made to a position beyond the end of the file and data has subsequently
    been written at that point. A file system need not allocate all the
    intervening zero-filled blocks to such a file. It is up to the
    implementation to define exactly how accurate its methods are.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-a</b> and <b>-s</b> options were mutually-exclusive in the
    original version of <i>du</i>. The POSIX Shell and Utilities description is
    implied by the language in the SVID where <b>-s</b> is described as causing
    ``only the grand total'' to be reported. Some systems may produce output for
    <b>-sa</b>, but a Strictly Conforming POSIX Shell and Utilities Application
    cannot use that combination.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-a</b> and <b>-s</b> options were adopted from the SVID
    except that the System V behavior of not listing non-directories explicitly
    given as operands, unless the <b>-a</b> option is specified, was considered
    a bug; the BSD-based behavior (report for all operands) is mandated. The
    default behavior of <i>du</i> in the SVID with regard to reporting the
    failure to read files (it produces no messages) was considered
    counter-intuitive, and thus it was specified that the POSIX Shell and
    Utilities default behavior shall be to produce such messages. These messages
    can be turned off with shell redirection to achieve the System V
  behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-x</b> option is historical practice on recent BSD systems.
    It has been adopted by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 because there was
    no other historical method of limiting the <i>du</i> search to a single file
    hierarchy. This limitation of the search is necessary to make it possible to
    obtain file space usage information about a file system on which other file
    systems are mounted, without having to resort to a lengthy <i>find</i> and
    <i>awk</i> script.</p>
