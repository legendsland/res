<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Pipes and FIFOs (also known as named pipes) provide a
    unidirectional interprocess communication channel. A pipe has a <i>read
    end</i> and a <i>write end</i>. Data written to the write end of a pipe can
    be read from the read end of the pipe.</p>
<p class="Pp">A pipe is created using <b>pipe</b>(2), which creates a new pipe
    and returns two file descriptors, one referring to the read end of the pipe,
    the other referring to the write end. Pipes can be used to create a
    communication channel between related processes; see <b>pipe</b>(2) for an
    example.</p>
<p class="Pp">A FIFO (short for First In First Out) has a name within the
    filesystem (created using <b>mkfifo</b>(3)), and is opened using
    <b>open</b>(2). Any process may open a FIFO, assuming the file permissions
    allow it. The read end is opened using the <b>O_RDONLY</b> flag; the write
    end is opened using the <b>O_WRONLY</b> flag. See <b>fifo</b>(7) for further
    details. <i>Note</i>: although FIFOs have a pathname in the filesystem, I/O
    on FIFOs does not involve operations on the underlying device (if there is
    one).</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="I/O_on_pipes_and_FIFOs"><a class="permalink" href="#I/O_on_pipes_and_FIFOs">I/O
  on pipes and FIFOs</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The only difference between pipes and FIFOs is the manner in which
    they are created and opened. Once these tasks have been accomplished, I/O on
    pipes and FIFOs has exactly the same semantics.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a process attempts to read from an empty pipe, then
    <b>read</b>(2) will block until data is available. If a process attempts to
    write to a full pipe (see below), then <b>write</b>(2) blocks until
    sufficient data has been read from the pipe to allow the write to complete.
    Nonblocking I/O is possible by using the <b>fcntl</b>(2) <b>F_SETFL</b>
    operation to enable the <b>O_NONBLOCK</b> open file status flag.</p>
<p class="Pp">The communication channel provided by a pipe is a <i>byte
    stream</i>: there is no concept of message boundaries.</p>
<p class="Pp">If all file descriptors referring to the write end of a pipe have
    been closed, then an attempt to <b>read</b>(2) from the pipe will see
    end-of-file (<b>read</b>(2) will return 0). If all file descriptors
    referring to the read end of a pipe have been closed, then a <b>write</b>(2)
    will cause a <b>SIGPIPE</b> signal to be generated for the calling process.
    If the calling process is ignoring this signal, then <b>write</b>(2) fails
    with the error <b>EPIPE</b>. An application that uses <b>pipe</b>(2) and
    <b>fork</b>(2) should use suitable <b>close</b>(2) calls to close
    unnecessary duplicate file descriptors; this ensures that end-of-file and
    <b>SIGPIPE</b>/<b>EPIPE</b> are delivered when appropriate.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is not possible to apply <b>lseek</b>(2) to a pipe.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Pipe_capacity"><a class="permalink" href="#Pipe_capacity">Pipe
  capacity</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A pipe has a limited capacity. If the pipe is full, then a
    <b>write</b>(2) will block or fail, depending on whether the
    <b>O_NONBLOCK</b> flag is set (see below). Different implementations have
    different limits for the pipe capacity. Applications should not rely on a
    particular capacity: an application should be designed so that a reading
    process consumes data as soon as it is available, so that a writing process
    does not remain blocked.</p>
<p class="Pp">Before Linux 2.6.11, the capacity of a pipe was the same as the
    system page size (e.g., 4096 bytes on i386). Since Linux 2.6.11, the pipe
    capacity is 16 pages (i.e., 65,536 bytes in a system with a page size of
    4096 bytes). Since Linux 2.6.35, the default pipe capacity is 16 pages, but
    the capacity can be queried and set using the <b>fcntl</b>(2)
    <b>F_GETPIPE_SZ</b> and <b>F_SETPIPE_SZ</b> operations. See <b>fcntl</b>(2)
    for more information.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following <b>ioctl</b>(2) operation, which can be applied to a
    file descriptor that refers to either end of a pipe, places a count of the
    number of unread bytes in the pipe in the <i>int</i> buffer pointed to by
    the final argument of the call:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &amp;nbytes);
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">The <b>FIONREAD</b> operation is not specified in any standard,
    but is provided on many implementations.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="PIPE_BUF"><a class="permalink" href="#PIPE_BUF">PIPE_BUF</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">POSIX.1 says that writes of less than <b>PIPE_BUF</b> bytes must
    be atomic: the output data is written to the pipe as a contiguous sequence.
    Writes of more than <b>PIPE_BUF</b> bytes may be nonatomic: the kernel may
    interleave the data with data written by other processes. POSIX.1 requires
    <b>PIPE_BUF</b> to be at least 512 bytes. (On Linux, <b>PIPE_BUF</b> is 4096
    bytes.) The precise semantics depend on whether the file descriptor is
    nonblocking (<b>O_NONBLOCK</b>), whether there are multiple writers to the
    pipe, and on <i>n</i>, the number of bytes to be written:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="O_NONBLOCK"><a class="permalink" href="#O_NONBLOCK"><b>O_NONBLOCK</b>
    disabled, <i>n</i> &lt;= <b>PIPE_BUF</b></a></dt>
  <dd>All <i>n</i> bytes are written atomically; <b>write</b>(2) may block if
      there is not room for <i>n</i> bytes to be written immediately</dd>
  <dt id="O_NONBLOCK~2"><a class="permalink" href="#O_NONBLOCK~2"><b>O_NONBLOCK</b>
    enabled, <i>n</i> &lt;= <b>PIPE_BUF</b></a></dt>
  <dd>If there is room to write <i>n</i> bytes to the pipe, then <b>write</b>(2)
      succeeds immediately, writing all <i>n</i> bytes; otherwise
      <b>write</b>(2) fails, with <i>errno</i> set to <b>EAGAIN</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="O_NONBLOCK~3"><a class="permalink" href="#O_NONBLOCK~3"><b>O_NONBLOCK</b>
    disabled, <i>n</i> &gt; <b>PIPE_BUF</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The write is nonatomic: the data given to <b>write</b>(2) may be
      interleaved with <b>write</b>(2)s by other process; the <b>write</b>(2)
      blocks until <i>n</i> bytes have been written.</dd>
  <dt id="O_NONBLOCK~4"><a class="permalink" href="#O_NONBLOCK~4"><b>O_NONBLOCK</b>
    enabled, <i>n</i> &gt; <b>PIPE_BUF</b></a></dt>
  <dd>If the pipe is full, then <b>write</b>(2) fails, with <i>errno</i> set to
      <b>EAGAIN</b>. Otherwise, from 1 to <i>n</i> bytes may be written (i.e., a
      "partial write" may occur; the caller should check the return
      value from <b>write</b>(2) to see how many bytes were actually written),
      and these bytes may be interleaved with writes by other processes.</dd>
</dl>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Open_file_status_flags"><a class="permalink" href="#Open_file_status_flags">Open
  file status flags</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The only open file status flags that can be meaningfully applied
    to a pipe or FIFO are <b>O_NONBLOCK</b> and <b>O_ASYNC</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Setting the <b>O_ASYNC</b> flag for the read end of a pipe causes
    a signal (<b>SIGIO</b> by default) to be generated when new input becomes
    available on the pipe. The target for delivery of signals must be set using
    the <b>fcntl</b>(2) <b>F_SETOWN</b> command. On Linux, <b>O_ASYNC</b> is
    supported for pipes and FIFOs only since Linux 2.6.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Portability_notes"><a class="permalink" href="#Portability_notes">Portability
  notes</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">On some systems (but not Linux), pipes are bidirectional: data can
    be transmitted in both directions between the pipe ends. POSIX.1 requires
    only unidirectional pipes. Portable applications should avoid reliance on
    bidirectional pipe semantics.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="BUGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Before Linux 4.9, some bugs affected the handling of the
    <i>pipe-user-pages-soft</i> and <i>pipe-user-pages-hard</i> limits when
    using the <b>fcntl</b>(2) <b>F_SETPIPE_SZ</b> operation to change a pipe's
    capacity:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>(a)</dt>
  <dd>When increasing the pipe capacity, the checks against the soft and hard
      limits were made against existing consumption, and excluded the memory
      required for the increased pipe capacity. The new increase in pipe
      capacity could then push the total memory used by the user for pipes
      (possibly far) over a limit. (This could also trigger the problem
      described next.)</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Starting with Linux 4.9, the limit checking includes the memory required
      for the new pipe capacity.</dd>
  <dt>(b)</dt>
  <dd>The limit checks were performed even when the new pipe capacity was less
      than the existing pipe capacity. This could lead to problems if a user set
      a large pipe capacity, and then the limits were lowered, with the result
      that the user could no longer decrease the pipe capacity.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Starting with Linux 4.9, checks against the limits are performed only when
      increasing a pipe's capacity; an unprivileged user can always decrease a
      pipe's capacity.</dd>
  <dt>(c)</dt>
  <dd>The accounting and checking against the limits were done as follows:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>(1)</dt>
  <dd>Test whether the user has exceeded the limit.</dd>
  <dt>(2)</dt>
  <dd>Make the new pipe buffer allocation.</dd>
  <dt>(3)</dt>
  <dd>Account new allocation against the limits.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>This was racey. Multiple processes could pass point (1) simultaneously,
      and then allocate pipe buffers that were accounted for only in step (3),
      with the result that the user's pipe buffer allocation could be pushed
      over the limit.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Starting with Linux 4.9, the accounting step is performed before doing the
      allocation, and the operation fails if the limit would be exceeded.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Before Linux 4.9, bugs similar to points (a) and (c) could also
    occur when the kernel allocated memory for a new pipe buffer; that is, when
    calling <b>pipe</b>(2) and when opening a previously unopened FIFO.</p>
