<p class="Pp">Each process has a unique nonnegative integer identifier that is
    assigned when the process is created using <b>fork</b>(2). A process can
    obtain its PID using <b>getpid</b>(2). A PID is represented using the type
    <i>pid_t</i> (defined in <i>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</i>).</p>
<p class="Pp">PIDs are used in a range of system calls to identify the process
    affected by the call, for example: <b>kill</b>(2), <b>ptrace</b>(2),
    <b>setpriority</b>(2), <b>setpgid</b>(2), <b>setsid</b>(2),

    this process using <b>fork</b>(2). A process can obtain its PPID using
    <b>getppid</b>(2). A PPID is represented using the type <i>pid_t</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">A process's PPID is preserved across an <b>execve</b>(2).</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Process_group_ID_and_session_ID"><a class="permalink" href="#Process_group_ID_and_session_ID">Process
  group ID and session ID</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Each process has a session ID and a process group ID, both
    represented using the type <i>pid_t</i>. A process can obtain its session ID
    using <b>getsid</b>(2), and its process group ID using
  <b>getpgrp</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp">A child created by <b>fork</b>(2) inherits its parent's session ID
    and process group ID. A process's session ID and process group ID are
    preserved across an <b>execve</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp">Sessions and process groups are abstractions devised to support
    shell job control. A process group (sometimes called a "job") is a
    collection of processes that share the same process group ID; the shell
    creates a new process group for the process(es) used to execute single
    command or pipeline (e.g., the two processes created to execute the command
    "ls&nbsp;|&nbsp;wc" are placed in the same process group). A
    process's group membership can be set using <b>setpgid</b>(2). The process
    whose process ID is the same as its process group ID is the <i>process group
    leader</i> for that group.</p>
<p class="Pp">A session is a collection of processes that share the same session
    ID. All of the members of a process group also have the same session ID
    (i.e., all of the members of a process group always belong to the same
    session, so that sessions and process groups form a strict two-level
    hierarchy of processes.) A new session is created when a process calls
    <b>setsid</b>(2), which creates a new session whose session ID is the same
    as the PID of the process that called <b>setsid</b>(2). The creator of the
    session is called the <i>session leader</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">All of the processes in a session share a <i>controlling
    terminal</i>. The controlling terminal is established when the session
    leader first opens a terminal (unless the <b>O_NOCTTY</b> flag is specified
    when calling <b>open</b>(2)). A terminal may be the controlling terminal of
    at most one session.</p>
<p class="Pp">At most one of the jobs in a session may be the <i>foreground
    job</i>; other jobs in the session are <i>background jobs</i>. Only the
    foreground job may read from the terminal; when a process in the background
    attempts to read from the terminal, its process group is sent a
    <b>SIGTTIN</b> signal, which suspends the job. If the <b>TOSTOP</b> flag has
    been set for the terminal (see <b>termios</b>(3)), then only the foreground
    job may write to the terminal; writes from background jobs cause a
    <b>SIGTTOU</b> signal to be generated, which suspends the job. When terminal
    keys that generate a signal (such as the <i>interrupt</i> key, normally
    control-C) are pressed, the signal is sent to the processes in the
    foreground job.</p>
<p class="Pp">Various system calls and library functions may operate on all
    members of a process group, including <b>kill</b>(2), <b>killpg</b>(3),
    <b>getpriority</b>(2), <b>setpriority</b>(2), <b>ioprio_get</b>(2),
    <b>ioprio_set</b>(2), <b>waitid</b>(2), and <b>waitpid</b>(2). See also the
    discussion of the <b>F_GETOWN</b>, <b>F_GETOWN_EX</b>, <b>F_SETOWN</b>, and
    <b>F_SETOWN_EX</b> operations in <b>fcntl</b>(2).</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="User_and_group_identifiers"><a class="permalink" href="#User_and_group_identifiers">User
  and group identifiers</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Each process has various associated user and group IDs. These IDs
    are integers, respectively represented using the types <i>uid_t</i> and
    <i>gid_t</i> (defined in <i>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</i>).</p>
<p class="Pp">On Linux, each process has the following user and group
    identifiers:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>Real user ID and real group ID. These IDs determine who owns the process.
      A process can obtain its real user (group) ID using <b>getuid</b>(2)
      (<b>getgid</b>(2)).</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>Effective user ID and effective group ID. These IDs are used by the kernel
      to determine the permissions that the process will have when accessing
      shared resources such as message queues, shared memory, and semaphores. On
      most UNIX systems, these IDs also determine the permissions when accessing
      files. However, Linux uses the filesystem IDs described below for this
      task. A process can obtain its effective user (group) ID using
      <b>geteuid</b>(2) (<b>getegid</b>(2)).</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>Saved set-user-ID and saved set-group-ID. These IDs are used in
      set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs to save a copy of the corresponding
      effective IDs that were set when the program was executed (see
      <b>execve</b>(2)). A set-user-ID program can assume and drop privileges by
      switching its effective user ID back and forth between the values in its
      real user ID and saved set-user-ID. This switching is done via calls to
      <b>seteuid</b>(2), <b>setreuid</b>(2), or <b>setresuid</b>(2). A
      set-group-ID program performs the analogous tasks using <b>setegid</b>(2),
      <b>setregid</b>(2), or <b>setresgid</b>(2). A process can obtain its saved
      set-user-ID (set-group-ID) using <b>getresuid</b>(2)
      (<b>getresgid</b>(2)).</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>Filesystem user ID and filesystem group ID (Linux-specific). These IDs, in
      conjunction with the supplementary group IDs described below, are used to
      determine permissions for accessing files; see <b>path_resolution</b>(7)
      for details. Whenever a process's effective user (group) ID is changed,
      the kernel also automatically changes the filesystem user (group) ID to
      the same value. Consequently, the filesystem IDs normally have the same
      values as the corresponding effective ID, and the semantics for
      file-permission checks are thus the same on Linux as on other UNIX
      systems. The filesystem IDs can be made to differ from the effective IDs
      by calling <b>setfsuid</b>(2) and <b>setfsgid</b>(2).</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>Supplementary group IDs. This is a set of additional group IDs that are
      used for permission checks when accessing files and other shared
      resources. Before Linux 2.6.4, a process can be a member of up to 32
      supplementary groups; since Linux 2.6.4, a process can be a member of up
      to 65536 supplementary groups. The call <i>sysconf(_SC_NGROUPS_MAX)</i>
      can be used to determine the number of supplementary groups of which a
      process may be a member. A process can obtain its set of supplementary
      group IDs using <b>getgroups</b>(2).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">A child process created by <b>fork</b>(2) inherits copies of its
    parent's user and groups IDs. During an <b>execve</b>(2), a process's real
    user and group ID and supplementary group IDs are preserved; the effective
    and saved set IDs may be changed, as described in <b>execve</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp">Aside from the purposes noted above, a process's user IDs are also
    employed in a number of other contexts:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>when determining the permissions for sending signals (see
    <b>kill</b>(2));</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>when determining the permissions for setting process-scheduling parameters
      (nice value, real time scheduling policy and priority, CPU affinity, I/O
      priority) using <b>setpriority</b>(2), <b>sched_setaffinity</b>(2),
      <b>sched_setscheduler</b>(2), <b>sched_setparam</b>(2),
      <b>sched_setattr</b>(2), and <b>ioprio_set</b>(2);</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>when checking resource limits (see <b>getrlimit</b>(2));</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>when checking the limit on the number of inotify instances that the
      process may create (see <b>inotify</b>(7)).</dd>
</dl>

<p class="Pp">Any changes to a process's effective user (group) ID are
    automatically carried over to the process's filesystem user (group) ID.
    Changes to a process's effective user or group ID can also affect the
    process "dumpable" attribute, as described in <b>prctl</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp">Changes to process user and group IDs can affect the capabilities
    of the process, as described in <b>capabilities</b>(7).</p>

<p class="Pp">Process IDs, parent process IDs, process group IDs, and session
    IDs are specified in POSIX.1. The real, effective, and saved set user and
    groups IDs, and the supplementary group IDs, are specified in POSIX.1. The

<p class="Pp">Various fields in the <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/status</i> file show the
    process credentials described above. See <b>proc</b>(5) for further
    information.</p>
<p class="Pp">The POSIX threads specification requires that credentials are
    shared by all of the threads in a process. However, at the kernel level,
    Linux maintains separate user and group credentials for each thread. The
    NPTL threading implementation does some work to ensure that any change to
    user or group credentials (e.g., calls to <b>setuid</b>(2),
    <b>setresuid</b>(2)) is carried through to all of the POSIX threads in a
    process. See <b>nptl</b>(7) for further details.</p>
