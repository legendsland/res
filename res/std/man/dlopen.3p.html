<p class="Pp">The <i>dlopen</i>() function shall make the symbols (function
    identifiers and data object identifiers) in the executable object file
    specified by <i>file</i> available to the calling program.</p>
<p class="Pp">The class of executable object files eligible for this operation
    and the manner of their construction are implementation-defined, though
    typically such files are shared libraries or programs.</p>
<p class="Pp">Implementations may permit the construction of embedded
    dependencies in executable object files. In such cases, a <i>dlopen</i>()
    operation shall load those dependencies in addition to the executable object
    file specified by <i>file</i>. Implementations may also impose specific
    constraints on the construction of programs that can employ <i>dlopen</i>()
    and its related services.</p>
<p class="Pp">A successful <i>dlopen</i>() shall return a symbol table handle
    which the caller may use on subsequent calls to <i>dlsym</i>() and
    <i>dlclose</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">The value of this symbol table handle should not be interpreted in
    any way by the caller.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>file</i> argument is used to construct a pathname to the
    executable object file. If <i>file</i> contains a &lt;slash&gt; character,
    the <i>file</i> argument is used as the pathname for the file. Otherwise,
    <i>file</i> is used in an implementation-defined manner to yield a
  pathname.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>file</i> is a null pointer, <i>dlopen</i>() shall return a
    global symbol table handle for the currently running process image. This
    symbol table handle shall provide access to the symbols from an ordered set
    of executable object files consisting of the original program image file,
    any executable object files loaded at program start-up as specified by that
    process file (for example, shared libraries), and the set of executable
    object files loaded using <i>dlopen</i>() operations with the RTLD_GLOBAL
    flag. As the latter set of executable object files can change during
    execution, the set of symbols made available by this symbol table handle can
    also change dynamically.</p>
<p class="Pp">Only a single copy of an executable object file shall be brought
    into the address space, even if <i>dlopen</i>() is invoked multiple times in
    reference to the executable object file, and even if different pathnames are
    used to reference the executable object file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>mode</i> parameter describes how <i>dlopen</i>() shall
    operate upon <i>file</i> with respect to the processing of relocations and
    the scope of visibility of the symbols provided within <i>file</i>. When an
    executable object file is brought into the address space of a process, it
    may contain references to symbols whose addresses are not known until the
    executable object file is loaded.</p>
<p class="Pp">These references shall be relocated before the symbols can be
    accessed. The <i>mode</i> parameter governs when these relocations take
    place and may have the following values:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="RTLD_LAZY"><a class="permalink" href="#RTLD_LAZY">RTLD_LAZY</a></dt>
  <dd>Relocations shall be performed at an implementation-defined time, ranging
      from the time of the <i>dlopen</i>() call until the first reference to a
      given symbol occurs. Specifying RTLD_LAZY should improve performance on
      implementations supporting dynamic symbol binding since a process might
      not reference all of the symbols in an executable object file. And, for
      systems supporting dynamic symbol resolution for normal process execution,
      this behavior mimics the normal handling of process execution.</dd>
  <dt id="RTLD_NOW"><a class="permalink" href="#RTLD_NOW">RTLD_NOW</a></dt>
  <dd>All necessary relocations shall be performed when the executable object
      file is first loaded. This may waste some processing if relocations are
      performed for symbols that are never referenced. This behavior may be
      useful for applications that need to know that all symbols referenced
      during execution will be available before <i>dlopen</i>() returns.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Any executable object file loaded by <i>dlopen</i>() that requires
    relocations against global symbols can reference the symbols in the original
    process image file, any executable object files loaded at program start-up,
    from the initial process image itself, from any other executable object file
    included in the same <i>dlopen</i>() invocation, and any executable object
    files that were loaded in any <i>dlopen</i>() invocation and which specified
    the RTLD_GLOBAL flag. To determine the scope of visibility for the symbols
    loaded with a <i>dlopen</i>() invocation, the <i>mode</i> parameter should
    be a bitwise-inclusive OR with one of the following values:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="RTLD_GLOBAL"><a class="permalink" href="#RTLD_GLOBAL">RTLD_GLOBAL</a></dt>
  <dd>The executable object file's symbols shall be made available for
      relocation processing of any other executable object file. In addition,
      symbol lookup using <i>dlopen</i>(NULL,<i>mode</i>) and an associated
      <i>dlsym</i>() allows executable object files loaded with this mode to be
      searched.</dd>
  <dt id="RTLD_LOCAL"><a class="permalink" href="#RTLD_LOCAL">RTLD_LOCAL</a></dt>
  <dd>The executable object file's symbols shall not be made available for
      relocation processing of any other executable object file.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If neither RTLD_GLOBAL nor RTLD_LOCAL is specified, the default
    behavior is unspecified.</p>
<p class="Pp">If an executable object file is specified in multiple
    <i>dlopen</i>() invocations, <i>mode</i> is interpreted at each
  invocation.</p>
<p class="Pp">If RTLD_NOW has been specified, all relocations shall have been
    completed rendering further RTLD_NOW operations redundant and any further
    RTLD_LAZY operations irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Pp">If RTLD_GLOBAL has been specified, the executable object file
    shall maintain the RTLD_GLOBAL status regardless of any previous or future
    specification of RTLD_LOCAL, as long as the executable object file remains
    in the address space (see <i><i>dlclose</i>()</i>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Symbols introduced into the process image through calls to
    <i>dlopen</i>() may be used in relocation activities. Symbols so introduced
    may duplicate symbols already defined by the program or previous
    <i>dlopen</i>() operations. To resolve the ambiguities such a situation
    might present, the resolution of a symbol reference to symbol definition is
    based on a symbol resolution order. Two such resolution orders are defined:
    load order and dependency order. Load order establishes an ordering among
    symbol definitions, such that the first definition loaded (including
    definitions from the process image file and any dependent executable object
    files loaded with it) has priority over executable object files added later
    (by <i>dlopen</i>()). Load ordering is used in relocation processing.
    Dependency ordering uses a breadth-first order starting with a given
    executable object file, then all of its dependencies, then any dependents of
    those, iterating until all dependencies are satisfied. With the exception of
    the global symbol table handle obtained via a <i>dlopen</i>() operation with
    a null pointer as the <i>file</i> argument, dependency ordering is used by
    the <i>dlsym</i>() function. Load ordering is used in <i>dlsym</i>()
    operations upon the global symbol table handle.</p>
<p class="Pp">When an executable object file is first made accessible via
    <i>dlopen</i>(), it and its dependent executable object files are added in
    dependency order. Once all the executable object files are added,
    relocations are performed using load order. Note that if an executable
    object file or its dependencies had been previously loaded, the load and
    dependency orders may yield different resolutions.</p>
<p class="Pp">The symbols introduced by <i>dlopen</i>() operations and available
    through <i>dlsym</i>() are at a minimum those which are exported as
    identifiers of global scope by the executable object file. Typically, such
    identifiers shall be those that were specified in (for example) C source
    code as having <b>extern</b> linkage. The precise manner in which an
    implementation constructs the set of exported symbols for an executable
    object file is implementation-defined.</p>

<p class="Pp">Upon successful completion, <i>dlopen</i>() shall return a symbol
    table handle. If <i>file</i> cannot be found, cannot be opened for reading,
    is not of an appropriate executable object file format for processing by
    <i>dlopen</i>(), or if an error occurs during the process of loading
    <i>file</i> or relocating its symbolic references, <i>dlopen</i>() shall
    return a null pointer. More detailed diagnostic information shall be
    available through <i>dlerror</i>().</p>
