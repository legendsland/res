<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <i>shm_open</i>() function shall establish a connection
    between a shared memory object and a file descriptor. It shall create an
    open file description that refers to the shared memory object and a file
    descriptor that refers to that open file description. The file descriptor
    shall be allocated as described in <i>Section 2.14</i>, <i>File Descriptor
    Allocation</i>, and can be used by other functions to refer to that shared
    memory object. The <i>name</i> argument points to a string naming a shared
    memory object. It is unspecified whether the name appears in the file system
    and is visible to other functions that take pathnames as arguments. The
    <i>name</i> argument conforms to the construction rules for a pathname,
    except that the interpretation of &lt;slash&gt; characters other than the
    leading &lt;slash&gt; character in <i>name</i> is implementation-defined,
    and that the length limits for the <i>name</i> argument are
    implementation-defined and need not be the same as the pathname limits
    {PATH_MAX} and {NAME_MAX}. If <i>name</i> begins with the &lt;slash&gt;
    character, then processes calling <i>shm_open</i>() with the same value of
    <i>name</i> refer to the same shared memory object, as long as that name has
    not been removed. If <i>name</i> does not begin with the &lt;slash&gt;
    character, the effect is implementation-defined.</p>
<p class="Pp">If successful, <i>shm_open</i>() shall return a file descriptor
    for the shared memory object. The open file description is new, and
    therefore the file descriptor does not share it with any other processes. It
    is unspecified whether the file offset is set. The FD_CLOEXEC file
    descriptor flag associated with the new file descriptor is set.</p>
<p class="Pp">The file status flags and file access modes of the open file
    description are according to the value of <i>oflag</i>. The <i>oflag</i>
    argument is the bitwise-inclusive OR of the following flags defined in the
    <i>&lt;fcntl.h&gt;</i> header. Applications specify exactly one of the first
    two values (access modes) below in the value of <i>oflag</i>:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="O_RDONLY"><a class="permalink" href="#O_RDONLY">O_RDONLY</a></dt>
  <dd>Open for read access only.</dd>
  <dt id="O_RDWR"><a class="permalink" href="#O_RDWR">O_RDWR</a></dt>
  <dd>Open for read or write access.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Any combination of the remaining flags may be specified in the
    value of <i>oflag</i>:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="O_CREAT"><a class="permalink" href="#O_CREAT">O_CREAT</a></dt>
  <dd>If the shared memory object exists, this flag has no effect, except as
      noted under O_EXCL below. Otherwise, the shared memory object is created.
      The user ID of the shared memory object shall be set to the effective user
      ID of the process. The group ID of the shared memory object shall be set
      to the effective group ID of the process; however, if the <i>name</i>
      argument is visible in the file system, the group ID may be set to the
      group ID of the containing directory. The permission bits of the shared
      memory object shall be set to the value of the <i>mode</i> argument except
      those set in the file mode creation mask of the process. When bits in
      <i>mode</i> other than the file permission bits are set, the effect is
      unspecified. The <i>mode</i> argument does not affect whether the shared
      memory object is opened for reading, for writing, or for both. The shared
      memory object has a size of zero.</dd>
  <dt id="O_EXCL"><a class="permalink" href="#O_EXCL">O_EXCL</a></dt>
  <dd>If O_EXCL and O_CREAT are set, <i>shm_open</i>() fails if the shared
      memory object exists. The check for the existence of the shared memory
      object and the creation of the object if it does not exist is atomic with
      respect to other processes executing <i>shm_open</i>() naming the same
      shared memory object with O_EXCL and O_CREAT set. If O_EXCL is set and
      O_CREAT is not set, the result is undefined.</dd>
  <dt id="O_TRUNC"><a class="permalink" href="#O_TRUNC">O_TRUNC</a></dt>
  <dd>If the shared memory object exists, and it is successfully opened O_RDWR,
      the object shall be truncated to zero length and the mode and owner shall
      be unchanged by this function call. The result of using O_TRUNC with
      O_RDONLY is undefined.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">When a shared memory object is created, the state of the shared
    memory object, including all data associated with the shared memory object,
    persists until the shared memory object is unlinked and all other references
    are gone. It is unspecified whether the name and shared memory object state
    remain valid after a system reboot.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="permalink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When the Memory Mapped Files option is supported, the normal
    <i>open</i>() call is used to obtain a descriptor to a file to be mapped
    according to existing practice with <i>mmap</i>(). When the Shared Memory
    Objects option is supported, the <i>shm_open</i>() function shall obtain a
    descriptor to the shared memory object to be mapped.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is ample precedent for having a file descriptor represent
    several types of objects. In the POSIX.1‐1990 standard, a file
    descriptor can represent a file, a pipe, a FIFO, a tty, or a directory. Many
    implementations simply have an operations vector, which is indexed by the
    file descriptor type and does very different operations. Note that in some
    cases the file descriptor passed to generic operations on file descriptors
    is returned by <i>open</i>() or <i>creat</i>() and in some cases returned by
    alternate functions, such as <i>pipe</i>(). The latter technique is used by
    <i>shm_open</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that such shared memory objects can actually be implemented
    as mapped files. In both cases, the size can be set after the open using
    <i>ftruncate</i>(). The <i>shm_open</i>() function itself does not create a
    shared object of a specified size because this would duplicate an extant
    function that set the size of an object referenced by a file descriptor.</p>
<p class="Pp">On implementations where memory objects are implemented using the
    existing file system, the <i>shm_open</i>() function may be implemented
    using a macro that invokes <i>open</i>(), and the <i>shm_unlink</i>()
    function may be implemented using a macro that invokes <i>unlink</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">For implementations without a permanent file system, the
    definition of the name of the memory objects is allowed not to survive a
    system reboot. Note that this allows systems with a permanent file system to
    implement memory objects as data structures internal to the implementation
    as well.</p>
<p class="Pp">On implementations that choose to implement memory objects using
    memory directly, a <i>shm_open</i>() followed by an <i>ftruncate</i>() and
    <i>close</i>() can be used to preallocate a shared memory area and to set
    the size of that preallocation. This may be necessary for systems without
    virtual memory hardware support in order to ensure that the memory is
    contiguous.</p>
<p class="Pp">The set of valid open flags to <i>shm_open</i>() was restricted to
    O_RDONLY, O_RDWR, O_CREAT, and O_TRUNC because these could be easily
    implemented on most memory mapping systems. This volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017 is silent on the results if the implementation cannot
    supply the requested file access because of implementation-defined reasons,
    including hardware ones.</p>
<p class="Pp">The error conditions <b>[EACCES]</b> and <b>[ENOTSUP]</b> are
    provided to inform the application that the implementation cannot complete a
    request.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>[EACCES]</b> indicates for implementation-defined reasons,
    probably hardware-related, that the implementation cannot comply with a
    requested mode because it conflicts with another requested mode. An example
    might be that an application desires to open a memory object two times,
    mapping different areas with different access modes. If the implementation
    cannot map a single area into a process space in two places, which would be
    required if different access modes were required for the two areas, then the
    implementation may inform the application at the time of the second
  open.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>[ENOTSUP]</b> indicates for implementation-defined reasons,
    probably hardware-related, that the implementation cannot comply with a
    requested mode at all. An example would be that the hardware of the
    implementation cannot support write-only shared memory areas.</p>
<p class="Pp">On all implementations, it may be desirable to restrict the
    location of the memory objects to specific file systems for performance
    (such as a RAM disk) or implementation-defined reasons (shared memory
    supported directly only on certain file systems). The <i>shm_open</i>()
    function may be used to enforce these restrictions. There are a number of
    methods available to the application to determine an appropriate name of the
    file or the location of an appropriate directory. One way is from the
    environment via <i>getenv</i>(). Another would be from a configuration
  file.</p>
<p class="Pp">This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 specifies that memory objects
    have initial contents of zero when created. This is consistent with current
    behavior for both files and newly allocated memory. For those
    implementations that use physical memory, it would be possible that such
    implementations could simply use available memory and give it to the process
    uninitialized. This, however, is not consistent with standard behavior for
    the uninitialized data area, the stack, and of course, files. Finally, it is
    highly desirable to set the allocated memory to zero for security reasons.
    Thus, initializing memory objects to zero is required.</p>
