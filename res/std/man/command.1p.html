<h1 class="Sh" id="APPLICATION_USAGE"><a class="permalink" href="#APPLICATION_USAGE">APPLICATION
  USAGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The order for command search allows functions to override regular
    built-ins and path searches. This utility is necessary to allow functions
    that have the same name as a utility to call the utility (instead of a
    recursive call to the function).</p>
<p class="Pp">The system default path is available using <i>getconf</i>;
    however, since <i>getconf</i> may need to have the <i>PATH</i> set up before
    it can be called itself, the following can be used:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>command -p getconf PATH</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">There are some advantages to suppressing the special
    characteristics of special built-ins on occasion. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>command exec &gt; <i>unwritable-file</i></pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">does not cause a non-interactive script to abort, so that the
    output status can be checked by the script.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>command</i>, <i>env</i>, <i>nohup</i>, <i>time</i>, and
    <i>xargs</i> utilities have been specified to use exit code 127 if an error
    occurs so that applications can distinguish ``failure to find a utility''
    from ``invoked utility exited with an error indication''. The value 127 was
    chosen because it is not commonly used for other meanings; most utilities
    use small values for ``normal error conditions'' and the values above 128
    can be confused with termination due to receipt of a signal. The value 126
    was chosen in a similar manner to indicate that the utility could be found,
    but not invoked. Some scripts produce meaningful error messages
    differentiating the 126 and 127 cases. The distinction between exit codes
    126 and 127 is based on KornShell practice that uses 127 when all attempts
    to <i>exec</i> the utility fail with <b>[ENOENT]</b>, and uses 126 when any
    attempt to <i>exec</i> the utility fails for any other reason.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since the <b>-v</b> and <b>-V</b> options of <i>command</i>
    produce output in relation to the current shell execution environment,
    <i>command</i> is generally provided as a shell regular built-in. If it is
    called in a subshell or separate utility execution environment, such as one
    of the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>(PATH=foo command -v)
<br>
 nohup command -v</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">it does not necessarily produce correct results. For example, when
    called with <i>nohup</i> or an <i>exec</i> function, in a separate utility
    execution environment, most implementations are not able to identify
    aliases, functions, or special built-ins.</p>
<p class="Pp">Two types of regular built-ins could be encountered on a system
    and these are described separately by <i>command</i>. The description of
    command search in <i>Section 2.9.1.1</i>, <i>Command Search and
    Execution</i> allows for a standard utility to be implemented as a regular
    built-in as long as it is found in the appropriate place in a <i>PATH</i>
    search. So, for example, <i>command</i> <b>-v</b> <i>true</i> might yield
    <b>/bin/true</b> or some similar pathname. Other implementation-defined
    utilities that are not defined by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 might
    exist only as built-ins and have no pathname associated with them. These
    produce output identified as (regular) built-ins. Applications encountering
    these are not able to count on <i>exec</i>ing them, using them with
    <i>nohup</i>, overriding them with a different <i>PATH</i>, and so on.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd>Make a version of <i>cd</i> that always prints out the new working

<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>cd() {
<br>
    command cd "$@" &gt;/dev/null
<br>
    pwd
}</pre>
</div>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> 2.</dt>
  <dd>Start off a ``secure shell script'' in which the script avoids being
      spoofed by its parent:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>IFS='
'
#    The preceding value should be &lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;newline&gt;.
#    Set IFS to its default value.</pre>
<pre>\unalias -a
#    Unset all possible aliases.
#    Note that unalias is escaped to prevent an alias
#    being used for unalias.</pre>
<pre>unset -f command
#    Ensure command is not a user function.</pre>
<pre>PATH="$(command -p getconf PATH):$PATH"
#    Put on a reliable PATH prefix.</pre>
<pre>#    ...</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">At this point, given correct permissions on the directories called
    by <i>PATH</i>, the script has the ability to ensure that any utility it
    calls is the intended one. It is being very cautious because it assumes that
    implementation extensions may be present that would allow user functions to
    exist when it is invoked; this capability is not specified by this volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017, but it is not prohibited as an extension. For example,
    the <i>ENV</i> variable precedes the invocation of the script with a user
    start-up script. Such a script could define functions to spoof the
    application.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="permalink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Since <i>command</i> is a regular built-in utility it is always
    found prior to the <i>PATH</i> search.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is nothing in the description of <i>command</i> that implies
    the command line is parsed any differently from that of any other simple
    command. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>command a | b ; c</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">is not parsed in any special way that causes <b>'|'</b> or
    <b>';'</b> to be treated other than a pipe operator or &lt;semicolon&gt; or
    that prevents function lookup on <b>b</b> or <b>c</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>command</i> utility is somewhat similar to the Eighth
    Edition shell <i>builtin</i> command, but since <i>command</i> also goes to
    the file system to search for utilities, the name <i>builtin</i> would not
    be intuitive.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>command</i> utility is most likely to be provided as a
    regular built-in. It is not listed as a special built-in for the following
    reasons:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>The removal of exportable functions made the special precedence of a
      special built-in unnecessary.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>A special built-in has special properties (see <i>Section 2.14</i>,
      <i>Special Built-In Utilities</i>) that were inappropriate for invoking
      other utilities. For example, two commands such as:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>date &gt; <i>unwritable-file</i></pre>
<pre>command date &gt; <i>unwritable-file</i></pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">would have entirely different results; in a non-interactive
    script, the former would continue to execute the next command, the latter
    would abort. Introducing this semantic difference along with suppressing
    functions was seen to be non-intuitive.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-p</b> option is present because it is useful to be able to
    ensure a safe path search that finds all the standard utilities. This search
    might not be identical to the one that occurs through one of the <i>exec</i>
    functions (as defined in the System Interfaces volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017) when <i>PATH</i> is unset. At the very least, this
    feature is required to allow the script to access the correct version of
    <i>getconf</i> so that the value of the default path can be accurately
    retrieved.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>command</i> <b>-v</b> and <b>-V</b> options were added to
    satisfy requirements from users that are currently accomplished by three
    different historical utilities: <i>type</i> in the System V shell,
    <i>whence</i> in the KornShell, and <i>which</i> in the C shell. Since there
    is no historical agreement on how and what to accomplish here, the POSIX
    <i>command</i> utility was enhanced and the historical utilities were left
    unmodified. The C shell <i>which</i> merely conducts a path search. The
    KornShell <i>whence</i> is more elaborate—in addition to the
    categories required by POSIX, it also reports on tracked aliases, exported
    aliases, and undefined functions.</p>
<p class="Pp">The output format of <b>-V</b> was left mostly unspecified because
    human users are its only audience. Applications should not be written to
    care about this information; they can use the output of <b>-v</b> to
    differentiate between various types of commands, but the additional
    information that may be emitted by the more verbose <b>-V</b> is not needed
    and should not be arbitrarily constrained in its verbosity or localization
    for application parsing reasons.</p>
