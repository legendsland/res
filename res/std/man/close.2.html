<p class="Pp"><b>close</b>() closes a file descriptor, so that it no longer
    refers to any file and may be reused. Any record locks (see <b>fcntl</b>(2))
    held on the file it was associated with, and owned by the process, are
    removed (regardless of the file descriptor that was used to obtain the
    lock).</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>fd</i> is the last file descriptor referring to the
    underlying open file description (see <b>open</b>(2)), the resources
    associated with the open file description are freed; if the file descriptor
    was the last reference to a file which has been removed using
    <b>unlink</b>(2), the file is deleted.</p>

<p class="Pp">A successful close does not guarantee that the data has been
    successfully saved to disk, as the kernel uses the buffer cache to defer
    writes. Typically, filesystems do not flush buffers when a file is closed.
    If you need to be sure that the data is physically stored on the underlying
    disk, use <b>fsync</b>(2). (It will depend on the disk hardware at this
    point.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The close-on-exec file descriptor flag can be used to ensure that
    a file descriptor is automatically closed upon a successful
    <b>execve</b>(2); see <b>fcntl</b>(2) for details.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Multithreaded_processes_and_close()"><a class="permalink" href="#Multithreaded_processes_and_close()">Multithreaded
  processes and close()</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">It is probably unwise to close file descriptors while they may be
    in use by system calls in other threads in the same process. Since a file
    descriptor may be reused, there are some obscure race conditions that may
    cause unintended side effects.</p>
<p class="Pp">Furthermore, consider the following scenario where two threads are
    performing operations on the same file descriptor:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>(1)</dt>
  <dd>One thread is blocked in an I/O system call on the file descriptor. For
      example, it is trying to <b>write</b>(2) to a pipe that is already full,
      or trying to <b>read</b>(2) from a stream socket which currently has no
      available data.</dd>
  <dt>(2)</dt>
  <dd>Another thread closes the file descriptor.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The behavior in this situation varies across systems. On some
    systems, when the file descriptor is closed, the blocking system call
    returns immediately with an error.</p>
<p class="Pp">On Linux (and possibly some other systems), the behavior is
    different: the blocking I/O system call holds a reference to the underlying
    open file description, and this reference keeps the description open until
    the I/O system call completes. (See <b>open</b>(2) for a discussion of open
    file descriptions.) Thus, the blocking system call in the first thread may
    successfully complete after the <b>close</b>() in the second thread.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Dealing_with_error_returns_from_close()"><a class="permalink" href="#Dealing_with_error_returns_from_close()">Dealing
  with error returns from close()</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A careful programmer will check the return value of
    <b>close</b>(), since it is quite possible that errors on a previous
    <b>write</b>(2) operation are reported only on the final <b>close</b>() that
    releases the open file description. Failing to check the return value when
    closing a file may lead to <i>silent</i> loss of data. This can especially
    be observed with NFS and with disk quota.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note, however, that a failure return should be used only for
    diagnostic purposes (i.e., a warning to the application that there may still
    be I/O pending or there may have been failed I/O) or remedial purposes
    (e.g., writing the file once more or creating a backup).</p>
<p class="Pp">Retrying the <b>close</b>() after a failure return is the wrong
    thing to do, since this may cause a reused file descriptor from another
    thread to be closed. This can occur because the Linux kernel <i>always</i>
    releases the file descriptor early in the close operation, freeing it for
    reuse; the steps that may return an error, such as flushing data to the
    filesystem or device, occur only later in the close operation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many other implementations similarly always close the file
    descriptor (except in the case of <b>EBADF</b>, meaning that the file
    descriptor was invalid) even if they subsequently report an error on return
    from <b>close</b>(). POSIX.1 is currently silent on this point, but there
    are plans to mandate this behavior in the next major release of the
    standard.</p>
<p class="Pp">A careful programmer who wants to know about I/O errors may
    precede <b>close</b>() with a call to <b>fsync</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>EINTR</b> error is a somewhat special case. Regarding the
    <b>EINTR</b> error, POSIX.1-2008 says:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If <b>close</b>() is interrupted by a signal that is to
  be caught, it shall return -1 with <i>errno</i> set to <b>EINTR</b> and the
  state of <i>fildes</i> is unspecified.</div>
<p class="Pp">This permits the behavior that occurs on Linux and many other
    implementations, where, as with other errors that may be reported by
    <b>close</b>(), the file descriptor is guaranteed to be closed. However, it
    also permits another possibility: that the implementation returns an
    <b>EINTR</b> error and keeps the file descriptor open. (According to its
    documentation, HP-UX's <b>close</b>() does this.) The caller must then once
    more use <b>close</b>() to close the file descriptor, to avoid file
    descriptor leaks. This divergence in implementation behaviors provides a
    difficult hurdle for portable applications, since on many implementations,
    <b>close</b>() must not be called again after an <b>EINTR</b> error, and on
    at least one, <b>close</b>() must be called again. There are plans to
    address this conundrum for the next major release of the POSIX.1
  standard.</p>
