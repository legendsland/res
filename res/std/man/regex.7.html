<p class="Pp">regex - POSIX.2 regular expressions</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Regular expressions ("RE"s), as defined in POSIX.2, come
    in two forms: modern REs (roughly those of <i>egrep</i>; POSIX.2 calls these
    "extended" REs) and obsolete REs (roughly those of <b>ed</b>(1);
    POSIX.2 "basic" REs). Obsolete REs mostly exist for backward
    compatibility in some old programs; they will be discussed at the end.
    POSIX.2 leaves some aspects of RE syntax and semantics open; "(!)"
    marks decisions on these aspects that may not be fully portable to other
    POSIX.2 implementations.</p>
<p class="Pp">A (modern) RE is one(!) or more nonempty(!) <i>branches</i>,
    separated by '|'. It matches anything that matches one of the branches.</p>
<p class="Pp">A branch is one(!) or more <i>pieces</i>, concatenated. It matches
    a match for the first, followed by a match for the second, and so on.</p>
<p class="Pp">A piece is an <i>atom</i> possibly followed by a single(!) '*',
    '+', '?', or <i>bound</i>. An atom followed by '*' matches a sequence of 0
    or more matches of the atom. An atom followed by '+' matches a sequence of 1
    or more matches of the atom. An atom followed by '?' matches a sequence of 0
    or 1 matches of the atom.</p>
<p class="Pp">A <i>bound</i> is '{' followed by an unsigned decimal integer,
    possibly followed by ',' possibly followed by another unsigned decimal
    integer, always followed by '}'. The integers must lie between 0 and
    <b>RE_DUP_MAX</b> (255(!)) inclusive, and if there are two of them, the
    first may not exceed the second. An atom followed by a bound containing one
    integer <i>i</i> and no comma matches a sequence of exactly <i>i</i> matches
    of the atom. An atom followed by a bound containing one integer <i>i</i> and
    a comma matches a sequence of <i>i</i> or more matches of the atom. An atom
    followed by a bound containing two integers <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> matches a
    sequence of <i>i</i> through <i>j</i> (inclusive) matches of the atom.</p>
<p class="Pp">An atom is a regular expression enclosed in "<i>()</i>"
    (matching a match for the regular expression), an empty set of
    "<i>()</i>" (matching the null string)(!), a <i>bracket
    expression</i> (see below), '.' (matching any single character), '^'
    (matching the null string at the beginning of a line), '$' (matching the
    null string at the end of a line), a '\' followed by one of the characters
    "<i>^.[$()|*+?{\</i>" (matching that character taken as an
    ordinary character), a '\' followed by any other character(!) (matching that
    character taken as an ordinary character, as if the '\' had not been
    present(!)), or a single character with no other significance (matching that
    character). A '{' followed by a character other than a digit is an ordinary
    character, not the beginning of a bound(!). It is illegal to end an RE with
    '\'.</p>
<p class="Pp">A <i>bracket expression</i> is a list of characters enclosed in
    "<i>[]</i>". It normally matches any single character from the
    list (but see below). If the list begins with '^', it matches any single
    character (but see below) <i>not</i> from the rest of the list. If two
    characters in the list are separated by '-', this is shorthand for the full
    <i>range</i> of characters between those two (inclusive) in the collating
    sequence, for example, "<i>[0-9]</i>" in ASCII matches any decimal
    digit. It is illegal(!) for two ranges to share an endpoint, for example,
    "<i>a-c-e</i>". Ranges are very collating-sequence-dependent, and
    portable programs should avoid relying on them.</p>
<p class="Pp">To include a literal ']' in the list, make it the first character
    (following a possible '^'). To include a literal '-', make it the first or
    last character, or the second endpoint of a range. To use a literal '-' as
    the first endpoint of a range, enclose it in "<i>[.</i>" and
    "<i>.]</i>" to make it a collating element (see below). With the
    exception of these and some combinations using '[' (see next paragraphs),
    all other special characters, including '\', lose their special significance
    within a bracket expression.</p>
<p class="Pp">Within a bracket expression, a collating element (a character, a
    multicharacter sequence that collates as if it were a single character, or a
    collating-sequence name for either) enclosed in "<i>[.</i>" and
    "<i>.]</i>" stands for the sequence of characters of that
    collating element. The sequence is a single element of the bracket
    expression's list. A bracket expression containing a multicharacter
    collating element can thus match more than one character, for example, if
    the collating sequence includes a "ch" collating element, then the
    RE "<i>[[.ch.]]*c</i>" matches the first five characters of
    "chchcc".</p>
<p class="Pp">Within a bracket expression, a collating element enclosed in
    "<i>[=</i>" and "<i>=]</i>" is an equivalence class,
    standing for the sequences of characters of all collating elements
    equivalent to that one, including itself. (If there are no other equivalent
    collating elements, the treatment is as if the enclosing delimiters were
    "<i>[.</i>" and "<i>.]</i>".) For example, if o and
    ô are the members of an equivalence class, then
    "<i>[[=o=]]</i>", "<i>[[=ô=]]</i>", and
    "<i>[oô]</i>" are all synonymous. An equivalence class may
    not(!) be an endpoint of a range.</p>
<p class="Pp">Within a bracket expression, the name of a <i>character class</i>
    enclosed in "<i>[:</i>" and "<i>:]</i>" stands for the
    list of all characters belonging to that class. Standard character class
    names are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<table class="tbl">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>alnum</td>
    <td>digit</td>
    <td>punct</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>alpha</td>
    <td>graph</td>
    <td>space</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>blank</td>
    <td>lower</td>
    <td>upper</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cntrl</td>
    <td>print</td>
    <td>xdigit</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p class="Pp">These stand for the character classes defined in <b>wctype</b>(3).
    A locale may provide others. A character class may not be used as an
    endpoint of a range.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the event that an RE could match more than one substring of a
    given string, the RE matches the one starting earliest in the string. If the
    RE could match more than one substring starting at that point, it matches
    the longest. Subexpressions also match the longest possible substrings,
    subject to the constraint that the whole match be as long as possible, with
    subexpressions starting earlier in the RE taking priority over ones starting
    later. Note that higher-level subexpressions thus take priority over their
    lower-level component subexpressions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Match lengths are measured in characters, not collating elements.
    A null string is considered longer than no match at all. For example,
    "<i>bb*</i>" matches the three middle characters of
    "abbbc", "<i>(wee|week)(knights|nights)</i>" matches all
    ten characters of "weeknights", when "<i>(.*).*</i>" is
    matched against "abc" the parenthesized subexpression matches all
    three characters, and when "<i>(a*)*</i>" is matched against
    "bc" both the whole RE and the parenthesized subexpression match
    the null string.</p>
<p class="Pp">If case-independent matching is specified, the effect is much as
    if all case distinctions had vanished from the alphabet. When an alphabetic
    that exists in multiple cases appears as an ordinary character outside a
    bracket expression, it is effectively transformed into a bracket expression
    containing both cases, for example, 'x' becomes "<i>[xX]</i>".
    When it appears inside a bracket expression, all case counterparts of it are
    added to the bracket expression, so that, for example,
    "<i>[x]</i>" becomes "<i>[xX]</i>" and
    "<i>[^x]</i>" becomes "<i>[^xX]</i>".</p>
<p class="Pp">No particular limit is imposed on the length of REs(!). Programs
    intended to be portable should not employ REs longer than 256 bytes, as an
    implementation can refuse to accept such REs and remain POSIX-compliant.</p>
<p class="Pp">Obsolete ("basic") regular expressions differ in several
    respects. '|', '+', and '?' are ordinary characters and there is no
    equivalent for their functionality. The delimiters for bounds are
    "<i>\{</i>" and "<i>\}</i>", with '{' and '}' by
    themselves ordinary characters. The parentheses for nested subexpressions
    are "<i>\(</i>" and "<i>\)</i>", with '(' and ')' by
    themselves ordinary characters. '^' is an ordinary character except at the
    beginning of the RE or(!) the beginning of a parenthesized subexpression,
    '$' is an ordinary character except at the end of the RE or(!) the end of a
    parenthesized subexpression, and '*' is an ordinary character if it appears
    at the beginning of the RE or the beginning of a parenthesized subexpression
    (after a possible leading '^').</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, there is one new type of atom, a <i>back reference</i>:
    '\' followed by a nonzero decimal digit <i>d</i> matches the same sequence
    of characters matched by the <i>d</i>th parenthesized subexpression
    (numbering subexpressions by the positions of their opening parentheses,
    left to right), so that, for example, "<i>\([bc]\)\1</i>" matches
    "bb" or "cc" but not "bc".</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Having two kinds of REs is a botch.</p>
<p class="Pp">The current POSIX.2 spec says that ')' is an ordinary character in
    the absence of an unmatched '('; this was an unintentional result of a
    wording error, and change is likely. Avoid relying on it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Back references are a dreadful botch, posing major problems for
    efficient implementations. They are also somewhat vaguely defined (does
    "<i>a\(\(b\)*\2\)*d</i>" match "abbbd"?). Avoid using
    them.</p>
<p class="Pp">POSIX.2's specification of case-independent matching is vague. The
    "one case implies all cases" definition given above is current
    consensus among implementors as to the right interpretation.</p>
