<p class="Pp">The <i>fort77</i> utility is the interface to the FORTRAN
    compilation system; it shall accept the full FORTRAN-77 language defined by
    the ANSI&nbsp;X3.9‐1978 standard. The system conceptually consists
    of a compiler and link editor. The files referenced by <i>operand</i>s are
    compiled and linked to produce an executable file. It is unspecified whether
    the linking occurs entirely within the operation of <i>fort77</i>; some
    implementations may produce objects that are not fully resolved until the
    file is executed.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>-c</b> option is present, for all pathname operands of

<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">

</div>
<p class="Pp">shall be created or overwritten as the result of successful
    compilation. If the <b>-c</b> option is not specified, it is unspecified
    whether such <b>.o</b> files are created or deleted for the
    <i>file</i><b>.f</b> operands.</p>
<p class="Pp">If there are no options that prevent link editing (such as
    <b>-c</b>) and all operands compile and link without error, the resulting
    executable file shall be written into the file named by the <b>-o</b> option
    (if present) or to the file <b>a.out</b>. The executable file shall be
    created as specified in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017,

<h1 class="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="permalink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The name of this utility was chosen as <i>fort77</i> to parallel
    the renaming of the C compiler. The name <i>f77</i> was not chosen to avoid
    problems with historical implementations. The ANSI&nbsp;X3.9‐1978
    standard was selected as a normative reference because the ISO/IEC version
    of FORTRAN-77 has been superseded by the ISO/IEC&nbsp;1539:1991
  standard.</p>
<p class="Pp">The file inclusion and symbol definition <b>#define</b> mechanisms
    used by the <i>c99</i> utility were not included in this volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017—even though they are commonly
    implemented—since there is no requirement that the FORTRAN compiler
    use the C preprocessor.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-onetrip</b> option was not included in this volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017, even though many historical compilers support it,
    because it is derived from FORTRAN-66; it is an anachronism that should not
    be perpetuated.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some implementations produce compilation listings. This aspect of
    FORTRAN has been left unspecified because there was controversy concerning
    the various methods proposed for implementing it: a <b>-V</b> option
    overlapped with historical vendor practice and a naming convention of
    creating files with <b>.l</b> suffixes collided with historical <i>lex</i>
    file naming practice.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is no <b>-I</b> option in this version of this volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017 to specify a directory for file inclusion. An INCLUDE
    directive has been a part of the Fortran-90 discussions, but an interface
    supporting that standard is not in the current scope.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is noted that many FORTRAN compilers produce an object module
    even when compilation errors occur; during a subsequent compilation, the
    compiler may patch the object module rather than recompiling all the code.
    Consequently, it is left to the implementor whether or not an object file is
    created.</p>
<p class="Pp">A reference to MIL-STD-1753 was removed from an early proposal in
    response to a request from the POSIX FORTRAN-binding standard developers. It
    was not the intention of the standard developers to require certification of
    the FORTRAN compiler, and IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.9‐1992 does not
    specify the military standard or any special preprocessing requirements.
    Furthermore, use of that document would have been inappropriate for an
    international standard.</p>
<p class="Pp">The specification of optimization has been subject to changes
    through early proposals. At one time, <b>-O</b> and <b>-N</b> were Booleans:
    optimize and do not optimize (with an unspecified default). Some historical
    practice led this to be changed to:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="O~2"><a class="permalink" href="#O~2"><b>-O</b>&nbsp;0</a></dt>
  <dd>No optimization.</dd>
  <dt id="O~3"><a class="permalink" href="#O~3"><b>-O</b>&nbsp;1</a></dt>
  <dd>Some level of optimization.</dd>
  <dt id="O~4"><a class="permalink" href="#O~4"><b>-O&nbsp;</b><i>n</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Other, unspecified levels of optimization.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">It is not always clear whether ``good code generation'' is the
    same thing as optimization. Simple optimizations of local actions do not
    usually affect the semantics of a program. The <b>-O</b> 0 option has been
    included to accommodate the very particular nature of scientific
    calculations in a highly optimized environment; compilers make errors. Some
    degree of optimization is expected, even if it is not documented here, and
    the ability to shut it off completely could be important when porting an
    application. An implementation may treat <b>-O</b> 0 as ``do less than
    normal'' if it wishes, but this is only meaningful if any of the operations
    it performs can affect the semantics of a program. It is highly dependent on
    the implementation whether doing less than normal is logical. It is not the
    intent of the <b>-O</b> 0 option to ask for inefficient code generation, but
    rather to assure that any semantically visible optimization is
  suppressed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The specification of standard library access is consistent with
    the C compiler specification. Implementations are not required to have
    <b>/usr/lib/libf.a</b>, as many historical implementations do, but if not
    they are required to recognize <b>f</b> as a token.</p>
<p class="Pp">External symbol size limits are in normative text; conforming
    applications need to know these limits. However, the minimum maximum symbol
    length should be taken as a constraint on a conforming application, not on
    an implementation, and consequently the action taken for a symbol exceeding
    the limit is unspecified. The minimum size for the external symbol table was
    added for similar reasons.</p>
<p class="Pp">The CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS section clearly specifies the behavior
    of the compiler when compilation or link-edit errors occur. The behavior of
    several historical implementations was examined, and the choice was made to
    be silent on the status of the executable, or <b>a.out</b>, file in the face
    of compiler or linker errors. If a linker writes the executable file, then
    links it on disk with <i>lseek</i>()s and <i>write</i>()s, the partially
    linked executable file can be left on disk and its execute bits turned off
    if the link edit fails. However, if the linker links the image in memory
    before writing the file to disk, it need not touch the executable file (if
    it already exists) because the link edit fails. Since both approaches are
    historical practice, a conforming application shall rely on the exit status
    of <i>fort77</i>, rather than on the existence or mode of the executable
    file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-g</b> and <b>-s</b> options are not specified as
    mutually-exclusive. Historically, these two options have been
    mutually-exclusive, but because both are so loosely specified, it seemed
    appropriate to leave their interaction unspecified.</p>
<p class="Pp">The requirement that conforming applications specify compiler
    options separately is to reserve the multi-character option name space for
    vendor-specific compiler options, which are known to exist in many
    historical implementations. Implementations are not required to recognize,
    for example, <b>-gc</b> as if it were <b>-g</b> <b>-c</b>; nor are they
    forbidden from doing so. The SYNOPSIS shows all of the options separately to
    highlight this requirement on applications.</p>
<p class="Pp">Echoing filenames to standard error is considered a diagnostic
    message because it would otherwise be difficult to associate an error
    message with the erring file. They are described with ``may'' to allow
    implementations to use other methods of identifying files and to parallel
    the description in <i>c99</i>.</p>

    compiler.</p>
