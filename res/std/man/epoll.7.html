<p class="Pp">The <b>epoll</b> API performs a similar task to <b>poll</b>(2):
    monitoring multiple file descriptors to see if I/O is possible on any of
    them. The <b>epoll</b> API can be used either as an edge-triggered or a
    level-triggered interface and scales well to large numbers of watched file
    descriptors.</p>
<p class="Pp">The central concept of the <b>epoll</b> API is the <b>epoll</b>
    <i>instance</i>, an in-kernel data structure which, from a user-space
    perspective, can be considered as a container for two lists:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>The <i>interest</i> list (sometimes also called the <b>epoll</b> set): the
      set of file descriptors that the process has registered an interest in
      monitoring.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>The <i>ready</i> list: the set of file descriptors that are
      "ready" for I/O. The ready list is a subset of (or, more
      precisely, a set of references to) the file descriptors in the interest
      list. The ready list is dynamically populated by the kernel as a result of
      I/O activity on those file descriptors.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The following system calls are provided to create and manage an
    <b>epoll</b> instance:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd><b>epoll_create</b>(2) creates a new <b>epoll</b> instance and returns a
      file descriptor referring to that instance. (The more recent
      <b>epoll_create1</b>(2) extends the functionality of
      <b>epoll_create</b>(2).)</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>Interest in particular file descriptors is then registered via
      <b>epoll_ctl</b>(2), which adds items to the interest list of the
      <b>epoll</b> instance.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd><b>epoll_wait</b>(2) waits for I/O events, blocking the calling thread if
      no events are currently available. (This system call can be thought of as
      fetching items from the ready list of the <b>epoll</b> instance.)</dd>
</dl>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Level-triggered_and_edge-triggered"><a class="permalink" href="#Level-triggered_and_edge-triggered">Level-triggered
  and edge-triggered</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <b>epoll</b> event distribution interface is able to behave
    both as edge-triggered (ET) and as level-triggered (LT). The difference
    between the two mechanisms can be described as follows. Suppose that this
    scenario happens:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>(1)</dt>
  <dd>The file descriptor that represents the read side of a pipe (<i>rfd</i>)
      is registered on the <b>epoll</b> instance.</dd>
  <dt>(2)</dt>
  <dd>A pipe writer writes 2&nbsp;kB of data on the write side of the
    pipe.</dd>
  <dt>(3)</dt>
  <dd>A call to <b>epoll_wait</b>(2) is done that will return <i>rfd</i> as a
      ready file descriptor.</dd>
  <dt>(4)</dt>
  <dd>The pipe reader reads 1&nbsp;kB of data from <i>rfd</i>.</dd>
  <dt>(5)</dt>
  <dd>A call to <b>epoll_wait</b>(2) is done.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>rfd</i> file descriptor has been added to the
    <b>epoll</b> interface using the <b>EPOLLET</b> (edge-triggered) flag, the
    call to <b>epoll_wait</b>(2) done in step <b>5</b> will probably hang
    despite the available data still present in the file input buffer; meanwhile
    the remote peer might be expecting a response based on the data it already
    sent. The reason for this is that edge-triggered mode delivers events only
    when changes occur on the monitored file descriptor. So, in step <b>5</b>
    the caller might end up waiting for some data that is already present inside
    the input buffer. In the above example, an event on <i>rfd</i> will be
    generated because of the write done in <b>2</b> and the event is consumed in
    <b>3</b>. Since the read operation done in <b>4</b> does not consume the
    whole buffer data, the call to <b>epoll_wait</b>(2) done in step <b>5</b>
    might block indefinitely.</p>
<p class="Pp">An application that employs the <b>EPOLLET</b> flag should use
    nonblocking file descriptors to avoid having a blocking read or write starve
    a task that is handling multiple file descriptors. The suggested way to use
    <b>epoll</b> as an edge-triggered (<b>EPOLLET</b>) interface is as
  follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>(1)</dt>
  <dd>with nonblocking file descriptors; and</dd>
  <dt>(2)</dt>
  <dd>by waiting for an event only after <b>read</b>(2) or <b>write</b>(2)
      return <b>EAGAIN</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">By contrast, when used as a level-triggered interface (the
    default, when <b>EPOLLET</b> is not specified), <b>epoll</b> is simply a
    faster <b>poll</b>(2), and can be used wherever the latter is used since it
    shares the same semantics.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since even with edge-triggered <b>epoll</b>, multiple events can
    be generated upon receipt of multiple chunks of data, the caller has the
    option to specify the <b>EPOLLONESHOT</b> flag, to tell <b>epoll</b> to
    disable the associated file descriptor after the receipt of an event with
    <b>epoll_wait</b>(2). When the <b>EPOLLONESHOT</b> flag is specified, it is
    the caller's responsibility to rearm the file descriptor using
    <b>epoll_ctl</b>(2) with <b>EPOLL_CTL_MOD</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If multiple threads (or processes, if child processes have
    inherited the <b>epoll</b> file descriptor across <b>fork</b>(2)) are
    blocked in <b>epoll_wait</b>(2) waiting on the same epoll file descriptor
    and a file descriptor in the interest list that is marked for edge-triggered
    (<b>EPOLLET</b>) notification becomes ready, just one of the threads (or
    processes) is awoken from <b>epoll_wait</b>(2). This provides a useful
    optimization for avoiding "thundering herd" wake-ups in some
    scenarios.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Interaction_with_autosleep"><a class="permalink" href="#Interaction_with_autosleep">Interaction
  with autosleep</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If the system is in <b>autosleep</b> mode via
    <i>/sys/power/autosleep</i> and an event happens which wakes the device from
    sleep, the device driver will keep the device awake only until that event is
    queued. To keep the device awake until the event has been processed, it is
    necessary to use the <b>epoll_ctl</b>(2) <b>EPOLLWAKEUP</b> flag.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the <b>EPOLLWAKEUP</b> flag is set in the <b>events</b> field
    for a <i>struct epoll_event</i>, the system will be kept awake from the
    moment the event is queued, through the <b>epoll_wait</b>(2) call which
    returns the event until the subsequent <b>epoll_wait</b>(2) call. If the
    event should keep the system awake beyond that time, then a separate
    <i>wake_lock</i> should be taken before the second <b>epoll_wait</b>(2)
    call.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="/proc_interfaces"><a class="permalink" href="#/proc_interfaces">/proc
  interfaces</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The following interfaces can be used to limit the amount of kernel
    memory consumed by epoll:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>/proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_watches</i> (since Linux 2.6.28)</dt>
  <dd>This specifies a limit on the total number of file descriptors that a user
      can register across all epoll instances on the system. The limit is per
      real user ID. Each registered file descriptor costs roughly 90 bytes on a
      32-bit kernel, and roughly 160 bytes on a 64-bit kernel. Currently, the
      default value for <i>max_user_watches</i> is 1/25 (4%) of the available
      low memory, divided by the registration cost in bytes.</dd>
</dl>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Example_for_suggested_usage"><a class="permalink" href="#Example_for_suggested_usage">Example
  for suggested usage</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">While the usage of <b>epoll</b> when employed as a level-triggered
    interface does have the same semantics as <b>poll</b>(2), the edge-triggered
    usage requires more clarification to avoid stalls in the application event
    loop. In this example, listener is a nonblocking socket on which
    <b>listen</b>(2) has been called. The function <i>do_use_fd()</i> uses the
    new ready file descriptor until <b>EAGAIN</b> is returned by either
    <b>read</b>(2) or <b>write</b>(2). An event-driven state machine application
    should, after having received <b>EAGAIN</b>, record its current state so
    that at the next call to <i>do_use_fd()</i> it will continue to
    <b>read</b>(2) or <b>write</b>(2) from where it stopped before.</p>

<p class="Pp">When used as an edge-triggered interface, for performance reasons,
    it is possible to add the file descriptor inside the <b>epoll</b> interface
    (<b>EPOLL_CTL_ADD</b>) once by specifying (<b>EPOLLIN</b>|<b>EPOLLOUT</b>).
    This allows you to avoid continuously switching between <b>EPOLLIN</b> and

  <dt>•</dt>

  <dd>What happens if you register the same file descriptor on an <b>epoll</b>
      instance twice?</dd>

  <dd>You will probably get <b>EEXIST</b>. However, it is possible to add a

      file descriptor to the same <b>epoll</b> instance. This can be a useful
      technique for filtering events, if the duplicate file descriptors are
      registered with different <i>events</i> masks.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>Can two <b>epoll</b> instances wait for the same file descriptor? If so,
      are events reported to both <b>epoll</b> file descriptors?</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Yes, and events would be reported to both. However, careful programming
      may be needed to do this correctly.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>Is the <b>epoll</b> file descriptor itself poll/epoll/selectable?</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Yes. If an <b>epoll</b> file descriptor has events waiting, then it will
      indicate as being readable.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>What happens if one attempts to put an <b>epoll</b> file descriptor into
      its own file descriptor set?</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The <b>epoll_ctl</b>(2) call fails (<b>EINVAL</b>). However, you can add
      an <b>epoll</b> file descriptor inside another <b>epoll</b> file
      descriptor set.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>Can I send an <b>epoll</b> file descriptor over a UNIX domain socket to
      another process?</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Yes, but it does not make sense to do this, since the receiving process
      would not have copies of the file descriptors in the interest list.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>Will closing a file descriptor cause it to be removed from all
      <b>epoll</b> interest lists?</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Yes, but be aware of the following point. A file descriptor is a reference
      to an open file description (see <b>open</b>(2)). Whenever a file
      descriptor is duplicated via <b>dup</b>(2), <b>dup2</b>(2),
      <b>fcntl</b>(2) <b>F_DUPFD</b>, or <b>fork</b>(2), a new file descriptor
      referring to the same open file description is created. An open file
      description continues to exist until all file descriptors referring to it
      have been closed.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>A file descriptor is removed from an interest list only after all the file
      descriptors referring to the underlying open file description have been
      closed. This means that even after a file descriptor that is part of an
      interest list has been closed, events may be reported for that file
      descriptor if other file descriptors referring to the same underlying file
      description remain open. To prevent this happening, the file descriptor
      must be explicitly removed from the interest list (using
      <b>epoll_ctl</b>(2) <b>EPOLL_CTL_DEL</b>) before it is duplicated.
      Alternatively, the application must ensure that all file descriptors are
      closed (which may be difficult if file descriptors were duplicated behind
      the scenes by library functions that used <b>dup</b>(2) or
      <b>fork</b>(2)).</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>If more than one event occurs between <b>epoll_wait</b>(2) calls, are they
      combined or reported separately?</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>They will be combined.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>Does an operation on a file descriptor affect the already collected but
      not yet reported events?</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>You can do two operations on an existing file descriptor. Remove would be
      meaningless for this case. Modify will reread available I/O.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>Do I need to continuously read/write a file descriptor until <b>EAGAIN</b>
      when using the <b>EPOLLET</b> flag (edge-triggered behavior)?</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Receiving an event from <b>epoll_wait</b>(2) should suggest to you that
      such file descriptor is ready for the requested I/O operation. You must
      consider it ready until the next (nonblocking) read/write yields
      <b>EAGAIN</b>. When and how you will use the file descriptor is entirely
      up to you.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>For packet/token-oriented files (e.g., datagram socket, terminal in
      canonical mode), the only way to detect the end of the read/write I/O
      space is to continue to read/write until <b>EAGAIN</b>.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>For stream-oriented files (e.g., pipe, FIFO, stream socket), the condition
      that the read/write I/O space is exhausted can also be detected by
      checking the amount of data read from / written to the target file
      descriptor. For example, if you call <b>read</b>(2) by asking to read a
      certain amount of data and <b>read</b>(2) returns a lower number of bytes,
      you can be sure of having exhausted the read I/O space for the file
      descriptor. The same is true when writing using <b>write</b>(2). (Avoid
      this latter technique if you cannot guarantee that the monitored file
      descriptor always refers to a stream-oriented file.)</dd>

  <dd><b>Starvation (edge-triggered)</b></dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>If there is a large amount of I/O space, it is possible that by trying to
      drain it the other files will not get processed causing starvation. (This
      problem is not specific to <b>epoll</b>.)</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The solution is to maintain a ready list and mark the file descriptor as
      ready in its associated data structure, thereby allowing the application
      to remember which files need to be processed but still round robin amongst
      all the ready files. This also supports ignoring subsequent events you
      receive for file descriptors that are already ready.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd><b>If using an event cache...</b></dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>If you use an event cache or store all the file descriptors returned from
      <b>epoll_wait</b>(2), then make sure to provide a way to mark its closure
      dynamically (i.e., caused by a previous event's processing). Suppose you
      receive 100 events from <b>epoll_wait</b>(2), and in event #47 a condition
      causes event #13 to be closed. If you remove the structure and
      <b>close</b>(2) the file descriptor for event #13, then your event cache
      might still say there are events waiting for that file descriptor causing
      confusion.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>One solution for this is to call, during the processing of event 47,
      <b>epoll_ctl</b>(<b>EPOLL_CTL_DEL</b>) to delete file descriptor 13 and
      <b>close</b>(2), then mark its associated data structure as removed and
      link it to a cleanup list. If you find another event for file descriptor
      13 in your batch processing, you will discover the file descriptor had
      been previously removed and there will be no confusion.</dd>
