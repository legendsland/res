<p class="Pp">The Linux key-management facility is primarily a way for various
    kernel components to retain or cache security data, authentication keys,
    encryption keys, and other data in the kernel.</p>
<p class="Pp">System call interfaces are provided so that user-space programs
    can manage those objects and also use the facility for their own purposes;
    see <b>add_key</b>(2), <b>request_key</b>(2), and <b>keyctl</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp">A library and some user-space utilities are provided to allow
    access to the facility. See <b>keyctl</b>(1), <b>keyctl</b>(3), and
    <b>keyutils</b>(7) for more information.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Keys"><a class="permalink" href="#Keys">Keys</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A key has the following attributes:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Serial"><a class="permalink" href="#Serial">Serial number
    (ID)</a></dt>
  <dd>This is a unique integer handle by which a key is referred to in system
      calls. The serial number is sometimes synonymously referred as the key ID.
      Programmatically, key serial numbers are represented using the type
      <i>key_serial_t</i>.</dd>
  <dt id="Type"><a class="permalink" href="#Type">Type</a></dt>
  <dd>A key's type defines what sort of data can be held in the key, how the
      proposed content of the key will be parsed, and how the payload will be
      used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>There are a number of general-purpose types available, plus some
      specialist types defined by specific kernel components.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Description"><a class="permalink" href="#Description">Description
    (name)</a></dt>
  <dd>The key description is a printable string that is used as the search term
      for the key (in conjunction with the key type) as well as a display name.
      During searches, the description may be partially matched or exactly
      matched.</dd>
  <dt id="Payload"><a class="permalink" href="#Payload">Payload (data)</a></dt>
  <dd>The payload is the actual content of a key. This is usually set when a key
      is created, but it is possible for the kernel to upcall to user space to
      finish the instantiation of a key if that key wasn't already known to the
      kernel when it was requested. For further details, see
      <b>request_key</b>(2).</dd>

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Access"><a class="permalink" href="#Access">Access rights</a></dt>
  <dd>Much as files do, each key has an owning user ID, an owning group ID, and
      a security label. Each key also has a set of permissions, though there are
      more than for a normal UNIX file, and there is an additional
      category—possessor—beyond the usual user, group, and other
      (see <i>Possession</i>, below).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Note that keys are quota controlled, since they require unswappable kernel

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Expiration"><a class="permalink" href="#Expiration">Expiration
    time</a></dt>
  <dd>Each key can have an expiration time set. When that time is reached, the
      key is marked as being expired and accesses to it fail with the error
      <b>EKEYEXPIRED</b>. If not deleted, updated, or replaced, then, after a
      set amount of time, an expired key is automatically removed (garbage
      collected) along with all links to it, and attempts to access the key fail
      with the error <b>ENOKEY</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="Reference"><a class="permalink" href="#Reference">Reference
    count</a></dt>
  <dd>Each key has a reference count. Keys are referenced by keyrings, by
      currently active users, and by a process's credentials. When the reference
      count reaches zero, the key is scheduled for garbage collection.</dd>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Key_types"><a class="permalink" href="#Key_types">Key
  types</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The kernel provides several basic types of key:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>"keyring"</i></dt>
  <dd>Keyrings are special keys which store a set of links to other keys
      (including other keyrings), analogous to a directory holding links to
      files. The main purpose of a keyring is to prevent other keys from being
      garbage collected because nothing refers to them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Keyrings with descriptions (names) that begin with a period ('.') are

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>"user"</i></dt>
  <dd>This is a general-purpose key type. The key is kept entirely within kernel
      memory. The payload may be read and updated by user-space
    applications.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The payload for keys of this type is a blob of arbitrary data of up to
      32,767 bytes.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The description may be any valid string, though it is preferred that it
      start with a colon-delimited prefix representing the service to which the
      key is of interest (for instance <i>"afs:mykey"</i>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>"logon"</i> (since Linux 3.3)</dt>
  <dd>This key type is essentially the same as <i>"user"</i>, but it
      does not provide reading (i.e., the <b>keyctl</b>(2) <b>KEYCTL_READ</b>
      operation), meaning that the key payload is never visible from user space.
      This is suitable for storing username-password pairs that should not be
      readable from user space.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The description of a <i>"logon"</i> key <i>must</i> start with a
      non-empty colon-delimited prefix whose purpose is to identify the service
      to which the key belongs. (Note that this differs from keys of the
      <i>"user"</i> type, where the inclusion of a prefix is
      recommended but is not enforced.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>"big_key"</i> (since Linux 3.13)</dt>
  <dd>This key type is similar to the <i>"user"</i> key type, but it
      may hold a payload of up to 1&nbsp;MiB in size. This key type is useful
      for purposes such as holding Kerberos ticket caches.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The payload data may be stored in a tmpfs filesystem, rather than in
      kernel memory, if the data size exceeds the overhead of storing the data
      in the filesystem. (Storing the data in a filesystem requires filesystem
      structures to be allocated in the kernel. The size of these structures
      determines the size threshold above which the tmpfs storage method is
      used.) Since Linux 4.8, the payload data is encrypted when stored in
      tmpfs, thereby preventing it from being written unencrypted into swap
      space.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">There are more specialized key types available also, but they
    aren't discussed here because they aren't intended for normal user-space
    use.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Keyrings"><a class="permalink" href="#Keyrings">Keyrings</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">As previously mentioned, keyrings are a special type of key that
    contain links to other keys (which may include other keyrings). Keys may be
    linked to by multiple keyrings. Keyrings may be considered as analogous to
    UNIX directories where each directory contains a set of hard links to
  files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Various operations (system calls) may be applied only to
  keyrings:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Adding"><a class="permalink" href="#Adding">Adding</a></dt>
  <dd>A key may be added to a keyring by system calls that create keys. This

  <dt id="Linking"><a class="permalink" href="#Linking">Linking</a></dt>

  <dd>A link may be removed from a keyring. When the last link to a key is

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Anchoring_keys"><a class="permalink" href="#Anchoring_keys">Anchoring
  keys</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">To prevent a key from being garbage collected, it must be anchored
    to keep its reference count elevated when it is not in active use by the
    kernel.</p>
<p class="Pp">Keyrings are used to anchor other keys: each link is a reference
    on a key. Note that keyrings themselves are just keys and are also subject
    to the same anchoring requirement to prevent them being garbage
  collected.</p>
<p class="Pp">The kernel makes available a number of anchor keyrings. Note that
    some of these keyrings will be created only when first accessed.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Possession"><a class="permalink" href="#Possession">Possession</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The concept of possession is important to understanding the
    keyrings security model. Whether a thread possesses a key is determined by
    the following rules:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>(1)</dt>
  <dd>Any key or keyring that does not grant <i>search</i> permission to the
      caller is ignored in all the following rules.</dd>
  <dt>(2)</dt>
  <dd>A thread possesses its <b>session-keyring</b>(7),
      <b>process-keyring</b>(7), and <b>thread-keyring</b>(7) directly because
      those keyrings are referred to by its credentials.</dd>
  <dt>(3)</dt>
  <dd>If a keyring is possessed, then any key it links to is also
    possessed.</dd>
  <dt>(4)</dt>
  <dd>If any key a keyring links to is itself a keyring, then rule (3) applies
      recursively.</dd>
  <dt>(5)</dt>
  <dd>If a process is upcalled from the kernel to instantiate a key (see
      <b>request_key</b>(2)), then it also possesses the requester's keyrings as
      in rule (1) as if it were the requester.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Note that possession is not a fundamental property of a key, but
    must rather be calculated each time the key is needed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Possession is designed to allow set-user-ID programs run from, say
    a user's shell to access the user's keys. Granting permissions to the key
    possessor while denying them to the key owner and group allows the
    prevention of access to keys on the basis of UID and GID matches.</p>
<p class="Pp">When it creates the session keyring, <b>pam_keyinit</b>(8) adds a
    link to the <b>user-keyring</b>(7), thus making the user keyring and
    anything it contains possessed by default.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Access_rights"><a class="permalink" href="#Access_rights">Access

<p class="Pp">The permissions mask contains four sets of rights. The first three

<p class="Pp">The complete set of rights for a key is the union of whichever of

    user-space applications to find a key. (Internally, the kernel has something
    similar available for use by internal components that make use of keys.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The search algorithm works as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>(1)</dt>
  <dd>The process keyrings are searched in the following order: the

  <dt>(2)</dt>
  <dd>If the caller was a process that was invoked by the <b>request_key</b>(2)
      upcall mechanism, then the keyrings of the original caller of
      <b>request_key</b>(2) will be searched as well.</dd>
  <dt>(3)</dt>
  <dd>The search of a keyring tree is in breadth-first order: each keyring is
