<p class="Pp">The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
    the ISO&nbsp;C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
    here and the ISO&nbsp;C standard is unintentional. This volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO&nbsp;C standard.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>&lt;fenv.h&gt;</i> header shall define the following data
    types through <b>typedef</b>:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="fenv_t"><a class="permalink" href="#fenv_t"><b>fenv_t</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Represents the entire floating-point environment. The floating-point

      control modes supported by the implementation.</dd>
  <dt id="fexcept_t"><a class="permalink" href="#fexcept_t"><b>fexcept_t</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Represents the floating-point status flags collectively, including any
      status the implementation associates with the flags. A floating-point
      status flag is a system variable whose value is set (but never cleared)
      when a floating-point exception is raised, which occurs as a side-effect
      of exceptional floating-point arithmetic to provide auxiliary information.
      A floating-point control mode is a system variable whose value may be set
      by the user to affect the subsequent behavior of floating-point
      arithmetic.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The <i>&lt;fenv.h&gt;</i> header shall define each of the

    <i>feclearexcept</i>(), <i>fegetexceptflag</i>(), <i>feraiseexcept</i>(),
    <i>fesetexceptflag</i>(), and <i>fetestexcept</i>(). The defined macros

    floating-point exceptions with macros beginning with FE_ and an uppercase
    letter may also be specified by the implementation.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>&lt;fenv.h&gt;</i> header shall define the macro
    FE_ALL_EXCEPT as the bitwise-inclusive OR of all floating-point exception
    macros defined by the implementation, if any. If no such macros are defined,
    then the macro FE_ALL_EXCEPT shall be defined as zero.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>&lt;fenv.h&gt;</i> header shall define each of the
    following macros if and only if the implementation supports getting and
    setting the represented rounding direction by means of the
    <i>fegetround</i>() and <i>fesetround</i>() functions. The defined macros
    shall expand to integer constant expressions whose values are distinct
    non-negative values.</p>

<p class="Pp">The <i>&lt;fenv.h&gt;</i> header shall define the following macro,
    which represents the default floating-point environment (that is, the one
    installed at program startup) and has type pointer to const-qualified
    <b>fenv_t</b>. It can be used as an argument to the functions within the

</div>
<p class="Pp">The FENV_ACCESS pragma provides a means to inform the
    implementation when an application might access the floating-point
    environment to test floating-point status flags or run under non-default
    floating-point control modes. The pragma shall occur either outside external
    declarations or preceding all explicit declarations and statements inside a
    compound statement. When outside external declarations, the pragma takes
    effect from its occurrence until another FENV_ACCESS pragma is encountered,
    or until the end of the translation unit. When inside a compound statement,
    the pragma takes effect from its occurrence until another FENV_ACCESS pragma
    is encountered (including within a nested compound statement), or until the
    end of the compound statement; at the end of a compound statement the state
    for the pragma is restored to its condition just before the compound
    statement. If this pragma is used in any other context, the behavior is
    undefined. If part of an application tests floating-point status flags, sets
    floating-point control modes, or runs under non-default mode settings, but
    was translated with the state for the FENV_ACCESS pragma off, the behavior
    is undefined. The default state (on or off) for the pragma is
    implementation-defined. (When execution passes from a part of the
    application translated with FENV_ACCESS off to a part translated with
    FENV_ACCESS on, the state of the floating-point status flags is unspecified
    and the floating-point control modes have their default settings.)</p>

</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="APPLICATION_USAGE"><a class="permalink" href="#APPLICATION_USAGE">APPLICATION
  USAGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This header is designed to support the floating-point exception
    status flags and directed-rounding control modes required by the
    IEC&nbsp;60559:1989 standard, and other similar floating-point state
    information. Also it is designed to facilitate code portability among all
    systems.</p>
<p class="Pp">Certain application programming conventions support the intended
    model of use for the floating-point environment:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>A function call does not alter its caller's floating-point control modes,
      clear its caller's floating-point status flags, nor depend on the state of
      its caller's floating-point status flags unless the function is so
      documented.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>A function call is assumed to require default floating-point control
      modes, unless its documentation promises otherwise.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>A function call is assumed to have the potential for raising
      floating-point exceptions, unless its documentation promises
    otherwise.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">With these conventions, an application can safely assume default
    floating-point control modes (or be unaware of them). The responsibilities
    associated with accessing the floating-point environment fall on the
    application that does so explicitly.</p>
<p class="Pp">Even though the rounding direction macros may expand to constants
    corresponding to the values of FLT_ROUNDS, they are not required to do
  so.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>#include &lt;fenv.h&gt;
void f(double x)
{
<br>
    #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
<br>
    void g(double);
<br>
    void h(double);
<br>
    /* ... */
<br>
    g(x + 1);
<br>
    h(x + 1);
<br>
    /* ... */
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If the function <i>g</i>() might depend on status flags set as a
    side-effect of the first <i>x</i>+1, or if the second <i>x</i>+1 might
    depend on control modes set as a side-effect of the call to function
    <i>g</i>(), then the application shall contain an appropriately placed
    invocation as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>#pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON</pre>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The_fexcept_t_Type"><a class="permalink" href="#The_fexcept_t_Type">The
  fexcept_t Type</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><b>fexcept_t</b> does not have to be an integer type. Its values
    must be obtained by a call to <i>fegetexceptflag</i>(), and cannot be
    created by logical operations from the exception macros. An implementation
    might simply implement <b>fexcept_t</b> as an <b>int</b> and use the
    representations reflected by the exception macros, but is not required to;
    other representations might contain extra information about the exceptions.
    <b>fexcept_t</b> might be a <b>struct</b> with a member for each exception
    (that might hold the address of the first or last floating-point instruction
    that caused that exception). The ISO/IEC&nbsp;9899:1999 standard makes no
    claims about the internals of an <b>fexcept_t</b>, and so the user cannot
    inspect it.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Exception_and_Rounding_Macros"><a class="permalink" href="#Exception_and_Rounding_Macros">Exception
  and Rounding Macros</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Macros corresponding to unsupported modes and rounding directions
    are not defined by the implementation and must not be defined by the
    application. An application might use <b>#ifdef</b> to test for this.</p>
