<p class="Pp">unicode - universal character set</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The international standard ISO/IEC 10646 defines the Universal
    Character Set (UCS). UCS contains all characters of all other character set
    standards. It also guarantees "round-trip compatibility"; in other
    words, conversion tables can be built such that no information is lost when
    a string is converted from any other encoding to UCS and back.</p>
<p class="Pp">UCS contains the characters required to represent practically all
    known languages. This includes not only the Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew,
    Arabic, Armenian, and Georgian scripts, but also Chinese, Japanese and
    Korean Han ideographs as well as scripts such as Hiragana, Katakana, Hangul,
    Devanagari, Bengali, Gurmukhi, Gujarati, Oriya, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada,
    Malayalam, Thai, Lao, Khmer, Bopomofo, Tibetan, Runic, Ethiopic, Canadian
    Syllabics, Cherokee, Mongolian, Ogham, Myanmar, Sinhala, Thaana, Yi, and
    others. For scripts not yet covered, research on how to best encode them for
    computer usage is still going on and they will be added eventually. This
    might eventually include not only Hieroglyphs and various historic
    Indo-European languages, but even some selected artistic scripts such as
    Tengwar, Cirth, and Klingon. UCS also covers a large number of graphical,
    typographical, mathematical, and scientific symbols, including those
    provided by TeX, Postscript, APL, MS-DOS, MS-Windows, Macintosh, OCR fonts,
    as well as many word processing and publishing systems, and more are being
    added.</p>
<p class="Pp">The UCS standard (ISO/IEC 10646) describes a 31-bit character set
    architecture consisting of 128 24-bit <i>groups</i>, each divided into 256
    16-bit <i>planes</i> made up of 256 8-bit <i>rows</i> with 256 <i>column</i>
    positions, one for each character. Part 1 of the standard (ISO/IEC 10646-1)
    defines the first 65534 code positions (0x0000 to 0xfffd), which form the
    <i>Basic Multilingual Plane</i> (BMP), that is plane 0 in group 0. Part 2 of
    the standard (ISO/IEC 10646-2) adds characters to group 0 outside the BMP in
    several <i>supplementary planes</i> in the range 0x10000 to 0x10ffff. There
    are no plans to add characters beyond 0x10ffff to the standard, therefore of
    the entire code space, only a small fraction of group 0 will ever be
    actually used in the foreseeable future. The BMP contains all characters
    found in the commonly used other character sets. The supplemental planes
    added by ISO/IEC 10646-2 cover only more exotic characters for special
    scientific, dictionary printing, publishing industry, higher-level protocol
    and enthusiast needs.</p>
<p class="Pp">The representation of each UCS character as a 2-byte word is
    referred to as the UCS-2 form (only for BMP characters), whereas UCS-4 is
    the representation of each character by a 4-byte word. In addition, there
    exist two encoding forms UTF-8 for backward compatibility with ASCII
    processing software and UTF-16 for the backward-compatible handling of
    non-BMP characters up to 0x10ffff by UCS-2 software.</p>
<p class="Pp">The UCS characters 0x0000 to 0x007f are identical to those of the
    classic US-ASCII character set and the characters in the range 0x0000 to
    0x00ff are identical to those in ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1).</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Combining_characters"><a class="permalink" href="#Combining_characters">Combining
  characters</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Some code points in UCS have been assigned to <i>combining
    characters</i>. These are similar to the nonspacing accent keys on a
    typewriter. A combining character just adds an accent to the previous
    character. The most important accented characters have codes of their own in
    UCS, however, the combining character mechanism allows us to add accents and
    other diacritical marks to any character. The combining characters always
    follow the character which they modify. For example, the German character
    Umlaut-A ("Latin capital letter A with diaeresis") can either be
    represented by the precomposed UCS code 0x00c4, or alternatively as the
    combination of a normal "Latin capital letter A" followed by a
    "combining diaeresis": 0x0041 0x0308.</p>
<p class="Pp">Combining characters are essential for instance for encoding the
    Thai script or for mathematical typesetting and users of the International
    Phonetic Alphabet.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Implementation_levels"><a class="permalink" href="#Implementation_levels">Implementation
  levels</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">As not all systems are expected to support advanced mechanisms
    like combining characters, ISO/IEC 10646-1 specifies the following three
    <i>implementation levels</i> of UCS:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Level"><a class="permalink" href="#Level">Level 1</a></dt>
  <dd>Combining characters and Hangul Jamo (a variant encoding of the Korean
      script, where a Hangul syllable glyph is coded as a triplet or pair of
      vowel/consonant codes) are not supported.</dd>
  <dt id="Level~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Level~2">Level 2</a></dt>
  <dd>In addition to level 1, combining characters are now allowed for some
      languages where they are essential (e.g., Thai, Lao, Hebrew, Arabic,
      Devanagari, Malayalam).</dd>
  <dt id="Level~3"><a class="permalink" href="#Level~3">Level 3</a></dt>
  <dd>All UCS characters are supported.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The Unicode 3.0 Standard published by the Unicode Consortium
    contains exactly the UCS Basic Multilingual Plane at implementation level 3,
    as described in ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000. Unicode 3.1 added the supplemental
    planes of ISO/IEC 10646-2. The Unicode standard and technical reports
    published by the Unicode Consortium provide much additional information on
    the semantics and recommended usages of various characters. They provide
    guidelines and algorithms for editing, sorting, comparing, normalizing,
    converting, and displaying Unicode strings.</p>

  under Linux</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Under GNU/Linux, the C type <i>wchar_t</i> is a signed 32-bit
    integer type. Its values are always interpreted by the C library as UCS code
    values (in all locales), a convention that is signaled by the GNU C library
    to applications by defining the constant <b>__STDC_ISO_10646__</b> as
    specified in the ISO C99 standard.</p>
<p class="Pp">UCS/Unicode can be used just like ASCII in input/output streams,
    terminal communication, plaintext files, filenames, and environment
    variables in the ASCII compatible UTF-8 multibyte encoding. To signal the
    use of UTF-8 as the character encoding to all applications, a suitable
    <i>locale</i> has to be selected via environment variables (e.g.,
    "LANG=en_GB.UTF-8").</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>nl_langinfo(CODESET)</b> function returns the name of the
    selected encoding. Library functions such as <b>wctomb</b>(3) and
    <b>mbsrtowcs</b>(3) can be used to transform the internal <i>wchar_t</i>
    characters and strings into the system character encoding and back and
    <b>wcwidth</b>(3) tells how many positions (0â€“2) the cursor is
    advanced by the output of a character.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Private_Use_Areas_(PUA)"><a class="permalink" href="#Private_Use_Areas_(PUA)">Private
  Use Areas (PUA)</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In the Basic Multilingual Plane, the range 0xe000 to 0xf8ff will
    never be assigned to any characters by the standard and is reserved for
    private usage. For the Linux community, this private area has been
    subdivided further into the range 0xe000 to 0xefff which can be used
    individually by any end-user and the Linux zone in the range 0xf000 to
    0xf8ff where extensions are coordinated among all Linux users. The registry
    of the characters assigned to the Linux zone is maintained by LANANA and the
    registry itself is <i>Documentation/admin-guide/unicode.rst</i> in the Linux
    kernel sources (or <i>Documentation/unicode.txt</i> before Linux 4.10).</p>
<p class="Pp">Two other planes are reserved for private usage, plane 15
    (Supplementary Private Use Area-A, range 0xf0000 to 0xffffd) and plane 16
    (Supplementary Private Use Area-B, range 0x100000 to 0x10fffd).</p>
