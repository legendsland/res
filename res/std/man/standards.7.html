  <dd>Version 7 (also known as Seventh Edition) UNIX, released by AT&amp;T/Bell
      Labs in 1979. After this point, UNIX systems diverged into two main
      dialects: BSD and System V.</dd>
  <dt><b>4.2BSD</b></dt>
  <dd>This is an implementation standard defined by the 4.2 release of the
      <i>Berkeley Software Distribution</i>, released by the University of
      California at Berkeley. This was the first Berkeley release that contained
      a TCP/IP stack and the sockets API. 4.2BSD was released in 1983.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Earlier major BSD releases included <i>3BSD</i> (1980), <i>4BSD</i>

      Berkeley release.</dd>
  <dt id="System"><a class="permalink" href="#System"><b>System V</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This is an implementation standard defined by AT&amp;T's milestone 1983
      release of its commercial System V (five) release. The previous major
      AT&amp;T release was <i>System III</i>, released in 1981.</dd>
  <dt id="System~2"><a class="permalink" href="#System~2"><b>System V release 2
    (SVr2)</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This was the next System V release, made in 1985. The SVr2 was formally
      described in the <i>System V Interface Definition version 1</i> (<i>SVID
      1</i>) published in 1985.</dd>
  <dt id="System~3"><a class="permalink" href="#System~3"><b>System V release 3

      (<i>SVID 2</i>).</dd>
  <dt id="System~4"><a class="permalink" href="#System~4"><b>System V release 4

  <dd>This was the successor to SVr3, released in 1989. This version of System V
      is described in the "Programmer's Reference Manual: Operating System
      API (Intel processors)" (Prentice-Hall 1992, ISBN 0-13-951294-2) This
      release was formally described in the <i>System V Interface Definition

  <dd>This was the first C language standard, ratified by ANSI (American
      National Standards Institute) in 1989 (<i>X3.159-1989</i>). Sometimes this
      is known as <i>ANSI C</i>, but since C99 is also an ANSI standard, this
      term is ambiguous. This standard was also ratified by ISO (International
      Standards Organization) in 1990 (<i>ISO/IEC 9899:1990</i>), and is thus
      occasionally referred to as <i>ISO C90</i>.</dd>

  <dd>This was the first POSIX standard, ratified by IEEE as IEEE Std
      1003.1-1988, and subsequently adopted (with minor revisions) as an ISO
      standard in 1990. The term "POSIX" was coined by Richard

  <dd>Released in 1989, this was the first release of the X/Open Portability

    standard.</dd>
  <dt id="SUS"><a class="permalink" href="#SUS"><b>SUS (SUSv1)</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Single UNIX Specification. This was a repackaging of XPG4v2 and other
      X/Open standards (X/Open Curses Issue 4 version 2, X/Open Networking
      Service (XNS) Issue 4). Systems conforming to this standard can be branded
      <i>UNIX 95</i>.</dd>
  <dt id="SUSv2"><a class="permalink" href="#SUSv2"><b>SUSv2</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Single UNIX Specification version 2. Sometimes also referred to
      (incorrectly) as <i>XPG5</i>. This standard appeared in 1997. Systems
      conforming to this standard can be branded <i>UNIX 98</i>. See also
      <a class="Lk" href="http://www.unix.org/version2/">http://www.unix.org/version2/</a>.)</dd>
  <dt id="POSIX.1-2001,"><a class="permalink" href="#POSIX.1-2001,"><b>POSIX.1-2001,
    SUSv3</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This was a 2001 revision and consolidation of the POSIX.1, POSIX.2, and
      SUS standards into a single document, conducted under the auspices of the
      Austin Group
      <a class="Lk" href="http://www.opengroup.org/austin/">http://www.opengroup.org/austin/</a>.
      The standard is available online at
      <a class="Lk" href="http://www.unix.org/version3/">http://www.unix.org/version3/</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The standard defines two levels of conformance: <i>POSIX conformance</i>,
      which is a baseline set of interfaces required of a conforming system; and
      <i>XSI Conformance</i>, which additionally mandates a set of interfaces
      (the "XSI extension") which are only optional for POSIX
      conformance. XSI-conformant systems can be branded <i>UNIX 03</i>.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The POSIX.1-2001 document is broken into four parts:</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><b>XBD</b>: Definitions, terms, and concepts, header file
    specifications.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><b>XSH</b>: Specifications of functions (i.e., system calls and library
      functions in actual implementations).</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><b>XCU</b>: Specifications of commands and utilities (i.e., the area
      formerly described by POSIX.2).</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><b>XRAT</b>: Informative text on the other parts of the standard.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>POSIX.1-2001 is aligned with C99, so that all of the library functions
      standardized in C99 are also standardized in POSIX.1-2001.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The Single UNIX Specification version 3 (SUSv3) comprises the Base
      Specifications containing XBD, XSH, XCU, and XRAT as above, plus X/Open
      Curses Issue 4 version 2 as an extra volume that is not in
    POSIX.1-2001.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Two Technical Corrigenda (minor fixes and improvements) of the original
      2001 standard have occurred: TC1 in 2003 and TC2 in 2004.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="POSIX.1-2008,"><a class="permalink" href="#POSIX.1-2008,"><b>POSIX.1-2008,
    SUSv4</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Work on the next revision of POSIX.1/SUS was completed and ratified in
      2008. The standard is available online at
      <a class="Lk" href="http://www.unix.org/version4/">http://www.unix.org/version4/</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The changes in this revision are not as large as those that occurred for
      POSIX.1-2001/SUSv3, but a number of new interfaces are added and various
      details of existing specifications are modified. Many of the interfaces
      that were optional in POSIX.1-2001 become mandatory in the 2008 revision
      of the standard. A few interfaces that are present in POSIX.1-2001 are
      marked as obsolete in POSIX.1-2008, or removed from the standard
      altogether.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The revised standard is structured in the same way as its predecessor. The
      Single UNIX Specification version 4 (SUSv4) comprises the Base
      Specifications containing XBD, XSH, XCU, and XRAT, plus X/Open Curses
      Issue 7 as an extra volume that is not in POSIX.1-2008.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Again there are two levels of conformance: the baseline <i>POSIX
      Conformance</i>, and <i>XSI Conformance</i>, which mandates an additional
      set of interfaces beyond those in the base specification.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>In general, where the STANDARDS section of a manual page lists
      POSIX.1-2001, it can be assumed that the interface also conforms to
      POSIX.1-2008, unless otherwise noted.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Technical Corrigendum 1 (minor fixes and improvements) of this standard
      was released in 2013.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Technical Corrigendum 2 of this standard was released in 2016.</dd>
  <dt></dt>

    edition</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This is equivalent to POSIX.1-2008, with the addition of Technical
      Corrigenda 1 and 2 and the XCurses specification.</dd>
