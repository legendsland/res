<p class="Pp">The <i>sleep</i>() function shall cause the calling thread to be
    suspended from execution until either the number of realtime seconds
    specified by the argument <i>seconds</i> has elapsed or a signal is
    delivered to the calling thread and its action is to invoke a
    signal-catching function or to terminate the process. The suspension time
    may be longer than requested due to the scheduling of other activity by the
    system.</p>
<p class="Pp">In single-threaded programs, <i>sleep</i>() may make use of
    SIGALRM. In multi-threaded programs, <i>sleep</i>() shall not make use of
    SIGALRM and the remainder of this DESCRIPTION does not apply.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a SIGALRM signal is generated for the calling process during
    execution of <i>sleep</i>() and if the SIGALRM signal is being ignored or
    blocked from delivery, it is unspecified whether <i>sleep</i>() returns when
    the SIGALRM signal is scheduled. If the signal is being blocked, it is also
    unspecified whether it remains pending after <i>sleep</i>() returns or it is
    discarded.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a SIGALRM signal is generated for the calling process during
    execution of <i>sleep</i>(), except as a result of a prior call to
    <i>alarm</i>(), and if the SIGALRM signal is not being ignored or blocked
    from delivery, it is unspecified whether that signal has any effect other
    than causing <i>sleep</i>() to return.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a signal-catching function interrupts <i>sleep</i>() and
    examines or changes either the time a SIGALRM is scheduled to be generated,
    the action associated with the SIGALRM signal, or whether the SIGALRM signal
    is blocked from delivery, the results are unspecified.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a signal-catching function interrupts <i>sleep</i>() and calls
    <i>siglongjmp</i>() or <i>longjmp</i>() to restore an environment saved
    prior to the <i>sleep</i>() call, the action associated with the SIGALRM
    signal and the time at which a SIGALRM signal is scheduled to be generated
    are unspecified. It is also unspecified whether the SIGALRM signal is
    blocked, unless the signal mask of the process is restored as part of the
    environment.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="permalink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">There are two general approaches to the implementation of the
    <i>sleep</i>() function. One is to use the <i>alarm</i>() function to
    schedule a SIGALRM signal and then suspend the calling thread waiting for
    that signal. The other is to implement an independent facility. This volume
    of POSIX.1‐2017 permits either approach in single-threaded programs,
    but the simple alarm/suspend implementation is not appropriate for
    multi-threaded programs.</p>
<p class="Pp">In order to comply with the requirement that no primitive shall
    change a process attribute unless explicitly described by this volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017, an implementation using SIGALRM must carefully take
    into account any SIGALRM signal scheduled by previous <i>alarm</i>() calls,
    the action previously established for SIGALRM, and whether SIGALRM was
    blocked. If a SIGALRM has been scheduled before the <i>sleep</i>() would
    ordinarily complete, the <i>sleep</i>() must be shortened to that time and a
    SIGALRM generated (possibly simulated by direct invocation of the
    signal-catching function) before <i>sleep</i>() returns. If a SIGALRM has
    been scheduled after the <i>sleep</i>() would ordinarily complete, it must
    be rescheduled for the same time before <i>sleep</i>() returns. The action
    and blocking for SIGALRM must be saved and restored.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historical implementations often implement the SIGALRM-based
    version using <i>alarm</i>() and <i>pause</i>(). One such implementation is
    prone to infinite hangups, as described in <i><i>pause</i>()</i>. Another
    such implementation uses the C-language <i>setjmp</i>() and <i>longjmp</i>()
    functions to avoid that window. That implementation introduces a different
    problem: when the SIGALRM signal interrupts a signal-catching function
    installed by the user to catch a different signal, the <i>longjmp</i>()
    aborts that signal-catching function. An implementation based on
    <i>sigprocmask</i>(), <i>alarm</i>(), and <i>sigsuspend</i>() can avoid
    these problems.</p>
<p class="Pp">Despite all reasonable care, there are several very subtle, but
    detectable and unavoidable, differences between the two types of
    implementations. These are the cases mentioned in this volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017 where some other activity relating to SIGALRM takes
    place, and the results are stated to be unspecified. All of these cases are
    sufficiently unusual as not to be of concern to most applications.</p>
<p class="Pp">See also the discussion of the term <i>realtime</i> in
    <i><i>alarm</i>()</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since <i>sleep</i>() can be implemented using <i>alarm</i>(), the
    discussion about alarms occurring early under <i>alarm</i>() applies to
    <i>sleep</i>() as well.</p>
<p class="Pp">Application developers should note that the type of the argument
    <i>seconds</i> and the return value of <i>sleep</i>() is <b>unsigned</b>.
    That means that a Strictly Conforming POSIX System Interfaces Application
    cannot pass a value greater than the minimum guaranteed value for
    {UINT_MAX}, which the ISO&nbsp;C standard sets as 65535, and any
    application passing a larger value is restricting its portability. A
    different type was considered, but historical implementations, including
    those with a 16-bit <b>int</b> type, consistently use either <b>unsigned</b>
    or <b>int</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Scheduling delays may cause the process to return from the
    <i>sleep</i>() function significantly after the requested time. In such
    cases, the return value should be set to zero, since the formula (requested
    time minus the time actually spent) yields a negative number and
    <i>sleep</i>() returns an <b>unsigned</b>.</p>
