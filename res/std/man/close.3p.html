<p class="Pp">The <i>close</i>() function shall deallocate the file descriptor
    indicated by <i>fildes</i>. To deallocate means to make the file descriptor
    available for return by subsequent calls to <i>open</i>() or other functions
    that allocate file descriptors. All outstanding record locks owned by the
    process on the file associated with the file descriptor shall be removed
    (that is, unlocked).</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>close</i>() is interrupted by a signal that is to be caught,
    it shall return -1 with <i>errno</i> set to <b>[EINTR]</b> and the state of
    <i>fildes</i> is unspecified. If an I/O error occurred while reading from or
    writing to the file system during <i>close</i>(), it may return -1 with
    <i>errno</i> set to <b>[EIO]</b>; if this error is returned, the state of
    <i>fildes</i> is unspecified.</p>
<p class="Pp">When all file descriptors associated with a pipe or FIFO special
    file are closed, any data remaining in the pipe or FIFO shall be
  discarded.</p>
<p class="Pp">When all file descriptors associated with an open file description
    have been closed, the open file description shall be freed.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the link count of the file is 0, when all file descriptors
    associated with the file are closed, the space occupied by the file shall be
    freed and the file shall no longer be accessible.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a STREAMS-based <i>fildes</i> is closed and the calling process
    was previously registered to receive a SIGPOLL signal for events associated
    with that STREAM, the calling process shall be unregistered for events
    associated with the STREAM. The last <i>close</i>() for a STREAM shall cause
    the STREAM associated with <i>fildes</i> to be dismantled. If O_NONBLOCK is
    not set and there have been no signals posted for the STREAM, and if there
    is data on the module's write queue, <i>close</i>() shall wait for an
    unspecified time (for each module and driver) for any output to drain before
    dismantling the STREAM. The time delay can be changed via an I_SETCLTIME
    <i>ioctl</i>() request. If the O_NONBLOCK flag is set, or if there are any
    pending signals, <i>close</i>() shall not wait for output to drain, and
    shall dismantle the STREAM immediately.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the implementation supports STREAMS-based pipes, and
    <i>fildes</i> is associated with one end of a pipe, the last <i>close</i>()
    shall cause a hangup to occur on the other end of the pipe. In addition, if
    the other end of the pipe has been named by <i>fattach</i>(), then the last
    <i>close</i>() shall force the named end to be detached by <i>fdetach</i>().
    If the named end has no open file descriptors associated with it and gets
    detached, the STREAM associated with that end shall also be dismantled.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>fildes</i> refers to the master side of a pseudo-terminal,
    and this is the last close, a SIGHUP signal shall be sent to the controlling
    process, if any, for which the slave side of the pseudo-terminal is the
    controlling terminal. It is unspecified whether closing the master side of
    the pseudo-terminal flushes all queued input and output.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>fildes</i> refers to the slave side of a STREAMS-based
    pseudo-terminal, a zero-length message may be sent to the master.</p>
<p class="Pp">When there is an outstanding cancelable asynchronous I/O operation
    against <i>fildes</i> when <i>close</i>() is called, that I/O operation may
    be canceled. An I/O operation that is not canceled completes as if the
    <i>close</i>() operation had not yet occurred. All operations that are not
    canceled shall complete as if the <i>close</i>() blocked until the
    operations completed. The <i>close</i>() operation itself need not block
    awaiting such I/O completion. Whether any I/O operation is canceled, and
    which I/O operation may be canceled upon <i>close</i>(), is
    implementation-defined.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a memory mapped file or a shared memory object remains
    referenced at the last close (that is, a process has it mapped), then the
    entire contents of the memory object shall persist until the memory object
    becomes unreferenced. If this is the last close of a memory mapped file or a
    shared memory object and the close results in the memory object becoming
    unreferenced, and the memory object has been unlinked, then the memory
    object shall be removed.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>fildes</i> refers to a socket, <i>close</i>() shall cause
    the socket to be destroyed. If the socket is in connection-mode, and the
    SO_LINGER option is set for the socket with non-zero linger time, and the
    socket has untransmitted data, then <i>close</i>() shall block for up to the
    current linger interval until all data is transmitted.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="APPLICATION_USAGE"><a class="permalink" href="#APPLICATION_USAGE">APPLICATION
  USAGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">An application that had used the <i>stdio</i> routine
    <i>fopen</i>() to open a file should use the corresponding <i>fclose</i>()
    routine rather than <i>close</i>(). Once a file is closed, the file
    descriptor no longer exists, since the integer corresponding to it no longer
    refers to a file.</p>
<p class="Pp">Implementations may use file descriptors that must be inherited
    into child processes for the child process to remain conforming, such as for
    message catalog or tracing purposes. Therefore, an application that calls
    <i>close</i>() on an arbitrary integer risks non-conforming behavior, and
    <i>close</i>() can only portably be used on file descriptor values that the
    application has obtained through explicit actions, as well as the three file
    descriptors corresponding to the standard file streams. In multi-threaded
    parent applications, the practice of calling <i>close</i>() in a loop after
    <i>fork</i>() and before an <i>exec</i> call in order to avoid a race
    condition of leaking an unintended file descriptor into a child process, is
    therefore unsafe, and the race should instead be combatted by opening all
    file descriptors with the FD_CLOEXEC bit set unless the file descriptor is
    intended to be inherited across <i>exec</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Usage of <i>close</i>() on file descriptors STDIN_FILENO,
    STDOUT_FILENO, or STDERR_FILENO should immediately be followed by an
    operation to reopen these file descriptors. Unexpected behavior will result
    if any of these file descriptors is left in a closed state (for example, an
    <b>[EBADF]</b> error from <i>perror</i>()) or if an unrelated <i>open</i>()
    or similar call later in the application accidentally allocates a file to
    one of these well-known file descriptors. Furthermore, a <i>close</i>()
    followed by a reopen operation (e.g., <i>open</i>(), <i>dup</i>(), etc.) is
    not atomic; <i>dup2</i>() should be used to change standard file
    descriptors.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="permalink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The use of interruptible device close routines should be
    discouraged to avoid problems with the implicit closes of file descriptors
    by <i>exec</i> and <i>exit</i>(). This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 only
    intends to permit such behavior by specifying the <b>[EINTR]</b> error
    condition.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the requirement for <i>close</i>() on a socket to block
    for up to the current linger interval is not conditional on the O_NONBLOCK
    setting.</p>
<p class="Pp">The standard developers rejected a proposal to add
    <i>closefrom</i>() to the standard. Because the standard permits
    implementations to use inherited file descriptors as a means of providing a
    conforming environment for the child process, it is not possible to
    standardize an interface that closes arbitrary file descriptors above a
    certain value while still guaranteeing a conforming environment.</p>
