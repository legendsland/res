<p class="Pp">The user session keyring is a keyring used to anchor keys on
    behalf of a user. Each UID the kernel deals with has its own user session
    keyring that is shared by all processes with that UID. The user session
    keyring has a name (description) of the form <i>_uid_ses.&lt;UID&gt;</i>
    where <i>&lt;UID&gt;</i> is the user ID of the corresponding user.</p>
<p class="Pp">The user session keyring is associated with the record that the
    kernel maintains for the UID. It comes into existence upon the first attempt
    to access either the user session keyring, the <b>user-keyring</b>(7), or
    the <b>session-keyring</b>(7). The keyring remains pinned in existence so
    long as there are processes running with that real UID or files opened by
    those processes remain open. (The keyring can also be pinned indefinitely by
    linking it into another keyring.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The user session keyring is created on demand when a thread
    requests it or when a thread asks for its <b>session-keyring</b>(7) and that
    keyring doesn't exist. In the latter case, a user session keyring will be
    created and, if the session keyring wasn't to be created, the user session
    keyring will be set as the process's actual session keyring.</p>
<p class="Pp">The user session keyring is searched by <b>request_key</b>(2) if
    the actual session keyring does not exist and is ignored otherwise.</p>
<p class="Pp">A special serial number value,
    <b>KEY_SPEC_USER_SESSION_KEYRING</b>, is defined that can be used in lieu of
    the actual serial number of the calling process's user session keyring.</p>
<p class="Pp">From the <b>keyctl</b>(1) utility, '<b>@us</b>' can be used
    instead of a numeric key ID in much the same way.</p>
<p class="Pp">User session keyrings are independent of <b>clone</b>(2),
    <b>fork</b>(2), <b>vfork</b>(2), <b>execve</b>(2), and <b>_exit</b>(2)
    excepting that the keyring is destroyed when the UID record is destroyed
    when the last process pinning it exits.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a user session keyring does not exist when it is accessed, it
    will be created.</p>
<p class="Pp">Rather than relying on the user session keyring, it is strongly
    recommended—especially if the process is running as root—that
    a <b>session-keyring</b>(7) be set explicitly, for example by
    <b>pam_keyinit</b>(8).</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The user session keyring was added to support situations where a
    process doesn't have a session keyring, perhaps because it was created via a
    pathway that didn't involve PAM (e.g., perhaps it was a daemon started by
    <b>inetd</b>(8)). In such a scenario, the user session keyring acts as a
    substitute for the <b>session-keyring</b>(7).</p>
