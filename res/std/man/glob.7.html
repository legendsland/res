<p class="Pp">glob - globbing pathnames</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Long ago, in UNIX&nbsp;V6, there was a program <i>/etc/glob</i>
    that would expand wildcard patterns. Soon afterward this became a shell
    built-in.</p>
<p class="Pp">These days there is also a library routine <b>glob</b>(3) that
    will perform this function for a user program.</p>
<p class="Pp">The rules are as follows (POSIX.2, 3.13).</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Wildcard_matching"><a class="permalink" href="#Wildcard_matching">Wildcard
  matching</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A string is a wildcard pattern if it contains one of the
    characters '?', '*', or '['. Globbing is the operation that expands a
    wildcard pattern into the list of pathnames matching the pattern. Matching
    is defined by:</p>
<p class="Pp">A '?' (not between brackets) matches any single character.</p>
<p class="Pp">A '*' (not between brackets) matches any string, including the
    empty string.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Character classes</b></p>
<p class="Pp">An expression "<i>[...]</i>" where the first character
    after the leading '[' is not an '!' matches a single character, namely any
    of the characters enclosed by the brackets. The string enclosed by the
    brackets cannot be empty; therefore ']' can be allowed between the brackets,
    provided that it is the first character. (Thus, "<i>[][!]</i>"
    matches the three characters '[', ']', and '!'.)</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Ranges</b></p>
<p class="Pp">There is one special convention: two characters separated by '-'
    denote a range. (Thus, "<i>[A-Fa-f0-9]</i>" is equivalent to
    "<i>[ABCDEFabcdef0123456789]</i>".) One may include '-' in its
    literal meaning by making it the first or last character between the
    brackets. (Thus, "<i>[]-]</i>" matches just the two characters ']'
    and '-', and "<i>[--0]</i>" matches the three characters '-', '.',
    and '0', since '/' cannot be matched.)</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Complementation</b></p>
<p class="Pp">An expression "<i>[!...]</i>" matches a single
    character, namely any character that is not matched by the expression
    obtained by removing the first '!' from it. (Thus, "<i>[!]a-]</i>"
    matches any single character except ']', 'a', and '-'.)</p>
<p class="Pp">One can remove the special meaning of '?', '*', and '[' by
    preceding them by a backslash, or, in case this is part of a shell command
    line, enclosing them in quotes. Between brackets these characters stand for
    themselves. Thus, "<i>[[?*\]</i>" matches the four characters '[',
    '?', '*', and '\'.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Pathnames"><a class="permalink" href="#Pathnames">Pathnames</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Globbing is applied on each of the components of a pathname
    separately. A '/' in a pathname cannot be matched by a '?' or '*' wildcard,
    or by a range like "<i>[.-0]</i>". A range containing an explicit
    '/' character is syntactically incorrect. (POSIX requires that syntactically
    incorrect patterns are left unchanged.)</p>
<p class="Pp">If a filename starts with a '.', this character must be matched
    explicitly. (Thus, <i>rm&nbsp;*</i> will not remove .profile, and
    <i>tar&nbsp;c&nbsp;*</i> will not archive all your files;
    <i>tar&nbsp;c&nbsp;.</i> is better.)</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Empty_lists"><a class="permalink" href="#Empty_lists">Empty
  lists</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The nice and simple rule given above: "expand a wildcard
    pattern into the list of matching pathnames" was the original UNIX
    definition. It allowed one to have patterns that expand into an empty list,
    as in</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre><br>
    xv -wait 0 *.gif *.jpg</pre>
<p class="Pp">where perhaps no *.gif files are present (and this is not an
    error). However, POSIX requires that a wildcard pattern is left unchanged
    when it is syntactically incorrect, or the list of matching pathnames is
    empty. With <i>bash</i> one can force the classical behavior using this
    command:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>shopt -s nullglob
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">(Similar problems occur elsewhere. For example, where old scripts
    have</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>rm `find . -name "*~"`
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">new scripts require</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>rm -f nosuchfile `find . -name "*~"`
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">to avoid error messages from <i>rm</i> called with an empty
    argument list.)</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Regular_expressions"><a class="permalink" href="#Regular_expressions">Regular
  expressions</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Note that wildcard patterns are not regular expressions, although
    they are a bit similar. First of all, they match filenames, rather than
    text, and secondly, the conventions are not the same: for example, in a
    regular expression '*' means zero or more copies of the preceding thing.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now that regular expressions have bracket expressions where the
    negation is indicated by a '^', POSIX has declared the effect of a wildcard
    pattern "<i>[^...]</i>" to be undefined.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Character_classes_and_internationalization"><a class="permalink" href="#Character_classes_and_internationalization">Character
  classes and internationalization</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Of course ranges were originally meant to be ASCII ranges, so that
    "<i>[&nbsp;-%]</i>" stands for
    "<i>[&nbsp;!"#$%]</i>" and "<i>[a-z]</i>" stands
    for "any lowercase letter". Some UNIX implementations generalized
    this so that a range X-Y stands for the set of characters with code between
    the codes for X and for Y. However, this requires the user to know the
    character coding in use on the local system, and moreover, is not convenient
    if the collating sequence for the local alphabet differs from the ordering
    of the character codes. Therefore, POSIX extended the bracket notation
    greatly, both for wildcard patterns and for regular expressions. In the
    above we saw three types of items that can occur in a bracket expression:
    namely (i) the negation, (ii) explicit single characters, and (iii) ranges.
    POSIX specifies ranges in an internationally more useful way and adds three
    more types:</p>
<p class="Pp">(iii) Ranges X-Y comprise all characters that fall between X and Y
    (inclusive) in the current collating sequence as defined by the
    <b>LC_COLLATE</b> category in the current locale.</p>
<p class="Pp">(iv) Named character classes, like</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>[:alnum:]  [:alpha:]  [:blank:]  [:cntrl:]
[:digit:]  [:graph:]  [:lower:]  [:print:]
[:punct:]  [:space:]  [:upper:]  [:xdigit:]</pre>
<p class="Pp">so that one can say "<i>[[:lower:]]</i>" instead of
    "<i>[a-z]</i>", and have things work in Denmark, too, where there
    are three letters past 'z' in the alphabet. These character classes are
    defined by the <b>LC_CTYPE</b> category in the current locale.</p>
<p class="Pp">(v) Collating symbols, like "<i>[.ch.]</i>" or
    "<i>[.a-acute.]</i>", where the string between
    "<i>[.</i>" and "<i>.]</i>" is a collating element
    defined for the current locale. Note that this may be a multicharacter
    element.</p>
<p class="Pp">(vi) Equivalence class expressions, like "<i>[=a=]</i>",
    where the string between "<i>[=</i>" and "<i>=]</i>" is
    any collating element from its equivalence class, as defined for the current
    locale. For example, "<i>[[=a=]]</i>" might be equivalent to
    "<i>[aáàäâ]</i>", that is, to
    "<i>[a[.a-acute.][.a-grave.][.a-umlaut.][.a-circumflex.]]</i>".</p>
