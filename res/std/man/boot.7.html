   I tried to be as much generic in the description as possible:
   - General boot sequence is applicable to almost any
   OS/Machine (DOS/PC, Linux/PC, Solaris/SPARC, CMS/S390)
   - kernel and init(1) is applicable to almost any UNIX/Linux
   - boot scripts are applicable to SYSV-R4 based UNIX/Linux

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>bootup process</b> (or "<b>boot sequence</b>")
    varies in details among systems, but can be roughly divided into phases
    controlled by the following components:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>(1)</dt>
  <dd>hardware</dd>
  <dt>(2)</dt>
  <dd>operating system (OS) loader</dd>
  <dt>(3)</dt>
  <dd>kernel</dd>
  <dt>(4)</dt>
  <dd>root user-space process (<i>init</i> and <i>inittab</i>)</dd>
  <dt>(5)</dt>
  <dd>boot scripts</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Each of these is described below in more detail.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Hardware"><a class="permalink" href="#Hardware">Hardware</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">After power-on or hard reset, control is given to a program stored
    in read-only memory (normally PROM); for historical reasons involving the
    personal computer, this program is often called "the
  <b>BIOS</b>".</p>
<p class="Pp">This program normally performs a basic self-test of the machine
    and accesses nonvolatile memory to read further parameters. This memory in
    the PC is battery-backed CMOS memory, so most people refer to it as
    "the <b>CMOS</b>"; outside of the PC world, it is usually called
    "the <b>NVRAM</b>" (nonvolatile RAM).</p>
<p class="Pp">The parameters stored in the NVRAM vary among systems, but as a
    minimum, they should specify which device can supply an OS loader, or at
    least which devices may be probed for one; such a device is known as
    "the <b>boot device</b>". The hardware boot stage loads the OS
    loader from a fixed position on the boot device, and then transfers control
    to it.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Note:"><a class="permalink" href="#Note:">Note:</a></dt>
  <dd>The device from which the OS loader is read may be attached via a network,
      in which case the details of booting are further specified by protocols
      such as DHCP, TFTP, PXE, Etherboot, etc.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="OS_loader"><a class="permalink" href="#OS_loader">OS
  loader</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The main job of the OS loader is to locate the kernel on some
    device, load it, and run it. Most OS loaders allow interactive use, in order
    to enable specification of an alternative kernel (maybe a backup in case the
    one last compiled isn't functioning) and to pass optional parameters to the
    kernel.</p>
<p class="Pp">In a traditional PC, the OS loader is located in the initial
    512-byte block of the boot device; this block is known as "the
    <b>MBR</b>" (Master Boot Record).</p>
<p class="Pp">In most systems, the OS loader is very limited due to various
    constraints. Even on non-PC systems, there are some limitations on the size
    and complexity of this loader, but the size limitation of the PC MBR (512
    bytes, including the partition table) makes it almost impossible to squeeze
    much functionality into it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Therefore, most systems split the role of loading the OS between a
    primary OS loader and a secondary OS loader; this secondary OS loader may be
    located within a larger portion of persistent storage, such as a disk
    partition.</p>
<p class="Pp">In Linux, the OS loader is often either <b>lilo</b>(8) or
    <b>grub</b>(8).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Kernel"><a class="permalink" href="#Kernel">Kernel</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When the kernel is loaded, it initializes various components of
    the computer and operating system; each portion of software responsible for
    such a task is usually consider "a <b>driver</b>" for the
    applicable component. The kernel starts the virtual memory swapper (it is a
    kernel process, called "kswapd" in a modern Linux kernel), and
    mounts some filesystem at the root path, <i>/</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some of the parameters that may be passed to the kernel relate to
    these activities (for example, the default root filesystem can be
    overridden); for further information on Linux kernel parameters, read
    <b>bootparam</b>(7).</p>
<p class="Pp">Only then does the kernel create the initial userland process,
    which is given the number 1 as its <b>PID</b> (process ID). Traditionally,
    this process executes the program <i>/sbin/init</i>, to which are passed the
    parameters that haven't already been handled by the kernel.</p>

  <dt id="Note:~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Note:~2">Note:</a></dt>
  <dd>The following description applies to an OS based on UNIX System V Release
      4. However, a number of widely used systems have adopted a related but
      fundamentally different approach known as <b>systemd</b>(1), for which the
      bootup process is detailed in its associated <b>bootup</b>(7).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">When <i>/sbin/init</i> starts, it reads <i>/etc/inittab</i> for
    further instructions. This file defines what should be run when the
    <i>/sbin/init</i> program is instructed to enter a particular run level,
    giving the administrator an easy way to establish an environment for some
    usage; each run level is associated with a set of services (for example, run
    level <b>S</b> is single-user mode, and run level <b>2</b> entails running
    most network services).</p>
<p class="Pp">The administrator may change the current run level via
    <b>init</b>(1), and query the current run level via <b>runlevel</b>(8).</p>
<p class="Pp">However, since it is not convenient to manage individual services
    by editing this file, <i>/etc/inittab</i> only bootstraps a set of scripts
    that actually start/stop the individual services.</p>

  <dd>The following description applies to an OS based on UNIX System V Release
      4. However, a number of widely used systems (Slackware Linux, FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD) have a somewhat different scheme for boot scripts.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">For each managed service (mail, nfs server, cron, etc.), there is
    a single startup script located in a specific directory (<i>/etc/init.d</i>
    in most versions of Linux). Each of these scripts accepts as a single
    argument the word "start" (causing it to start the service) or the
    word "stop" (causing it to stop the service). The script may
    optionally accept other "convenience" parameters (e.g.,
    "restart" to stop and then start, "status" to display
    the service status, etc.). Running the script without parameters displays
    the possible arguments.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Sequencing_directories"><a class="permalink" href="#Sequencing_directories">Sequencing
  directories</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">To make specific scripts start/stop at specific run levels and in
    a specific order, there are <i>sequencing directories</i>, normally of the
    form <i>/etc/rc[0-6S].d</i>. In each of these directories, there are links
    (usually symbolic) to the scripts in the <i>/etc/init.d</i> directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">A primary script (usually <i>/etc/rc</i>) is called from
    <b>inittab</b>(5); this primary script calls each service's script via a
    link in the relevant sequencing directory. Each link whose name begins with
    'S' is called with the argument "start" (thereby starting the
    service). Each link whose name begins with 'K' is called with the argument
    "stop" (thereby stopping the service).</p>
<p class="Pp">To define the starting or stopping order within the same run
    level, the name of a link contains an <b>order-number</b>. Also, for
    clarity, the name of a link usually ends with the name of the service to
    which it refers. For example, the link <i>/etc/rc2.d/S80sendmail</i> starts
    the <b>sendmail</b>(8) service on run level 2. This happens after
    <i>/etc/rc2.d/S12syslog</i> is run but before <i>/etc/rc2.d/S90xfs</i> is
    run.</p>
<p class="Pp">To manage these links is to manage the boot order and run levels;
    under many systems, there are tools to help with this task (e.g.,
    <b>chkconfig</b>(8)).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Boot_configuration"><a class="permalink" href="#Boot_configuration">Boot
  configuration</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A program that provides a service is often called a
    "<b>daemon</b>". Usually, a daemon may receive various
    command-line options and parameters. To allow a system administrator to
    change these inputs without editing an entire boot script, some separate
    configuration file is used, and is located in a specific directory where an
    associated boot script may find it (<i>/etc/sysconfig</i> on older Red Hat
    systems).</p>
<p class="Pp">In older UNIX systems, such a file contained the actual command
    line options for a daemon, but in modern Linux systems (and also in HP-UX),
    it just contains shell variables. A boot script in <i>/etc/init.d</i> reads
    and includes its configuration file (that is, it "<b>sources</b>"
    its configuration file) and then uses the variable values.</p>
