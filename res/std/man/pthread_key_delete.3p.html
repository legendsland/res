<p class="Pp">The <i>pthread_key_delete</i>() function shall delete a

    The thread-specific data values associated with <i>key</i> need not be NULL

    of the application to free any application storage or perform any cleanup
    actions for data structures related to the deleted key or associated
    thread-specific data in any threads; this cleanup can be done either before
    or after <i>pthread_key_delete</i>() is called. Any attempt to use

<p class="Pp">A thread-specific data key deletion function has been included in
    order to allow the resources associated with an unused thread-specific data
    key to be freed. Unused thread-specific data keys can arise, among other
    scenarios, when a dynamically loaded module that allocated a key is
    unloaded.</p>
<p class="Pp">Conforming applications are responsible for performing any cleanup
    actions needed for data structures associated with the key to be deleted,
    including data referenced by thread-specific data values. No such cleanup is
    done by <i>pthread_key_delete</i>(). In particular, destructor functions are
    not called. There are several reasons for this division of
  responsibility:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> 1.</dt>
  <dd>The associated destructor functions used to free thread-specific data at
      thread exit time are only guaranteed to work correctly when called in the
      thread that allocated the thread-specific data. (Destructors themselves
      may utilize thread-specific data.) Thus, they cannot be used to free
      thread-specific data in other threads at key deletion time. Attempting to
      have them called by other threads at key deletion time would require other
      threads to be asynchronously interrupted. But since interrupted threads
      could be in an arbitrary state, including holding locks necessary for the
      destructor to run, this approach would fail. In general, there is no safe
      mechanism whereby an implementation could free thread-specific data at key
      deletion time.</dd>
  <dt> 2.</dt>
  <dd>Even if there were a means of safely freeing thread-specific data
      associated with keys to be deleted, doing so would require that
      implementations be able to enumerate the threads with non-NULL data and
      potentially keep them from creating more thread-specific data while the
      key deletion is occurring. This special case could cause extra
      synchronization in the normal case, which would otherwise be
    unnecessary.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">For an application to know that it is safe to delete a key, it has
    to know that all the threads that might potentially ever use the key do not
    attempt to use it again. For example, it could know this if all the client
    threads have called a cleanup procedure declaring that they are through with
    the module that is being shut down, perhaps by setting a reference count to
    zero.</p>
<p class="Pp">If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
    <i>key</i> argument to <i>pthread_key_delete</i>() does not refer to a a key
    value obtained from <i>pthread_key_create</i>() or refers to a key that has
    been deleted with <i>pthread_key_delete</i>(), it is recommended that the
    function should fail and report an <b>[EINVAL]</b> error.</p>
