<p class="Pp">A FIFO special file (a named pipe) is similar to a pipe, except
    that it is accessed as part of the filesystem. It can be opened by multiple
    processes for reading or writing. When processes are exchanging data via the
    FIFO, the kernel passes all data internally without writing it to the
    filesystem. Thus, the FIFO special file has no contents on the filesystem;
    the filesystem entry merely serves as a reference point so that processes
    can access the pipe using a name in the filesystem.</p>
<p class="Pp">The kernel maintains exactly one pipe object for each FIFO special
    file that is opened by at least one process. The FIFO must be opened on both
    ends (reading and writing) before data can be passed. Normally, opening the
    FIFO blocks until the other end is opened also.</p>
<p class="Pp">A process can open a FIFO in nonblocking mode. In this case,
    opening for read-only succeeds even if no one has opened on the write side
    yet and opening for write-only fails with <b>ENXIO</b> (no such device or
    address) unless the other end has already been opened.</p>
<p class="Pp">Under Linux, opening a FIFO for read and write will succeed both
    in blocking and nonblocking mode. POSIX leaves this behavior undefined. This
    can be used to open a FIFO for writing while there are no readers available.
    A process that uses both ends of the connection in order to communicate with
    itself should be very careful to avoid deadlocks.</p>

<p class="Pp">When a process tries to write to a FIFO that is not opened for
    read on the other side, the process is sent a <b>SIGPIPE</b> signal.</p>
<p class="Pp">FIFO special files can be created by <b>mkfifo</b>(3), and are
    indicated by <i>ls&nbsp;-l</i> with the file type 'p'.</p>
