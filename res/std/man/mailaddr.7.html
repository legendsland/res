   Extensively rewritten by Arnt Gulbrandsen <agulbra@troll.no>.  My
   changes are placed under the same copyright as the original BSD page.
  
   Adjusted by Arnt Gulbrandsen <arnt@gulbrandsen.priv.no> in 2004 to
   account for changes since 1995. Route-addrs are now even less
   common, etc. Some minor wording improvements. Same copyright.

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This manual page gives a brief introduction to SMTP mail
    addresses, as used on the Internet. These addresses are in the general
    format</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>user@domain
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">where a domain is a hierarchical dot-separated list of subdomains.
    These examples are valid forms of the same address:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>john.doe@monet.example.com
John Doe &lt;john.doe@monet.example.com&gt;
john.doe@monet.example.com (John Doe)
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">The domain part ("monet.example.com") is a
    mail-accepting domain. It can be a host and in the past it usually was, but
    it doesn't have to be. The domain part is not case sensitive.</p>
<p class="Pp">The local part ("john.doe") is often a username, but its
    meaning is defined by the local software. Sometimes it is case sensitive,
    although that is unusual. If you see a local-part that looks like garbage,
    it is usually because of a gateway between an internal e-mail system and the
    net, here are some examples:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>"surname/admd=telemail/c=us/o=hp/prmd=hp"@some.where
USER%SOMETHING@some.where
machine!machine!name@some.where
I2461572@some.where
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">(These are, respectively, an X.400 gateway, a gateway to an
    arbitrary internal mail system that lacks proper internet support, an UUCP
    gateway, and the last one is just boring username policy.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The real-name part ("John Doe") can either be placed
    before &lt;&gt;, or in () at the end. (Strictly speaking the two aren't the
    same, but the difference is beyond the scope of this page.) The name may
    have to be quoted using "", for example, if it contains
    ".":</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>"John Q. Doe" &lt;john.doe@monet.example.com&gt;
</pre>
<br>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Abbreviation"><a class="permalink" href="#Abbreviation">Abbreviation</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Some mail systems let users abbreviate the domain name. For
    instance, users at example.com may get away with "john.doe@monet"
    to send mail to John Doe. <i>This behavior is deprecated.</i> Sometimes it
    works, but you should not depend on it.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Route-addrs"><a class="permalink" href="#Route-addrs">Route-addrs</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In the past, sometimes one had to route a message through several
    hosts to get it to its final destination. Addresses which show these relays
    are termed "route-addrs". These use the syntax:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>&lt;@hosta,@hostb:user@hostc&gt;
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">This specifies that the message should be sent to hosta, from
    there to hostb, and finally to hostc. Many hosts disregard route-addrs and
    send directly to hostc.</p>
<p class="Pp">Route-addrs are very unusual now. They occur sometimes in old mail
    archives. It is generally possible to ignore all but the
    "user@hostc" part of the address to determine the actual
  address.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Postmaster"><a class="permalink" href="#Postmaster">Postmaster</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Every site is required to have a user or user alias designated
    "postmaster" to which problems with the mail system may be
    addressed. The "postmaster" address is not case sensitive.</p>
