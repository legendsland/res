<h1 class="Sh" id="APPLICATION_USAGE"><a class="permalink" href="#APPLICATION_USAGE">APPLICATION
  USAGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <i>sigaction</i>() function supersedes the <i>signal</i>()
    function, and should be used in preference. In particular,
    <i>sigaction</i>() and <i>signal</i>() should not be used in the same
    process to control the same signal. The behavior of async-signal-safe
    functions, as defined in their respective DESCRIPTION sections, is as
    specified by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, regardless of invocation
    from a signal-catching function. This is the only intended meaning of the
    statement that async-signal-safe functions may be used in signal-catching
    functions without restrictions. Applications must still consider all effects
    of such functions on such things as data structures, files, and process
    state. In particular, application developers need to consider the
    restrictions on interactions when interrupting <i>sleep</i>() and
    interactions among multiple handles for a file description. The fact that
    any specific function is listed as async-signal-safe does not necessarily
    mean that invocation of that function from a signal-catching function is
    recommended.</p>
<p class="Pp">In order to prevent errors arising from interrupting
    non-async-signal-safe function calls, applications should protect calls to
    these functions either by blocking the appropriate signals or through the
    use of some programmatic semaphore (see <i><i>semget</i>()</i>,
    <i><i>sem_init</i>()</i>, <i><i>sem_open</i>()</i>, and so on). Note in
    particular that even the ``safe'' functions may modify <i>errno</i>; the
    signal-catching function, if not executing as an independent thread, should
    save and restore its value in order to avoid the possibility that delivery
    of a signal in between an error return from a function that sets
    <i>errno</i> and the subsequent examination of <i>errno</i> could result in
    the signal-catching function changing the value of <i>errno</i>. Naturally,
    the same principles apply to the async-signal-safety of application routines
    and asynchronous data access. Note that <i>longjmp</i>() and
    <i>siglongjmp</i>() are not in the list of async-signal-safe functions. This
    is because the code executing after <i>longjmp</i>() and <i>siglongjmp</i>()
    can call any unsafe functions with the same danger as calling those unsafe
    functions directly from the signal handler. Applications that use
    <i>longjmp</i>() and <i>siglongjmp</i>() from within signal handlers require
    rigorous protection in order to be portable. Many of the other functions
    that are excluded from the list are traditionally implemented using either
    <i>malloc</i>() or <i>free</i>() functions or the standard I/O library, both
    of which traditionally use data structures in a non-async-signal-safe
    manner. Since any combination of different functions using a common data
    structure can cause async-signal-safety problems, this volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017 does not define the behavior when any unsafe function is
    called in a signal handler that interrupts an unsafe function.</p>
<p class="Pp">Usually, the signal is executed on the stack that was in effect
    before the signal was delivered. An alternate stack may be specified to
    receive a subset of the signals being caught.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the signal handler returns, the receiving thread resumes
    execution at the point it was interrupted unless the signal handler makes
    other arrangements. If <i>longjmp</i>() or <i>_longjmp</i>() is used to
    leave the signal handler, then the signal mask must be explicitly
  restored.</p>
<p class="Pp">This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defines the third argument of a
    signal handling function when SA_SIGINFO is set as a <b>void *</b> instead
    of a <b>ucontext_t *</b>, but without requiring type checking. New
    applications should explicitly cast the third argument of the signal
    handling function to <b>ucontext_t *</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The BSD optional four argument signal handling function is not
    supported by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017. The BSD declaration would
    be:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>void handler(int <i>sig</i>, int <i>code</i>, struct sigcontext *<i>scp</i>,
<br>
    char *<i>addr</i>);</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">where <i>sig</i> is the signal number, <i>code</i> is additional
    information on certain signals, <i>scp</i> is a pointer to the
    <b>sigcontext</b> structure, and <i>addr</i> is additional address
    information. Much the same information is available in the objects pointed
    to by the second argument of the signal handler specified when SA_SIGINFO is
    set.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since the <i>sigaction</i>() function is allowed but not required
    to set SA_NODEFER when the application sets the SA_RESETHAND flag,
    applications which depend on the SA_RESETHAND functionality for the newly
    installed signal handler must always explicitly set SA_NODEFER when they set
    SA_RESETHAND in order to be portable.</p>
<p class="Pp">See also the rationale for Realtime Signal Generation and Delivery
    in the Rationale (Informative) volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section
    B.2.4.2</i>, <i>Signal Generation and Delivery</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="permalink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Although this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires that signals
    that cannot be ignored shall not be added to the signal mask when a
    signal-catching function is entered, there is no explicit requirement that
    subsequent calls to <i>sigaction</i>() reflect this in the information
    returned in the <i>oact</i> argument. In other words, if SIGKILL is included
    in the <i>sa_mask</i> field of <i>act</i>, it is unspecified whether or not
    a subsequent call to <i>sigaction</i>() returns with SIGKILL included in the
    <i>sa_mask</i> field of <i>oact</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The SA_NOCLDSTOP flag, when supplied in the
    <i>act</i>-&gt;<i>sa_flags</i> parameter, allows overloading SIGCHLD with
    the System V semantics that each SIGCLD signal indicates a single terminated
    child. Most conforming applications that catch SIGCHLD are expected to
    install signal-catching functions that repeatedly call the <i>waitpid</i>()
    function with the WNOHANG flag set, acting on each child for which status is
    returned, until <i>waitpid</i>() returns zero. If stopped children are not
    of interest, the use of the SA_NOCLDSTOP flag can prevent the overhead from
    invoking the signal-catching routine when they stop.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some historical implementations also define other mechanisms for
    stopping processes, such as the <i>ptrace</i>() function. These
    implementations usually do not generate a SIGCHLD signal when processes stop
    due to this mechanism; however, that is beyond the scope of this volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017.</p>
<p class="Pp">This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires that calls to
    <i>sigaction</i>() that supply a NULL <i>act</i> argument succeed, even in
    the case of signals that cannot be caught or ignored (that is, SIGKILL or
    SIGSTOP). The System V <i>signal</i>() and BSD <i>sigvec</i>() functions
    return <b>[EINVAL]</b> in these cases and, in this respect, their behavior
    varies from <i>sigaction</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires that
    <i>sigaction</i>() properly save and restore a signal action set up by the
    ISO&nbsp;C standard <i>signal</i>() function. However, there is no
    guarantee that the reverse is true, nor could there be given the greater
    amount of information conveyed by the <b>sigaction</b> structure. Because of
    this, applications should avoid using both functions for the same signal in
    the same process. Since this cannot always be avoided in case of
    general-purpose library routines, they should always be implemented with
    <i>sigaction</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">It was intended that the <i>signal</i>() function should be
    implementable as a library routine using <i>sigaction</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">The POSIX Realtime Extension extends the <i>sigaction</i>()
    function as specified by the POSIX.1‐1990 standard to allow the
    application to request on a per-signal basis via an additional signal action
    flag that the extra parameters, including the application-defined signal
    value, if any, be passed to the signal-catching function.</p>
