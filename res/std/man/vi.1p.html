<p class="Pp">This utility shall be provided on systems that both support the
    User Portability Utilities option and define the POSIX2_CHAR_TERM symbol. On
    other systems it is optional.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>vi</i> (visual) utility is a screen-oriented text editor.
    Only the open and visual modes of the editor are described in
    POSIX.1‐2008; see the line editor <i>ex</i> for additional editing
    capabilities used in <i>vi</i>. The user can switch back and forth between
    <i>vi</i> and <i>ex</i> and execute <i>ex</i> commands from within
    <i>vi</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">This reference page uses the term <i>edit buffer</i> to describe
    the current working text. No specific implementation is implied by this
    term. All editing changes are performed on the edit buffer, and no changes
    to it shall affect any file until an editor command writes the file.</p>
<p class="Pp">When using <i>vi</i>, the terminal screen acts as a window into
    the editing buffer. Changes made to the editing buffer shall be reflected in
    the screen display; the position of the cursor on the screen shall indicate
    the position within the editing buffer.</p>
<p class="Pp">Certain terminals do not have all the capabilities necessary to
    support the complete <i>vi</i> definition. When these commands cannot be
    supported on such terminals, this condition shall not produce an error
    message such as ``not an editor command'' or report a syntax error. The
    implementation may either accept the commands and produce results on the
    screen that are the result of an unsuccessful attempt to meet the
    requirements of this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 or report an error
    describing the terminal-related deficiency.</p>

<p class="Pp">In the remainder of the description of the <i>vi</i> utility, the
    term ``buffer line'' refers to a line in the edit buffer and the term
    ``display line'' refers to the line or lines on the display screen used to
    display one buffer line. The term ``current line'' refers to a specific
    ``buffer line''.</p>
<p class="Pp">If there are display lines on the screen for which there are no
    corresponding buffer lines because they correspond to lines that would be
    after the end of the file, they shall be displayed as a single &lt;tilde&gt;
    (<b>'~'</b>) character, plus the terminating &lt;newline&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The last line of the screen shall be used to report errors or
    display informational messages. It shall also be used to display the input
    for ``line-oriented commands'' (<b>/</b>, <b>?</b>, <b>:</b>, and <b>!</b>).
    When a line-oriented command is executed, the editor shall enter text input
    mode on the last line on the screen, using the respective command characters
    as prompt characters. (In the case of the <b>!</b> command, the associated
    motion shall be entered by the user before the editor enters text input
    mode.) The line entered by the user shall be terminated by a
    &lt;newline&gt;, a non-&lt;control&gt;‐V-escaped
    &lt;carriage-return&gt;, or unescaped &lt;ESC&gt;. It is unspecified if more
    characters than require a display width minus one column number of screen
    columns can be entered.</p>
<p class="Pp">If any command is executed that overwrites a portion of the screen
    other than the last line of the screen (for example, the <i>ex</i>
    <b>suspend</b> or <b>!</b> commands), other than the <i>ex</i> <b>shell</b>
    command, the user shall be prompted for a character before the screen is
    refreshed and the edit session continued.</p>
<p class="Pp">&lt;tab&gt; characters shall take up the number of columns on the
    screen set by the <b>tabstop</b> edit option (see <i>ex</i>), unless there
    are less than that number of columns before the display margin that will
    cause the displayed line to be folded; in this case, they shall only take up
    the number of columns up to that boundary.</p>
<p class="Pp">The cursor shall be placed on the current line and relative to the
    current column as specified by each command described in the following
    sections.</p>
<p class="Pp">In open mode, if the current line is not already displayed, then
    it shall be displayed.</p>
<p class="Pp">In visual mode, if the current line is not displayed, then the
    lines that are displayed shall be expanded, scrolled, or redrawn to cause an
    unspecified portion of the current line to be displayed. If the screen is
    redrawn, no more than the number of display lines specified by the value of
    the <b>window</b> edit option shall be displayed (unless the current line
    cannot be completely displayed in the number of display lines specified by
    the <b>window</b> edit option) and the current line shall be positioned as
    close to the center of the displayed lines as possible (within the
    constraints imposed by the distance of the line from the beginning or end of
    the edit buffer). If the current line is before the first line in the
    display and the screen is scrolled, an unspecified portion of the current
    line shall be placed on the first line of the display. If the current line
    is after the last line in the display and the screen is scrolled, an
    unspecified portion of the current line shall be placed on the last line of
    the display.</p>
<p class="Pp">In visual mode, if a line from the edit buffer (other than the
    current line) does not entirely fit into the lines at the bottom of the
    display that are available for its presentation, the editor may choose not
    to display any portion of the line. The lines of the display that do not
    contain text from the edit buffer for this reason shall each consist of a
    single <b>'@'</b> character.</p>
<p class="Pp">In visual mode, the editor may choose for unspecified reasons to
    not update lines in the display to correspond to the underlying edit buffer
    text. The lines of the display that do not correctly correspond to text from
    the edit buffer for this reason shall consist of a single <b>'@'</b>
    character (plus the terminating &lt;newline&gt;), and the
    &lt;control&gt;‐R command shall cause the editor to update the screen
    to correctly represent the edit buffer.</p>
<p class="Pp">Open and visual mode commands that set the current column set it
    to a column position in the display, and not a character position in the
    line. In this case, however, the column position in the display shall be
    calculated for an infinite width display; for example, the column related to
    a character that is part of a line that has been folded onto additional
    screen lines will be offset from the display line column where the buffer
    line begins, not from the beginning of a particular display line.</p>
<p class="Pp">The display cursor column in the display is based on the value of
    the current column, as follows, with each rule applied in turn:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> 1.</dt>
  <dd>If the current column is after the last display line column used by the
      displayed line, the display cursor column shall be set to the last display
      line column occupied by the last non-&lt;newline&gt; in the current line;
      otherwise, the display cursor column shall be set to the current
    column.</dd>
  <dt> 2.</dt>
  <dd>If the character of which some portion is displayed in the display line
      column specified by the display cursor column requires more than a single
      display line column:</dd>

    characters, an optional new <b>window</b> edit option value, zero or more

<p class="Pp">See the RATIONALE for <i><i>ex</i></i> for more information on
    <i>vi</i>. Major portions of the <i>vi</i> utility specification point to
    <i>ex</i> to avoid inadvertent divergence. While <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i>
    have historically been implemented as a single utility, this is not required
    by POSIX.1‐2008.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is recognized that portions of <i>vi</i> would be difficult, if
    not impossible, to implement satisfactorily on a block-mode terminal, or a
    terminal without any form of cursor addressing, thus it is not a mandatory
    requirement that such features should work on all terminals. It is the
    intention, however, that a <i>vi</i> implementation should provide the full
    set of capabilities on all terminals capable of supporting them.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, <i>vi</i> exited immediately if the standard input
    was not a terminal. POSIX.1‐2008 permits, but does not require, this
    behavior. An end-of-file condition is not equivalent to an end-of-file
    character. A common end-of-file character, &lt;control&gt;‐D, is
    historically a <i>vi</i> command.</p>
<p class="Pp">The text in the STDOUT section reflects the usage of the verb
    <i>display</i> in this section; some implementations of <i>vi</i> use
    standard output to write to the terminal, but POSIX.1‐2008 does not
    require that to be the case.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, implementations reverted to open mode if the
    terminal was incapable of supporting full visual mode. POSIX.1‐2008
    requires this behavior. Historically, the open mode of <i>vi</i> behaved
    roughly equivalently to the visual mode, with the exception that only a
    single line from the edit buffer (one ``buffer line'') was kept current at
    any time. This line was normally displayed on the next-to-last line of a
    terminal with cursor addressing (and the last line performed its normal
    visual functions for line-oriented commands and messages). In addition, some
    few commands behaved differently in open mode than in visual mode.
    POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical practice.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> implementations have
    expected text to proceed in the usual European/Latin order of left to right,
    top to bottom. There is no requirement in POSIX.1‐2008 that this be
    the case. The specification was deliberately written using words like
    ``before'', ``after'', ``first'', and ``last'' in order to permit
    implementations to support the natural text order of the language.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, lines past the end of the edit buffer were marked
    with single &lt;tilde&gt; (<b>'~'</b>) characters; that is, if the one-based
    display was 20 lines in length, and the last line of the file was on line
    one, then lines 2-20 would contain only a single <b>'~'</b> character.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <i>vi</i> editor attempted to display only
    complete lines at the bottom of the screen (it did display partial lines at
    the top of the screen). If a line was too long to fit in its entirety at the
    bottom of the screen, the screen lines where the line would have been
    displayed were displayed as single <b>'@'</b> characters, instead of
    displaying part of the line. POSIX.1‐2008 permits, but does not
    require, this behavior. Implementations are encouraged to attempt always to
    display a complete line at the bottom of the screen when doing scrolling or
    screen positioning by buffer lines.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, lines marked with <b>'@'</b> were also used to
    minimize output to dumb terminals over slow lines; that is, changes local to
    the cursor were updated, but changes to lines on the screen that were not
    close to the cursor were simply marked with an <b>'@'</b> sign instead of
    being updated to match the current text. POSIX.1‐2008 permits, but
    does not require this feature because it is used ever less frequently as
    terminals become smarter and connections are faster.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">Initialization in ex and vi</h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, <i>vi</i> always had a line in the edit buffer, even
    if the edit buffer was ``empty''. For example:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> 1.</dt>
  <dd>The <i>ex</i> command <b>=</b> executed from visual mode wrote ``1'' when
      the buffer was empty.</dd>
  <dt> 2.</dt>
  <dd>Writes from visual mode of an empty edit buffer wrote files of a single
      character (a &lt;newline&gt;), while writes from <i>ex</i> mode of an
      empty edit buffer wrote empty files.</dd>
  <dt> 3.</dt>
  <dd>Put and read commands into an empty edit buffer left an empty line at the
      top of the edit buffer.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">For consistency, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit any of these
    behaviors.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, <i>vi</i> did not always return the terminal to its
    original modes; for example, ICRNL was modified if it was not originally
    set. POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">Command Descriptions in vi</h2>
<p class="Pp">Motion commands are among the most complicated aspects of
    <i>vi</i> to describe. With some exceptions, the text region and buffer type
    effect of a motion command on a <i>vi</i> command are described on a
    case-by-case basis. The descriptions of text regions in POSIX.1‐2008
    are not intended to imply direction; that is, an inclusive region from line
    <i>n</i> to line <i>n</i>+5 is identical to a region from line <i>n</i>+5 to
    line <i>n</i>. This is of more than academic interest—movements to
    marks can be in either direction, and, if the <b>wrapscan</b> option is set,
    so can movements to search points. Historically, lines are always stored
    into buffers in text order; that is, from the start of the edit buffer to
    the end. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical
  practice.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, command counts were applied to any associated
    motion, and were multiplicative to any supplied motion count. For example,
    <b>2cw</b> is the same as <b>c2w</b>, and <b>2c3w</b> is the same as
    <b>c6w</b>. POSIX.1‐2008 requires this behavior. Historically,
    <i>vi</i> commands that used bigwords, words, paragraphs, and sentences as
    objects treated groups of empty lines, or lines that contained only
    &lt;blank&gt; characters, inconsistently. Some commands treated them as a
    single entity, while others treated each line separately. For example, the
    <b>w</b>, <b>W</b>, and <b>B</b> commands treated groups of empty lines as
    individual words; that is, the command would move the cursor to each new
    empty line. The <b>e</b> and <b>E</b> commands treated groups of empty lines
    as a single word; that is, the first use would move past the group of lines.
    The <b>b</b> command would just beep at the user, or if done from the start
    of the line as a motion command, fail in unexpected ways. If the lines
    contained only (or ended with) &lt;blank&gt; characters, the <b>w</b> and
    <b>W</b> commands would just beep at the user, the <b>E</b> and <b>e</b>
    commands would treat the group as a single word, and the <b>B</b> and
    <b>b</b> commands would treat the lines as individual words. For consistency
    and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1‐2008 requires that all
    <i>vi</i> commands treat groups of empty or blank lines as a single entity,
    and that movement through lines ending with &lt;blank&gt; characters be
    consistent with other movements.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, <i>vi</i> documentation indicated that any number of
    double-quotes were skipped after punctuation marks at sentence boundaries;
    however, implementations only skipped single-quotes. POSIX.1‐2008
    requires both to be skipped.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the first and last characters in the edit buffer
    were word boundaries. This historical practice is required by
    POSIX.1‐2008.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, <i>vi</i> attempted to update the minimum number of
    columns on the screen possible, which could lead to misleading information
    being displayed. POSIX.1‐2008 makes no requirements other than that
    the current character being entered is displayed correctly, leaving all
    other decisions in this area up to the implementation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, lines were arbitrarily folded between columns of any
    characters that required multiple column positions on the screen, with the
    exception of tabs, which terminated at the right-hand margin.
    POSIX.1‐2008 permits the former and requires the latter.
    Implementations that do not arbitrarily break lines between columns of
    characters that occupy multiple column positions should not permit the
    cursor to rest on a column that does not contain any part of a
  character.</p>
<p class="Pp">The historical <i>vi</i> had a problem in that all movements were
    by buffer lines, not by display or screen lines. This is often the right
    thing to do; for example, single line movements, such as <b>j</b> or
    <b>k</b>, should work on buffer lines. Commands like <b>dj</b>, or
    <b>j.</b>, where <b>.</b> is a change command, only make sense for buffer
    lines. It is not, however, the right thing to do for screen motion or
    scrolling commands like &lt;control&gt;‐D, &lt;control&gt;‐F,
    and <b>H</b>. If the window is fairly small, using buffer lines in these
    cases can result in completely random motion; for example,
    <b>1</b>&lt;control&gt;<b>‐D</b> can result in a completely changed
    screen, without any overlap. This is clearly not what the user wanted. The
    problem is even worse in the case of the <b>H</b>, <b>L</b>, and <b>M</b>
    commands—as they position the cursor at the first non-&lt;blank&gt;
    of the line, they may all refer to the same location in large lines, and
    will result in no movement at all.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition, if the line is larger than the screen, using buffer
    lines can make it impossible to display parts of the line—there are
    not any commands that do not display the beginning of the line in historical
    <i>vi</i>, and if both the beginning and end of the line cannot be on the
    screen at the same time, the user suffers. Finally, the page and half-page
    scrolling commands historically moved to the first non-&lt;blank&gt; in the
    new line. If the line is approximately the same size as the screen, this is
    inadequate because the cursor before and after a &lt;control&gt;‐D
    command will refer to the same location on the screen.</p>
<p class="Pp">Implementations of <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> exist that do not have
    these problems because the relevant commands (&lt;control&gt;‐B,
    &lt;control&gt;‐D, &lt;control&gt;‐F,
    &lt;control&gt;‐U, &lt;control&gt;‐Y,
    &lt;control&gt;‐E, <b>H</b>, <b>L</b>, and <b>M)</b> operate on
    display (screen) lines, not (edit) buffer lines.</p>
<p class="Pp">POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior by default
    because the standard developers believed that users would find it too
    confusing. However, historical practice has been relaxed. For example,
    <i>ex</i> and <i>vi</i> historically attempted, albeit sometimes
    unsuccessfully, to never put part of a line on the last lines of a screen;
    for example, if a line would not fit in its entirety, no part of the line
    was displayed, and the screen lines corresponding to the line contained
    single <b>'@'</b> characters. This behavior is permitted, but not required
    by POSIX.1‐2008, so that it is possible for implementations to
    support long lines in small screens more reasonably without changing the
    commands to be oriented to the display (instead of oriented to the buffer).
    POSIX.1‐2008 also permits implementations to refuse to edit any edit
    buffer containing a line that will not fit on the screen in its
  entirety.</p>
<p class="Pp">The display area (for example, the value of the <b>window</b> edit
    option) has historically been ``grown'', or expanded, to display new text
    when local movements are done in displays where the number of lines
    displayed is less than the maximum possible. Expansion has historically been
    the first choice, when the target line is less than the maximum possible
    expansion value away. Scrolling has historically been the next choice, done
    when the target line is less than half a display away, and otherwise, the
    screen was redrawn. There were exceptions, however, in that <i>ex</i>
    commands generally always caused the screen to be redrawn.
    POSIX.1‐2008 does not specify a standard behavior because there may
    be external issues, such as connection speed, the number of characters
    necessary to redraw as opposed to scroll, or terminal capabilities that
    implementations will have to accommodate.</p>
<p class="Pp">The current line in POSIX.1‐2008 maps one-to-one to a
    buffer line in the file. The current column does not. There are two
    different column values that are described by POSIX.1‐2008. The first
    is the current column value as set by many of the <i>vi</i> commands. This
    value is remembered for the lifetime of the editor. The second column value
    is the actual position on the screen where the cursor rests. The two are not
    always the same. For example, when the cursor is backed by a multi-column
    character, the actual cursor position on the screen has historically been
    the last column of the character in command mode, and the first column of
    the character in input mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">Commands that set the current line, but that do not set the
    current cursor value (for example, <b>j</b> and <b>k</b>) attempt to get as
    close as possible to the remembered column position, so that the cursor
    tends to restrict itself to a vertical column as the user moves around in
    the edit buffer. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical
    practice, requiring that the display location of the cursor on the display
    line be adjusted from the current column value as necessary to support this
    historical behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, only a single line (and for some terminals, a single
    line minus 1 column) of characters could be entered by the user for the
    line-oriented commands; that is, <b>:</b>, <b>!</b>, <b>/</b>, or <b>?</b>.
    POSIX.1‐2008 permits, but does not require, this limitation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, ``soft'' errors in <i>vi</i> caused the terminal to
    be alerted, but no error message was displayed. As a general rule, no error
    message was displayed for errors in command execution in <i>vi</i>, when the
    error resulted from the user attempting an invalid or impossible action, or
    when a searched-for object was not found. Examples of soft errors included
    <b>h</b> at the left margin, &lt;control&gt;‐B or <b>[[</b> at the
    beginning of the file, <b>2G</b> at the end of the file, and so on. In
    addition, errors such as <b>%</b>, <b>]]</b>, <b>}</b>, <b>)</b>, <b>N</b>,
    <b>n</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>t</b>, and <b>T</b> failing to find the
    searched-for object were soft as well. Less consistently, <b>/</b> and
    <b>?</b> displayed an error message if the pattern was not found, <b>/</b>,
    <b>?</b>, <b>N</b>, and <b>n</b> displayed an error message if no previous
    regular expression had been specified, and <b>;</b> did not display an error
    message if no previous <b>f</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>t</b>, or <b>T</b> command had
    occurred. Also, behavior in this area might reasonably be based on a runtime
    evaluation of the speed of a network connection. Finally, some
    implementations have provided error messages for soft errors in order to
    assist naive users, based on the value of a verbose edit option.
    POSIX.1‐2008 does not list specific errors for which an error message
    shall be displayed. Implementations should conform to historical practice in
    the absence of any strong reason to diverge.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">Page Backwards</h2>
<p class="Pp">The &lt;control&gt;‐B and &lt;control&gt;‐F commands
    historically considered it an error to attempt to page past the beginning or
    end of the file, whereas the &lt;control&gt;‐D and
    &lt;control&gt;‐U commands simply moved to the beginning or end of
    the file. For consistency, POSIX.1‐2008 requires the latter behavior
    for all four commands. All four commands still consider it an error if the
    current line is at the beginning (&lt;control&gt;‐B,
    &lt;control&gt;‐U) or end (&lt;control&gt;‐F,
    &lt;control&gt;‐D) of the file. Historically, the
    &lt;control&gt;‐B and &lt;control&gt;‐F commands skip two
    lines in order to include overlapping lines when a single command is
    entered. This makes less sense in the presence of a <i>count</i>, as there
    will be, by definition, no overlapping lines. The actual calculation used by
    historical implementations of the <i>vi</i> editor for
    &lt;control&gt;‐B was:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>((current first line) - count x (window edit option)) +2</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">and for &lt;control&gt;‐F was:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>((current first line) + count x (window edit option)) -2</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This calculation does not work well when intermixing commands with
    and without counts; for example, <b>3</b>&lt;control&gt;‐F is not
    equivalent to entering the &lt;control&gt;‐F command three times, and
    is not reversible by entering the &lt;control&gt;‐B command three
    times. For consistency with other <i>vi</i> commands that take counts,
    POSIX.1‐2008 requires a different calculation.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">Scroll Forward</h2>
<p class="Pp">The 4BSD and System V implementations of <i>vi</i> differed on the
    initial value used by the <b>scroll</b> command. 4BSD used:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>((window edit option) +1) /2</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">while System V used the value of the <b>scroll</b> edit option.
    The System V version is specified by POSIX.1‐2008 because the
    standard developers believed that it was more intuitive and permitted the
    user a method of setting the scroll value initially without also setting the
    number of lines that are displayed.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">Scroll Forward by Line</h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the &lt;control&gt;‐E and
    &lt;control&gt;‐Y commands considered it an error if the last and
    first lines, respectively, were already on the screen. POSIX.1‐2008
    requires conformance to historical practice. Historically, the
    &lt;control&gt;‐E and &lt;control&gt;‐Y commands had no effect
    in open mode. For simplicity and consistency of specification,
    POSIX.1‐2008 requires that they behave as usual, albeit with a single
    line screen.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">Clear and Redisplay</h2>
<p class="Pp">The historical &lt;control&gt;‐L command refreshed the
    screen exactly as it was supposed to be currently displayed, replacing any
    <b>'@'</b> characters for lines that had been deleted but not updated on the
    screen with refreshed <b>'@'</b> characters. The intent of the
    &lt;control&gt;‐L command is to refresh when the screen has been
    accidentally overwritten; for example, by a <b>write</b> command from
    another user, or modem noise.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">Redraw Screen</h2>
<p class="Pp">The historical &lt;control&gt;‐R command redisplayed only
    when necessary to update lines that had been deleted but not updated on the
    screen and that were flagged with <b>'@'</b> characters. There is no
    requirement that the screen be in any way refreshed if no lines of this form
    are currently displayed. POSIX.1‐2008 permits implementations to
    extend this command to refresh lines on the screen flagged with <b>'@'</b>
    characters because they are too long to be displayed in the current
    framework; however, the current line and column need not be modified.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">Search for tagstring</h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the first non-&lt;blank&gt; at or after the cursor
    was the first character, and all subsequent characters that were word
    characters, up to the end of the line, were included. For example, with the
    cursor on the leading &lt;space&gt; or on the <b>'#'</b> character in the
    text <b>"#bar@"</b>, the tag was <b>"#bar"</b>. On the
    character <b>'b'</b> it was <b>"bar"</b>, and on the <b>'a'</b> it
    was <b>"ar"</b>. POSIX.1‐2008 requires this behavior.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">Replace Text with Results from Shell Command</h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;</b>, and <b>!</b> commands
    considered most cursor motions other than line-oriented motions an error;
    for example, the command <b>&gt;/foo&lt;CR&gt;</b> succeeded, while the
    command <b>&gt;l</b> failed, even though the text region described by the
    two commands might be identical. For consistency, all three commands only
    consider entire lines and not partial lines, and the region is defined as
    any line that contains a character that was specified by the motion.</p>

    <b>}</b> commands are all affected by ``section boundaries'', but in some
    historical implementations not all of the commands recognize the same
    section boundaries. This is a bug, not a feature, and a unique
    section-boundary algorithm was not described for each command. One special
    case that is preserved is that the sentence command moves to the end of the
    last line of the edit buffer while the other commands go to the beginning,
    in order to preserve the traditional character cut semantics of the sentence
    command. Historically, <i>vi</i> section boundaries at the beginning and end
    of the edit buffer were the first non-&lt;blank&gt; on the first and last
    lines of the edit buffer if one exists; otherwise, the last character of the
    first and last lines of the edit buffer if one exists. To increase
    consistency with other section locations, this has been simplified by
    POSIX.1‐2008 to the first character of the first and last lines of
    the edit buffer, or the first and the last lines of the edit buffer if they
    are empty.</p>
<p class="Pp">Sentence boundaries were problematic in the historical <i>vi</i>.
    They were not only the boundaries as defined for the section and paragraph
    commands, but they were the first non-&lt;blank&gt; that occurred after
    those boundaries, as well. Historically, the <i>vi</i> section commands were
    documented as taking an optional window size as a <i>count</i> preceding the
    command. This was not implemented in historical versions, so
    POSIX.1‐2008 requires that the <i>count</i> repeat the command, for
    consistency with other <i>vi</i> commands.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Repeat~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Repeat~2">Repeat</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, mapped commands other than text input commands could
    not be repeated using the <b>period</b> command. POSIX.1‐2008
    requires conformance to historical practice.</p>
<p class="Pp">The restrictions on the interpretation of special characters (for
    example, &lt;control&gt;‐H) in the repetition of text input mode
    commands is intended to match historical practice. For example, given the
    input sequence:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>iab&lt;control&gt;-H&lt;control&gt;-H&lt;control&gt;-Hdef&lt;escape&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">the user should be informed of an error when the sequence is first
    entered, but not during a command repetition. The character
    &lt;control&gt;‐T is specifically exempted from this restriction.
    Historical implementations of <i>vi</i> ignored &lt;control&gt;‐T
    characters that were input in the original command during command
    repetition. POSIX.1‐2008 prohibits this behavior.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">Find Regular Expression</h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, commands did not affect the line searched to or from
    if the motion command was a search (<b>/</b>, <b>?</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>n</b>)
    and the final position was the start/end of the line. There were some
    special cases and <i>vi</i> was not consistent. POSIX.1‐2008 does not
    permit this behavior, for consistency. Historical implementations permitted
    but were unable to handle searches as motion commands that wrapped (that is,
    due to the edit option <b>wrapscan</b>) to the original location.
    POSIX.1‐2008 requires that this behavior be treated as an error.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the syntax <b>"/RE/0"</b> was used to
    force the command to cut text in line mode. POSIX.1‐2008 requires
    conformance to historical practice.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, in open mode, a <b>z</b> specified to a search
    command redisplayed the current line instead of displaying the current
    screen with the current line highlighted. For consistency and simplicity of
    specification, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, trailing <b>z</b> commands were permitted and
    ignored if entered as part of a search used as a motion command. For
    consistency and simplicity of specification, POSIX.1‐2008 does not
    permit this behavior.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">Execute an ex Command</h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, <i>vi</i> implementations restricted the commands
    that could be entered on the colon command line (for example, <b>append</b>
    and <b>change</b>), and some other commands were known to cause them to fail
    catastrophically. For consistency, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit these
    restrictions. When executing an <i>ex</i> command by entering <b>:</b>, it
    is not possible to enter a &lt;newline&gt; as part of the command because it
    is considered the end of the command. A different approach is to enter
    <i>ex</i> command mode by using the <i>vi</i> <b>Q</b> command (and later
    resuming visual mode with the <i>ex</i> <b>vi</b> command). In <i>ex</i>
    command mode, the single-line limitation does not exist. So, for example,
    the following is valid:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Q
s/break here/break\
here/
vi</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">POSIX.1‐2008 requires that, if the <i>ex</i> command
    overwrites any part of the screen that would be erased by a refresh,
    <i>vi</i> pauses for a character from the user. Historically, this character
    could be any character; for example, a character input by the user before
    the message appeared, or even a mapped character. This is probably a bug,
    but implementations that have tried to be more rigorous by requiring that
    the user enter a specific character, or that the user enter a character
    after the message was displayed, have been forced by user indignation back
    into historical behavior. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to
    historical practice.</p>

  Left (Right)</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Refer to the Rationale for the <b>!</b> and <b>/</b> commands.
    Historically, the <b>&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;</b> commands sometimes moved the
    cursor to the first non-&lt;blank&gt; (for example if the command was
    repeated or with <b>_</b> as the motion command), and sometimes left it
    unchanged. POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this inconsistency, requiring
    instead that the cursor always move to the first non-&lt;blank&gt;.
    Historically, the <b>&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;</b> commands did not support
    buffer arguments, although some implementations allow the specification of
    an optional buffer. This behavior is neither required nor disallowed by
    POSIX.1‐2008.</p>

<p class="Pp">Historically, buffers could execute other buffers, and loops,
    infinite and otherwise, were possible. POSIX.1‐2008 requires
    conformance to historical practice. The *<i>buffer</i> syntax of <i>ex</i>
    is not required in <i>vi</i>, because it is not historical practice and has
    been used in some <i>vi</i> implementations to support additional scripting
    languages.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">Reverse Case</h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>~</b> command ignored any associated
    <i>count</i>, and acted only on the characters in the current line. For
    consistency with other <i>vi</i> commands, POSIX.1‐2008 requires that
    an associated <i>count</i> act on the next <i>count</i> characters, and that
    the command move to subsequent lines if warranted by <i>count</i>, to make
    it possible to modify large pieces of text in a reasonably efficient manner.
    There exist <i>vi</i> implementations that optionally require an associated
    motion command for the <b>~</b> command. Implementations supporting this
    functionality are encouraged to base it on the <b>tildedop</b> edit option
    and handle the text regions and cursor positioning identically to the
    <b>yank</b> command.</p>

<p class="Pp">Historically, <i>count</i>s specified to the <b>A</b>, <b>a</b>,
    <b>I</b>, and <b>i</b> commands repeated the input of the first line
    <i>count</i> times, and did not repeat the subsequent lines of the input
    text. POSIX.1‐2008 requires that the entire text input be repeated
    <i>count</i> times.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">Move Backward to Preceding Word</h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, <i>vi</i> became confused if word commands were used
    as motion commands in empty files. POSIX.1‐2008 requires that this be
    an error. Historical implementations of <i>vi</i> had a large number of bugs
    in the word movement commands, and they varied greatly in behavior in the
    presence of empty lines, ``words'' made up of a single character, and lines
    containing only &lt;blank&gt; characters. For consistency and simplicity of
    specification, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior.</p>

<h2 class="Ss">Change to End-of-Line</h2>
<p class="Pp">Some historical implementations of the <b>C</b> command did not
    behave as described by POSIX.1‐2008 when the <b>$</b> key was
    remapped because they were implemented by pushing the <b>$</b> key onto the
    input queue and reprocessing it. POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this
    behavior. Historically, the <b>C</b>, <b>S</b>, and <b>s</b> commands did
    not copy replaced text into the numeric buffers. For consistency and
    simplicity of specification, POSIX.1‐2008 requires that they behave
    like their respective <b>c</b> commands in all respects.</p>

<p class="Pp">Historically, lines in open mode that were deleted were scrolled
    up, and an <b>@</b> glyph written over the beginning of the line. In the
    case of terminals that are incapable of the necessary cursor motions, the
    editor erased the deleted line from the screen. POSIX.1‐2008 requires
    conformance to historical practice; that is, if the terminal cannot display
    the <b>'@'</b> character, the line cannot remain on the screen.</p>

    conformance to historical practice. The <i>vi</i> <b>J</b> command is
    specified in terms of the <i>ex</i> <b>join</b> command with an <i>ex</i>
    command <i>count</i> value. The address correction for a <i>count</i> that

<h2 class="Ss">Mark Position</h2>
<p class="Pp">Historical practice is that only lowercase letters, plus backquote

    as motion components for the <b>c</b> command. With the exception of the
    <b>cN</b> command, which worked if the search crossed a line boundary, the

    traffic over slow connections and repainting for dumb terminals.
    POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior, requiring that a
    <i>count</i> to the open command behave as for other text input commands.
    This change to historical practice was made for consistency, and because a

<p class="Pp">Historically, <i>count</i>s to the <b>p</b> and <b>P</b> commands
    were ignored if the buffer was a line mode buffer, but were (mostly)
    implemented as described in POSIX.1‐2008 if the buffer was a
    character mode buffer. Because implementations exist that do not have this
    limitation, and because pasting lines multiple times is generally useful,
    POSIX.1‐2008 requires that <i>count</i> be supported for all <b>p</b>
    and <b>P</b> commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historical implementations of <i>vi</i> were widely known to have
    major problems in the <b>p</b> and <b>P</b> commands, particularly when
    unusual regions of text were copied into the edit buffer. The standard
    developers viewed these as bugs, and they are not permitted for consistency
    and simplicity of specification.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, a <b>P</b> or <b>p</b> command (or an <i>ex</i>
    <b>put</b> command executed from open or visual mode) executed in an empty
    file, left an empty line as the first line of the file. For consistency and
    simplicity of specification, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this
    behavior.</p>

<h2 class="Ss">Replace Character</h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>r</b> command did not correctly handle the
    <i>erase</i> and <i>word erase</i> characters as arguments, nor did it
    handle an associated <i>count</i> greater than 1 with a
    &lt;carriage-return&gt; argument, for which it replaced <i>count</i>
    characters with a single &lt;newline&gt;. POSIX.1‐2008 does not
    permit these inconsistencies.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>r</b> command permitted the
    &lt;control&gt;‐V escaping of entered characters, such as &lt;ESC&gt;
    and the &lt;carriage-return&gt;; however, it required two leading
    &lt;control&gt;‐V characters instead of one. POSIX.1‐2008
    requires that this be changed for consistency with the other text input
    commands of <i>vi</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, it is an error to enter the <b>r</b> command if
    there are less than <i>count</i> characters at or after the cursor in the
    line. While a reasonable and unambiguous extension would be to permit the
    <b>r</b> command on empty lines, it would require that too large a
    <i>count</i> be adjusted to match the number of characters at or after the
    cursor for consistency, which is sufficiently different from historical
    practice to be avoided. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to
    historical practice.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">Replace Characters</h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, if there were <b>autoindent</b> characters in the
    line on which the <b>R</b> command was run, and <b>autoindent</b> was set,
    the first &lt;newline&gt; would be properly indented and no characters would
    be replaced by the &lt;newline&gt;. Each additional &lt;newline&gt; would
    replace <i>n</i> characters, where <i>n</i> was the number of characters
    that were needed to indent the rest of the line to the proper indentation
    level. This behavior is a bug and is not permitted by
  POSIX.1‐2008.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Undo~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Undo~2">Undo</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Historical practice for cursor positioning after undoing commands
    was mixed. In most cases, when undoing commands that affected a single line,
    the cursor was moved to the start of added or changed text, or immediately
    after deleted text. However, if the user had moved from the line being
    changed, the column was either set to the first non-&lt;blank&gt;, returned
    to the origin of the command, or remained unchanged. When undoing commands
    that affected multiple lines or entire lines, the cursor was moved to the
    first character in the first line restored. As an example of how
    inconsistent this was, a search, followed by an <b>o</b> text input command,
    followed by an <b>undo</b> would return the cursor to the location where the
    <b>o</b> command was entered, but a <b>cw</b> command followed by an
    <b>o</b> command followed by an <b>undo</b> would return the cursor to the
    first non-&lt;blank&gt; of the line. POSIX.1‐2008 requires the most
    useful of these behaviors, and discards the least useful, in the interest of
    consistency and simplicity of specification.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Yank~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Yank~2">Yank</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>yank</b> command did not move to the end of
    the motion if the motion was in the forward direction. It moved to the end
    of the motion if the motion was in the backward direction, except for the
    <b>_</b> command, or for the <b>G</b> and <b>'</b> commands when the end of
    the motion was on the current line. This was further complicated by the fact
    that for a number of motion commands, the <b>yank</b> command moved the
    cursor but did not update the screen; for example, a subsequent command
    would move the cursor from the end of the motion, even though the cursor on
    the screen had not reflected the cursor movement for the <b>yank</b>
    command. POSIX.1‐2008 requires that all <b>yank</b> commands
    associated with backward motions move the cursor to the end of the motion
    for consistency, and specifically, to make <b>'</b> commands as motions
    consistent with search patterns as motions.</p>

<p class="Pp">Some historical implementations of the <b>Y</b> command did not
    behave as described by POSIX.1‐2008 when the <b>'_'</b> key was

    the input queue and reprocessing it. POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit
    this behavior.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">Redraw Window</h2>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>z</b> command always redrew the screen. This
    is permitted but not required by POSIX.1‐2008, because of the
    frequent use of the <b>z</b> command in macros such as <b>map n nz.</b> for
    screen positioning, instead of its use to change the screen size. The
    standard developers believed that expanding or scrolling the screen offered
    a better interface for users. The ability to redraw the screen is preserved
    if the optional new window size is specified, and in the
    &lt;control&gt;‐L and &lt;control&gt;‐R commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">The semantics of <b>z^</b> are confusing at best. Historical
    practice is that the screen before the screen that ended with the specified
    line is displayed. POSIX.1‐2008 requires conformance to historical
    practice.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>z</b> command would not display a partial
    line at the top or bottom of the screen. If the partial line would normally
    have been displayed at the bottom of the screen, the command worked, but the
    partial line was replaced with <b>'@'</b> characters. If the partial line
    would normally have been displayed at the top of the screen, the command
    would fail. For consistency and simplicity of specification,
    POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>z</b> command with a line specification of 1
    ignored the command. For consistency and simplicity of specification,
    POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the <b>z</b> command did not set the cursor column
    to the first non-&lt;blank&gt; for the character if the first screen was to
    be displayed, and was already displayed. For consistency and simplicity of
    specification, POSIX.1‐2008 does not permit this behavior.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">Input Mode Commands in vi</h2>
<p class="Pp">Historical implementations of <i>vi</i> did not permit the user to
    erase more than a single line of input, or to use normal erase characters
    such as <i>line erase</i>, <i>worderase</i>, and <i>erase</i> to erase
    <b>autoindent</b> characters. As there exist implementations of <i>vi</i>
    that do not have these limitations, both behaviors are permitted, but only
    historical practice is required. In the case of these extensions, <i>vi</i>
    is required to pause at the <b>autoindent</b> and previous line
  boundaries.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historical implementations of <i>vi</i> updated only the portion
    of the screen where the current cursor character was displayed. For example,
    consider the <i>vi</i> input keystrokes:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>iabcd&lt;escape&gt;0C&lt;tab&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the &lt;tab&gt; would overwrite the characters
    <b>"abcd"</b> when it was displayed. Other implementations replace
    only the <b>'a'</b> character with the &lt;tab&gt;, and then push the rest
    of the characters ahead of the cursor. Both implementations have problems.
    The historical implementation is probably visually nicer for the above
    example; however, for the keystrokes:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>iabcd&lt;ESC&gt;0R&lt;tab&gt;&lt;ESC&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">the historical implementation results in the string
    <b>"bcd"</b> disappearing and then magically reappearing when the
    &lt;ESC&gt; character is entered. POSIX.1‐2008 requires the former
    behavior when overwriting erase-columns—that is, overwriting
    characters that are no longer logically part of the edit buffer—and
    the latter behavior otherwise.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historical implementations of <i>vi</i> discarded the
    &lt;control&gt;‐D and &lt;control&gt;‐T characters when they
    were entered at places where their command functionality was not
    appropriate. POSIX.1‐2008 requires that the &lt;control&gt;‐T
    functionality always be available, and that &lt;control&gt;‐D be
    treated as any other key when not operating on <b>autoindent</b>
  characters.</p>

    &lt;tab&gt;, with <b>tabstop</b> set to 8, and <b>shiftwidth</b> set to 3,
