<p class="Pp"><b>mount</b>() attaches the filesystem specified by <i>source</i>
    (which is often a pathname referring to a device, but can also be the
    pathname of a directory or file, or a dummy string) to the location (a
    directory or file) specified by the pathname in <i>target</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Appropriate privilege (Linux: the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> capability)
    is required to mount filesystems.</p>
<p class="Pp">Values for the <i>filesystemtype</i> argument supported by the
    kernel are listed in <i>/proc/filesystems</i> (e.g., "btrfs",
    "ext4", "jfs", "xfs", "vfat",
    "fuse", "tmpfs", "cgroup", "proc",
    "mqueue", "nfs", "cifs", "iso9660").
    Further types may become available when the appropriate modules are
  loaded.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>data</i> argument is interpreted by the different
    filesystems. Typically it is a string of comma-separated options understood
    by this filesystem. See <b>mount</b>(8) for details of the options available
    for each filesystem type. This argument may be specified as NULL, if there
    are no options.</p>
<p class="Pp">A call to <b>mount</b>() performs one of a number of general types
    of operation, depending on the bits specified in <i>mountflags</i>. The
    choice of which operation to perform is determined by testing the bits set
    in <i>mountflags</i>, with the tests being conducted in the order listed
    here:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>Remount an existing mount: <i>mountflags</i> includes
    <b>MS_REMOUNT</b>.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>Create a bind mount: <i>mountflags</i> includes <b>MS_BIND</b>.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>Change the propagation type of an existing mount: <i>mountflags</i>

  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>Move an existing mount to a new location: <i>mountflags</i> includes
      <b>MS_MOVE</b>.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>Create a new mount: <i>mountflags</i> includes none of the above
    flags.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Each of these operations is detailed later in this page. Further
    flags may be specified in <i>mountflags</i> to modify the behavior of
    <b>mount</b>(), as described below.</p>

  <dd>Examples of workloads where this option could be of significant benefit

      advantage of combining <b>MS_STRICTATIME</b> and <b>MS_LAZYTIME</b> is
      that <b>stat</b>(2) will return the correctly updated atime, but the atime

  <dd>Permit mandatory locking on files in this filesystem. (Mandatory locking
      must still be enabled on a per-file basis, as described in
      <b>fcntl</b>(2).) Since Linux 4.5, this mount option requires the
      <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> capability and a kernel configured with the
      <b>CONFIG_MANDATORY_FILE_LOCKING</b> option. Mandatory locking has been
      fully deprecated in Linux 5.15, so this flag should be considered

  <dd>Used in conjunction with <b>MS_BIND</b> to create a recursive bind mount,
      and in conjunction with the propagation type flags to recursively change
      the propagation type of all of the mounts in a subtree. See below for

  <dt id="MS_RELATIME"><a class="permalink" href="#MS_RELATIME"><b>MS_RELATIME</b>

  <dd>When a file on this filesystem is accessed, update the file's last access
      time (atime) only if the current value of atime is less than or equal to
      the file's last modification time (mtime) or last status change time
      (ctime). This option is useful for programs, such as <b>mutt</b>(1), that
      need to know when a file has been read since it was last modified. Since
      Linux 2.6.30, the kernel defaults to the behavior provided by this flag
      (unless <b>MS_NOATIME</b> was specified), and the <b>MS_STRICTATIME</b>
      flag is required to obtain traditional semantics. In addition, since Linux
      2.6.30, the file's last access time is always updated if it is more than 1
      day old.</dd>

      meaning.</dd>
  <dt id="MS_STRICTATIME"><a class="permalink" href="#MS_STRICTATIME"><b>MS_STRICTATIME</b>

  <dd>Always update the last access time (atime) when files on this filesystem
      are accessed. (This was the default behavior before Linux 2.6.30.)
      Specifying this flag overrides the effect of setting the <b>MS_NOATIME</b>
      and <b>MS_RELATIME</b> flags.</dd>
  <dt id="MS_SYNCHRONOUS"><a class="permalink" href="#MS_SYNCHRONOUS"><b>MS_SYNCHRONOUS</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Make writes on this filesystem synchronous (as though the <b>O_SYNC</b>
      flag to <b>open</b>(2) was specified for all file opens to this

</dl>
<p class="Pp">From Linux 2.4 onward, some of the above flags are settable on a
    per-mount basis, while others apply to the superblock of the mounted
    filesystem, meaning that all mounts of the same filesystem share those
    flags. (Previously, all of the flags were per-superblock.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The per-mount-point flags are as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>Since Linux 2.4: <b>MS_NODEV</b>, <b>MS_NOEXEC</b>, and <b>MS_NOSUID</b>

  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>Additionally, since Linux 2.6.20: <b>MS_RELATIME</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The following flags are per-superblock: <b>MS_DIRSYNC</b>,
    <b>MS_LAZYTIME</b>, <b>MS_MANDLOCK</b>, <b>MS_SILENT</b>, and
    <b>MS_SYNCHRONOUS</b>. The initial settings of these flags are determined on
    the first mount of the filesystem, and will be shared by all subsequent
    mounts of the same filesystem. Subsequently, the settings of the flags can
    be changed via a remount operation (see below). Such changes will be visible
    via all mounts associated with the filesystem.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 2.6.16, <b>MS_RDONLY</b> can be set or cleared on a
    per-mount-point basis as well as on the underlying filesystem superblock.
    The mounted filesystem will be writable only if neither the filesystem nor
    the mountpoint are flagged as read-only.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Remounting_an_existing_mount"><a class="permalink" href="#Remounting_an_existing_mount">Remounting
  an existing mount</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">An existing mount may be remounted by specifying <b>MS_REMOUNT</b>
    in <i>mountflags</i>. This allows you to change the <i>mountflags</i> and
    <i>data</i> of an existing mount without having to unmount and remount the
    filesystem. <i>target</i> should be the same value specified in the initial
    <b>mount</b>() call.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>source</i> and <i>filesystemtype</i> arguments are
  ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>mountflags</i> and <i>data</i> arguments should match the
    values used in the original <b>mount</b>() call, except for those parameters
    that are being deliberately changed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following <i>mountflags</i> can be changed:
    <b>MS_LAZYTIME</b>, <b>MS_MANDLOCK</b>, <b>MS_NOATIME</b>, <b>MS_NODEV</b>,
    <b>MS_NODIRATIME</b>, <b>MS_NOEXEC</b>, <b>MS_NOSUID</b>,
    <b>MS_RELATIME</b>, <b>MS_RDONLY</b>, <b>MS_STRICTATIME</b> (whose effect is
    to clear the <b>MS_NOATIME</b> and <b>MS_RELATIME</b> flags), and
    <b>MS_SYNCHRONOUS</b>. Attempts to change the setting of the
    <b>MS_DIRSYNC</b> and <b>MS_SILENT</b> flags during a remount are silently
    ignored. Note that changes to per-superblock flags are visible via all
    mounts of the associated filesystem (because the per-superblock flags are
    shared by all mounts).</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 3.17, if none of <b>MS_NOATIME</b>,
    <b>MS_NODIRATIME</b>, <b>MS_RELATIME</b>, or <b>MS_STRICTATIME</b> is
    specified in <i>mountflags</i>, then the remount operation preserves the
    existing values of these flags (rather than defaulting to
    <b>MS_RELATIME</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 2.6.26, the <b>MS_REMOUNT</b> flag can be used with
    <b>MS_BIND</b> to modify only the per-mount-point flags. This is
    particularly useful for setting or clearing the "read-only" flag
    on a mount without changing the underlying filesystem. Specifying
    <i>mountflags</i> as:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br>
</p>
<pre>MS_REMOUNT | MS_BIND | MS_RDONLY
</pre>
<br>
<p class="Pp">will make access through this mountpoint read-only, without

<p class="Pp">If <i>mountflags</i> includes <b>MS_BIND</b> (available since
    Linux 2.4), then perform a bind mount. A bind mount makes a file or a
    directory subtree visible at another point within the single directory
    hierarchy. Bind mounts may cross filesystem boundaries and span
    <b>chroot</b>(2) jails.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>filesystemtype</i> and <i>data</i> arguments are
  ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">The remaining bits (other than <b>MS_REC</b>, described below) in
    the <i>mountflags</i> argument are also ignored. (The bind mount has the
    same mount options as the underlying mount.) However, see the discussion of
    remounting above, for a method of making an existing bind mount
  read-only.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, when a directory is bind mounted, only that directory
    is mounted; if there are any submounts under the directory tree, they are
    not bind mounted. If the <b>MS_REC</b> flag is also specified, then a
    recursive bind mount operation is performed: all submounts under the
    <i>source</i> subtree (other than unbindable mounts) are also bind mounted
    at the corresponding location in the <i>target</i> subtree.</p>

<p class="Pp">Since Linux 2.4 a single filesystem can be mounted at multiple

  point.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>mountflags</i> argument may have the magic number 0xC0ED
    (<b>MS_MGC_VAL</b>) in the top 16 bits. (All of the other flags discussed in
    DESCRIPTION occupy the low order 16 bits of <i>mountflags</i>.) Specifying
    <b>MS_MGC_VAL</b> was required before Linux 2.4, but since Linux 2.4 is no
    longer required and is ignored if specified.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Mount_namespaces"><a class="permalink" href="#Mount_namespaces">Mount
  namespaces</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Starting with Linux 2.4.19, Linux provides mount namespaces. A
    mount namespace is the set of filesystem mounts that are visible to a
    process. Mount namespaces can be (and usually are) shared between multiple
    processes, and changes to the namespace (i.e., mounts and unmounts) by one
    process are visible to all other processes sharing the same namespace. (The
    pre-2.4.19 Linux situation can be considered as one in which a single
    namespace was shared by every process on the system.)</p>
<p class="Pp">A child process created by <b>fork</b>(2) shares its parent's
    mount namespace; the mount namespace is preserved across an
    <b>execve</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp">A process can obtain a private mount namespace if: it was created
    using the <b>clone</b>(2) <b>CLONE_NEWNS</b> flag, in which case its new
    namespace is initialized to be a <i>copy</i> of the namespace of the process
    that called <b>clone</b>(2); or it calls <b>unshare</b>(2) with the
    <b>CLONE_NEWNS</b> flag, which causes the caller's mount namespace to obtain
    a private copy of the namespace that it was previously sharing with other
    processes, so that future mounts and unmounts by the caller are invisible to
    other processes (except child processes that the caller subsequently
    creates) and vice versa.</p>
<p class="Pp">For further details on mount namespaces, see
    <b>mount_namespaces</b>(7).</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Parental_relationship_between_mounts"><a class="permalink" href="#Parental_relationship_between_mounts">Parental
  relationship between mounts</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Each mount has a parent mount. The overall parental relationship
    of all mounts defines the single directory hierarchy seen by the processes
    within a mount namespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">The parent of a new mount is defined when the mount is created. In
    the usual case, the parent of a new mount is the mount of the filesystem
    containing the directory or file at which the new mount is attached. In the
    case where a new mount is stacked on top of an existing mount, the parent of
    the new mount is the previous mount that was stacked at that location.</p>
<p class="Pp">The parental relationship between mounts can be discovered via the
    <i>/proc/[pid]/mountinfo</i> file (see below).</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="/proc/_pid_/mounts_and_/proc/_pid_/mountinfo"><a class="permalink" href="#/proc/_pid_/mounts_and_/proc/_pid_/mountinfo">/proc/[pid]/mounts
  and /proc/[pid]/mountinfo</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The Linux-specific <i>/proc/[pid]/mounts</i> file exposes the list
    of mounts in the mount namespace of the process with the specified ID. The
    <i>/proc/[pid]/mountinfo</i> file exposes even more information about
    mounts, including the propagation type and mount ID information that makes
    it possible to discover the parental relationship between mounts. See
