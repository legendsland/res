<p class="Pp">The function <b>dlopen</b>() loads the dynamic shared object
    (shared library) file named by the null-terminated string <i>filename</i>
    and returns an opaque "handle" for the loaded object. This handle
    is employed with other functions in the dlopen API, such as <b>dlsym</b>(3),
    <b>dladdr</b>(3), <b>dlinfo</b>(3), and <b>dlclose</b>().</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>filename</i> is NULL, then the returned handle is for the
    main program. If <i>filename</i> contains a slash ("/"), then it
    is interpreted as a (relative or absolute) pathname. Otherwise, the dynamic
    linker searches for the object as follows (see <b>ld.so</b>(8) for further
    details):</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>(ELF only) If the calling object (i.e., the shared library or executable
      from which <b>dlopen</b>() is called) contains a DT_RPATH tag, and does
      not contain a DT_RUNPATH tag, then the directories listed in the DT_RPATH
      tag are searched.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>If, at the time that the program was started, the environment variable
      <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b> was defined to contain a colon-separated list of
      directories, then these are searched. (As a security measure, this
      variable is ignored for set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs.)</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>(ELF only) If the calling object contains a DT_RUNPATH tag, then the
      directories listed in that tag are searched.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>The cache file <i>/etc/ld.so.cache</i> (maintained by <b>ldconfig</b>(8))
      is checked to see whether it contains an entry for <i>filename</i>.</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>The directories <i>/lib</i> and <i>/usr/lib</i> are searched (in that
      order).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If the object specified by <i>filename</i> has dependencies on
    other shared objects, then these are also automatically loaded by the
    dynamic linker using the same rules. (This process may occur recursively, if
    those objects in turn have dependencies, and so on.)</p>
<p class="Pp">One of the following two values must be included in
  <i>flags</i>:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="RTLD_LAZY"><a class="permalink" href="#RTLD_LAZY"><b>RTLD_LAZY</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Perform lazy binding. Resolve symbols only as the code that references
      them is executed. If the symbol is never referenced, then it is never
      resolved. (Lazy binding is performed only for function references;
      references to variables are always immediately bound when the shared
      object is loaded.) Since glibc 2.1.1, this flag is overridden by the
      effect of the <b>LD_BIND_NOW</b> environment variable.</dd>
  <dt id="RTLD_NOW"><a class="permalink" href="#RTLD_NOW"><b>RTLD_NOW</b></a></dt>
  <dd>If this value is specified, or the environment variable <b>LD_BIND_NOW</b>
      is set to a nonempty string, all undefined symbols in the shared object
      are resolved before <b>dlopen</b>() returns. If this cannot be done, an
      error is returned.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Zero or more of the following values may also be ORed in
    <i>flags</i>:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="RTLD_GLOBAL"><a class="permalink" href="#RTLD_GLOBAL"><b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The symbols defined by this shared object will be made available for
      symbol resolution of subsequently loaded shared objects.</dd>
  <dt id="RTLD_LOCAL"><a class="permalink" href="#RTLD_LOCAL"><b>RTLD_LOCAL</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This is the converse of <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b>, and the default if neither
      flag is specified. Symbols defined in this shared object are not made
      available to resolve references in subsequently loaded shared
    objects.</dd>
  <dt id="RTLD_NODELETE"><a class="permalink" href="#RTLD_NODELETE"><b>RTLD_NODELETE</b>
    (since glibc 2.2)</a></dt>
  <dd>Do not unload the shared object during <b>dlclose</b>(). Consequently, the
      object's static and global variables are not reinitialized if the object
      is reloaded with <b>dlopen</b>() at a later time.</dd>
  <dt id="RTLD_NOLOAD"><a class="permalink" href="#RTLD_NOLOAD"><b>RTLD_NOLOAD</b>
    (since glibc 2.2)</a></dt>
  <dd>Don't load the shared object. This can be used to test if the object is
      already resident (<b>dlopen</b>() returns NULL if it is not, or the
      object's handle if it is resident). This flag can also be used to promote
      the flags on a shared object that is already loaded. For example, a shared
      object that was previously loaded with <b>RTLD_LOCAL</b> can be reopened
      with <b>RTLD_NOLOAD&nbsp;|&nbsp;RTLD_GLOBAL</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="RTLD_DEEPBIND"><a class="permalink" href="#RTLD_DEEPBIND"><b>RTLD_DEEPBIND</b>
    (since glibc 2.3.4)</a></dt>
  <dd>Place the lookup scope of the symbols in this shared object ahead of the
      global scope. This means that a self-contained object will use its own
      symbols in preference to global symbols with the same name contained in
      objects that have already been loaded.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If <i>filename</i> is NULL, then the returned handle is for the
    main program. When given to <b>dlsym</b>(3), this handle causes a search for
    a symbol in the main program, followed by all shared objects loaded at
    program startup, and then all shared objects loaded by <b>dlopen</b>() with
    the flag <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Symbol references in the shared object are resolved using (in
    order): symbols in the link map of objects loaded for the main program and
    its dependencies; symbols in shared objects (and their dependencies) that
    were previously opened with <b>dlopen</b>() using the <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b>
    flag; and definitions in the shared object itself (and any dependencies that
    were loaded for that object).</p>
<p class="Pp">Any global symbols in the executable that were placed into its
    dynamic symbol table by <b>ld</b>(1) can also be used to resolve references
    in a dynamically loaded shared object. Symbols may be placed in the dynamic
    symbol table either because the executable was linked with the flag
    "-rdynamic" (or, synonymously, "--export-dynamic"),
    which causes all of the executable's global symbols to be placed in the
    dynamic symbol table, or because <b>ld</b>(1) noted a dependency on a symbol
    in another object during static linking.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the same shared object is opened again with <b>dlopen</b>(),
    the same object handle is returned. The dynamic linker maintains reference
    counts for object handles, so a dynamically loaded shared object is not
    deallocated until <b>dlclose</b>() has been called on it as many times as
    <b>dlopen</b>() has succeeded on it. Constructors (see below) are called
    only when the object is actually loaded into memory (i.e., when the
    reference count increases to 1).</p>
<p class="Pp">A subsequent <b>dlopen</b>() call that loads the same shared
    object with <b>RTLD_NOW</b> may force symbol resolution for a shared object
    earlier loaded with <b>RTLD_LAZY</b>. Similarly, an object that was
    previously opened with <b>RTLD_LOCAL</b> can be promoted to
    <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b> in a subsequent <b>dlopen</b>().</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>dlopen</b>() fails for any reason, it returns NULL.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="dlmopen()"><a class="permalink" href="#dlmopen()">dlmopen()</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This function performs the same task as <b>dlopen</b>()—the
    <i>filename</i> and <i>flags</i> arguments, as well as the return value, are
    the same, except for the differences noted below.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>dlmopen</b>() function differs from <b>dlopen</b>()
    primarily in that it accepts an additional argument, <i>lmid</i>, that
    specifies the link-map list (also referred to as a <i>namespace</i>) in
    which the shared object should be loaded. (By comparison, <b>dlopen</b>()
    adds the dynamically loaded shared object to the same namespace as the
    shared object from which the <b>dlopen</b>() call is made.) The
    <i>Lmid_t</i> type is an opaque handle that refers to a namespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>lmid</i> argument is either the ID of an existing namespace
    (which can be obtained using the <b>dlinfo</b>(3) <b>RTLD_DI_LMID</b>
    request) or one of the following special values:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="LM_ID_BASE"><a class="permalink" href="#LM_ID_BASE"><b>LM_ID_BASE</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Load the shared object in the initial namespace (i.e., the application's
      namespace).</dd>
  <dt id="LM_ID_NEWLM"><a class="permalink" href="#LM_ID_NEWLM"><b>LM_ID_NEWLM</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Create a new namespace and load the shared object in that namespace. The
      object must have been correctly linked to reference all of the other
      shared objects that it requires, since the new namespace is initially
      empty.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If <i>filename</i> is NULL, then the only permitted value for
    <i>lmid</i> is <b>LM_ID_BASE</b>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="dlclose()"><a class="permalink" href="#dlclose()">dlclose()</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The function <b>dlclose</b>() decrements the reference count on
    the dynamically loaded shared object referred to by <i>handle</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the object's reference count drops to zero and no symbols in
    this object are required by other objects, then the object is unloaded after
    first calling any destructors defined for the object. (Symbols in this
    object might be required in another object because this object was opened
    with the <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b> flag and one of its symbols satisfied a
    relocation in another object.)</p>
<p class="Pp">All shared objects that were automatically loaded when
    <b>dlopen</b>() was invoked on the object referred to by <i>handle</i> are
    recursively closed in the same manner.</p>
<p class="Pp">A successful return from <b>dlclose</b>() does not guarantee that
    the symbols associated with <i>handle</i> are removed from the caller's
    address space. In addition to references resulting from explicit
    <b>dlopen</b>() calls, a shared object may have been implicitly loaded (and
    reference counted) because of dependencies in other shared objects. Only
    when all references have been released can the shared object be removed from
    the address space.</p>

    functions return NULL.</p>
<p class="Pp">On success, <b>dlclose</b>() returns 0; on error, it returns a

<p class="Pp">A link-map list defines an isolated namespace for the resolution
    of symbols by the dynamic linker. Within a namespace, dependent shared
    objects are implicitly loaded according to the usual rules, and symbol
    references are likewise resolved according to the usual rules, but such
    resolution is confined to the definitions provided by the objects that have
    been (explicitly and implicitly) loaded into the namespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>dlmopen</b>() function permits object-load
    isolation—the ability to load a shared object in a new namespace
    without exposing the rest of the application to the symbols made available
    by the new object. Note that the use of the <b>RTLD_LOCAL</b> flag is not
    sufficient for this purpose, since it prevents a shared object's symbols
    from being available to <i>any</i> other shared object. In some cases, we
    may want to make the symbols provided by a dynamically loaded shared object
    available to (a subset of) other shared objects without exposing those
    symbols to the entire application. This can be achieved by using a separate
    namespace and the <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b> flag.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>dlmopen</b>() function also can be used to provide better
    isolation than the <b>RTLD_LOCAL</b> flag. In particular, shared objects
    loaded with <b>RTLD_LOCAL</b> may be promoted to <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b> if they
    are dependencies of another shared object loaded with <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b>.
    Thus, <b>RTLD_LOCAL</b> is insufficient to isolate a loaded shared object
    except in the (uncommon) case where one has explicit control over all shared
    object dependencies.</p>
<p class="Pp">Possible uses of <b>dlmopen</b>() are plugins where the author of
    the plugin-loading framework can't trust the plugin authors and does not
    wish any undefined symbols from the plugin framework to be resolved to
    plugin symbols. Another use is to load the same object more than once.
    Without the use of <b>dlmopen</b>(), this would require the creation of
    distinct copies of the shared object file. Using <b>dlmopen</b>(), this can
    be achieved by loading the same shared object file into different
    namespaces.</p>
<p class="Pp">The glibc implementation supports a maximum of 16 namespaces.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Initialization_and_finalization_functions"><a class="permalink" href="#Initialization_and_finalization_functions">Initialization
  and finalization functions</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Shared objects may export functions using the
    <b>__attribute__((constructor))</b> and <b>__attribute__((destructor))</b>
    function attributes. Constructor functions are executed before
    <b>dlopen</b>() returns, and destructor functions are executed before
    <b>dlclose</b>() returns. A shared object may export multiple constructors
    and destructors, and priorities can be associated with each function to
    determine the order in which they are executed. See the <b>gcc</b> info
    pages (under "Function attributes") for further information.</p>
<p class="Pp">An older method of (partially) achieving the same result is via
    the use of two special symbols recognized by the linker: <b>_init</b> and
    <b>_fini</b>. If a dynamically loaded shared object exports a routine named
    <b>_init</b>(), then that code is executed after loading a shared object,
    before <b>dlopen</b>() returns. If the shared object exports a routine named
    <b>_fini</b>(), then that routine is called just before the object is
    unloaded. In this case, one must avoid linking against the system startup
    files, which contain default versions of these files; this can be done by
    using the <b>gcc</b>(1) <i>-nostartfiles</i> command-line option.</p>
<p class="Pp">Use of <b>_init</b> and <b>_fini</b> is now deprecated in favor of
    the aforementioned constructors and destructors, which among other
    advantages, permit multiple initialization and finalization functions to be
    defined.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since glibc 2.2.3, <b>atexit</b>(3) can be used to register an
    exit handler that is automatically called when a shared object is
  unloaded.</p>
