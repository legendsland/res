<p class="Pp">The <i>pthread_exit</i>() function shall terminate the calling
    thread and make the value <i>value_ptr</i> available to any successful join
    with the terminating thread. Any cancellation cleanup handlers that have
    been pushed and not yet popped shall be popped in the reverse order that
    they were pushed and then executed. After all cancellation cleanup handlers
    have been executed, if the thread has any thread-specific data, appropriate
    destructor functions shall be called in an unspecified order. Thread
    termination does not release any application visible process resources,
    including, but not limited to, mutexes and file descriptors, nor does it
    perform any process-level cleanup actions, including, but not limited to,
    calling any <i>atexit</i>() routines that may exist.</p>
<p class="Pp">An implicit call to <i>pthread_exit</i>() is made when a thread
    other than the thread in which <i>main</i>() was first invoked returns from
    the start routine that was used to create it. The function's return value
    shall serve as the thread's exit status.</p>
<p class="Pp">The behavior of <i>pthread_exit</i>() is undefined if called from
    a cancellation cleanup handler or destructor function that was invoked as a
    result of either an implicit or explicit call to <i>pthread_exit</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">After a thread has terminated, the result of access to local
    (auto) variables of the thread is undefined. Thus, references to local
    variables of the exiting thread should not be used for the
    <i>pthread_exit</i>() <i>value_ptr</i> parameter value.</p>
<p class="Pp">The process shall exit with an exit status of 0 after the last
    thread has been terminated. The behavior shall be as if the implementation
    called <i>exit</i>() with a zero argument at thread termination time.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="permalink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The normal mechanism by which a thread terminates is to return
    from the routine that was specified in the <i>pthread_create</i>() call that
    started it. The <i>pthread_exit</i>() function provides the capability for a
    thread to terminate without requiring a return from the start routine of
    that thread, thereby providing a function analogous to <i>exit</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">Regardless of the method of thread termination, any cancellation
    cleanup handlers that have been pushed and not yet popped are executed, and
    the destructors for any existing thread-specific data are executed. This
    volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires that cancellation cleanup handlers be
    popped and called in order. After all cancellation cleanup handlers have
    been executed, thread-specific data destructors are called, in an
    unspecified order, for each item of thread-specific data that exists in the
    thread. This ordering is necessary because cancellation cleanup handlers may
    rely on thread-specific data.</p>
<p class="Pp">As the meaning of the status is determined by the application
    (except when the thread has been canceled, in which case it is
    PTHREAD_CANCELED), the implementation has no idea what an illegal status
    value is, which is why no address error checking is done.</p>
