<p class="Pp">The <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() functions shall
    create a new process (child process) from the specified process image. The
    new process image shall be constructed from a regular executable file called
    the new process image file.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a C program is executed as the result of this call, it shall
    be entered as a C-language function call as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>int main(int <i>argc</i>, char *<i>argv</i>[]);</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">where <i>argc</i> is the argument count and <i>argv</i> is an
    array of character pointers to the arguments themselves. In addition, the
    following variable:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>extern char **environ;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">shall be initialized as a pointer to an array of character
    pointers to the environment strings.</p>
<p class="Pp">The argument <i>argv</i> is an array of character pointers to
    null-terminated strings. The last member of this array shall be a null
    pointer and is not counted in <i>argc</i>. These strings constitute the
    argument list available to the new process image. The value in
    <i>argv</i>[0] should point to a filename string that is associated with the
    process image being started by the <i>posix_spawn</i>() or
    <i>posix_spawnp</i>() function.</p>
<p class="Pp">The argument <i>envp</i> is an array of character pointers to
    null-terminated strings. These strings constitute the environment for the
    new process image. The environment array is terminated by a null
  pointer.</p>
<p class="Pp">The number of bytes available for the combined argument and
    environment lists of the child process is {ARG_MAX}. The implementation
    shall specify in the system documentation (see the Base Definitions volume
    of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter 2</i>, <i>Conformance</i>) whether any
    list overhead, such as length words, null terminators, pointers, or
    alignment bytes, is included in this total.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>path</i> argument to <i>posix_spawn</i>() is a pathname
    that identifies the new process image file to execute.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>file</i> parameter to <i>posix_spawnp</i>() shall be used
    to construct a pathname that identifies the new process image file. If the
    <i>file</i> parameter contains a &lt;slash&gt; character, the <i>file</i>
    parameter shall be used as the pathname for the new process image file.
    Otherwise, the path prefix for this file shall be obtained by a search of
    the directories passed as the environment variable <i>PATH</i> (see the Base
    Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Chapter 8</i>, <i>Environment
    Variables</i>). If this environment variable is not defined, the results of
    the search are implementation-defined.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>file_actions</i> is a null pointer, then file descriptors
    open in the calling process shall remain open in the child process, except
    for those whose close-on-<i>exec</i> flag FD_CLOEXEC is set (see
    <i><i>fcntl</i>()</i>). For those file descriptors that remain open, the
    child process shall not inherit any file locks, but all remaining attributes
    of the corresponding open file descriptions (see <i><i>fcntl</i>()</i>),
    shall remain unchanged.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>file_actions</i> is not NULL, then the file descriptors open
    in the child process shall be those open in the calling process as modified
    by the spawn file actions object pointed to by <i>file_actions</i> and the
    FD_CLOEXEC flag of each remaining open file descriptor after the spawn file
    actions have been processed. The effective order of processing the spawn
    file actions shall be:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> 1.</dt>
  <dd>The set of open file descriptors for the child process shall initially be
      the same set as is open for the calling process. The child process shall
      not inherit any file locks, but all remaining attributes of the
      corresponding open file descriptions (see <i><i>fcntl</i>()</i>), shall
      remain unchanged.</dd>
  <dt> 2.</dt>
  <dd>The signal mask, signal default actions, and the effective user and group
      IDs for the child process shall be changed as specified in the attributes
      object referenced by <i>attrp</i>.</dd>
  <dt> 3.</dt>
  <dd>The file actions specified by the spawn file actions object shall be
      performed in the order in which they were added to the spawn file actions
      object.</dd>
  <dt> 4.</dt>
  <dd>Any file descriptor that has its FD_CLOEXEC flag set (see
      <i><i>fcntl</i>()</i>) shall be closed.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If file descriptor 0, 1, or 2 would otherwise be closed in the new
    process image created by <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>(),
    implementations may open an unspecified file for the file descriptor in the
    new process image. If a standard utility or a conforming application is
    executed with file descriptor 0 not open for reading or with file descriptor
    1 or 2 not open for writing, the environment in which the utility or
    application is executed shall be deemed non-conforming, and consequently the
    utility or application might not behave as described in this standard.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>posix_spawnattr_t</b> spawn attributes object type is
    defined in <i>&lt;spawn.h&gt;</i>. It shall contain at least the attributes
    defined below.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP flag is set in the <i>spawn-flags</i>
    attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i>, and the
    <i>spawn-pgroup</i> attribute of the same object is non-zero, then the
    child's process group shall be as specified in the <i>spawn-pgroup</i>
    attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a special case, if the POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP flag is set in the
    <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i>, and
    the <i>spawn-pgroup</i> attribute of the same object is set to zero, then
    the child shall be in a new process group with a process group ID equal to
    its process ID.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP flag is not set in the
    <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i>, the
    new child process shall inherit the parent's process group.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM flag is set in the
    <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i>, but
    POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER is not set, the new process image shall initially
    have the scheduling policy of the calling process with the scheduling
    parameters specified in the <i>spawn-schedparam</i> attribute of the object
    referenced by <i>attrp</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER flag is set in the
    <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i>
    (regardless of the setting of the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM flag), the new
    process image shall initially have the scheduling policy specified in the
    <i>spawn-schedpolicy</i> attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i>
    and the scheduling parameters specified in the <i>spawn-schedparam</i>
    attribute of the same object.</p>
<p class="Pp">The POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS flag in the <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute
    of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i> governs the effective user ID of
    the child process. If this flag is not set, the child process shall inherit
    the effective user ID of the parent process. If this flag is set, the
    effective user ID of the child process shall be reset to the parent's real
    user ID. In either case, if the set-user-ID mode bit of the new process
    image file is set, the effective user ID of the child process shall become
    that file's owner ID before the new process image begins execution.</p>
<p class="Pp">The POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS flag in the <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute
    of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i> also governs the effective group ID
    of the child process. If this flag is not set, the child process shall
    inherit the effective group ID of the parent process. If this flag is set,
    the effective group ID of the child process shall be reset to the parent's
    real group ID. In either case, if the set-group-ID mode bit of the new
    process image file is set, the effective group ID of the child process shall
    become that file's group ID before the new process image begins
  execution.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK flag is set in the
    <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i>, the
    child process shall initially have the signal mask specified in the
    <i>spawn-sigmask</i> attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF flag is set in the <i>spawn-flags</i>
    attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i>, the signals specified in
    the <i>spawn-sigdefault</i> attribute of the same object shall be set to
    their default actions in the child process. Signals set to the default
    action in the parent process shall be set to the default action in the child
    process.</p>
<p class="Pp">Signals set to be caught by the calling process shall be set to
    the default action in the child process.</p>
<p class="Pp">Except for SIGCHLD, signals set to be ignored by the calling
    process image shall be set to be ignored by the child process, unless
    otherwise specified by the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF flag being set in the
    <i>spawn-flags</i> attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i> and
    the signals being indicated in the <i>spawn-sigdefault</i> attribute of the
    object referenced by <i>attrp</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the SIGCHLD signal is set to be ignored by the calling process,
    it is unspecified whether the SIGCHLD signal is set to be ignored or to the
    default action in the child process, unless otherwise specified by the
    POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF flag being set in the <i>spawn_flags</i> attribute of
    the object referenced by <i>attrp</i> and the SIGCHLD signal being indicated
    in the <i>spawn_sigdefault</i> attribute of the object referenced by
    <i>attrp</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the value of the <i>attrp</i> pointer is NULL, then the default
    values are used.</p>
<p class="Pp">All process attributes, other than those influenced by the
    attributes set in the object referenced by <i>attrp</i> as specified above
    or by the file descriptor manipulations specified in <i>file_actions</i>,
    shall appear in the new process image as though <i>fork</i>() had been
    called to create a child process and then a member of the <i>exec</i> family
    of functions had been called by the child process to execute the new process
    image.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is implementation-defined whether the fork handlers are run
    when <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() is called.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="permalink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <i>posix_spawn</i>() function and its close relation
    <i>posix_spawnp</i>() have been introduced to overcome the following
    perceived difficulties with <i>fork</i>(): the <i>fork</i>() function is
    difficult or impossible to implement without swapping or dynamic address
    translation.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>Swapping is generally too slow for a realtime environment.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>Dynamic address translation is not available everywhere that POSIX might
      be useful.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>Processes are too useful to simply option out of POSIX whenever it must
      run without address translation or other MMU services.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Thus, POSIX needs process creation and file execution primitives
    that can be efficiently implemented without address translation or other MMU
    services.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>posix_spawn</i>() function is implementable as a library
    routine, but both <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() are
    designed as kernel operations. Also, although they may be an efficient
    replacement for many <i>fork</i>()/<i>exec</i> pairs, their goal is to
    provide useful process creation primitives for systems that have difficulty
    with <i>fork</i>(), not to provide drop-in replacements for
    <i>fork</i>()/<i>exec</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">This view of the role of <i>posix_spawn</i>() and
    <i>posix_spawnp</i>() influenced the design of their API. It does not
    attempt to provide the full functionality of <i>fork</i>()/<i>exec</i> in
    which arbitrary user-specified operations of any sort are permitted between
    the creation of the child process and the execution of the new process
    image; any attempt to reach that level would need to provide a programming
    language as parameters. Instead, <i>posix_spawn</i>() and
    <i>posix_spawnp</i>() are process creation primitives like the
    <i>Start_Process</i> and <i>Start_Process_Search</i> Ada language bindings
    package <i>POSIX_Process_Primitives</i> and also like those in many
    operating systems that are not UNIX systems, but with some POSIX-specific
    additions.</p>
<p class="Pp">To achieve its coverage goals, <i>posix_spawn</i>() and
    <i>posix_spawnp</i>() have control of six types of inheritance: file
    descriptors, process group ID, user and group ID, signal mask, scheduling,
    and whether each signal ignored in the parent will remain ignored in the
    child, or be reset to its default action in the child.</p>
<p class="Pp">Control of file descriptors is required to allow an independently
    written child process image to access data streams opened by and even
    generated or read by the parent process without being specifically coded to
    know which parent files and file descriptors are to be used. Control of the
    process group ID is required to control how the job control of the child
    process relates to that of the parent.</p>
<p class="Pp">Control of the signal mask and signal defaulting is sufficient to
    support the implementation of <i>system</i>(). Although support for
    <i>system</i>() is not explicitly one of the goals for <i>posix_spawn</i>()
    and <i>posix_spawnp</i>(), it is covered under the ``at least 50%'' coverage
    goal.</p>
<p class="Pp">The intention is that the normal file descriptor inheritance
    across <i>fork</i>(), the subsequent effect of the specified spawn file
    actions, and the normal file descriptor inheritance across one of the
    <i>exec</i> family of functions should fully specify open file inheritance.
    The implementation need make no decisions regarding the set of open file
    descriptors when the child process image begins execution, those decisions
    having already been made by the caller and expressed as the set of open file
    descriptors and their FD_CLOEXEC flags at the time of the call and the spawn
    file actions object specified in the call. We have been assured that in
    cases where the POSIX <i>Start_Process</i> Ada primitives have been
    implemented in a library, this method of controlling file descriptor
    inheritance may be implemented very easily.</p>
<p class="Pp">We can identify several problems with <i>posix_spawn</i>() and
    <i>posix_spawnp</i>(), but there does not appear to be a solution that
    introduces fewer problems. Environment modification for child process
    attributes not specifiable via the <i>attrp</i> or <i>file_actions</i>
    arguments must be done in the parent process, and since the parent generally
    wants to save its context, it is more costly than similar functionality with
    <i>fork</i>()/<i>exec</i>. It is also complicated to modify the environment
    of a multi-threaded process temporarily, since all threads must agree when
    it is safe for the environment to be changed. However, this cost is only
    borne by those invocations of <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>()
    that use the additional functionality. Since extensive modifications are not
    the usual case, and are particularly unlikely in time-critical code, keeping
    much of the environment control out of <i>posix_spawn</i>() and
    <i>posix_spawnp</i>() is appropriate design.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() functions do
    not have all the power of <i>fork</i>()/<i>exec</i>. This is to be expected.
    The <i>fork</i>() function is a wonderfully powerful operation. We do not
    expect to duplicate its functionality in a simple, fast function with no
    special hardware requirements. It is worth noting that <i>posix_spawn</i>()
    and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() are very similar to the process creation
    operations on many operating systems that are not UNIX systems.</p>

    <i>posix_spawnp</i>(). Originally, in keeping with our simplicity goal, the
    standard developers had limited the capabilities of <i>posix_spawn</i>() and
    <i>posix_spawnp</i>() to a subset of the capabilities of
    <i>Start_Process</i> and <i>Start_Process_Search</i>; certain non-default
    capabilities were not supported. However, based on suggestions by the ballot
    group to improve file descriptor mapping or drop it, and on the advice of an
    Ada Language Bindings working group member, the standard developers decided
    that <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() should be sufficiently
    powerful to implement <i>Start_Process</i> and <i>Start_Process_Search</i>.
    The rationale is that if the Ada language binding to such a primitive had
    already been approved as an IEEE standard, there can be little justification
    for not approving the functionally-equivalent parts of a C binding. The only
    three capabilities provided by <i>posix_spawn</i>() and
    <i>posix_spawnp</i>() that are not provided by <i>Start_Process</i> and
    <i>Start_Process_Search</i> are optionally specifying the child's process
    group ID, the set of signals to be reset to default signal handling in the
    child process, and the child's scheduling policy and parameters.</p>
<p class="Pp">For the Ada language binding for <i>Start_Process</i> to be
    implemented with <i>posix_spawn</i>(), that binding would need to explicitly
    pass an empty signal mask and the parent's environment to
    <i>posix_spawn</i>() whenever the caller of <i>Start_Process</i> allowed
    these arguments to default, since <i>posix_spawn</i>() does not provide such
    defaults. The ability of <i>Start_Process</i> to mask user-specified signals
    during its execution is functionally unique to the Ada language binding and
    must be dealt with in the binding separately from the call to
    <i>posix_spawn</i>().</p>

<p class="Pp">The process group inheritance field can be used to join the child
    process with an existing process group. By assigning a value of zero to the
    <i>spawn-pgroup</i> attribute of the object referenced by <i>attrp</i>, the
    <i>setpgid</i>() mechanism will place the child process in a new process
    group.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Threads"><a class="permalink" href="#Threads">Threads</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Without the <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>()
    functions, systems without address translation can still use threads to give
    an abstraction of concurrency. In many cases, thread creation suffices, but
    it is not always a good substitute. The <i>posix_spawn</i>() and
    <i>posix_spawnp</i>() functions are considerably ``heavier'' than thread
    creation. Processes have several important attributes that threads do not.
    Even without address translation, a process may have base-and-bound memory
    protection. Each process has a process environment including security
    attributes and file capabilities, and powerful scheduling attributes.
    Processes abstract the behavior of non-uniform-memory-architecture
    multi-processors better than threads, and they are more convenient to use
    for activities that are not closely linked.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>posix_spawn</i>() and <i>posix_spawnp</i>() functions may
    not bring support for multiple processes to every configuration. Process
    creation is not the only piece of operating system support required to
    support multiple processes. The total cost of support for multiple processes
    may be quite high in some circumstances. Existing practice shows that
    support for multiple processes is uncommon and threads are common among
    ``tiny kernels''. There should, therefore, probably continue to be AEPs for
    operating systems with only one process.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Asynchronous_Error_Notification"><a class="permalink" href="#Asynchronous_Error_Notification">Asynchronous
  Error Notification</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A library implementation of <i>posix_spawn</i>() or
    <i>posix_spawnp</i>() may not be able to detect all possible errors before
    it forks the child process. POSIX.1‐2008 provides for an error
    indication returned from a child process which could not successfully
    complete the spawn operation via a special exit status which may be detected
    using the status value returned by <i>wait</i>(), <i>waitid</i>(), and
    <i>waitpid</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>stat_val</i> interface and the macros used to interpret it
    are not well suited to the purpose of returning API errors, but they are the
    only path available to a library implementation. Thus, an implementation may
    cause the child process to exit with exit status 127 for any error detected
    during the spawn process after the <i>posix_spawn</i>() or
    <i>posix_spawnp</i>() function has successfully returned.</p>
<p class="Pp">The standard developers had proposed using two additional macros
    to interpret <i>stat_val</i>. The first, WIFSPAWNFAIL, would have detected a
    status that indicated that the child exited because of an error detected
    during the <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() operations rather
    than during actual execution of the child process image; the second,
    WSPAWNERRNO, would have extracted the error value if WIFSPAWNFAIL indicated
    a failure. Unfortunately, the ballot group strongly opposed this because it
    would make a library implementation of <i>posix_spawn</i>() or
    <i>posix_spawnp</i>() dependent on kernel modifications to <i>waitpid</i>()
    to be able to embed special information in <i>stat_val</i> to indicate a
    spawn failure.</p>
<p class="Pp">The 8 bits of child process exit status that are guaranteed by
    POSIX.1‐2008 to be accessible to the waiting parent process are
    insufficient to disambiguate a spawn error from any other kind of error that
    may be returned by an arbitrary process image. No other bits of the exit
    status are required to be visible in <i>stat_val</i>, so these macros could
    not be strictly implemented at the library level. Reserving an exit status
    of 127 for such spawn errors is consistent with the use of this value by
    <i>system</i>() and <i>popen</i>() to signal failures in these operations
    that occur after the function has returned but before a shell is able to
    execute. The exit status of 127 does not uniquely identify this class of
    error, nor does it provide any detailed information on the nature of the
    failure. Note that a kernel implementation of <i>posix_spawn</i>() or
    <i>posix_spawnp</i>() is permitted (and encouraged) to return any possible
    error as the function value, thus providing more detailed failure
    information to the parent process.</p>
<p class="Pp">Thus, no special macros are available to isolate asynchronous
    <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() errors. Instead, errors
    detected by the <i>posix_spawn</i>() or <i>posix_spawnp</i>() operations in
    the context of the child process before the new process image executes are
    reported by setting the child's exit status to 127. The calling process may
    use the WIFEXITED and WEXITSTATUS macros on the <i>stat_val</i> stored by
    the <i>wait</i>() or <i>waitpid</i>() functions to detect spawn failures to
    the extent that other status values with which the child process image may
    exit (before the parent can conclusively determine that the child process
    image has begun execution) are distinct from exit status 127.</p>
