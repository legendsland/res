<p class="Pp">The <i>write</i>() function shall attempt to write <i>nbyte</i>
    bytes from the buffer pointed to by <i>buf</i> to the file associated with
    the open file descriptor, <i>fildes</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Before any action described below is taken, and if <i>nbyte</i> is
    zero and the file is a regular file, the <i>write</i>() function may detect
    and return errors as described below. In the absence of errors, or if error
    detection is not performed, the <i>write</i>() function shall return zero
    and have no other results. If <i>nbyte</i> is zero and the file is not a
    regular file, the results are unspecified.</p>
<p class="Pp">On a regular file or other file capable of seeking, the actual
    writing of data shall proceed from the position in the file indicated by the
    file offset associated with <i>fildes</i>. Before successful return from
    <i>write</i>(), the file offset shall be incremented by the number of bytes
    actually written. On a regular file, if the position of the last byte
    written is greater than or equal to the length of the file, the length of
    the file shall be set to this position plus one.</p>
<p class="Pp">On a file not capable of seeking, writing shall always take place
    starting at the current position. The value of a file offset associated with
    such a device is undefined.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the O_APPEND flag of the file status flags is set, the file
    offset shall be set to the end of the file prior to each write and no
    intervening file modification operation shall occur between changing the
    file offset and the write operation.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a <i>write</i>() requests that more bytes be written than there
    is room for (for example, the file size limit of the process or the physical
    end of a medium), only as many bytes as there is room for shall be written.
    For example, suppose there is space for 20 bytes more in a file before
    reaching a limit. A write of 512 bytes will return 20. The next write of a
    non-zero number of bytes would give a failure return (except as noted
    below).</p>
<p class="Pp">If the request would cause the file size to exceed the soft file
    size limit for the process and there is no room for any bytes to be written,
    the request shall fail and the implementation shall generate the SIGXFSZ
    signal for the thread.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>write</i>() is interrupted by a signal before it writes any
    data, it shall return -1 with <i>errno</i> set to <b>[EINTR]</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>write</i>() is interrupted by a signal after it successfully
    writes some data, it shall return the number of bytes written.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the value of <i>nbyte</i> is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the
    result is implementation-defined.</p>
<p class="Pp">After a <i>write</i>() to a regular file has successfully
    returned:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>Any successful <i>read</i>() from each byte position in the file that was
      modified by that write shall return the data specified by the
      <i>write</i>() for that position until such byte positions are again
      modified.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>Any subsequent successful <i>write</i>() to the same byte position in the
      file shall overwrite that file data.
    <br>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Write requests to a pipe or FIFO shall be handled in the same way
    as a regular file with the following exceptions:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>There is no file offset associated with a pipe, hence each write request
      shall append to the end of the pipe.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>Write requests of {PIPE_BUF} bytes or less shall not be interleaved with
      data from other processes doing writes on the same pipe. Writes of greater
      than {PIPE_BUF} bytes may have data interleaved, on arbitrary boundaries,
      with writes by other processes, whether or not the O_NONBLOCK flag of the
      file status flags is set.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>If the O_NONBLOCK flag is clear, a write request may cause the thread to
      block, but on normal completion it shall return <i>nbyte</i>.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>If the O_NONBLOCK flag is set, <i>write</i>() requests shall be handled
      differently, in the following ways:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>--</dt>
  <dd>The <i>write</i>() function shall not block the thread.</dd>
  <dt>--</dt>
  <dd>A write request for {PIPE_BUF} or fewer bytes shall have the following
      effect: if there is sufficient space available in the pipe, <i>write</i>()
      shall transfer all the data and return the number of bytes requested.
      Otherwise, <i>write</i>() shall transfer no data and return -1 with
      <i>errno</i> set to <b>[EAGAIN]</b>.</dd>
  <dt>--</dt>
  <dd>A write request for more than {PIPE_BUF} bytes shall cause one of the
      following:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>--</dt>
  <dd>When at least one byte can be written, transfer what it can and return the
      number of bytes written. When all data previously written to the pipe is
      read, it shall transfer at least {PIPE_BUF} bytes.</dd>
  <dt>--</dt>
  <dd>When no data can be written, transfer no data, and return -1 with
      <i>errno</i> set to <b>[EAGAIN]</b>.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">When attempting to write to a file descriptor (other than a pipe
    or FIFO) that supports non-blocking writes and cannot accept the data
    immediately:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>If the O_NONBLOCK flag is clear, <i>write</i>() shall block the calling
      thread until the data can be accepted.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>If the O_NONBLOCK flag is set, <i>write</i>() shall not block the thread.
      If some data can be written without blocking the thread, <i>write</i>()
      shall write what it can and return the number of bytes written. Otherwise,
      it shall return -1 and set <i>errno</i> to <b>[EAGAIN]</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Upon successful completion, where <i>nbyte</i> is greater than 0,
    <i>write</i>() shall mark for update the last data modification and last
    file status change timestamps of the file, and if the file is a regular
    file, the S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits of the file mode may be cleared.</p>
<p class="Pp">For regular files, no data transfer shall occur past the offset
    maximum established in the open file description associated with
    <i>fildes</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>fildes</i> refers to a socket, <i>write</i>() shall be
    equivalent to <i>send</i>() with no flags set.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the O_DSYNC bit has been set, write I/O operations on the file
    descriptor shall complete as defined by synchronized I/O data integrity
    completion.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the O_SYNC bit has been set, write I/O operations on the file
    descriptor shall complete as defined by synchronized I/O file integrity
    completion.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>fildes</i> refers to a shared memory object, the result of
    the <i>write</i>() function is unspecified.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>fildes</i> refers to a typed memory object, the result of
    the <i>write</i>() function is unspecified.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>fildes</i> refers to a STREAM, the operation of
    <i>write</i>() shall be determined by the values of the minimum and maximum
    <i>nbyte</i> range (packet size) accepted by the STREAM. These values are
    determined by the topmost STREAM module. If <i>nbyte</i> falls within the
    packet size range, <i>nbyte</i> bytes shall be written. If <i>nbyte</i> does
    not fall within the range and the minimum packet size value is 0,
    <i>write</i>() shall break the buffer into maximum packet size segments
    prior to sending the data downstream (the last segment may contain less than
    the maximum packet size). If <i>nbyte</i> does not fall within the range and
    the minimum value is non-zero, <i>write</i>() shall fail with <i>errno</i>
    set to <b>[ERANGE]</b>. Writing a zero-length buffer (<i>nbyte</i> is 0) to
    a STREAMS device sends 0 bytes with 0 returned. However, writing a
    zero-length buffer to a STREAMS-based pipe or FIFO sends no message and 0 is
    returned. The process may issue I_SWROPT <i>ioctl</i>() to enable
    zero-length messages to be sent across the pipe or FIFO.</p>
<p class="Pp">When writing to a STREAM, data messages are created with a
    priority band of 0. When writing to a STREAM that is not a pipe or FIFO:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>If O_NONBLOCK is clear, and the STREAM cannot accept data (the STREAM
      write queue is full due to internal flow control conditions),
      <i>write</i>() shall block until data can be accepted.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>If O_NONBLOCK is set and the STREAM cannot accept data, <i>write</i>()
      shall return -1 and set <i>errno</i> to <b>[EAGAIN]</b>.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>If O_NONBLOCK is set and part of the buffer has been written while a
      condition in which the STREAM cannot accept additional data occurs,
      <i>write</i>() shall terminate and return the number of bytes
    written.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">In addition, <i>write</i>() shall fail if the STREAM head has
    processed an asynchronous error before the call. In this case, the value of
    <i>errno</i> does not reflect the result of <i>write</i>(), but reflects the
    prior error.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>pwrite</i>() function shall be equivalent to
    <i>write</i>(), except that it writes into a given position and does not
    change the file offset (regardless of whether O_APPEND is set). The first
    three arguments to <i>pwrite</i>() are the same as <i>write</i>() with the
    addition of a fourth argument <i>offset</i> for the desired position inside
    the file. An attempt to perform a <i>pwrite</i>() on a file that is
    incapable of seeking shall result in an error.</p>

<p class="Pp">An attempt to write to a pipe or FIFO has several major
    characteristics:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd><i>Atomic/non-atomic</i>: A write is atomic if the whole amount written in
      one operation is not interleaved with data from any other process. This is
      useful when there are multiple writers sending data to a single reader.
      Applications need to know how large a write request can be expected to be
      performed atomically. This maximum is called {PIPE_BUF}. This volume of
      POSIX.1‐2017 does not say whether write requests for more than
      {PIPE_BUF} bytes are atomic, but requires that writes of {PIPE_BUF} or
      fewer bytes shall be atomic.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd><i>Blocking/immediate</i>: Blocking is only possible with O_NONBLOCK
      clear. If there is enough space for all the data requested to be written
      immediately, the implementation should do so. Otherwise, the calling
      thread may block; that is, pause until enough space is available for
      writing. The effective size of a pipe or FIFO (the maximum amount that can
      be written in one operation without blocking) may vary dynamically,
      depending on the implementation, so it is not possible to specify a fixed
      value for it.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>

<p class="Pp">There is no exception regarding partial writes when O_NONBLOCK is
    set. With the exception of writing to an empty pipe, this volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify exactly when a partial write is
    performed since that would require specifying internal details of the
    implementation. Every application should be prepared to handle partial
    writes when O_NONBLOCK is set and the requested amount is greater than
    {PIPE_BUF}, just as every application should be prepared to handle partial
    writes on other kinds of file descriptors.</p>
<p class="Pp">The intent of forcing writing at least one byte if any can be
    written is to assure that each write makes progress if there is any room in
    the pipe. If the pipe is empty, {PIPE_BUF} bytes must be written; if not, at
    least some progress must have been made.</p>
<p class="Pp">Where this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires -1 to be
    returned and <i>errno</i> set to <b>[EAGAIN]</b>, most historical
    implementations return zero (with the O_NDELAY flag set, which is the
    historical predecessor of O_NONBLOCK, but is not itself in this volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017). The error indications in this volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017 were chosen so that an application can distinguish these
    cases from end-of-file. While <i>write</i>() cannot receive an indication of
    end-of-file, <i>read</i>() can, and the two functions have similar return
    values. Also, some existing systems (for example, Eighth Edition) permit a
    write of zero bytes to mean that the reader should get an end-of-file
    indication; for those systems, a return value of zero from <i>write</i>()
    indicates a successful write of an end-of-file indication.</p>
<p class="Pp">Implementations are allowed, but not required, to perform error
    checking for <i>write</i>() requests of zero bytes.</p>
<p class="Pp">The concept of a {PIPE_MAX} limit (indicating the maximum number
    of bytes that can be written to a pipe in a single operation) was
    considered, but rejected, because this concept would unnecessarily limit
    application writing.</p>
<p class="Pp">See also the discussion of O_NONBLOCK in <i>read</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">Writes can be serialized with respect to other reads and writes.
    If a <i>read</i>() of file data can be proven (by any means) to occur after
    a <i>write</i>() of the data, it must reflect that <i>write</i>(), even if
    the calls are made by different processes. A similar requirement applies to
    multiple write operations to the same file position. This is needed to
    guarantee the propagation of data from <i>write</i>() calls to subsequent
    <i>read</i>() calls. This requirement is particularly significant for
    networked file systems, where some caching schemes violate these
  semantics.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that this is specified in terms of <i>read</i>() and
    <i>write</i>(). The XSI extensions <i>readv</i>() and <i>writev</i>() also
    obey these semantics. A new ``high-performance'' write analog that did not
    follow these serialization requirements would also be permitted by this
    wording. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 is also silent about any effects
    of application-level caching (such as that done by <i>stdio</i>).</p>
<p class="Pp">This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify the value of
    the file offset after an error is returned; there are too many cases. For
    programming errors, such as <b>[EBADF]</b>, the concept is meaningless since
    no file is involved. For errors that are detected immediately, such as
    <b>[EAGAIN]</b>, clearly the pointer should not change. After an interrupt
    or hardware error, however, an updated value would be very useful and is the
    behavior of many implementations.</p>
<p class="Pp">This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify the behavior
    of concurrent writes to a regular file from multiple threads, except that
    each write is atomic (see <i>Section 2.9.7</i>, <i>Thread Interactions with
    Regular File Operations</i>). Applications should use some form of
    concurrency control.</p>
<p class="Pp">This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 intentionally does not specify
    any <i>pwrite</i>() errors related to pipes, FIFOs, and sockets other than
    <b>[ESPIPE]</b>.</p>
