<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre><i>pa</i>=<i>mmap</i>(<i>addr</i>, <i>len</i>, <i>prot</i>, <i>flags</i>, <i>fildes</i>, <i>off</i>);</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <i>mmap</i>() function shall establish a mapping between the
    address space of the process at an address <i>pa</i> for <i>len</i> bytes to
    the memory object represented by the file descriptor <i>fildes</i> at offset
    <i>off</i> for <i>len</i> bytes. The value of <i>pa</i> is an
    implementation-defined function of the parameter <i>addr</i> and the values
    of <i>flags</i>, further described below. A successful <i>mmap</i>() call
    shall return <i>pa</i> as its result. The address range starting at
    <i>pa</i> and continuing for <i>len</i> bytes shall be legitimate for the
    possible (not necessarily current) address space of the process. The range
    of bytes starting at <i>off</i> and continuing for <i>len</i> bytes shall be
    legitimate for the possible (not necessarily current) offsets in the memory
    object represented by <i>fildes</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>fildes</i> represents a typed memory object opened with
    either the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE flag or the
    POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag, the memory object to be mapped shall
    be that portion of the typed memory object allocated by the implementation
    as specified below. In this case, if <i>off</i> is non-zero, the behavior of
    <i>mmap</i>() is undefined. If <i>fildes</i> refers to a valid typed memory
    object that is not accessible from the calling process, <i>mmap</i>() shall
    fail.</p>
<p class="Pp">The mapping established by <i>mmap</i>() shall replace any
    previous mappings for those whole pages containing any part of the address
    space of the process starting at <i>pa</i> and continuing for <i>len</i>
    bytes.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the size of the mapped file changes after the call to
    <i>mmap</i>() as a result of some other operation on the mapped file, the
    effect of references to portions of the mapped region that correspond to
    added or removed portions of the file is unspecified.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>len</i> is zero, <i>mmap</i>() shall fail and no mapping
    shall be established.</p>
<p class="Pp">The parameter <i>prot</i> determines whether read, write, execute,
    or some combination of accesses are permitted to the data being mapped. The
    <i>prot</i> shall be either PROT_NONE or the bitwise-inclusive OR of one or
    more of the other flags in the following table, defined in the
    <i>&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</i> header.</p>

<p class="Pp">If an implementation cannot support the combination of access
    types specified by <i>prot</i>, the call to <i>mmap</i>() shall fail.</p>
<p class="Pp">An implementation may permit accesses other than those specified
    by <i>prot</i>; however, the implementation shall not permit a write to
    succeed where PROT_WRITE has not been set and shall not permit any access
    where PROT_NONE alone has been set. The implementation shall support at
    least the following values of <i>prot</i>: PROT_NONE, PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE,
    and the bitwise-inclusive OR of PROT_READ and PROT_WRITE. The file
    descriptor <i>fildes</i> shall have been opened with read permission,
    regardless of the protection options specified. If PROT_WRITE is specified,
    the application shall ensure that it has opened the file descriptor
    <i>fildes</i> with write permission unless MAP_PRIVATE is specified in the
    <i>flags</i> parameter as described below.</p>
<p class="Pp">The parameter <i>flags</i> provides other information about the
    handling of the mapped data. The value of <i>flags</i> is the
    bitwise-inclusive OR of these options, defined in
  <i>&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</i>:</p>

<p class="Pp">It is implementation-defined whether MAP_FIXED shall be supported.
    MAP_FIXED shall be supported on XSI-conformant systems.</p>
<p class="Pp">MAP_SHARED and MAP_PRIVATE describe the disposition of write
    references to the memory object. If MAP_SHARED is specified, write
    references shall change the underlying object. If MAP_PRIVATE is specified,
    modifications to the mapped data by the calling process shall be visible
    only to the calling process and shall not change the underlying object. It
    is unspecified whether modifications to the underlying object done after the
    MAP_PRIVATE mapping is established are visible through the MAP_PRIVATE
    mapping. Either MAP_SHARED or MAP_PRIVATE can be specified, but not both.
    The mapping type is retained across <i>fork</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">The state of synchronization objects such as mutexes, semaphores,
    barriers, and conditional variables placed in shared memory mapped with
    MAP_SHARED becomes undefined when the last region in any process containing
    the synchronization object is unmapped.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <i>fildes</i> represents a typed memory object opened with
    either the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE flag or the
    POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag, <i>mmap</i>() shall, if there are
    enough resources available, map <i>len</i> bytes allocated from the
    corresponding typed memory object which were not previously allocated to any
    process in any processor that may access that typed memory object. If there
    are not enough resources available, the function shall fail. If
    <i>fildes</i> represents a typed memory object opened with the
    POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag, these allocated bytes shall be
    contiguous within the typed memory object. If <i>fildes</i> represents a
    typed memory object opened with the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE flag, these
    allocated bytes may be composed of non-contiguous fragments within the typed
    memory object. If <i>fildes</i> represents a typed memory object opened with
    neither the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag nor the
    POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE flag, <i>len</i> bytes starting at offset
    <i>off</i> within the typed memory object are mapped, exactly as when
    mapping a file or shared memory object. In this case, if two processes map
    an area of typed memory using the same <i>off</i> and <i>len</i> values and
    using file descriptors that refer to the same memory pool (either from the
    same port or from a different port), both processes shall map the same
    region of storage.</p>
<p class="Pp">When MAP_FIXED is set in the <i>flags</i> argument, the
    implementation is informed that the value of <i>pa</i> shall be <i>addr</i>,
    exactly. If MAP_FIXED is set, <i>mmap</i>() may return MAP_FAILED and set
    <i>errno</i> to <b>[EINVAL]</b>. If a MAP_FIXED request is successful, then
    any previous mappings or memory locks for those whole pages containing any
    part of the address range [<i>pa</i>,<i>pa</i>+<i>len</i>) shall be removed,
    as if by an appropriate call to <i>munmap</i>(), before the new mapping is
    established.</p>
<p class="Pp">When MAP_FIXED is not set, the implementation uses <i>addr</i> in
    an implementation-defined manner to arrive at <i>pa</i>. The <i>pa</i> so
    chosen shall be an area of the address space that the implementation deems
    suitable for a mapping of <i>len</i> bytes to the file. All implementations
    interpret an <i>addr</i> value of 0 as granting the implementation complete
    freedom in selecting <i>pa</i>, subject to constraints described below. A
    non-zero value of <i>addr</i> is taken to be a suggestion of a process
    address near which the mapping should be placed. When the implementation
    selects a value for <i>pa</i>, it never places a mapping at address 0, nor
    does it replace any extant mapping.</p>
<p class="Pp">If MAP_FIXED is specified and <i>addr</i> is non-zero, it shall
    have the same remainder as the <i>off</i> parameter, modulo the page size as
    returned by <i>sysconf</i>() when passed _SC_PAGESIZE or _SC_PAGE_SIZE. The
    implementation may require that off is a multiple of the page size. If
    MAP_FIXED is specified, the implementation may require that <i>addr</i> is a
    multiple of the page size. The system performs mapping operations over whole
    pages. Thus, while the parameter <i>len</i> need not meet a size or
    alignment constraint, the system shall include, in any mapping operation,
    any partial page specified by the address range starting at <i>pa</i> and
    continuing for <i>len</i> bytes.</p>
<p class="Pp">The system shall always zero-fill any partial page at the end of
    an object. Further, the system shall never write out any modified portions
    of the last page of an object which are beyond its end. References within
    the address range starting at <i>pa</i> and continuing for <i>len</i> bytes
    to whole pages following the end of an object shall result in delivery of a
    SIGBUS signal.</p>
<p class="Pp">An implementation may generate SIGBUS signals when a reference
    would cause an error in the mapped object, such as out-of-space
  condition.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>mmap</i>() function shall add an extra reference to the
    file associated with the file descriptor <i>fildes</i> which is not removed
    by a subsequent <i>close</i>() on that file descriptor. This reference shall
    be removed when there are no more mappings to the file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The last data access timestamp of the mapped file may be marked
    for update at any time between the <i>mmap</i>() call and the corresponding
    <i>munmap</i>() call. The initial read or write reference to a mapped region
    shall cause the file's last data access timestamp to be marked for update if
    it has not already been marked for update.</p>
<p class="Pp">The last data modification and last file status change timestamps
    of a file that is mapped with MAP_SHARED and PROT_WRITE shall be marked for
    update at some point in the interval between a write reference to the mapped
    region and the next call to <i>msync</i>() with MS_ASYNC or MS_SYNC for that
    portion of the file by any process. If there is no such call and if the
    underlying file is modified as a result of a write reference, then these
    timestamps shall be marked for update at some time after the write
    reference.</p>
<p class="Pp">There may be implementation-defined limits on the number of memory
    regions that can be mapped (per process or per system).</p>
<p class="Pp">If such a limit is imposed, whether the number of memory regions
    that can be mapped by a process is decreased by the use of <i>shmat</i>() is
    implementation-defined.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>mmap</i>() fails for reasons other than <b>[EBADF]</b>,
    <b>[EINVAL]</b>, or <b>[ENOTSUP]</b>, some of the mappings in the address
    range starting at <i>addr</i> and continuing for <i>len</i> bytes may have
    been unmapped.</p>

<p class="Pp">Use of <i>mmap</i>() may reduce the amount of memory available to
    other memory allocation functions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Use of MAP_FIXED may result in unspecified behavior in further use
    of <i>malloc</i>() and <i>shmat</i>(). The use of MAP_FIXED is discouraged,
    as it may prevent an implementation from making the most effective use of
    resources. Most implementations require that <i>off</i> and <i>addr</i> are
    multiples of the page size as returned by <i>sysconf</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">The application must ensure correct synchronization when using
    <i>mmap</i>() in conjunction with any other file access method, such as
    <i>read</i>() and <i>write</i>(), standard input/output, and
  <i>shmat</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>mmap</i>() function allows access to resources via address
    space manipulations, instead of <i>read</i>()/<i>write</i>(). Once a file is
    mapped, all a process has to do to access it is use the data at the address
    to which the file was mapped. So, using pseudo-code to illustrate the way in
    which an existing program might be changed to use <i>mmap</i>(), the
    following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>fildes = open(...)
lseek(fildes, some_offset)
read(fildes, buf, len)
/* Use data in buf. */</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">becomes:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>fildes = open(...)
address = mmap(0, len, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fildes, some_offset)
/* Use data at address. */</pre>
</div>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="permalink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">After considering several other alternatives, it was decided to
    adopt the <i>mmap</i>() definition found in SVR4 for mapping memory objects
    into process address spaces. The SVR4 definition is minimal, in that it
    describes only what has been built, and what appears to be necessary for a
    general and portable mapping facility.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that while <i>mmap</i>() was first designed for mapping
    files, it is actually a general-purpose mapping facility. It can be used to
    map any appropriate object, such as memory, files, devices, and so on, into
    the address space of a process.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a mapping is established, it is possible that the
    implementation may need to map more than is requested into the address space
    of the process because of hardware requirements. An application, however,
    cannot count on this behavior. Implementations that do not use a paged
    architecture may simply allocate a common memory region and return the
    address of it; such implementations probably do not allocate any more than
    is necessary. References past the end of the requested area are
  unspecified.</p>
<p class="Pp">If an application requests a mapping that overlaps existing
    mappings in the process, it might be desirable that an implementation detect
    this and inform the application. However, if the program specifies a fixed
    address mapping (which requires some implementation knowledge to determine a
    suitable address, if the function is supported at all), then the program is
    presumed to be successfully managing its own address space and should be
    trusted when it asks to map over existing data structures. Furthermore, it
    is also desirable to make as few system calls as possible, and it might be
    considered onerous to require an <i>munmap</i>() before an <i>mmap</i>() to
    the same address range. This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 specifies that
    the new mapping replaces any existing mappings (implying an automatic
    <i>munmap</i>() on the address range), following existing practice in this
    regard. The standard developers also considered whether there should be a
    way for new mappings to overlay existing mappings, but found no existing
    practice for this.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is not expected that all hardware implementations are able to
    support all combinations of permissions at all addresses. Implementations
    are required to disallow write access to mappings without write permission
    and to disallow access to mappings without any access permission. Other than
    these restrictions, implementations may allow access types other than those
    requested by the application. For example, if the application requests only
    PROT_WRITE, the implementation may also allow read access. A call to
    <i>mmap</i>() fails if the implementation cannot support allowing all the
    access requested by the application. For example, some implementations
    cannot support a request for both write access and execute access
    simultaneously. All implementations must support requests for no access,
    read access, write access, and both read and write access. Strictly
    conforming code must only rely on the required checks. These restrictions
    allow for portability across a wide range of hardware.</p>
<p class="Pp">The MAP_FIXED address treatment is likely to fail for
    non-page-aligned values and for certain architecture-dependent address
    ranges. Conforming implementations cannot count on being able to choose
    address values for MAP_FIXED without utilizing non-portable,
    implementation-defined knowledge. Nonetheless, MAP_FIXED is provided as a
    standard interface conforming to existing practice for utilizing such
    knowledge when it is available.</p>
<p class="Pp">Similarly, in order to allow implementations that do not support
    virtual addresses, support for directly specifying any mapping addresses via
    MAP_FIXED is not required and thus a conforming application may not count on
    it.</p>
<p class="Pp">The MAP_PRIVATE function can be implemented efficiently when
    memory protection hardware is available. When such hardware is not
    available, implementations can implement such ``mappings'' by simply making
    a real copy of the relevant data into process private memory, though this
    tends to behave similarly to <i>read</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">The function has been defined to allow for many different models
    of using shared memory. However, all uses are not equally portable across
    all machine architectures. In particular, the <i>mmap</i>() function allows
    the system as well as the application to specify the address at which to map
    a specific region of a memory object. The most portable way to use the
    function is always to let the system choose the address, specifying NULL as
    the value for the argument <i>addr</i> and not to specify MAP_FIXED.</p>
<p class="Pp">If it is intended that a particular region of a memory object be
    mapped at the same address in a group of processes (on machines where this
    is even possible), then MAP_FIXED can be used to pass in the desired mapping
    address. The system can still be used to choose the desired address if the
    first such mapping is made without specifying MAP_FIXED, and then the
    resulting mapping address can be passed to subsequent processes for them to
    pass in via MAP_FIXED. The availability of a specific address range cannot
    be guaranteed, in general.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>mmap</i>() function can be used to map a region of memory
    that is larger than the current size of the object. Memory access within the
    mapping but beyond the current end of the underlying objects may result in
    SIGBUS signals being sent to the process. The reason for this is that the
    size of the object can be manipulated by other processes and can change at
    any moment. The implementation should tell the application that a memory
    reference is outside the object where this can be detected; otherwise,
    written data may be lost and read data may not reflect actual data in the
    object.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that references beyond the end of the object do not extend
    the object as the new end cannot be determined precisely by most virtual
    memory hardware. Instead, the size can be directly manipulated by
    <i>ftruncate</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">Process memory locking does apply to shared memory regions, and
    the MCL_FUTURE argument to <i>mlockall</i>() can be relied upon to cause new
    shared memory regions to be automatically locked.</p>
<p class="Pp">Existing implementations of <i>mmap</i>() return the value -1 when
    unsuccessful. Since the casting of this value to type <b>void *</b> cannot
    be guaranteed by the ISO&nbsp;C standard to be distinct from a successful
    value, this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defines the symbol MAP_FAILED,
    which a conforming implementation does not return as the result of a
    successful call.</p>
