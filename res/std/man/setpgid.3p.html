<p class="Pp">The <i>setpgid</i>() function shall group processes together for
    the purpose of signaling, placement in foreground or background, and other
    job control actions.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>setpgid</i>() function is similar to the <i>setpgrp</i>()
    function of 4.2 BSD, except that 4.2 BSD allowed the specified new process
    group to assume any value. This presents certain security problems and is
    more flexible than necessary to support job control.</p>
<p class="Pp">To provide tighter security, <i>setpgid</i>() only allows the
    calling process to join a process group already in use inside its session or
    create a new process group whose process group ID was equal to its process
    ID.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a job control shell spawns a new job, the processes in the
    job must be placed into a new process group via <i>setpgid</i>(). There are
    two timing constraints involved in this action:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> 1.</dt>
  <dd>The new process must be placed in the new process group before the
      appropriate program is launched via one of the <i>exec</i> functions.</dd>
  <dt> 2.</dt>
  <dd>The new process must be placed in the new process group before the shell
      can correctly send signals to the new process group.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">To address these constraints, the following actions are performed.
    The new processes call <i>setpgid</i>() to alter their own process groups
    after <i>fork</i>() but before <i>exec</i>. This satisfies the first
    constraint. Under 4.3 BSD, the second constraint is satisfied by the
    synchronization property of <i>vfork</i>(); that is, the shell is suspended
    until the child has completed the <i>exec</i>, thus ensuring that the child
    has completed the <i>setpgid</i>(). A new version of <i>fork</i>() with this
    same synchronization property was considered, but it was decided instead to
    merely allow the parent shell process to adjust the process group of its
    child processes via <i>setpgid</i>(). Both timing constraints are now
    satisfied by having both the parent shell and the child attempt to adjust
    the process group of the child process; it does not matter which succeeds
    first.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since it would be confusing to an application to have its process
    group change after it began executing (that is, after <i>exec</i>), and
    because the child process would already have adjusted its process group
    before this, the <b>[EACCES]</b> error was added to disallow this.</p>
<p class="Pp">One non-obvious use of <i>setpgid</i>() is to allow a job control
    shell to return itself to its original process group (the one in effect when
    the job control shell was executed). A job control shell does this before
    returning control back to its parent when it is terminating or suspending
    itself as a way of restoring its job control ``state'' back to what its
    parent would expect. (Note that the original process group of the job
    control shell typically matches the process group of its parent, but this is
    not necessarily always the case.)</p>
