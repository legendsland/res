<h2 class="Ss" id="Process_Termination"><a class="permalink" href="#Process_Termination">Process
  Termination</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Early proposals drew a distinction between normal and abnormal
    process termination. Abnormal termination was caused only by certain signals
    and resulted in implementation-defined ``actions'', as discussed below.
    Subsequent proposals distinguished three types of termination: <i>normal
    termination</i> (as in the current specification), <i>simple</i> <i>abnormal
    termination</i>, and <i>abnormal termination with actions</i>. Again the
    distinction between the two types of abnormal termination was that they were
    caused by different signals and that implementation-defined actions would
    result in the latter case. Given that these actions were completely
    implementation-defined, the early proposals were only saying when the
    actions could occur and how their occurrence could be detected, but not what
    they were. This was of little or no use to conforming applications, and thus
    the distinction is not made in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017.</p>
<p class="Pp">The implementation-defined actions usually include, in most
    historical implementations, the creation of a file named <b>core</b> in the
    current working directory of the process. This file contains an image of the
    memory of the process, together with descriptive information about the
    process, perhaps sufficient to reconstruct the state of the process at the
    receipt of the signal.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is a potential security problem in creating a <b>core</b>
    file if the process was set-user-ID and the current user is not the owner of
    the program, if the process was set-group-ID and none of the user's groups
    match the group of the program, or if the user does not have permission to
    write in the current directory. In this situation, an implementation either
    should not create a <b>core</b> file or should make it unreadable by the
    user.</p>
<p class="Pp">Despite the silence of this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 on this
    feature, applications are advised not to create files named <b>core</b>
    because of potential conflicts in many implementations. Some implementations
    use a name other than <b>core</b> for the file; for example, by appending
    the process ID to the filename.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Terminating_a_Process"><a class="permalink" href="#Terminating_a_Process">Terminating
  a Process</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">It is important that the consequences of process termination as
    described occur regardless of whether the process called <i>_exit</i>()
    (perhaps indirectly through <i>exit</i>()) or instead was terminated due to
    a signal or for some other reason. Note that in the specific case of
    <i>exit</i>() this means that the <i>status</i> argument to <i>exit</i>() is
    treated in the same way as the <i>status</i> argument to <i>_exit</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">A language other than C may have other termination primitives than
    the C-language <i>exit</i>() function, and programs written in such a
    language should use its native termination primitives, but those should have
    as part of their function the behavior of <i>_exit</i>() as described.
    Implementations in languages other than C are outside the scope of this
    version of this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, however.</p>
<p class="Pp">As required by the ISO&nbsp;C standard, using <b>return</b> from
    <i>main</i>() has the same behavior (other than with respect to language
    scope issues) as calling <i>exit</i>() with the returned value. Reaching the
    end of the <i>main</i>() function has the same behavior as calling
    <i>exit</i>(0).</p>
<p class="Pp">A value of zero (or EXIT_SUCCESS, which is required to be zero)
    for the argument <i>status</i> conventionally indicates successful
    termination. This corresponds to the specification for <i>exit</i>() in the
    ISO&nbsp;C standard. The convention is followed by utilities such as
    <i>make</i> and various shells, which interpret a zero status from a child
    process as success. For this reason, applications should not call
    <i>exit</i>(0) or <i>_exit</i>(0) when they terminate unsuccessfully; for
    example, in signal-catching functions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historically, the implementation-defined process that inherits
    children whose parents have terminated without waiting on them is called
    <i>init</i> and has a process ID of 1.</p>
<p class="Pp">The sending of a SIGHUP to the foreground process group when a
    controlling process terminates corresponds to somewhat different historical
    implementations. In System V, the kernel sends a SIGHUP on termination of
    (essentially) a controlling process. In 4.2 BSD, the kernel does not send
    SIGHUP in a case like this, but the termination of a controlling process is
    usually noticed by a system daemon, which arranges to send a SIGHUP to the
    foreground process group with the <i>vhangup</i>() function. However, in 4.2
    BSD, due to the behavior of the shells that support job control, the
    controlling process is usually a shell with no other processes in its
    process group. Thus, a change to make <i>_exit</i>() behave this way in such
    systems should not cause problems with existing applications.</p>
<p class="Pp">The termination of a process may cause a process group to become
    orphaned in either of two ways. The connection of a process group to its
    parent(s) outside of the group depends on both the parents and their
    children. Thus, a process group may be orphaned by the termination of the
    last connecting parent process outside of the group or by the termination of
    the last direct descendant of the parent process(es). In either case, if the
    termination of a process causes a process group to become orphaned,
    processes within the group are disconnected from their job control shell,
    which no longer has any information on the existence of the process group.
    Stopped processes within the group would languish forever. In order to avoid
    this problem, newly orphaned process groups that contain stopped processes
    are sent a SIGHUP signal and a SIGCONT signal to indicate that they have
    been disconnected from their session. The SIGHUP signal causes the process
    group members to terminate unless they are catching or ignoring SIGHUP.
    Under most circumstances, all of the members of the process group are
    stopped if any of them are stopped.</p>
<p class="Pp">The action of sending a SIGHUP and a SIGCONT signal to members of
    a newly orphaned process group is similar to the action of 4.2 BSD, which
    sends SIGHUP and SIGCONT to each stopped child of an exiting process. If
    such children exit in response to the SIGHUP, any additional descendants
    receive similar treatment at that time. In this volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017, the signals are sent to the entire process group at the
    same time. Also, in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, but not in 4.2 BSD,
    stopped processes may be orphaned, but may be members of a process group
    that is not orphaned; therefore, the action taken at <i>_exit</i>() must
    consider processes other than child processes.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is possible for a process group to be orphaned by a call to
    <i>setpgid</i>() or <i>setsid</i>(), as well as by process termination. This
    volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not require sending SIGHUP and SIGCONT in
    those cases, because, unlike process termination, those cases are not caused
    accidentally by applications that are unaware of job control. An
    implementation can choose to send SIGHUP and SIGCONT in those cases as an
    extension; such an extension must be documented as required in
    <i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The ISO/IEC&nbsp;9899:1999 standard adds the <i>_Exit</i>()
    function that results in immediate program termination without triggering
    signals or <i>atexit</i>()-registered functions. In POSIX.1‐2008,
    this is equivalent to the <i>_exit</i>() function.</p>
