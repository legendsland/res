<h2 class="Ss" id="Real_time_and_process_time"><a class="permalink" href="#Real_time_and_process_time">Real
  time and process time</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><i>Real time</i> is defined as time measured from some fixed
    point, either from a standard point in the past (see the description of the
    Epoch and calendar time below), or from some point (e.g., the start) in the
    life of a process (<i>elapsed time</i>).</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Process time</i> is defined as the amount of CPU time used by a
    process. This is sometimes divided into <i>user</i> and <i>system</i>
    components. User CPU time is the time spent executing code in user mode.
    System CPU time is the time spent by the kernel executing in system mode on
    behalf of the process (e.g., executing system calls). The <b>time</b>(1)
    command can be used to determine the amount of CPU time consumed during the
    execution of a program. A program can determine the amount of CPU time it
    has consumed using <b>times</b>(2), <b>getrusage</b>(2), or
  <b>clock</b>(3).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The_hardware_clock"><a class="permalink" href="#The_hardware_clock">The
  hardware clock</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Most computers have a (battery-powered) hardware clock which the
    kernel reads at boot time in order to initialize the software clock. For
    further details, see <b>rtc</b>(4) and <b>hwclock</b>(8).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The_software_clock,_HZ,_and_jiffies"><a class="permalink" href="#The_software_clock,_HZ,_and_jiffies">The
  software clock, HZ, and jiffies</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The accuracy of various system calls that set timeouts, (e.g.,
    <b>select</b>(2), <b>sigtimedwait</b>(2)) and measure CPU time (e.g.,
    <b>getrusage</b>(2)) is limited by the resolution of the <i>software
    clock</i>, a clock maintained by the kernel which measures time in
    <i>jiffies</i>. The size of a jiffy is determined by the value of the kernel
    constant <i>HZ</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The value of <i>HZ</i> varies across kernel versions and hardware
    platforms. On i386 the situation is as follows: on kernels up to and
    including Linux 2.4.x, HZ was 100, giving a jiffy value of 0.01 seconds;
    starting with Linux 2.6.0, HZ was raised to 1000, giving a jiffy of 0.001
    seconds. Since Linux 2.6.13, the HZ value is a kernel configuration
    parameter and can be 100, 250 (the default) or 1000, yielding a jiffies
    value of, respectively, 0.01, 0.004, or 0.001 seconds. Since Linux 2.6.20, a
    further frequency is available: 300, a number that divides evenly for the
    common video frame rates (PAL, 25 Hz; NTSC, 30 Hz).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>times</b>(2) system call is a special case. It reports
    times with a granularity defined by the kernel constant <i>USER_HZ</i>.
    User-space applications can determine the value of this constant using
    <i>sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</i>.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="System_and_process_clocks;_time_namespaces"><a class="permalink" href="#System_and_process_clocks;_time_namespaces">System
  and process clocks; time namespaces</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The kernel supports a range of clocks that measure various kinds
    of elapsed and virtual (i.e., consumed CPU) time. These clocks are described
    in <b>clock_gettime</b>(2). A few of the clocks are settable using
    <b>clock_settime</b>(2). The values of certain clocks are virtualized by
    time namespaces; see <b>time_namespaces</b>(7).</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="High-resolution_timers"><a class="permalink" href="#High-resolution_timers">High-resolution
  timers</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Before Linux 2.6.21, the accuracy of timer and sleep system calls
    (see below) was also limited by the size of the jiffy.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 2.6.21, Linux supports high-resolution timers (HRTs),
    optionally configurable via <b>CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS</b>. On a system that
    supports HRTs, the accuracy of sleep and timer system calls is no longer
    constrained by the jiffy, but instead can be as accurate as the hardware
    allows (microsecond accuracy is typical of modern hardware). You can
    determine whether high-resolution timers are supported by checking the
    resolution returned by a call to <b>clock_getres</b>(2) or looking at the
    "resolution" entries in <i>/proc/timer_list</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">HRTs are not supported on all hardware architectures. (Support is
    provided on x86, ARM, and PowerPC, among others.)</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The_Epoch"><a class="permalink" href="#The_Epoch">The
  Epoch</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">UNIX systems represent time in seconds since the <i>Epoch</i>,
    1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC).</p>
<p class="Pp">A program can determine the <i>calendar time</i> via the
    <b>clock_gettime</b>(2) <b>CLOCK_REALTIME</b> clock, which returns time (in
    seconds and nanoseconds) that have elapsed since the Epoch; <b>time</b>(2)
    provides similar information, but only with accuracy to the nearest second.
    The system time can be changed using <b>clock_settime</b>(2).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Broken-down_time"><a class="permalink" href="#Broken-down_time">Broken-down
  time</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Certain library functions use a structure of type <i>tm</i> to
    represent <i>broken-down time</i>, which stores time value separated out
    into distinct components (year, month, day, hour, minute, second, etc.).
    This structure is described in <b>tm</b>(3type), which also describes
    functions that convert between calendar time and broken-down time. Functions
    for converting between broken-down time and printable string representations
    of the time are described in <b>ctime</b>(3), <b>strftime</b>(3), and
    <b>strptime</b>(3).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Sleeping_and_setting_timers"><a class="permalink" href="#Sleeping_and_setting_timers">Sleeping
  and setting timers</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Various system calls and functions allow a program to sleep
    (suspend execution) for a specified period of time; see <b>nanosleep</b>(2),
    <b>clock_nanosleep</b>(2), and <b>sleep</b>(3).</p>
<p class="Pp">Various system calls allow a process to set a timer that expires
    at some point in the future, and optionally at repeated intervals; see
    <b>alarm</b>(2), <b>getitimer</b>(2), <b>timerfd_create</b>(2), and
    <b>timer_create</b>(2).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Timer_slack"><a class="permalink" href="#Timer_slack">Timer
  slack</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 2.6.28, it is possible to control the "timer
    slack" value for a thread. The timer slack is the length of time by
    which the kernel may delay the wake-up of certain system calls that block
    with a timeout. Permitting this delay allows the kernel to coalesce wake-up
    events, thus possibly reducing the number of system wake-ups and saving
    power. For more details, see the description of <b>PR_SET_TIMERSLACK</b> in
    <b>prctl</b>(2).</p>
