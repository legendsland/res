<p class="Pp">The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
    the ISO&nbsp;C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
    here and the ISO&nbsp;C standard is unintentional. This volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO&nbsp;C standard.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>fscanf</i>() function shall read from the named input
    <i>stream</i>. The <i>scanf</i>() function shall read from the standard
    input stream <i>stdin</i>. The <i>sscanf</i>() function shall read from the
    string <i>s</i>. Each function reads bytes, interprets them according to a
    format, and stores the results in its arguments. Each expects, as arguments,
    a control string <i>format</i> described below, and a set of <i>pointer</i>
    arguments indicating where the converted input should be stored. The result
    is undefined if there are insufficient arguments for the format. If the
    format is exhausted while arguments remain, the excess arguments shall be
    evaluated but otherwise ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">Conversions can be applied to the <i>n</i>th argument after the
    <i>format</i> in the argument list, rather than to the next unused argument.
    In this case, the conversion specifier character <b>%</b> (see below) is
    replaced by the sequence "%<i>n</i>$", where <i>n</i> is a decimal
    integer in the range [1,{NL_ARGMAX}]. This feature provides for the
    definition of format strings that select arguments in an order appropriate
    to specific languages. In format strings containing the
    "%<i>n</i>$" form of conversion specifications, it is unspecified
    whether numbered arguments in the argument list can be referenced from the
    format string more than once.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>format</i> can contain either form of a conversion
    specification—that is, <b>%</b> or "%<i>n</i>$"—but
    the two forms cannot be mixed within a single <i>format</i> string. The only
    exception to this is that <b>%%</b> or <b>%*</b> can be mixed with the
    "%<i>n</i>$" form. When numbered argument specifications are used,
    specifying the <i>N</i>th argument requires that all the leading arguments,
    from the first to the (<i>N</i>-1)th, are pointers.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>fscanf</i>() function in all its forms shall allow
    detection of a language-dependent radix character in the input string. The
    radix character is defined in the current locale (category
    <i>LC_NUMERIC</i>). In the POSIX locale, or in a locale where the radix
    character is not defined, the radix character shall default to a
    &lt;period&gt; (<b>'.'</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">The format is a character string, beginning and ending in its
    initial shift state, if any, composed of zero or more directives. Each
    directive is composed of one of the following: one or more white-space
    characters (&lt;space&gt;, &lt;tab&gt;, &lt;newline&gt;,
    &lt;vertical-tab&gt;, or &lt;form-feed&gt;); an ordinary character (neither
    <b>'%'</b> nor a white-space character); or a conversion specification. Each
    conversion specification is introduced by the character <b>'%'</b> or the
    character sequence "%<i>n</i>$", after which the following appear
    in sequence:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>An optional assignment-suppressing character <b>'*'</b>.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>An optional non-zero decimal integer that specifies the maximum field
      width.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>An optional assignment-allocation character <b>'m'</b>.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>An option length modifier that specifies the size of the receiving
    object.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>A <i>conversion specifier</i> character that specifies the type of
      conversion to be applied. The valid conversion specifiers are described
      below.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The <i>fscanf</i>() functions shall execute each directive of the
    format in turn. If a directive fails, as detailed below, the function shall
    return. Failures are described as input failures (due to the unavailability
    of input bytes) or matching failures (due to inappropriate input).</p>
<p class="Pp">A directive composed of one or more white-space characters shall
    be executed by reading input until no more valid input can be read, or up to
    the first byte which is not a white-space character, which remains
  unread.</p>
<p class="Pp">A directive that is an ordinary character shall be executed as
    follows: the next byte shall be read from the input and compared with the
    byte that comprises the directive; if the comparison shows that they are not
    equivalent, the directive shall fail, and the differing and subsequent bytes
    shall remain unread. Similarly, if end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read
    error prevents a character from being read, the directive shall fail.</p>
<p class="Pp">A directive that is a conversion specification defines a set of
    matching input sequences, as described below for each conversion character.
    A conversion specification shall be executed in the following steps.</p>
<p class="Pp">Input white-space characters (as specified by
    <i><i>isspace</i>()</i>) shall be skipped, unless the conversion
    specification includes a <b>[</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>C</b>, or <b>n</b>
    conversion specifier.</p>
<p class="Pp">An item shall be read from the input, unless the conversion
    specification includes an <b>n</b> conversion specifier. An input item shall
    be defined as the longest sequence of input bytes (up to any specified
    maximum field width, which may be measured in characters or bytes dependent
    on the conversion specifier) which is an initial subsequence of a matching
    sequence. The first byte, if any, after the input item shall remain unread.
    If the length of the input item is 0, the execution of the conversion
    specification shall fail; this condition is a matching failure, unless
    end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read error prevented input from the
    stream, in which case it is an input failure.</p>
<p class="Pp">Except in the case of a <b>%</b> conversion specifier, the input
    item (or, in the case of a <b>%n</b> conversion specification, the count of
    input bytes) shall be converted to a type appropriate to the conversion
    character. If the input item is not a matching sequence, the execution of
    the conversion specification fails; this condition is a matching failure.
    Unless assignment suppression was indicated by a <b>'*'</b>, the result of
    the conversion shall be placed in the object pointed to by the first
    argument following the <i>format</i> argument that has not already received
    a conversion result if the conversion specification is introduced by
    <b>%</b>, or in the <i>n</i>th argument if introduced by the character
    sequence "%<i>n</i>$". If this object does not have an appropriate
    type, or if the result of the conversion cannot be represented in the space
    provided, the behavior is undefined.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>%c</b>, <b>%s</b>, and <b>%[</b> conversion specifiers
    shall accept an optional assignment-allocation character <b>'m'</b>, which
    shall cause a memory buffer to be allocated to hold the string converted
    including a terminating null character. In such a case, the argument
    corresponding to the conversion specifier should be a reference to a pointer
    variable that will receive a pointer to the allocated buffer. The system
    shall allocate a buffer as if <i>malloc</i>() had been called. The
    application shall be responsible for freeing the memory after usage. If
    there is insufficient memory to allocate a buffer, the function shall set
    <i>errno</i> to <b>[ENOMEM]</b> and a conversion error shall result. If the
    function returns EOF, any memory successfully allocated for parameters using
    assignment-allocation character <b>'m'</b> by this call shall be freed
    before the function returns.

  USAGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If the application calling <i>fscanf</i>() has any objects of type
    <b>wint_t</b> or <b>wchar_t</b>, it must also include the
    <i>&lt;wchar.h&gt;</i> header to have these objects defined.</p>
<p class="Pp">For functions that allocate memory as if by <i>malloc</i>(), the
    application should release such memory when it is no longer required by a
    call to <i>free</i>(). For <i>fscanf</i>(), this is memory allocated via use
    of the <b>'m'</b> assignment-allocation character.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="permalink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This function is aligned with the ISO/IEC&nbsp;9899:1999
    standard, and in doing so a few ``obvious'' things were not included.
    Specifically, the set of characters allowed in a scanset is limited to
    single-byte characters. In other similar places, multi-byte characters have
    been permitted, but for alignment with the ISO/IEC&nbsp;9899:1999
    standard, it has not been done here. Applications needing this could use the
    corresponding wide-character functions to achieve the desired results.</p>
