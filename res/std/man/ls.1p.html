<p class="Pp">For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory
    or symbolic link to a directory, <i>ls</i> shall write the name of the file
    as well as any requested, associated information. For each operand that
    names a file of type directory, <i>ls</i> shall write the names of files
    contained within the directory as well as any requested, associated
    information. Filenames beginning with a &lt;period&gt; (<b>'.'</b>) and any
    associated information shall not be written out unless explicitly
    referenced, the <b>-A</b> or <b>-a</b> option is supplied, or an
    implementation-defined condition causes them to be written. If one or more
    of the <b>-d</b>, <b>-F</b>, or <b>-l</b> options are specified, and neither
    the <b>-H</b> nor the <b>-L</b> option is specified, for each operand that
    names a file of type symbolic link to a directory, <i>ls</i> shall write the
    name of the file as well as any requested, associated information. If none
    of the <b>-d</b>, <b>-F</b>, or <b>-l</b> options are specified, or the
    <b>-H</b> or <b>-L</b> options are specified, for each operand that names a
    file of type symbolic link to a directory, <i>ls</i> shall write the names
    of files contained within the directory as well as any requested, associated
    information. In each case where the names of files contained within a
    directory are written, if the directory contains any symbolic links then
    <i>ls</i> shall evaluate the file information and file type to be those of
    the symbolic link itself, unless the <b>-L</b> option is specified.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no operands are specified, <i>ls</i> shall behave as if a
    single operand of dot (<b>'.'</b>) had been specified. If more than one
    operand is specified, <i>ls</i> shall write non-directory operands first; it
    shall sort directory and non-directory operands separately according to the
    collating sequence in the current locale.</p>
<p class="Pp">Whenever <i>ls</i> sorts filenames or pathnames according to the
    collating sequence in the current locale, if this collating sequence does
    not have a total ordering of all characters (see the Base Definitions volume
    of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 7.3.2</i>, <i>LC_COLLATE</i>), then any
    filenames or pathnames that collate equally should be further compared
    byte-by-byte using the collating sequence for the POSIX locale.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>ls</i> utility shall detect infinite loops; that is,
    entering a previously visited directory that is an ancestor of the last file
    encountered. When it detects an infinite loop, <i>ls</i> shall write a
    diagnostic message to standard error and shall either recover its position
    in the hierarchy or terminate.</p>

      immediately after each pathname that is a directory, an &lt;asterisk&gt;
      (<b>'*'</b>) after each that is executable, a &lt;vertical-line&gt;
      (<b>'|'</b>) after each that is a FIFO, and an at-sign (<b>'@'</b>) after

  <dt id="d"><a class="permalink" href="#d"><b>-d</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Do not follow symbolic links named as operands unless the <b>-H</b> or

      produces unspecified results.</dd>
  <dt id="f"><a class="permalink" href="#f"><b>-f</b></a></dt>
  <dd>List the entries in directory operands in the order they appear in the

      occurrences of the <b>-r</b>, <b>-S</b>, and <b>-t</b> options shall be
      ignored and any occurrences of the <b>-A</b>, <b>-g</b>, <b>-l</b>,
      <b>-n</b>, <b>-o</b>, and <b>-s</b> options may be ignored. The use of

      options.</dd>
  <dt id="m"><a class="permalink" href="#m"><b>-m</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Stream output format; list pathnames across the page, separated by a

      &lt;newline&gt; character as the list terminator and after the separator
      sequence when there is not room on a line for the next list entry. This
      option disables long format output.</dd>
  <dt id="n"><a class="permalink" href="#n"><b>-n</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Turn on the <b>-l</b> (ell) option, but when writing the file's owner or
      group, write the file's numeric UID or GID rather than the user or group
      name, respectively. Disable the <b>-C</b>, <b>-m</b>, and <b>-x</b>
      options.</dd>
  <dt id="o"><a class="permalink" href="#o"><b>-o</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Turn on the <b>-l</b> (ell) option, but disable writing the file's group

    options.</dd>
  <dt id="p"><a class="permalink" href="#p"><b>-p</b></a></dt>

  <dd>Force each instance of non-printable filename characters and &lt;tab&gt;
      characters to be written as the &lt;question-mark&gt; (<b>'?'</b>)
      character. Implementations may provide this option by default if the
      output is to a terminal device.</dd>
  <dt id="r"><a class="permalink" href="#r"><b>-r</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Reverse the order of the sort to get reverse collating sequence oldest
      first, or smallest file size first depending on the other options
    given.</dd>
  <dt id="s"><a class="permalink" href="#s"><b>-s</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Indicate the total number of file system blocks consumed by each file
      displayed. If the <b>-k</b> option is also specified, the block size shall
      be 1024 bytes; otherwise, the block size is implementation-defined.</dd>
  <dt id="t"><a class="permalink" href="#t"><b>-t</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Sort with the primary key being time modified (most recently modified
      first) and the secondary key being filename in the collating sequence. For
      a symbolic link, the time used as the sort key is that of the symbolic
      link itself, unless <i>ls</i> is evaluating its file information to be
      that of the file referenced by the link (see the <b>-H</b> and <b>-L</b>
      options).</dd>
  <dt id="u"><a class="permalink" href="#u"><b>-u</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Use time of last access (see the Base Definitions volume of
      POSIX.1‐2017, <i><b>&lt;sys_stat.h&gt;</b></i>) instead of last
      modification of the file for sorting (<b>-t</b>) or writing
    (<b>-l</b>).</dd>
  <dt id="x"><a class="permalink" href="#x"><b>-x</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The same as <b>-C</b>, except that the multi-text-column output is
      produced with entries sorted across, rather than down, the columns. This
      option disables long format output.</dd>
  <dt><b>-1</b></dt>
  <dd>(The numeric digit one.) Force output to be one entry per line. This
      option does not disable long format output. (Long format output is enabled
      by <b>-g</b>, <b>-l</b> (ell), <b>-n</b>, and <b>-o</b>; and disabled by
      <b>-C</b>, <b>-m</b>, and <b>-x</b>.)</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If an option that enables long format output (<b>-g</b>, <b>-l</b>
    (ell), <b>-n</b>, and <b>-o</b> is given with an option that disables long
    format output (<b>-C</b>, <b>-m</b>, and <b>-x</b>), this shall not be
    considered an error. The last of these options specified shall determine
    whether long format output is written.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>-R</b>, <b>-d</b>, or <b>-f</b> are specified, the results
    of specifying these mutually-exclusive options are specified by the
    descriptions of these options above. If more than one of any of the other
    options shown in the SYNOPSIS section in mutually-exclusive sets are given,
    this shall not be considered an error; the last option specified in each set
    shall determine the output.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that if <b>-t</b> is specified, <b>-c</b> and <b>-u</b> are
    not only mutually-exclusive with each other, they are also
    mutually-exclusive with <b>-S</b> when determining sort order. But even if
    <b>-S</b> is specified after all occurrences of <b>-c</b>, <b>-t</b>, and
    <b>-u</b>, the last use of <b>-c</b> or <b>-u</b> determines the timestamp
    printed when producing long format output.</p>

  USAGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Many implementations use the &lt;equals-sign&gt; (<b>'='</b>) to
    denote sockets bound to the file system for the <b>-F</b> option. Similarly,
    many historical implementations use the <b>'s'</b> character to denote
    sockets as the entry type characters for the <b>-l</b> option.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is difficult for an application to use every part of the file
    modes field of <i>ls</i> <b>-l</b> in a portable manner. Certain file types
    and executable bits are not guaranteed to be exactly as shown, as
    implementations may have extensions. Applications can use this field to pass
    directly to a user printout or prompt, but actions based on its contents
    should generally be deferred, instead, to the <i>test</i> utility.</p>
<p class="Pp">The output of <i>ls</i> (with the <b>-l</b> and related options)
    contains information that logically could be used by utilities such as
    <i>chmod</i> and <i>touch</i> to restore files to a known state. However,
    this information is presented in a format that cannot be used directly by
    those utilities or be easily translated into a format that can be used. A
    character has been added to the end of the permissions string so that
    applications at least have an indication that they may be working in an area
    they do not understand instead of assuming that they can translate the
    permissions string into something that can be used. Future versions or
    related documents may define one or more specific characters to be used
    based on different standard additional or alternative access control
    mechanisms.</p>
<p class="Pp">As with many of the utilities that deal with filenames, the output
    of <i>ls</i> for multiple files or in one of the long listing formats must
    be used carefully on systems where filenames can contain embedded white
    space. Systems and system administrators should institute policies and user
    training to limit the use of such filenames.</p>
<p class="Pp">The number of disk blocks occupied by the file that it reports
    varies depending on underlying file system type, block size units reported,
    and the method of calculating the number of blocks. On some file system
    types, the number is the actual number of blocks occupied by the file
    (counting indirect blocks and ignoring holes in the file); on others it is
    calculated based on the file size (usually making an allowance for indirect
    blocks, but ignoring holes).</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="permalink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Some historical implementations of the <i>ls</i> utility show all
    entries in a directory except dot and dot-dot when a superuser invokes
    <i>ls</i> without specifying the <b>-a</b> option. When ``normal'' users
    invoke <i>ls</i> without specifying <b>-a</b>, they should not see
    information about any files with names beginning with a &lt;period&gt;
    unless they were named as <i>file</i> operands.</p>
<p class="Pp">Implementations are expected to traverse arbitrary depths when
    processing the <b>-R</b> option. The only limitation on depth should be
    based on running out of physical storage for keeping track of untraversed
    directories.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-1</b> (one) option was historically found in BSD and
    BSD-derived implementations only. It is required in this volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017 so that conforming applications might ensure that output
    is one entry per line, even if the output is to a terminal.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-S</b> option was added in Issue 7, but had been provided
    by several implementations for many years. The description given in the
    standard documents historic practice, but does not match much of the
    documentation that described its behavior. Historical documentation
    typically described it as something like:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="S~3"><a class="permalink" href="#S~3"><b>-S</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Sort by size (largest size first) instead of by name. Special character
      devices (listed last) are sorted by name.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">even though the file type was never considered when sorting the
    output. Character special files do typically sort close to the end of the
    list because their file size on most implementations is zero. But they are
    sorted alphabetically with any other files that happen to have the same file
    size (zero), not sorted separately and added to the end.</p>
<p class="Pp">This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 is frequently silent about what
    happens when mutually-exclusive options are specified. Except for <b>-R</b>,
    <b>-d</b>, and <b>-f</b>, the <i>ls</i> utility is required to accept
    multiple options from each mutually-exclusive option set without treating
    them as errors and to use the behavior specified by the last option given in
    each mutually-exclusive set. Since <i>ls</i> is one of the most aliased
    commands, it is important that the implementation perform intuitively. For
    example, if the alias were:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>alias ls="ls -C"</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">and the user typed <i>ls</i> <b>-1</b> (one), single-text-column
    output should result, not an error.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-g</b>, <b>-l</b> (ell), <b>-n</b>, and <b>-o</b> options
    are not mutually-exclusive options. They all enable long format output. They
    work together to determine whether the file's owner is written (no if
    <b>-g</b> is present), file's group is written (no if <b>-o</b> is present),
    and if the file's group or owner is written whether it is written as the
    name (default) or a string representation of the UID or GID number (if
    <b>-n</b> is present). The <b>-C</b>, <b>-m</b>, <b>-x</b>, and <b>-1</b>
    (one) are mutually-exclusive options and the first three of these disable
    long format output. The <b>-1</b> (one) option does not directly change
    whether or not long format output is enabled, but by overriding <b>-C</b>,
    <b>-m</b>, and <b>-x</b>, it can re-enable long format output that had been
    disabled by one of these options.</p>
<p class="Pp">Earlier versions of this standard did not describe the BSD
    <b>-A</b> option (like <b>-a</b>, but dot and dot-dot are not written out).
    It has been added due to widespread implementation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Implementations may make <b>-q</b> the default for terminals to
    prevent trojan horse attacks on terminals with special escape sequences.
    This is not required because:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>Some control characters may be useful on some terminals; for example, a
      system might write them as <b>"\001"</b> or
      <b>"^A"</b>.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>Special behavior for terminals is not relevant to applications
      portability.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">An early proposal specified that the
    &lt;<i>optional&nbsp;alternate&nbsp;access&nbsp;method&nbsp;flag</i>&gt;
    had to be <b>'+'</b> if there was an alternate access method used on the
    file or &lt;space&gt; if there was not. This was changed to be &lt;space&gt;
    if there is not and a single printable character if there is. This was done
    for three reasons:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> 1.</dt>
  <dd>There are historical implementations using characters other than
      <b>'+'</b>.</dd>
  <dt> 2.</dt>
  <dd>There are implementations that vary this character used in that position
      to distinguish between various alternate access methods in use.</dd>
  <dt> 3.</dt>
  <dd>The standard developers did not want to preclude future specifications
      that might need a way to specify more than one alternate access
    method.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Nonetheless, implementations providing a single alternate access
    method are encouraged to use <b>'+'</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Earlier versions of this standard did not have the <b>-k</b>
    option, which meant that the <b>-s</b> option could not be used portably as
    its block size was implementation-defined, and the units used to specify the
    number of blocks occupied by files in a directory in an <i>ls</i> <b>-l</b>
    listing were fixed as 512-byte units. The <b>-k</b> option has been added to
    provide a way for the <b>-s</b> option to be used portably, and for
    consistency it also changes the aforementioned units from 512-byte to
    1024-byte.</p>
<p class="Pp">The &lt;<i>date&nbsp;and&nbsp;time</i>&gt; field in the
    <b>-l</b> format is specified only for the POSIX locale. As noted, the
    format can be different in other locales. No mechanism for defining this is
    present in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, as the appropriate vehicle is
    a messaging system; that is, the format should be specified as a
    ``message''.</p>

<p class="Pp">A future version of this standard may require that if the
    collating sequence for the current locale does not have a total ordering of
    all characters, any filenames or pathnames that collate equally are further
    compared byte-by-byte using the collating sequence for the POSIX locale.</p>
