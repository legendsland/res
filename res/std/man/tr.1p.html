  <dd>Octal sequences can be used to represent characters with specific coded
      values. An octal sequence shall consist of a &lt;backslash&gt; followed by
      the longest sequence of one, two, or three-octal-digit characters
      (01234567). The sequence shall cause the value whose encoding is
      represented by the one, two, or three-digit octal integer to be placed
      into the array. Multi-byte characters require multiple, concatenated
      escape sequences of this type, including the leading &lt;backslash&gt; for
      each byte.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="permalink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">In some early proposals, an explicit option <b>-n</b> was added to
    disable the historical behavior of stripping NUL characters from the input.
    It was considered that automatically stripping NUL characters from the input
    was not correct functionality. However, the removal of <b>-n</b> in a later
    proposal does not remove the requirement that <i>tr</i> correctly process
    NUL characters in its input stream. NUL characters can be stripped by using
    <i>tr</i> <b>-d</b> '\000'.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historical implementations of <i>tr</i> differ widely in syntax
    and behavior. For example, the BSD version has not needed the bracket
    characters for the repetition sequence. The <i>tr</i> utility syntax is
    based more closely on the System V and XPG3 model while attempting to
    accommodate historical BSD implementations. In the case of the short
    <i>string2</i> padding, the decision was to unspecify the behavior and
    preserve System V and XPG3 scripts, which might find difficulty with the BSD
    method. The assumption was made that BSD users of <i>tr</i> have to make
    accommodations to meet the syntax defined here. Since it is possible to use
    the repetition sequence to duplicate the desired behavior, whereas there is
    no simple way to achieve the System V method, this was the correct, if not
    desirable, approach.</p>
<p class="Pp">The use of octal values to specify control characters, while
    having historical precedents, is not portable. The introduction of escape
    sequences for control characters should provide the necessary portability.
    It is recognized that this may cause some historical scripts to break.</p>
<p class="Pp">An early proposal included support for multi-character collating
    elements. It was pointed out that, while <i>tr</i> does employ some
    syntactical elements from REs, the aim of <i>tr</i> is quite different;
    ranges, for example, do not have a similar meaning (``any of the chars in
    the range matches'', <i>versus</i> ``translate each character in the range
    to the output counterpart''). As a result, the previously included support
    for multi-character collating elements has been removed. What remains are
    ranges in current collation order (to support, for example, accented
    characters), character classes, and equivalence classes.</p>
<p class="Pp">In XPG3 the [:<i>class</i>:] and [=<i>equiv</i>=] conventions are
    shown with double brackets, as in RE syntax. However, <i>tr</i> does not
    implement RE principles; it just borrows part of the syntax. Consequently,
    [:<i>class</i>:] and [=<i>equiv</i>=] should be regarded as syntactical
    elements on a par with [<i>x</i>*<i>n</i>], which is not an RE bracket
    expression.</p>
<p class="Pp">The standard developers will consider changes to <i>tr</i> that
    allow it to translate characters between different character encodings, or
    they will consider providing a new utility to accomplish this.</p>
<p class="Pp">On historical System V systems, a range expression requires
    enclosing square-brackets, such as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>tr '[a-z]' '[A-Z]'</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">However, BSD-based systems did not require the brackets, and this
    convention is used here to avoid breaking large numbers of BSD scripts:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>tr a-z A-Z</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The preceding System V script will continue to work because the
    brackets, treated as regular characters, are translated to themselves.
    However, any System V script that relied on <b>"a‐z"</b>
    representing the three characters <b>'a'</b>, <b>'-'</b>, and <b>'z'</b>
    have to be rewritten as <b>"az-"</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The ISO&nbsp;POSIX‐2:1993 standard had a <b>-c</b> option
    that behaved similarly to the <b>-C</b> option, but did not supply
    functionality equivalent to the <b>-c</b> option specified in
    POSIX.1‐2008.</p>
<p class="Pp">The earlier version also said that octal sequences referred to
    collating elements and could be placed adjacent to each other to specify
    multi-byte characters. However, it was noted that this caused ambiguities
    because <i>tr</i> would not be able to tell whether adjacent octal sequences
    were intending to specify multi-byte characters or multiple single byte
    characters. POSIX.1‐2008 specifies that octal sequences always refer
    to single byte binary values when used to specify an endpoint of a range of
    collating elements.</p>
<p class="Pp">Earlier versions of this standard allowed for implementations with
    bytes other than eight bits, but this has been modified in this version.</p>
