<p class="Pp">(From POSIX.1) The <b>vfork</b>() function has the same effect as
    <b>fork</b>(2), except that the behavior is undefined if the process created
    by <b>vfork</b>() either modifies any data other than a variable of type
    <i>pid_t</i> used to store the return value from <b>vfork</b>(), or returns
    from the function in which <b>vfork</b>() was called, or calls any other
    function before successfully calling <b>_exit</b>(2) or one of the
    <b>exec</b>(3) family of functions.</p>

<p class="Pp"><b>vfork</b>(), just like <b>fork</b>(2), creates a child process
    of the calling process. For details and return value and errors, see
    <b>fork</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>vfork</b>() is a special case of <b>clone</b>(2). It is used to
    create new processes without copying the page tables of the parent process.
    It may be useful in performance-sensitive applications where a child is
    created which then immediately issues an <b>execve</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>vfork</b>() differs from <b>fork</b>(2) in that the calling
    thread is suspended until the child terminates (either normally, by calling
    <b>_exit</b>(2), or abnormally, after delivery of a fatal signal), or it
    makes a call to <b>execve</b>(2). Until that point, the child shares all
    memory with its parent, including the stack. The child must not return from
    the current function or call <b>exit</b>(3) (which would have the effect of
    calling exit handlers established by the parent process and flushing the
    parent's <b>stdio</b>(3) buffers), but may call <b>_exit</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp">As with <b>fork</b>(2), the child process created by
    <b>vfork</b>() inherits copies of various of the caller's process attributes
    (e.g., file descriptors, signal dispositions, and current working
    directory); the <b>vfork</b>() call differs only in the treatment of the
    virtual address space, as described above.</p>
<p class="Pp">Signals sent to the parent arrive after the child releases the
    parent's memory (i.e., after the child terminates or calls
    <b>execve</b>(2)).</p>

<p class="Pp">Under Linux, <b>fork</b>(2) is implemented using copy-on-write
    pages, so the only penalty incurred by <b>fork</b>(2) is the time and memory
    required to duplicate the parent's page tables, and to create a unique task
    structure for the child. However, in the bad old days a <b>fork</b>(2) would
    require making a complete copy of the caller's data space, often needlessly,
    since usually immediately afterward an <b>exec</b>(3) is done. Thus, for
    greater efficiency, BSD introduced the <b>vfork</b>() system call, which did
    not fully copy the address space of the parent process, but borrowed the
    parent's memory and thread of control until a call to <b>execve</b>(2) or an
    exit occurred. The parent process was suspended while the child was using
    its resources. The use of <b>vfork</b>() was tricky: for example, not
    modifying data in the parent process depended on knowing which variables
    were held in a register.</p>

<p class="Pp">4.3BSD; POSIX.1-2001 (but marked OBSOLETE). POSIX.1-2008 removes
    the specification of <b>vfork</b>().</p>
<p class="Pp">The requirements put on <b>vfork</b>() by the standards are weaker
    than those put on <b>fork</b>(2), so an implementation where the two are
    synonymous is compliant. In particular, the programmer cannot rely on the
    parent remaining blocked until the child either terminates or calls
    <b>execve</b>(2), and cannot rely on any specific behavior with respect to
    shared memory.</p>

<p class="Pp">Some consider the semantics of <b>vfork</b>() to be an
    architectural blemish, and the 4.2BSD man page stated: "This system
    call will be eliminated when proper system sharing mechanisms are
    implemented. Users should not depend on the memory sharing semantics of
    <b>vfork</b>() as it will, in that case, be made synonymous to
    <b>fork</b>(2)." However, even though modern memory management hardware
    has decreased the performance difference between <b>fork</b>(2) and
    <b>vfork</b>(), there are various reasons why Linux and other systems have
    retained <b>vfork</b>():</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>Some performance-critical applications require the small performance
      advantage conferred by <b>vfork</b>().</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd><b>vfork</b>() can be implemented on systems that lack a memory-management
      unit (MMU), but <b>fork</b>(2) can't be implemented on such systems.
      (POSIX.1-2008 removed <b>vfork</b>() from the standard; the POSIX
      rationale for the <b>posix_spawn</b>(3) function notes that that function,
      which provides functionality equivalent to <b>fork</b>(2)+<b>exec</b>(3),
      is designed to be implementable on systems that lack an MMU.)</dd>
  <dt>•</dt>
  <dd>On systems where memory is constrained, <b>vfork</b>() avoids the need to
      temporarily commit memory (see the description of
      <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</i> in <b>proc</b>(5)) in order to
      execute a new program. (This can be especially beneficial where a large
      parent process wishes to execute a small helper program in a child
      process.) By contrast, using <b>fork</b>(2) in this scenario requires
      either committing an amount of memory equal to the size of the parent
      process (if strict overcommitting is in force) or overcommitting memory
      with the risk that a process is terminated by the out-of-memory (OOM)
      killer.</dd>

<p class="Pp">The child process should take care not to modify the memory in
    unintended ways, since such changes will be seen by the parent process once
    the child terminates or executes another program. In this regard, signal
    handlers can be especially problematic: if a signal handler that is invoked
    in the child of <b>vfork</b>() changes memory, those changes may result in
    an inconsistent process state from the perspective of the parent process
    (e.g., memory changes would be visible in the parent, but changes to the
    state of open file descriptors would not be visible).</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>vfork</b>() is called in a multithreaded process, only the
    calling thread is suspended until the child terminates or executes a new
    program. This means that the child is sharing an address space with other
    running code. This can be dangerous if another thread in the parent process
    changes credentials (using <b>setuid</b>(2) or similar), since there are now
    two processes with different privilege levels running in the same address
    space. As an example of the dangers, suppose that a multithreaded program
    running as root creates a child using <b>vfork</b>(). After the
    <b>vfork</b>(), a thread in the parent process drops the process to an
    unprivileged user in order to run some untrusted code (e.g., perhaps via
    plug-in opened with <b>dlopen</b>(3)). In this case, attacks are possible
    where the parent process uses <b>mmap</b>(2) to map in code that will be
    executed by the privileged child process.</p>

<p class="Pp">Fork handlers established using <b>pthread_atfork</b>(3) are not
    called when a multithreaded program employing the NPTL threading library
    calls <b>vfork</b>(). Fork handlers are called in this case in a program
    using the LinuxThreads threading library. (See <b>pthreads</b>(7) for a
    description of Linux threading libraries.)</p>

<p class="Pp">The <b>vfork</b>() system call appeared in 3.0BSD. In 4.4BSD it
    was made synonymous to <b>fork</b>(2) but NetBSD introduced it again; see
    <a class="Lk" href="http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/kernel/vfork.html">http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/kernel/vfork.html</a>.
    In Linux, it has been equivalent to <b>fork</b>(2) until Linux 2.2.0-pre6 or
    so. Since Linux 2.2.0-pre9 (on i386, somewhat later on other architectures)
    it is an independent system call. Support was added in glibc 2.0.112.</p>

<p class="Pp">Details of the signal handling are obscure and differ between
    systems. The BSD man page states: "To avoid a possible deadlock
    situation, processes that are children in the middle of a <b>vfork</b>() are
    never sent <b>SIGTTOU</b> or <b>SIGTTIN</b> signals; rather, output or
    <i>ioctl</i>s are allowed and input attempts result in an end-of-file
