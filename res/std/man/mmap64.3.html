<p class="Pp"><b>mmap</b>() creates a new mapping in the virtual address space
    of the calling process. The starting address for the new mapping is
    specified in <i>addr</i>. The <i>length</i> argument specifies the length of
    the mapping (which must be greater than 0).</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>addr</i> is NULL, then the kernel chooses the (page-aligned)
    address at which to create the mapping; this is the most portable method of
    creating a new mapping. If <i>addr</i> is not NULL, then the kernel takes it
    as a hint about where to place the mapping; on Linux, the kernel will pick a
    nearby page boundary (but always above or equal to the value specified by
    <i>/proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr</i>) and attempt to create the mapping there.
    If another mapping already exists there, the kernel picks a new address that
    may or may not depend on the hint. The address of the new mapping is
    returned as the result of the call.</p>
<p class="Pp">The contents of a file mapping (as opposed to an anonymous
    mapping; see <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b> below), are initialized using
    <i>length</i> bytes starting at offset <i>offset</i> in the file (or other
    object) referred to by the file descriptor <i>fd</i>. <i>offset</i> must be
    a multiple of the page size as returned by
  <i>sysconf(_SC_PAGE_SIZE)</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">After the <b>mmap</b>() call has returned, the file descriptor,
    <i>fd</i>, can be closed immediately without invalidating the mapping.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>prot</i> argument describes the desired memory protection
    of the mapping (and must not conflict with the open mode of the file). It is
    either <b>PROT_NONE</b> or the bitwise OR of one or more of the following
    flags:</p>

      kernel verifies all passed flags are known and fails the mapping with the
      error <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b> for unknown flags. This mapping type is also

  <dd>This flag provides behavior that is similar to <b>MAP_FIXED</b> with
      respect to the <i>addr</i> enforcement, but differs in that
      <b>MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE</b> never clobbers a preexisting mapped range. If

      address is one page lower than the memory area that is actually created in

<p class="Pp">On POSIX systems on which <b>mmap</b>(), <b>msync</b>(2), and
    <b>munmap</b>() are available, <b>_POSIX_MAPPED_FILES</b> is defined in
    <i>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</i> to a value greater than 0. (See also
    <b>sysconf</b>(3).)</p>

<p class="Pp">Memory mapped by <b>mmap</b>() is preserved across <b>fork</b>(2),
    with the same attributes.</p>
<p class="Pp">A file is mapped in multiples of the page size. For a file that is
    not a multiple of the page size, the remaining bytes in the partial page at
    the end of the mapping are zeroed when mapped, and modifications to that
    region are not written out to the file. The effect of changing the size of
    the underlying file of a mapping on the pages that correspond to added or
    removed regions of the file is unspecified.</p>
<p class="Pp">On some hardware architectures (e.g., i386), <b>PROT_WRITE</b>
    implies <b>PROT_READ</b>. It is architecture dependent whether
    <b>PROT_READ</b> implies <b>PROT_EXEC</b> or not. Portable programs should
    always set <b>PROT_EXEC</b> if they intend to execute code in the new
    mapping.</p>
<p class="Pp">The portable way to create a mapping is to specify <i>addr</i> as
    0 (NULL), and omit <b>MAP_FIXED</b> from <i>flags</i>. In this case, the
    system chooses the address for the mapping; the address is chosen so as not
    to conflict with any existing mapping, and will not be 0. If the
    <b>MAP_FIXED</b> flag is specified, and <i>addr</i> is 0 (NULL), then the
    mapped address will be 0 (NULL).</p>
<p class="Pp">Certain <i>flags</i> constants are defined only if suitable
    feature test macros are defined (possibly by default):
    <b>_DEFAULT_SOURCE</b> with glibc 2.19 or later; or <b>_BSD_SOURCE</b> or
    <b>_SVID_SOURCE</b> in glibc 2.19 and earlier. (Employing <b>_GNU_SOURCE</b>
    also suffices, and requiring that macro specifically would have been more
    logical, since these flags are all Linux-specific.) The relevant flags are:
    <b>MAP_32BIT</b>, <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b> (and the synonym <b>MAP_ANON</b>),
    <b>MAP_DENYWRITE</b>, <b>MAP_EXECUTABLE</b>, <b>MAP_FILE</b>,
    <b>MAP_GROWSDOWN</b>, <b>MAP_HUGETLB</b>, <b>MAP_LOCKED</b>,
    <b>MAP_NONBLOCK</b>, <b>MAP_NORESERVE</b>, <b>MAP_POPULATE</b>, and
    <b>MAP_STACK</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">An application can determine which pages of a mapping are
    currently resident in the buffer/page cache using <b>mincore</b>(2).</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Using_MAP_FIXED_safely"><a class="permalink" href="#Using_MAP_FIXED_safely">Using
  MAP_FIXED safely</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The only safe use for <b>MAP_FIXED</b> is where the address range
    specified by <i>addr</i> and <i>length</i> was previously reserved using
    another mapping; otherwise, the use of <b>MAP_FIXED</b> is hazardous because
    it forcibly removes preexisting mappings, making it easy for a multithreaded
    process to corrupt its own address space.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, suppose that thread A looks through
    <i>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/maps</i> in order to locate an unused address range
    that it can map using <b>MAP_FIXED</b>, while thread B simultaneously
    acquires part or all of that same address range. When thread A subsequently
    employs <b>mmap(MAP_FIXED)</b>, it will effectively clobber the mapping that
    thread B created. In this scenario, thread B need not create a mapping
    directly; simply making a library call that, internally, uses
    <b>dlopen</b>(3) to load some other shared library, will suffice. The
    <b>dlopen</b>(3) call will map the library into the process's address space.
    Furthermore, almost any library call may be implemented in a way that adds
    memory mappings to the address space, either with this technique, or by
    simply allocating memory. Examples include <b>brk</b>(2), <b>malloc</b>(3),
    <b>pthread_create</b>(3), and the PAM libraries
    <a class="Lk" href="http://www.linux-pam.org">http://www.linux-pam.org</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 4.17, a multithreaded program can use the
    <b>MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE</b> flag to avoid the hazard described above when
    attempting to create a mapping at a fixed address that has not been reserved
    by a preexisting mapping.</p>

  changes for file-backed mappings</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">For file-backed mappings, the <i>st_atime</i> field for the mapped
    file may be updated at any time between the <b>mmap</b>() and the
    corresponding unmapping; the first reference to a mapped page will update
    the field if it has not been already.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>st_ctime</i> and <i>st_mtime</i> field for a file mapped
    with <b>PROT_WRITE</b> and <b>MAP_SHARED</b> will be updated after a write
    to the mapped region, and before a subsequent <b>msync</b>(2) with the
    <b>MS_SYNC</b> or <b>MS_ASYNC</b> flag, if one occurs.</p>

  page (Huge TLB) mappings</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">For mappings that employ huge pages, the requirements for the
    arguments of <b>mmap</b>() and <b>munmap</b>() differ somewhat from the
    requirements for mappings that use the native system page size.</p>
<p class="Pp">For <b>mmap</b>(), <i>offset</i> must be a multiple of the
    underlying huge page size. The system automatically aligns <i>length</i> to
    be a multiple of the underlying huge page size.</p>
<p class="Pp">For <b>munmap</b>(), <i>addr</i>, and <i>length</i> must both be a
    multiple of the underlying huge page size.</p>

<p class="Pp">This page describes the interface provided by the glibc
    <b>mmap</b>() wrapper function. Originally, this function invoked a system
    call of the same name. Since Linux 2.4, that system call has been superseded
    by <b>mmap2</b>(2), and nowadays the glibc <b>mmap</b>() wrapper function
    invokes <b>mmap2</b>(2) with a suitably adjusted value for
  <i>offset</i>.</p>

<p class="Pp">On Linux, there are no guarantees like those suggested above under
    <b>MAP_NORESERVE</b>. By default, any process can be killed at any moment
    when the system runs out of memory.</p>
<p class="Pp">Before Linux 2.6.7, the <b>MAP_POPULATE</b> flag has effect only
    if <i>prot</i> is specified as <b>PROT_NONE</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">SUSv3 specifies that <b>mmap</b>() should fail if <i>length</i> is
    0. However, before Linux 2.6.12, <b>mmap</b>() succeeded in this case: no
    mapping was created and the call returned <i>addr</i>. Since Linux 2.6.12,
    <b>mmap</b>() fails with the error <b>EINVAL</b> for this case.</p>
<p class="Pp">POSIX specifies that the system shall always zero fill any partial
    page at the end of the object and that system will never write any
    modification of the object beyond its end. On Linux, when you write data to
    such partial page after the end of the object, the data stays in the page
    cache even after the file is closed and unmapped and even though the data is
    never written to the file itself, subsequent mappings may see the modified
    content. In some cases, this could be fixed by calling <b>msync</b>(2)
    before the unmap takes place; however, this doesn't work on <b>tmpfs</b>(5)
    (for example, when using the POSIX shared memory interface documented in
    <b>shm_overview</b>(7)).</p>
