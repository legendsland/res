<p class="Pp">The <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() function shall unblock all
    threads currently blocked on the specified condition variable
  <i>cond</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() function shall unblock at least
    one of the threads that are blocked on the specified condition variable
    <i>cond</i> (if any threads are blocked on <i>cond</i>).</p>
<p class="Pp">If more than one thread is blocked on a condition variable, the
    scheduling policy shall determine the order in which threads are unblocked.
    When each thread unblocked as a result of a <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>()
    or <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() returns from its call to
    <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() or <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>(), the thread
    shall own the mutex with which it called <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() or
    <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>(). The thread(s) that are unblocked shall
    contend for the mutex according to the scheduling policy (if applicable),
    and as if each had called <i>pthread_mutex_lock</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() or
    <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() functions may be called by a thread whether or
    not it currently owns the mutex that threads calling
    <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() or <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() have
    associated with the condition variable during their waits; however, if
    predictable scheduling behavior is required, then that mutex shall be locked
    by the thread calling <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() or
    <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() and
    <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() functions shall have no effect if there are no
    threads currently blocked on <i>cond</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the

<h1 class="Sh" id="APPLICATION_USAGE"><a class="permalink" href="#APPLICATION_USAGE">APPLICATION
  USAGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() function is used whenever the
    shared-variable state has been changed in a way that more than one thread
    can proceed with its task. Consider a single producer/multiple consumer
    problem, where the producer can insert multiple items on a list that is
    accessed one item at a time by the consumers. By calling the
    <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() function, the producer would notify all
    consumers that might be waiting, and thereby the application would receive
    more throughput on a multi-processor. In addition,
    <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() makes it easier to implement a read-write
    lock. The <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() function is needed in order to
    wake up all waiting readers when a writer releases its lock. Finally, the
    two-phase commit algorithm can use this broadcast function to notify all
    clients of an impending transaction commit.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is not safe to use the <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() function in
    a signal handler that is invoked asynchronously. Even if it were safe, there
    would still be a race between the test of the Boolean
    <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() that could not be efficiently eliminated.</p>
<p class="Pp">Mutexes and condition variables are thus not suitable for
    releasing a waiting thread by signaling from code running in a signal
    handler.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="permalink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
    <i>cond</i> argument to <i>pthread_cond_broadcast</i>() or
    <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() does not refer to an initialized condition
    variable, it is recommended that the function should fail and report an
    <b>[EINVAL]</b> error.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Multiple_Awakenings_by_Condition_Signal"><a class="permalink" href="#Multiple_Awakenings_by_Condition_Signal">Multiple
  Awakenings by Condition Signal</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">On a multi-processor, it may be impossible for an implementation
    of <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>() to avoid the unblocking of more than one
    thread blocked on a condition variable. For example, consider the following
    partial implementation of <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() and
    <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>(), executed by two threads in the order given.
    One thread is trying to wait on the condition variable, another is
    concurrently executing <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>(), while a third thread is
    already waiting.</p>

<p class="Pp">The effect is that more than one thread can return from its call
    to <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() or <i>pthread_cond_timedwait</i>() as a result
    of one call to <i>pthread_cond_signal</i>(). This effect is called
    ``spurious wakeup''. Note that the situation is self-correcting in that the
    number of threads that are so awakened is finite; for example, the next
    thread to call <i>pthread_cond_wait</i>() after the sequence of events above
    blocks.</p>
<p class="Pp">While this problem could be resolved, the loss of efficiency for a
    fringe condition that occurs only rarely is unacceptable, especially given
    that one has to check the predicate associated with a condition variable
    anyway. Correcting this problem would unnecessarily reduce the degree of
    concurrency in this basic building block for all higher-level
    synchronization operations.</p>
<p class="Pp">An added benefit of allowing spurious wakeups is that applications
    are forced to code a predicate-testing-loop around the condition wait. This
    also makes the application tolerate superfluous condition broadcasts or
    signals on the same condition variable that may be coded in some other part
    of the application. The resulting applications are thus more robust.
    Therefore, POSIX.1‐2008 explicitly documents that spurious wakeups
    may occur.</p>
