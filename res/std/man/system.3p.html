<p class="Pp">The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
    the ISO&nbsp;C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
    here and the ISO&nbsp;C standard is unintentional. This volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO&nbsp;C standard.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>command</i> is a null pointer, the <i>system</i>() function
    shall determine whether the host environment has a command processor. If
    <i>command</i> is not a null pointer, the <i>system</i>() function shall
    pass the string pointed to by <i>command</i> to that command processor to be
    executed in an implementation-defined manner; this might then cause the
    program calling <i>system</i>() to behave in a non-conforming manner or to
    terminate.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>system</i>() function shall behave as if a child process
    were created using <i>fork</i>(), and the child process invoked the
    <i>sh</i> utility using <i>execl</i>() as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>execl(&lt;<i>shell path</i>&gt;, "sh", "-c", <i>command</i>, (char *)0);</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">where &lt;<i>shell path</i>&gt; is an unspecified pathname for the
    <i>sh</i> utility. It is unspecified whether the handlers registered with
    <i>pthread_atfork</i>() are called as part of the creation of the child
    process.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>system</i>() function shall ignore the SIGINT and SIGQUIT
    signals, and shall block the SIGCHLD signal, while waiting for the command
    to terminate. If this might cause the application to miss a signal that
    would have killed it, then the application should examine the return value
    from <i>system</i>() and take whatever action is appropriate to the
    application if the command terminated due to receipt of a signal.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>system</i>() function shall not affect the termination
    status of any child of the calling processes other than the process or
    processes it itself creates.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>system</i>() function shall not return until the child
    process has terminated.</p>

<p class="Pp">If <i>command</i> is a null pointer, <i>system</i>() shall return
    non-zero to indicate that a command processor is available, or zero if none
    is available. The <i>system</i>() function shall always return non-zero when
    <i>command</i> is NULL.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>command</i> is not a null pointer, <i>system</i>() shall
    return the termination status of the command language interpreter in the
    format specified by <i>waitpid</i>(). The termination status shall be as
    defined for the <i>sh</i> utility; otherwise, the termination status is
    unspecified. If some error prevents the command language interpreter from
    executing after the child process is created, the return value from
    <i>system</i>() shall be as if the command language interpreter had
    terminated using <i>exit</i>(127) or <i>_exit</i>(127). If a child process
    cannot be created, or if the termination status for the command language
    interpreter cannot be obtained, <i>system</i>() shall return -1 and set
    <i>errno</i> to indicate the error.</p>

  USAGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If the return value of <i>system</i>() is not -1, its value can be
    decoded through the use of the macros described in
    <i>&lt;sys/wait.h&gt;</i>. For convenience, these macros are also provided
    in <i>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that, while <i>system</i>() must ignore SIGINT and SIGQUIT
    and block SIGCHLD while waiting for the child to terminate, the handling of
    signals in the executed command is as specified by <i>fork</i>() and
    <i>exec</i>. For example, if SIGINT is being caught or is set to SIG_DFL
    when <i>system</i>() is called, then the child is started with SIGINT
    handling set to SIG_DFL.</p>
<p class="Pp">Ignoring SIGINT and SIGQUIT in the parent process prevents
    coordination problems (two processes reading from the same terminal, for
    example) when the executed command ignores or catches one of the signals. It
    is also usually the correct action when the user has given a command to the
    application to be executed synchronously (as in the <b>'!'</b> command in
    many interactive applications). In either case, the signal should be
    delivered only to the child process, not to the application itself. There is
    one situation where ignoring the signals might have less than the desired
    effect. This is when the application uses <i>system</i>() to perform some
    task invisible to the user. If the user typed the interrupt character
    (<b>"^C"</b>, for example) while <i>system</i>() is being used in
    this way, one would expect the application to be killed, but only the
    executed command is killed. Applications that use <i>system</i>() in this
    way should carefully check the return status from <i>system</i>() to see if
    the executed command was successful, and should take appropriate action when
    the command fails.</p>
<p class="Pp">Blocking SIGCHLD while waiting for the child to terminate prevents
    the application from catching the signal and obtaining status from
    <i>system</i>()'s child process before <i>system</i>() can get the status
    itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">The context in which the utility is ultimately executed may differ
    from that in which <i>system</i>() was called. For example, file descriptors
    that have the FD_CLOEXEC flag set are closed, and the process ID and parent
    process ID are different. Also, if the executed utility changes its
    environment variables or its current working directory, that change is not
    reflected in the caller's context.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is no defined way for an application to find the specific
    path for the shell. However, <i>confstr</i>() can provide a value for
    <i>PATH</i> that is guaranteed to find the <i>sh</i> utility.</p>
<p class="Pp">Using the <i>system</i>() function in more than one thread in a
    process or when the SIGCHLD signal is being manipulated by more than one
    thread in a process may produce unexpected results.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="permalink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <i>system</i>() function should not be used by programs that
    have set user (or group) ID privileges. The <i>fork</i>() and <i>exec</i>
    family of functions (except <i>execlp</i>() and <i>execvp</i>()), should be
    used instead. This prevents any unforeseen manipulation of the environment
    of the user that could cause execution of commands not anticipated by the
    calling program.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are three levels of specification for the <i>system</i>()
    function. The ISO&nbsp;C standard gives the most basic. It requires that
    the function exists, and defines a way for an application to query whether a
    command language interpreter exists. It says nothing about the command
    language or the environment in which the command is interpreted.</p>
<p class="Pp">POSIX.1‐2008 places additional restrictions on
    <i>system</i>(). It requires that if there is a command language
    interpreter, the environment must be as specified by <i>fork</i>() and
    <i>exec</i>. This ensures, for example, that close-on-<i>exec</i> works,
    that file locks are not inherited, and that the process ID is different. It
    also specifies the return value from <i>system</i>() when the command line
    can be run, thus giving the application some information about the command's
    completion status.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, POSIX.1‐2008 requires the command to be
    interpreted as in the shell command language defined in the Shell and
    Utilities volume of POSIX.1‐2017.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that, <i>system</i>(NULL) is required to return non-zero,
    indicating that there is a command language interpreter. At first glance,
    this would seem to conflict with the ISO&nbsp;C standard which allows
    <i>system</i>(NULL) to return zero. There is no conflict, however. A system
    must have a command language interpreter, and is non-conforming if none is
    present. It is therefore permissible for the <i>system</i>() function on
    such a system to implement the behavior specified by the ISO&nbsp;C
    standard as long as it is understood that the implementation does not
    conform to POSIX.1‐2008 if <i>system</i>(NULL) returns zero.</p>
<p class="Pp">It was explicitly decided that when <i>command</i> is NULL,
    <i>system</i>() should not be required to check to make sure that the
    command language interpreter actually exists with the correct mode, that
    there are enough processes to execute it, and so on. The call
    <i>system</i>(NULL) could, theoretically, check for such problems as too
    many existing child processes, and return zero. However, it would be
    inappropriate to return zero due to such a (presumably) transient condition.
    If some condition exists that is not under the control of this application
    and that would cause any <i>system</i>() call to fail, that system has been
    rendered non-conforming.</p>
<p class="Pp">Early drafts required, or allowed, <i>system</i>() to return with
    <i>errno</i> set to <b>[EINTR]</b> if it was interrupted with a signal. This
    error return was removed, and a requirement that <i>system</i>() not return
    until the child has terminated was added. This means that if a
    <i>waitpid</i>() call in <i>system</i>() exits with <i>errno</i> set to
    <b>[EINTR]</b>, <i>system</i>() must reissue the <i>waitpid</i>(). This
    change was made for two reasons:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> 1.</dt>
  <dd>There is no way for an application to clean up if <i>system</i>() returns
      <b>[EINTR]</b>, short of calling <i>wait</i>(), and that could have the
      undesirable effect of returning the status of children other than the one
      started by <i>system</i>().</dd>
  <dt> 2.</dt>
  <dd>While it might require a change in some historical implementations, those
      implementations already have to be changed because they use <i>wait</i>()
      instead of <i>waitpid</i>().</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Note that if the application is catching SIGCHLD signals, it will
    receive such a signal before a successful <i>system</i>() call returns.</p>
<p class="Pp">To conform to POSIX.1‐2008, <i>system</i>() must use
    <i>waitpid</i>(), or some similar function, instead of <i>wait</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">The following code sample illustrates how <i>system</i>() might be
    implemented on an implementation conforming to POSIX.1‐2008.</p>

<p class="Pp">Note that, while a particular implementation of <i>system</i>()
    (such as the one above) can assume a particular path for the shell, such a
    path is not necessarily valid on another system. The above example is not
    portable, and is not intended to be.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note also that the above example implementation is not
    thread-safe. Implementations can provide a thread-safe <i>system</i>()
    function, but doing so involves complications such as how to restore the
    signal dispositions for SIGINT and SIGQUIT correctly if there are
    overlapping calls, and how to deal with cancellation. The example above
    would not restore the signal dispositions and would leak a process ID if
    cancelled. This does not matter for a non-thread-safe implementation since
    canceling a non-thread-safe function results in undefined behavior (see
    <i>Section 2.9.5.2</i>, <i>Cancellation Points</i>). To avoid leaking a
    process ID, a thread-safe implementation would need to terminate the child
    process when acting on a cancellation.</p>
<p class="Pp">One reviewer suggested that an implementation of <i>system</i>()
    might want to use an environment variable such as <i>SHELL</i> to determine
    which command interpreter to use. The supposed implementation would use the
    default command interpreter if the one specified by the environment variable
    was not available. This would allow a user, when using an application that
    prompts for command lines to be processed using <i>system</i>(), to specify
    a different command interpreter. Such an implementation is discouraged. If
    the alternate command interpreter did not follow the command line syntax
    specified in the Shell and Utilities volume of POSIX.1‐2017, then
    changing <i>SHELL</i> would render <i>system</i>() non-conforming. This
    would affect applications that expected the specified behavior from
    <i>system</i>(), and since the Shell and Utilities volume of
    POSIX.1‐2017 does not mention that <i>SHELL</i> affects
    <i>system</i>(), the application would not know that it needed to unset
    <i>SHELL</i>.</p>
