<p class="Pp">Two alternative functions were considered for sending the
    cancellation notification to a thread. One would be to define a new
    SIGCANCEL signal that had the cancellation semantics when delivered; the
    other was to define the new <i>pthread_cancel</i>() function, which would
    trigger the cancellation semantics.</p>
<p class="Pp">The advantage of a new signal was that so much of the delivery
    criteria were identical to that used when trying to deliver a signal that
    making cancellation notification a signal was seen as consistent. Indeed,
    many implementations implement cancellation using a special signal. On the
    other hand, there would be no signal functions that could be used with this
    signal except <i>pthread_kill</i>(), and the behavior of the delivered
    cancellation signal would be unlike any previously existing defined
  signal.</p>
<p class="Pp">The benefits of a special function include the recognition that
    this signal would be defined because of the similar delivery criteria and
    that this is the only common behavior between a cancellation request and a
    signal. In addition, the cancellation delivery mechanism does not have to be
    implemented as a signal. There are also strong, if not stronger, parallels
    with language exception mechanisms than with signals that are potentially
    obscured if the delivery mechanism is visibly closer to signals.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the end, it was considered that as there were so many
    exceptions to the use of the new signal with existing signals functions it
    would be misleading. A special function has resolved this problem. This
    function was carefully defined so that an implementation wishing to provide
    the cancellation functions on top of signals could do so. The special
    function also means that implementations are not obliged to implement
    cancellation with signals.</p>
<p class="Pp">If an implementation detects use of a thread ID after the end of
    its lifetime, it is recommended that the function should fail and report an
    <b>[ESRCH]</b> error.</p>
