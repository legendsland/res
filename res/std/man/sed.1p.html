<p class="Pp">The <i>script</i> shall consist of editing commands of the
    following form:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre><b>[</b><i>address</i><b>[</b>,<i>address</i><b>]]</b><i>function</i></pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">where <i>function</i> represents a single-character command verb
    from the list in <i>Editing Commands in sed</i>, followed by any applicable
    arguments.</p>
<p class="Pp">The command can be preceded by &lt;blank&gt; characters and/or
    &lt;semicolon&gt; characters. The function can be preceded by &lt;blank&gt;
    characters. These optional characters shall have no effect.</p>
<p class="Pp">In default operation, <i>sed</i> cyclically shall append a line of
    input, less its terminating &lt;newline&gt; character, into the pattern
    space. Reading from input shall be skipped if a &lt;newline&gt; was in the
    pattern space prior to a <b>D</b> command ending the previous cycle. The
    <i>sed</i> utility shall then apply in sequence all commands whose addresses
    select that pattern space, until a command starts the next cycle or quits.
    If no commands explicitly started a new cycle, then at the end of the script
    the pattern space shall be copied to standard output (except when <b>-n</b>
    is specified) and the pattern space shall be deleted. Whenever the pattern
    space is written to standard output or a named file, <i>sed</i> shall
    immediately follow it with a &lt;newline&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some of the editing commands use a hold space to save all or part
    of the pattern space for subsequent retrieval. The pattern and hold spaces
    shall each be able to hold at least 8192 bytes.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Addresses_in_sed"><a class="permalink" href="#Addresses_in_sed">Addresses
  in sed</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">An address is either a decimal number that counts input lines
    cumulatively across files, a <b>'$'</b> character that addresses the last
    line of input, or a context address (which consists of a BRE, as described
    in <i>Regular Expressions in sed</i>, preceded and followed by a delimiter,
    usually a &lt;slash&gt;).</p>
<p class="Pp">An editing command with no addresses shall select every pattern
    space.</p>
<p class="Pp">An editing command with one address shall select each pattern
    space that matches the address.</p>
<p class="Pp">An editing command with two addresses shall select the inclusive
    range from the first pattern space that matches the first address through
    the next pattern space that matches the second. (If the second address is a
    number less than or equal to the line number first selected, only one line
    shall be selected.) Starting at the first line following the selected range,
    <i>sed</i> shall look again for the first address. Thereafter, the process
    shall be repeated. Omitting either or both of the address components in the
    following form produces undefined results:</p>

<p class="Pp">The <i>sed</i> utility shall support the BREs described in the
    Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <i>Section 9.3</i>, <i>Basic
    Regular Expressions</i>, with the following additions:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>In a context address, the construction <b>"\cBREc"</b>, where
      <i>c</i> is any character other than &lt;backslash&gt; or &lt;newline&gt;,
      shall be identical to <b>"/BRE/"</b>. If the character
      designated by <i>c</i> appears following a &lt;backslash&gt;, then it
      shall be considered to be that literal character, which shall not
      terminate the BRE. For example, in the context address
      <b>"\xabc\xdefx"</b>, the second <i>x</i> stands for itself, so
      that the BRE is <b>"abcxdef"</b>.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>The escape sequence <b>'\n'</b> shall match a &lt;newline&gt; embedded in
      the pattern space. A literal &lt;newline&gt; shall not be used in the BRE
      of a context address or in the substitute function.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>If an RE is empty (that is, no pattern is specified) <i>sed</i> shall
      behave as if the last RE used in the last command applied (either as an

<h2 class="Ss" id="Editing_Commands_in_sed"><a class="permalink" href="#Editing_Commands_in_sed">Editing
  Commands in sed</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In the following list of editing commands, the maximum number of
    permissible addresses for each function is indicated by [<i>0addr</i>],
    [<i>1addr</i>], or [<i>2addr</i>], representing zero, one, or two
  addresses.</p>
<p class="Pp">The argument <i>text</i> shall consist of one or more lines. Each
    embedded &lt;newline&gt; in the text shall be preceded by a
    &lt;backslash&gt;. Other &lt;backslash&gt; characters in text shall be
    removed, and the following character shall be treated literally.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>r</b> and <b>w</b> command verbs, and the <i>w</i> flag to
    the <b>s</b> command, take an <i>rfile</i> (or <i>wfile</i>) parameter,
    separated from the command verb letter or flag by one or more &lt;blank&gt;
    characters; implementations may allow zero separation as an extension.</p>
<p class="Pp">The argument <i>rfile</i> or the argument <i>wfile</i> shall
    terminate the editing command. Each <i>wfile</i> shall be created before
    processing begins. Implementations shall support at least ten <i>wfile</i>
    arguments in the script; the actual number (greater than or equal to 10)
    that is supported by the implementation is unspecified. The use of the
    <i>wfile</i> parameter shall cause that file to be initially created, if it
    does not exist, or shall replace the contents of an existing file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>b</b>, <b>r</b>, <b>s</b>, <b>t</b>, <b>w</b>, <b>y</b>,
    and <b>:</b> command verbs shall accept additional arguments. The following
    synopses indicate which arguments shall be separated from the command verbs
    by a single &lt;space&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>a</b> and <b>r</b> commands schedule text for later output.
    The text specified for the <b>a</b> command, and the contents of the file
    specified for the <b>r</b> command, shall be written to standard output just
    before the next attempt to fetch a line of input when executing the <b>N</b>
    or <b>n</b> commands, or when reaching the end of the script. If written
    when reaching the end of the script, and the <b>-n</b> option was not
    specified, the text shall be written after copying the pattern space to
    standard output. The contents of the file specified for the <b>r</b> command
    shall be as of the time the output is written, not the time the <b>r</b>
    command is applied. The text shall be output in the order in which the
    <b>a</b> and <b>r</b> commands were applied to the input.</p>
<p class="Pp">Editing commands other than <b>{...}</b>, <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>,
    <b>c</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>r</b>, <b>t</b>, <b>w</b>, <b>:</b>, and <b>#</b> can
    be followed by a &lt;semicolon&gt;, optional &lt;blank&gt; characters, and
    another editing command. However, when an <b>s</b> editing command is used
    with the <i>w</i> flag, following it with another command in this manner
    produces undefined results.</p>
<p class="Pp">A function can be preceded by a <b>'!'</b> character, in which
    case the function shall be applied if the addresses do not select the
    pattern space. Zero or more &lt;blank&gt; characters shall be accepted
    before the <b>'!'</b> character. It is unspecified whether &lt;blank&gt;
    characters can follow the <b>'!'</b> character, and conforming applications
    shall not follow the <b>'!'</b> character with &lt;blank&gt; characters.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a <i>label</i> argument (to a <b>b</b>, <b>t</b>, or <b>:</b>
    command) contains characters outside of the portable filename character set,
    or if a <i>label</i> is longer than 8 bytes, the behavior is unspecified.
    The implementation shall support <i>label</i> arguments recognized as unique
    up to at least 8 bytes; the actual length (greater than or equal to 8)
    supported by the implementation is unspecified. It is unspecified whether
    exceeding the maximum supported label length causes an error or a silent

    <i>n</i> is a digit in this context, can be suppressed by preceding it by a

    unspecified.</p>
<p class="Pp">A substitution shall be considered to have been performed even if
    the replacement string is identical to the string that it replaces. Any
    &lt;backslash&gt; used to alter the default meaning of a subsequent
    character shall be discarded from the BRE or the replacement before
    evaluating the BRE or using the replacement.</p>
<p class="Pp">The value of <i>flags</i> shall be zero or more of:</p>

      of characters in <i>string1</i> and <i>string2</i> are not equal, or if
      any of the characters in <i>string1</i> appear more than once, the results
      are undefined. Any character other than &lt;backslash&gt; or

      <i>string2</i>, the delimiter itself can be used as a literal character if
      it is preceded by a &lt;backslash&gt;. If a &lt;backslash&gt; character is
      immediately followed by a &lt;backslash&gt; character in <i>string1</i> or
      <i>string2</i>, the two &lt;backslash&gt; characters shall be counted as a

<p class="Pp">Regular expressions match entire strings, not just individual
    lines, but a &lt;newline&gt; is matched by <b>'\n'</b> in a <i>sed</i> RE; a
    &lt;newline&gt; is not allowed by the general definition of regular
    expression in POSIX.1‐2008. Also note that <b>'\n'</b> cannot be used
    to match a &lt;newline&gt; at the end of an arbitrary input line;
    &lt;newline&gt; characters appear in the pattern space as a result of the
    <b>N</b> editing command.</p>
<p class="Pp">When using <i>sed</i> to process pathnames, it is recommended that
    LC_ALL, or at least LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE, are set to POSIX or C in the
    environment, since pathnames can contain byte sequences that do not form
    valid characters in some locales, in which case the utility's behavior would
    be undefined. In the POSIX locale each byte is a valid single-byte
    character, and therefore this problem is avoided.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="permalink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires implementations to
    support at least ten distinct <i>wfile</i>s, matching historical practice on
    many implementations. Implementations are encouraged to support more, but
    conforming applications should not exceed this limit.</p>
<p class="Pp">The exit status codes specified here are different from those in
    System V. System V returns 2 for garbled <i>sed</i> commands, but returns
    zero with its usage message or if the input file could not be opened. The
    standard developers considered this to be a bug.</p>
<p class="Pp">The manner in which the <b>l</b> command writes non-printable
    characters was changed to avoid the historical backspace-overstrike method,
    and other requirements to achieve unambiguous output were added. See the
    RATIONALE for <i><i>ed</i></i> for details of the format chosen, which is
    the same as that chosen for <i>sed</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires implementations to
    provide pattern and hold spaces of at least 8192 bytes, larger than the 4000
    bytes spaces used by some historical implementations, but less than the
    20480 bytes limit used in an early proposal. Implementations are encouraged
    to allocate dynamically larger pattern and hold spaces as needed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The requirements for acceptance of &lt;blank&gt; and &lt;space&gt;
    characters in command lines has been made more explicit than in early
    proposals to describe clearly the historical practice and to remove
    confusion about the phrase ``protect initial blanks [<i>sic</i>] and tabs
    from the stripping that is done on every script line'' that appears in much
    of the historical documentation of the <i>sed</i> utility description of
    text. (Not all implementations are known to have stripped &lt;blank&gt;
    characters from text lines, although they all have allowed leading
    &lt;blank&gt; characters preceding the address on a command line.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The treatment of <b>'#'</b> comments differs from the SVID which
    only allows a comment as the first line of the script, but matches
    BSD-derived implementations. The comment character is treated as a command,
    and it has the same properties in terms of being accepted with leading
    &lt;blank&gt; characters; the BSD implementation has historically supported
    this.</p>
<p class="Pp">Early proposals required that a <i>script_file</i> have at least
    one non-comment line. Some historical implementations have behaved in
    unexpected ways if this were not the case. The standard developers
    considered that this was incorrect behavior and that application developers
    should not have to avoid this feature. A correct implementation of this
    volume of POSIX.1‐2017 shall permit <i>script_file</i>s that consist
    only of comment lines.</p>
<p class="Pp">Early proposals indicated that if <b>-e</b> and <b>-f</b> options
    were intermixed, all <b>-e</b> options were processed before any <b>-f</b>
    options. This has been changed to process them in the order presented
    because it matches historical practice and is more intuitive.</p>
<p class="Pp">The treatment of the <b>p</b> flag to the <b>s</b> command differs
    between System V and BSD-based systems when the default output is
    suppressed. In the two examples:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>echo a | sed    's/a/A/p'
echo a | sed -n 's/a/A/p'</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, BSD, System V documentation,
    and the SVID indicate that the first example should write two lines with
    <b>A</b>, whereas the second should write one. Some System V systems write
    the <b>A</b> only once in both examples because the <b>p</b> flag is ignored
    if the <b>-n</b> option is not specified.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is a case of a diametrical difference between systems that
    could not be reconciled through the compromise of declaring the behavior to
    be unspecified. The SVID/BSD/System V documentation behavior was adopted for
    this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 because:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>No known documentation for any historic system describes the interaction
      between the <b>p</b> flag and the <b>-n</b> option.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>The selected behavior is more correct as there is no technical
      justification for any interaction between the <b>p</b> flag and the
      <b>-n</b> option. A relationship between <b>-n</b> and the <b>p</b> flag
      might imply that they are only used together, but this ignores valid
      scripts that interrupt the cyclical nature of the processing through the
      use of the <b>D</b>, <b>d</b>, <b>q</b>, or branching commands. Such
      scripts rely on the <b>p</b> suffix to write the pattern space because
      they do not make use of the default output at the ``bottom'' of the
      script.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>Because the <b>-n</b> option makes the <b>p</b> flag unnecessary, any
      interaction would only be useful if <i>sed</i> scripts were written to run
      both with and without the <b>-n</b> option. This is believed to be
      unlikely. It is even more unlikely that programmers have coded the
      <b>p</b> flag expecting it to be unnecessary. Because the interaction was
      not documented, the likelihood of a programmer discovering the interaction
      and depending on it is further decreased.</dd>
  <dt> *</dt>
  <dd>Finally, scripts that break under the specified behavior produce too much
      output instead of too little, which is easier to diagnose and
    correct.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The form of the substitute command that uses the <b>n</b> suffix
    was limited to the first 512 matches in an early proposal. This limit has
    been removed because there is no reason an editor processing lines of
    {LINE_MAX} length should have this restriction. The command
    <b>s/a/A/2047</b> should be able to substitute the 2047th occurrence of
    <b>a</b> on a line.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>b</b>, <b>t</b>, and <b>:</b> commands are documented to
    ignore leading white space, but no mention is made of trailing white space.
    Historical implementations of <i>sed</i> assigned different locations to the
    labels <b>'x'</b> and <b>"x&nbsp;"</b>. This is not useful, and
    leads to subtle programming errors, but it is historical practice, and
    changing it could theoretically break working scripts. Implementors are
    encouraged to provide warning messages about labels that are never
    referenced by a <b>b</b> or <b>t</b> command, jumps to labels that do not
    exist, and label arguments that are subject to truncation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Earlier versions of this standard allowed for implementations with
    bytes other than eight bits, but this has been modified in this version.</p>
