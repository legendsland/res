<p class="Pp">These functions create, access, and modify a database.</p>
<p class="Pp">A <b>datum</b> consists of at least two members, <i>dptr</i> and
    <i>dsize</i>. The <i>dptr</i> member points to an object that is
    <i>dsize</i> bytes in length. Arbitrary binary data, as well as character
    strings, may be stored in the object pointed to by <i>dptr</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">A database shall be stored in one or two files. When one file is
    used, the name of the database file shall be formed by appending the suffix
    <b>.db</b> to the <i>file</i> argument given to <i>dbm_open</i>(). When two
    files are used, the names of the database files shall be formed by appending
    the suffixes <b>.dir</b> and <b>.pag</b> respectively to the <i>file</i>
    argument.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>dbm_open</i>() function shall open a database. The
    <i>file</i> argument to the function is the pathname of the database. The
    <i>open_flags</i> argument has the same meaning as the <i>flags</i> argument
    of <i>open</i>() except that a database opened for write-only access opens
    the files for read and write access and the behavior of the O_APPEND flag is
    unspecified. The <i>file_mode</i> argument has the same meaning as the third
    argument of <i>open</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>dbm_open</i>() function need not accept pathnames longer
    than {PATH_MAX}-4 bytes (including the terminating null), or pathnames with
    a last component longer than {NAME_MAX}-4 bytes (excluding the terminating
    null).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>dbm_close</i>() function shall close a database. The
    application shall ensure that argument <i>db</i> is a pointer to a
    <b>dbm</b> structure that has been returned from a call to
    <i>dbm_open</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">These database functions shall support an internal block size
    large enough to support key/content pairs of at least 1023 bytes.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>dbm_fetch</i>() function shall read a record from a
    database. The argument <i>db</i> is a pointer to a database structure that
    has been returned from a call to <i>dbm_open</i>(). The argument <i>key</i>
    is a <b>datum</b> that has been initialized by the application to the value
    of the key that matches the key of the record the program is fetching.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>dbm_store</i>() function shall write a record to a
    database. The argument <i>db</i> is a pointer to a database structure that
    has been returned from a call to <i>dbm_open</i>(). The argument <i>key</i>
    is a <b>datum</b> that has been initialized by the application to the value
    of the key that identifies (for subsequent reading, writing, or deleting)
    the record the application is writing. The argument <i>content</i> is a
    <b>datum</b> that has been initialized by the application to the value of
    the record the program is writing. The argument <i>store_mode</i> controls
    whether <i>dbm_store</i>() replaces any pre-existing record that has the
    same key that is specified by the <i>key</i> argument. The application shall
    set <i>store_mode</i> to either DBM_INSERT or DBM_REPLACE. If the database
    contains a record that matches the <i>key</i> argument and <i>store_mode</i>
    is DBM_REPLACE, the existing record shall be replaced with the new record.
    If the database contains a record that matches the <i>key</i> argument and
    <i>store_mode</i> is DBM_INSERT, the existing record shall be left unchanged
    and the new record ignored. If the database does not contain a record that
    matches the <i>key</i> argument and <i>store_mode</i> is either DBM_INSERT
    or DBM_REPLACE, the new record shall be inserted in the database.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the sum of a key/content pair exceeds the internal block size,
    the result is unspecified. Moreover, the application shall ensure that all
    key/content pairs that hash together fit on a single block. The
    <i>dbm_store</i>() function shall return an error in the event that a disk
    block fills with inseparable data.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>dbm_delete</i>() function shall delete a record and its key
    from the database. The argument <i>db</i> is a pointer to a database
    structure that has been returned from a call to <i>dbm_open</i>(). The
    argument <i>key</i> is a <b>datum</b> that has been initialized by the
    application to the value of the key that identifies the record the program
    is deleting.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>dbm_firstkey</i>() function shall return the first key in
    the database. The argument <i>db</i> is a pointer to a database structure
    that has been returned from a call to <i>dbm_open</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>dbm_nextkey</i>() function shall return the next key in the
    database. The argument <i>db</i> is a pointer to a database structure that
    has been returned from a call to <i>dbm_open</i>(). The application shall
    ensure that the <i>dbm_firstkey</i>() function is called before calling
    <i>dbm_nextkey</i>(). Subsequent calls to <i>dbm_nextkey</i>() return the
    next key until all of the keys in the database have been returned.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>dbm_error</i>() function shall return the error condition
    of the database. The argument <i>db</i> is a pointer to a database structure
    that has been returned from a call to <i>dbm_open</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>dbm_clearerr</i>() function shall clear the error condition
    of the database. The argument <i>db</i> is a pointer to a database structure
    that has been returned from a call to <i>dbm_open</i>().</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>dptr</i> pointers returned by these functions may point
    into static storage that may be changed by subsequent calls.</p>
<p class="Pp">These functions need not be thread-safe.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RETURN_VALUE"><a class="permalink" href="#RETURN_VALUE">RETURN
  VALUE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <i>dbm_store</i>() and <i>dbm_delete</i>() functions shall
    return 0 when they succeed and a negative value when they fail.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>dbm_store</i>() function shall return 1 if it is called
    with a <i>flags</i> value of DBM_INSERT and the function finds an existing
    record with the same key.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>dbm_error</i>() function shall return 0 if the error
    condition is not set and return a non-zero value if the error condition is
    set.</p>
<p class="Pp">The return value of <i>dbm_clearerr</i>() is unspecified.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>dbm_firstkey</i>() and <i>dbm_nextkey</i>() functions shall
    return a key <b>datum</b>. When the end of the database is reached, the
    <i>dptr</i> member of the key is a null pointer. If an error is detected,
    the <i>dptr</i> member of the key shall be a null pointer and the error
    condition of the database shall be set.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>dbm_fetch</i>() function shall return a content
    <b>datum</b>. If no record in the database matches the key or if an error
    condition has been detected in the database, the <i>dptr</i> member of the
    content shall be a null pointer.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>dbm_open</i>() function shall return a pointer to a
    database structure. If an error is detected during the operation,
    <i>dbm_open</i>() shall return a (<b>DBM *</b>)0.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="APPLICATION_USAGE"><a class="permalink" href="#APPLICATION_USAGE">APPLICATION
  USAGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The following code can be used to traverse the database:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>for(key = dbm_firstkey(db); key.dptr != NULL; key = dbm_nextkey(db))</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <i>dbm_</i>* functions provided in this library should not be
    confused in any way with those of a general-purpose database management
    system. These functions do not provide for multiple search keys per entry,
    they do not protect against multi-user access (in other words they do not
    lock records or files), and they do not provide the many other useful
    database functions that are found in more robust database management
    systems. Creating and updating databases by use of these functions is
    relatively slow because of data copies that occur upon hash collisions.
    These functions are useful for applications requiring fast lookup of
    relatively static information that is to be indexed by a single key.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that a strictly conforming application is extremely limited
    by these functions: since there is no way to determine that the keys in use
    do not all hash to the same value (although that would be rare), a strictly
    conforming application cannot be guaranteed that it can store more than one
    block's worth of data in the database. As long as a key collision does not
    occur, additional data may be stored, but because there is no way to
    determine whether an error is due to a key collision or some other error
    condition (<i>dbm_error</i>() being effectively a Boolean), once an error is
    detected, the application is effectively limited to guessing what the error
    might be if it wishes to continue using these functions.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>dbm_delete</i>() function need not physically reclaim file
    space, although it does make it available for reuse by the database.</p>
<p class="Pp">After calling <i>dbm_store</i>() or <i>dbm_delete</i>() during a
    pass through the keys by <i>dbm_firstkey</i>() and <i>dbm_nextkey</i>(), the
    application should reset the database by calling <i>dbm_firstkey</i>()
    before again calling <i>dbm_nextkey</i>(). The contents of these files are
    unspecified and may not be portable.</p>
<p class="Pp">Applications should take care that database pathname arguments
    specified to <i>dbm_open</i>() are not prefixes of unrelated files. This
    might be done, for example, by placing databases in a separate
  directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since some implementations use three characters for a suffix and
    others use four characters for a suffix, applications should ensure that the
    maximum portable pathname length passed to <i>dbm_open</i>() is no greater
    than {PATH_MAX}-4 bytes, with the last component of the pathname no greater
    than {NAME_MAX}-4 bytes.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RATIONALE"><a class="permalink" href="#RATIONALE">RATIONALE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Previously the standard required the database to be stored in two
    files, one file being a directory containing a bitmap of keys and having
    <b>.dir</b> as its suffix. The second file containing all data and having
    <b>.pag</b> as its suffix. This has been changed not to specify the use of
    the files and to allow newer implementations of the Berkeley DB interface
    using a single file that have evolved while remaining compatible with the
    application programming interface. The standard developers considered
    removing the specific suffixes altogether but decided to retain them so as
    not to pollute the application file name space more than necessary and to
    allow for portable backups of the database.</p>
