<p class="Pp">libc - overview of standard C libraries on Linux</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The term “libc” is commonly used as a shorthand for
    the “standard C library” a library of standard functions that
    can be used by all C programs (and sometimes by programs in other
    languages). Because of some history (see below), use of the term
    “libc” to refer to the standard C library is somewhat
    ambiguous on Linux.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="glibc"><a class="permalink" href="#glibc">glibc</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">By far the most widely used C library on Linux is the
    <a class="Lk" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/">GNU C Library</a>,
    often referred to as <i>glibc</i>. This is the C library that is nowadays
    used in all major Linux distributions. It is also the C library whose
    details are documented in the relevant pages of the <i>man-pages</i> project
    (primarily in Section 3 of the manual). Documentation of glibc is also
    available in the glibc manual, available via the command <i>info libc</i>.
    Release 1.0 of glibc was made in September 1992. (There were earlier 0.x
    releases.) The next major release of glibc was 2.0, at the beginning of
    1997.</p>
<p class="Pp">The pathname <i>/lib/libc.so.6</i> (or something similar) is
    normally a symbolic link that points to the location of the glibc library,
    and executing this pathname will cause glibc to display various information
    about the version installed on your system.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Linux_libc"><a class="permalink" href="#Linux_libc">Linux
  libc</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In the early to mid 1990s, there was for a while <i>Linux
    libc</i>, a fork of glibc 1.x created by Linux developers who felt that
    glibc development at the time was not sufficing for the needs of Linux.
    Often, this library was referred to (ambiguously) as just
    “libc”. Linux libc released major versions 2, 3, 4, and 5, as
    well as many minor versions of those releases. Linux libc4 was the last
    version to use the a.out binary format, and the first version to provide
    (primitive) shared library support. Linux libc 5 was the first version to
    support the ELF binary format; this version used the shared library soname
    <i>libc.so.5</i>. For a while, Linux libc was the standard C library in many
    Linux distributions.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, notwithstanding the original motivations of the Linux
    libc effort, by the time glibc 2.0 was released (in 1997), it was clearly
    superior to Linux libc, and all major Linux distributions that had been
    using Linux libc soon switched back to glibc. To avoid any confusion with
    Linux libc versions, glibc 2.0 and later used the shared library soname
    <i>libc.so.6</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since the switch from Linux libc to glibc 2.0 occurred long ago,
    <i>man-pages</i> no longer takes care to document Linux libc details.
    Nevertheless, the history is visible in vestiges of information about Linux
    libc that remain in a few manual pages, in particular, references to
    <i>libc4</i> and <i>libc5</i>.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Other_C_libraries"><a class="permalink" href="#Other_C_libraries">Other
  C libraries</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">There are various other less widely used C libraries for Linux.
    These libraries are generally smaller than glibc, both in terms of features
    and memory footprint, and often intended for building small binaries,
    perhaps targeted at development for embedded Linux systems. Among such
    libraries are <a class="Lk" href="http://www.uclibc.org/"><i>uClibc</i></a>,
    <a class="Lk" href="http://www.fefe.de/dietlibc/"><i>dietlibc</i></a>, and
    <a class="Lk" href="http://www.musl-libc.org/"><i>musl libc</i></a>. Details
    of these libraries are covered by the <i>man-pages</i> project, where they
    are known.</p>
