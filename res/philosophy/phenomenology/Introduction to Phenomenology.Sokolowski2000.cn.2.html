  <p>感谢已故的 Gian-Carlo Rota 向我建议本书的主题，并在写作过程中给予我鼓励和帮助。在引言中，我描述了本书的概念是如何在我们之间的对话中产生的。我无法与他分享完成的作品，这只是他最近突然去世所造成的众多悲伤之一。</p><p>I am indebted to the late Gian-Carlo Rota for suggesting the topic of this book to me, and for his encouragement and help as the writing progressed. In the Introduction I describe how the concept of the book arose in a conversation between us. The fact that I cannot share the completed work with him is only one of the many sorrows caused by his recent, sudden death.</p>

  <p>许多朋友和同事对手稿的早期草稿发表了评论，在几个地方，我不仅使用了他们的想法，还使用了他们的表述。我感谢 John Brough、Richard Cobb-Stevens、John Drummond、James Hart、Richard Hassing、Piet Hut、John Smolko、Robert Tragesser 和 Kevin White。约翰·麦卡锡 (John McCarthy) 的言论特别慷慨。我使用了这项工作的早期版本作为美国天主教大学课程的基础，我很感谢参与其中的学生的回应和建议。艾米辛格的一些短语特别有用。最后，我非常感谢弗朗西斯·斯莱德 (Francis Slade) 在整本书中使用的思想和表述，尤其是他关于现代性的观点，我在最后一章的材料中依赖这些观点。</p><p>Many friends and colleagues have commented on earlier drafts of the manuscript, and in several places I have used not only their ideas, but also their formulations. I am grateful to John Brough, Richard Cobb-Stevens, John Drummond, James Hart, Richard Hassing, Piet Hut, John Smolko, Robert Tragesser, and Kevin White. John McCarthy was particularly generous with his remarks. I used an earlier version of this work as the basis for a course at The Catholic University of America, and I am grateful for the response and suggestions of the students who participated in it. Some of Amy Singer's phrases were especially useful. Finally, I am much obliged to Francis Slade for thoughts and formulations that I used throughout the book, especially for his ideas about modernity, which I relied on for the material in the final chapter.</p>

  <h1 id="OEBPS/Text/introduction.xhtml.heading_id_2">介绍</h1><h1>Introduction</h1>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/introduction.xhtml.heading_id_3"><a id="OEBPS/Text/introduction.xhtml.i_opb"></a>本书的来源和目的</h2><h2><a></a>ORIGIN AND PURPOSE OF THE BOOK</h2>

  <p>编写本书的计划始于 1996 年春天我与 Gian-Carlo Rota 的一次谈话。当时他正在美国天主教大学担任数学和哲学客座教授。</p><p>The project of writing this book began in a conversation I had with Gian-Carlo Rota in the spring of 1996. He was then lecturing as visiting professor of mathematics and philosophy at The Catholic University of America.</p>

  <p>罗塔经常提请注意数学家和哲学家之间的区别。他说，数学家倾向于将前人的著作直接吸收到自己的工作中。他们不评论早期数学家的著作，即使他们深受这些著作的影响。他们只是利用他们在阅读的作者身上找到的材料。当数学取得进步时，后来的思想家会浓缩这些发现并继续前进。很少有数学家研究过去几个世纪的著作；与当代数学相比，这些古老的著作在他们看来几乎就像是孩子们的作品。</p><p>Rota had often drawn attention to a difference between mathematicians and philosophers. Mathematicians, he said, tend to absorb the writings of their predecessors directly into their own work. They do not comment on the writings of earlier mathematicians, even if they have been very much influenced by them. They simply make use of the material that they find in the authors they read. When advances are made in mathematics, later thinkers condense the findings and move on. Few mathematicians study works from past centuries; compared with contemporary mathematics, such older writings seem to them almost like the work of children.</p>

  <p>相比之下，在哲学中，经典作品往往被奉为释经的对象，而不是可供开发的资源。罗塔观察到，哲学家往往不会问：“我们从这里去哪里？” 相反，他们告诉我们主要思想家的学说。他们倾向于评论早期作品而不是解释它们。罗塔承认评论的价值，但认为哲学家应该做得更多。除了提供说明外，他们还应该删减早期的著作并直接解决问题，用自己的声音说话，并将前人所做的融入自己的工作中。他们应该提取和注释。</p><p>In philosophy, by contrast, classical works often become enshrined as objects of exegesis rather than resources to be exploited. Philosophers, Rota observed, tend not to ask, "Where do we go from here?" Instead, they inform us about the doctrines of major thinkers. They are prone to comment on earlier works rather than paraphrase them. Rota acknowledged the value of commentaries but thought that philosophers ought to do more. Besides offering exposition, they should abridge earlier writings and directly address issues, speaking in their own voice and incorporating into their own work what their predecessors have done. They should extract as well as annotate.</p>

  <p>正是在这种背景下，在我的一节课结束后，当我们在大学哥伦布法学院的自助餐厅喝咖啡时，罗塔对我说，“你应该写一篇现象学导论。就写吧。不要说胡塞尔或海德格尔的想法，只是告诉人们什么是现象学。没有花哨的标题，称它为现象学导论”。</p><p>It was against this background that Rota said to me, after one of my classes, as we were having coffee in the cafeteria of the university's Columbus School of Law, "You should write an introduction to phenomenology. Just write it. Don't say what Husserl or Heidegger thought, just tell people what phenomenology is. No fancy title; call it an introduction to phenomenology".</p>

  <p>我觉得这是非常好的建议。评论胡塞尔的书籍和文章很多；为什么不试着模仿他自己写的几篇介绍呢？这样做似乎是对的，因为现象学可以继续对当前的哲学做出重要贡献。它的智力资本远未耗尽，其哲学能量在很大程度上仍未开发。</p><p>This struck me as very good advice. There are many books and articles that comment on Husserl; why not try to imitate the several introductions that he himself had written? It seemed right to do so, because phenomenology can continue to make an important contribution to current philosophy. Its intellectual capital is far from spent, and its philosophical energy is still largely unexploited.</p>

  <p>现象学是对人类经验以及事物在这种经验中并通过这种经验呈现给我们的方式的研究。它试图恢复人们在柏拉图身上发现的哲学意义。此外，这不仅仅是一场古董复兴，而是一场面对现代思想提出的问题的复兴。它超越古今，力求在我们当下的境遇中重新激活哲学生活。因此，我写这本书不仅是为了让读者了解某个特定的哲学运动，而且是在哲学思考受到严重质疑或基本上被忽视的时候提供哲学思考的可能性。</p><p>Phenomenology is the study of human experience and of the ways things present themselves to us in and through such experience. It attempts to restore the sense of philosophy one finds in Plato. It is, moreover, not just an antiquarian revival, but one that confronts the issues raised by modern thought. It goes beyond ancients and moderns and strives to reactivate the philosophical life in our present circumstances. My book is written, therefore, not just to inform readers about a particular philosophical movement, but to offer the possibility of philosophical thinking at a time when such thinking is seriously called into question or largely ignored.</p>

  <p>因为这本书是现象学的介绍，所以我使用了在那个传统中发展起来的哲学词汇。我使用诸如“意向性”、“证据”、“宪法”、“范畴直觉”、“生活世界”和“本质直觉”等词。但是，我不会对这些术语发表评论，就好像它们与我自己的想法是陌生的一样；我用它们。我认为他们命名了重要的现象，我想让本书的读者能够了解这些现象。在本书中，我不追溯这些和其他术语在胡塞尔的著作中以及在海德格尔、梅洛-庞蒂和其他现象学家的著作中出现的方式；我直接使用这些词，因为它们仍然有生命。例如，谈论证据本身是合法的，而不仅仅是胡塞尔关于证据的说法。这些术语不需要仅通过显示其他人如何使用它们来解释。我们不必为了从中获利而将它们钉在墙上。</p><p>Because this book is an introduction to phenomenology, I use the philosophical vocabulary developed in that tradition. I employ words like "intentionality," "evidence," "constitution," "categorial intuition," the "life world," and "eidetic intuition". However, I do not comment on these terms as though they were alien to my own thinking; I use them. I think they name important phenomena, and I want to make these phenomena available to the readers of this book. I do not, in this work, trace the manner in which these and other terms arose in Husserl's writings and in the work of Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, and other phenomenologists; I use the words directly because they still have life in them. It is legitimate, for example, to speak about evidence as such, and not only about what Husserl said about evidence. These terms need not be explained only by showing how other people have used them. We do not have to pin them to the wall in order to profit from them.</p>

  <p>我将在本书的附录中留下现象学的历史概览。现在，让我们简单回忆一下，埃德蒙·胡塞尔（1859-1938）是现象学的奠基人，他的著作<em>《逻辑研究》</em>可以公正地认为是运动的最初声明。这本书分两部分出版，分别于 1900 年和 1901 年出版，因此现象学是在新世纪初开始的。当我们现在站在那段时间的尽头时，我们可以回顾几乎恰好一百年的运动历史。马丁·海德格尔（1889-1976）是胡塞尔的弟子、同事，后来成为对手，是德国现象学的另一位重要人物。该运动在法国也蓬勃发展，其代表人物有伊曼纽尔·列维纳斯（1906-1995 年）、让-保罗·萨特（1905-1980 年）、莫里斯·梅洛-庞蒂（1907-1960 年）和保罗·利科（生于 1913 年） ). 革命前的俄罗斯以及比利时、西班牙、意大利、波兰、英国和美国都有重大发展。现象学影响了许多其他哲学和文化运动，例如解释学、结构主义、文学形式主义和解构主义。在整个二十世纪，它一直是所谓的“大陆”哲学的主要组成部分，这与英国和美国哲学的“分析”传统截然不同。</p><p>I will leave a historical survey of phenomenology for the appendix to this book. For the moment, let us simply recall that Edmund Husserl (1859-1938) was the founder of phenomenology, and that his work <em>Logical Investigations</em> can justly be considered the initial statement of the movement. The book appeared in two parts, in 1900 and 1901, so phenomenology began with the dawn of the new century. As we now stand at the end of that period of time, we can look back at almost precisely one hundred years of the movement's history. Martin Heidegger (1889-1976), a disciple, colleague, and later rival of Husserl, was the other major figure in German phenomenology. The movement also flourished in France, where it was represented by such authors as Emmanuel Levinas (1906-1995), Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980), Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1907-1960), and Paul Ricoeur (b. 1913). There were significant developments in prerevolutionary Russia and in Belgium, Spain, Italy, Poland, England, and the United States. Phenomenology influenced many other philosophical and cultural movements, such as hermeneutics, structuralism, literary formalism, and deconstruction. Through the whole of the twentieth century, it has been the major component in what is called "continental" philosophy, as opposed to the "analytic" tradition that has typified philosophy in England and the United States.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/introduction.xhtml.heading_id_4"><a id="OEBPS/Text/introduction.xhtml.i_pia"></a>现象学和表象问题</h2><h2><a></a>PHENOMENOLOGY AND THE ISSUE OF APPERANCES</h2>

  <p>现象学是一项重要的哲学运动，因为它很好地处理了表象问题。从哲学一开始，表象问题就是人类问题的一部分。智者通过文字的魔力操纵表象，柏拉图对他们所说的做出回应。从那时起，外观已经成倍增加并被极大地放大了。我们不仅通过一个人对另一个人说或写的文字，而且通过麦克风、电话、电影和电视，以及通过计算机和互联网，以及通过宣传和广告来产生它们。呈现和表示的模式激增，并且出现了有趣的问题：电子邮件消息与电话和信件有何不同？当我们阅读网页时，谁在向我们讲话？我们现在的交流方式如何改变说话者、听众和对话？</p><p>Phenomenology is a significant philosophical movement because it deals so well with the problem of appearances. The issue of appearances has been part of the human question from the beginning of philosophy. The Sophists manipulated appearances through the magic of words, and Plato responded to what they said. Since then, appearances have been multiplied and magnified enormously. We generate them not only by words spoken or written by one person to another, but by microphones, telephones, movies, and television, as well as by computers and the Internet, and by propaganda and advertising. Modes of presentation and representation proliferate, and fascinating issues arise: How is an e-mail message different from a telephone call and a letter? Who is addressing us when we read a Web page? How are speakers, listeners, and conversation modified by the way we communicate now?</p>

  <p>我们面临的危险之一是，随着图像和文字的技术扩展，一切似乎都分崩离析，只剩下表象。我们可以根据部分和整体、流形中的同一性以及存在与不存在这三个主题来表述这个问题：我们现在似乎被没有任何整体的碎片、没有同一性的流形和没有任何意义的多重缺席所淹没持久的真实存在。我们只有<em>bricolage</em>，没有别的，我们认为我们甚至可以通过从我们周围发现的点点滴滴中组装方便、令人愉悦但短暂的身份来随机发明自己。我们拾起碎片，靠岸抵御我们的废墟。</p><p>One of the dangers we face is that with the technological expansion of images and words, everything seems to fall apart into mere appearances. We might formulate this problem in terms of the three themes of parts and wholes, identity in manifolds, and presence and absence: it seems that we now are flooded by fragments without any wholes, by manifolds bereft of identities, and by multiple absences without any enduring real presence. We have <em>bricolage</em> and nothing else, and we think we can even invent ourselves at random by assembling convenient and pleasing but transient identities out of the bits and pieces we find around us. We pick up fragments to shore against our ruin.</p>

  <p>与这种对表象的后现代理解相反，现象学以其经典形式坚持认为，只有在适当的整体背景下才能理解部分，表象的多样性蕴藏着同一性，缺席没有任何意义，除非与出现的存在相抵触。可以通过他们来实现。现象学坚持认为，同一性和可理解性在事物中是可用的，我们自己被定义为被赋予这种身份和可理解性的人。我们可以证明事物的本来面目；当我们这样做时，我们发现了物体，但我们也发现了自己，恰恰是作为披露的与格，作为事物出现的对象。我们不仅可以思考经验中给予我们的事物；我们也可以将自己理解为在思考他们。<em>现象学是理性在可理解对象存在时的自我发现</em>。本书中的分析旨在向读者阐明让事物出现并成为其出现的与格对我们意味着什么。许多哲学家声称，我们必须学会在没有“真理”和“理性”的情况下生活，但本书试图表明，如果我们要成为人，我们能够而且必须行使责任和诚实。</p><p>In contrast with this postmodern understanding of appearance, phenomenology, in its classical form, insists that parts are only understood against the background of appropriate wholes, that manifolds of appearance harbor identities, and that absences make no sense except as played off against the presences that can be achieved through them. Phenomenology insists that identity and intelligibility are available in things, and that we ourselves are defined as the ones to whom such identities and intelligibilities are given. We can evidence the way things are; when we do so, we discover objects, but we also discover ourselves, precisely as datives of disclosure, as those to whom things appear. Not only can we think the things given to us in experience; we can also understand ourselves as thinking them. Phenomenology is precisely this sort of understanding: <em>phenomenology is reason's self-discovery in the presence of intelligible objects</em>. The analyses in this book are presented to the reader as a clarification of what it means for us to let things appear and to be the datives for their appearance. Many philosophers have claimed that we must learn to live without "truth" and "rationality," but this book tries to show that we can and must exercise responsibility and truthfulness if we are to be human.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/introduction.xhtml.heading_id_5"><a id="OEBPS/Text/introduction.xhtml.i_ob"></a>本书大纲</h2><h2><a></a>OUTLINE OF THE BOOK</h2>

  <p>我对现象学的介绍一般使用胡塞尔制定的术语，这已成为运动的标准。在第一章中，我讨论了意向性这一现象学的核心问题，并解释了为什么它是我们当前哲学和文化状况中的一个重要话题。第 2 章发展了现象学提供的那种分析的简单例子，让读者感受它的思想风格。第 3 章考察了现象学的三个主要主题：部分与整体、流形中的同一性以及存在与不存在。这三种形式结构遍及现象学，如果我们警惕它们的存在，许多问题的要点就更容易把握。我还声称虽然部分和整体的主题以及流形中的同一性（多中的一个）在几乎所有哲学流派中都可以找到，</p><p>My introduction to phenomenology generally uses the terminology formulated by Husserl, which has become standard in the movement. In chapter 1, I discuss intentionality, the central issue in phenomenology, and explain why it is an important topic in our current philosophical and cultural situation. Chapter 2 develops a simple example of the kind of analysis phenomenology provides, to give the reader a feeling for its style of thought. Chapter 3 examines three major themes in phenomenology: parts and wholes, identity in manifolds, and presence and absence. These three formal structures pervade phenomenology, and if we are alert to their presence, the point of many issues can more easily be grasped. I would also claim that while the themes of parts and wholes and identity in manifolds (one in many) are found in almost all philosophical schools, the explicit and sustained study of presence and absence is original in phenomenology.</p>

  <p>在本书的这一点上，在我们介绍了一些现象学分析之后，就有可能退后一步，解释现象学作为一种哲学是什么，并展示它的思维方式与前哲学经验的思维方式有何不同。现象学的这个初步定义在第四章给出，其中“现象学的态度”与“自然的态度”区别开来。</p><p>At this point in the book, after we have presented a number of phenomenological analyses, it becomes possible to step back and explain what phenomenology is as a philosophy and to show how its form of thinking differs from that of prephilosophical experience. This initial definition of phenomenology is given in Chapter 4, where "the phenomenological attitude" is distinguished from "the natural attitude".</p>

  <p>接下来的三章对人类经验的不同领域进行了具体的现象学调查。第 5 章着眼于知觉及其两种变体，即记忆和想象。它检验了我们所谓的感知的“内部”转变；除了看到和听到的东西，我们还回忆、预期和幻想，在这样做的过程中，我们过着一种私密的、甚至是秘密的有意识的生活。第 6 章转向我们的感知、文字、图片和符号的更公开的转变。在这里，我们意识到外部事物不仅被感知而且被解释为图像或文字或其他类型的表现形式。最后，第 7 章介绍了范畴思维的主题，在这种思维中，我们不仅要感知事物，还要表达它们，不仅表现出简单的物体，而且表现出安排和事态。在范畴思维中，我们从简单对象的经验转移到可理解对象的呈现。本章还包含对意义、意义和命题的重要处理。它努力将“概念”和“思想”解释为比通常认为的更为公开。它试图表明感觉和命题不是心理的、心理的或概念的实体。正确地理解命题和意义，是讨论真理本质的一个关键问题，尤其是在现代哲学所产生的哲学氛围中。然后，第 5 章到第 7 章提供了三个经验领域的现象学描述：记忆和想象的“内部”领域，“</p><p>The next three chapters develop concrete phenomenological investigations in different areas of human experience. Chapter 5 looks at perception and its two variants, memory and imagination. It examines what we could call the "internal" transformation of our perceptions; besides seeing and hearing things, we also recollect, anticipate, and fantasize, and in doing so we live a private, even secret conscious life. Chapter 6 turns to a more public transformation of our perceptions, to words, pictures, and symbols. Here we are conscious of external things that are not merely perceived but interpreted as images or words or other kinds of representations. Finally, Chapter 7 introduces the theme of categorial thinking, in which we do not just perceive things but articulate them, manifesting not just simple objects but arrangements and states of affairs. In categorial thinking we move from the experience of simple objects to the presentation of intelligible objects. This chapter also contains an important treatment of meanings, senses, and propositions. It strives to account for "concepts" and "thoughts" as being more public than they are often taken to be. It tries to show that senses and propositions are not psychological, mental, or conceptual entities. To understand propositions and senses in the right way is a crucial matter in discussing the nature of truth, especially in the philosophical climate generated by modern philosophy. Chapters 5 through 7, then, offer phenomenological descriptions of three domains of experience: the "internal" field of memory and imagination, the "external" field of perceived objects, words, pictures, and symbols, and the "intellectual" field of categorial objects.</p>

  <p>第 8 章将自我或自我作为在前面描述的所有意向性中建立的身份进行检查。自我被描述为真理的负责任代理人。它在记忆和预期以及主体间经验中被识别出来，并且它执行认知行为，通过这些认知行为来呈现事态和群体等更高的智力对象。自我是对自己提出的主张负责的人。在第 9 章中，自我问题逻辑上引出了时间和内在时间意识的主题，这是自我同一性的基础。时间性是感知、记忆和预期以及生活在其中的自我的条件。最后，第 10 章考察了自我居住的世界，即“生活世界”，在其中我们立即体验到我们周围的事物。这个世界是现代自然科学的基础。科学不是为我们生活的世界提供替代方案，而是从中产生并且必须融入其中。本章还非常简要地讨论了主体间性的主题。</p><p>Chapter 8 examines the self or the ego as the identity established within all the intentionalities previously described. The self is described as the responsible agent of truth. It is identified within memories and anticipations as well as intersubjective experience, and it carries out the cognitive acts by which higher, intellectual objects such as states of affairs and groups are presented. The self is the one who takes responsibility for the claims that it makes. The issue of the self leads logically, in Chapter 9, to the topic of time and internal time consciousness, which underlies the identity of the self. Temporality is the condition for perceptions, memories, and anticipations and for the self that lives in them. Finally, Chapter 10 examines the world inhabited by the self, the "life world," within which we immediately experience the things around us. This world is the foundation upon which the modern natural sciences are based. The sciences do not provide an alternative to the world in which we live, but arise from and must be integrated within it. This chapter also discusses, very briefly, the theme of intersubjectivity.</p>

  <p>第 11 章转向我们可以称之为理性现象学的东西。它不仅检查我们行使的各种意向性，而且特别检查导致事物真相的那些意向性，那些可以称为“证据”的意向性。尤其是在本章中，我们看到了现象学如何将人类思想和人类理性视为朝着真理的方向。第 12 章讨论本质直觉，即揭示事物本质特征的意向性，事物不能没有的特征。本质证据不仅触及事实真相，而且触及本质真相。本章是理性现象学的进一步发展。</p><p>Chapter 11 turns to what we could call the phenomenology of reason. It examines not just the various intentionalities that we exercise, but specifically those that lead to the truth of things, those that could be called "evidences". It is especially in this chapter that we see how phenomenology considers the human mind and human reason as ordered toward truth. Chapter 12 discusses eidetic intuition, the kind of intentionality that discloses essential features of things, features that things could not be without. Eidetic evidence reaches not just factual truth, but essential truth. This chapter is a further development of the phenomenology of reason.</p>

  <p>本书的最后两章回到了现象学是什么的问题。现象学最初在第 4 章中描述，但现在可以给出更完整的描述。第 13 章通过区分现象学反思和我所谓的命题反思（第 7 章的主题之一）来揭示哲学思维的本质。在这里，我表明哲学或现象学不仅仅是对意义的澄清，而是更深入的东西。本章研究的区别更清楚地说明了什么是哲学，什么是概念、意义和命题。</p><p>The final two chapters of the book return to the question of what phenomenology is. Phenomenology was initially described in Chapter 4, but now a more complete description can be given. Chapter 13 brings out the nature of philosophical thinking by distinguishing phenomenological reflection from what I have called propositional reflection (one of the themes in Chapter 7). Here I show that philosophy, or phenomenology, is not just a clarification of meaning, but something that cuts deeper. The distinctions studied in this chapter bring out more clearly both what philosophy is and what concepts, senses, and propositions are.</p>

  <p>最后，在第 14 章中，我试图通过将现象学与现代性和后现代性进行对比来描述现象学，并对如何将它与托马斯主义哲学区分开来做一个简短的评论。我通过将现象学置于我们当前的历史情境中来定义现象学。现代哲学有两个主要元素，政治哲学和认识论，而现象学明确地只涉及后者。然而，因为它认为人类理性是为了证据和真理，所以现象学也可以间接地解决政治理论中的现代问题。如果人类以诚实的能力为特征，那么政治和公民身份就具有独特的意义。</p><p>Finally, in Chapter 14, I try to describe phenomenology by contrasting it with modernity and postmodernity, and I add a brief remark on how it can be distinguished from Thomistic philosophy. I define phenomenology by locating it within our present historical situation. Modern philosophy has two major elements, political philosophy and epistemology, and phenomenology explicitly addresses only the latter. However, because it considers human reason as ordered toward evidence and truth, phenomenology can also address in an indirect way modern issues in political theory. If human beings are specified by the ability to be truthful, then politics and citizenship take on a distinctive sense.</p>

  <p>在考虑理性作为目的论面向真理时，现象学类似于托马斯主义哲学，它代表了对存在和心灵的前现代理解，但它与托马斯主义的不同之处在于它不从圣经启示中接近哲学。现象学和托马斯主义都是现代计划的替代品，但方式不同，将它们相互对比进一步阐明了现象学是一种哲学形式。</p><p>In considering reason as teleologically geared toward truth, phenomenology resembles Thomistic philosophy, which represents a premodern understanding of being and the mind, but it differs from Thomism in that it does not approach philosophy from within biblical revelation. Both phenomenology and Thomism are alternatives to the modern project, but in different ways, and contrasting them with one another further clarifies phenomenology as a form of philosophy.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>本书向读者介绍了 20 世纪哲学重大发展之一的术语和思想。这种发展，现象学，不仅仅属于过去。它可以帮助我们努力提醒自己，在新世纪和新千年的开始，我们永远不会完全忘记的事情。这本书开始于数学和哲学之间的对话。愿它帮助我们培养在这两次人类冒险中表达的理性生活。</p><p>This book introduces the reader to the terminology and the ideas of one of the major twentieth-century developments in philosophy. This development, phenomenology, does not belong only to the past. It can help us as we strive to remind ourselves, at the start of a new century and a new millennium, of things we can never entirely forget. The book began in a conversation between mathematics and philosophy; may it help us cultivate the life of reason expressed in both these human adventures.</p>

  什么是意向性，为什么它很重要？</h1><h1><span class="small">1</span><br><br>
  What Is Intentionality, and Why Is It Important?</h1>

  <p>与现象学最密切相关的术语是“意向性”。现象学的核心学说是这样的教导，即我们执行的每一个意识行为，我们拥有的每一个体验，都是有意的：它本质上是对某事或其他事物的“意识”或“体验”。我们所有的意识都指向对象。如果我在看，我会看到一些视觉对象，比如一棵树或一个湖；如果我想象，我的想象呈现出一个想象的物体，比如我想象的一辆汽车从路上驶来；如果我参与回忆，我记得一个过去的对象；如果我从事判断，我指的是事态或事实。每一个意识行为，每一个经验，都与一个对象相关联。每一个意向都有它意向的对象。</p><p>The term most closely associated with phenomenology is "intentionality". The core doctrine in phenomenology is the teaching that every act of consciousness we perform, every experience that we have, is intentional: it is essentially "consciousness of" or an "experience of" something or other. All our awareness is directed toward objects. If I see, I see some visual object, such as a tree or a lake; if I imagine, my imagining presents an imaginary object, such as a car that I visualize coming down a road; if I am involved in remembering, I remember a past object; if I am engaged in judging, I intend a state of affairs or a fact. Every act of consciousness, every experience, is correlated with an object. Every intending has its intended object.</p>

  <p>我们应该注意，这种“意图”或“意图”的意义不应与我们在行动时所想到的“意图”相混淆（“他买了一些木头，打算盖一个棚子”；“她打算一年后完成法学院学习”）。意向性的现象学概念主要适用于知识理论，而不适用于人类行为理论。这个词的现象学用法有些尴尬，因为它违背了通常的用法，后者倾向于在实际意义上使用“意图”；现象学的使用几乎总是会唤起实用意图的感觉作为泛音。然而，“意向性”及其同源词已成为现象学的专业术语，在讨论这一哲学传统时，无法回避它们。我们必须做出调整，将这个词理解为主要是指心理或认知上的意图，而不是实际的意图。在现象学中，“意图”是指我们与对象之间的有意识的关系。</p><p>We should note that this sense of "intend" or "intention" should not be confused with "intention" as the purpose we have in mind when we act ("He bought some wood with the intention of building a shed"; "She intended to finish law school a year later"). The phenomenological notion of intentionality applies primarily to the theory of knowledge, not to the theory of human action. The phenomenological use of the word is somewhat awkward because it goes against ordinary usage, which tends to use "intention" in the practical sense; the phenomenological use will almost always call up the sense of practical intending as an overtone. However, "intentionality" and its cognates have become technical terms in phenomenology, and there is no way of avoiding them in a discussion of this philosophical tradition. We have to make the adjustment and understand the word to mean primarily mental or cognitive, and not practical, intentions. In phenomenology, "intending" means the conscious relationship we have to an object.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_1.xhtml.heading_id_3"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_1.xhtml.ch1_ep"></a>自我中心的困境</h2><h2><a></a>THE EGOCENTRIC PREDICAMENT</h2>

  <p>那么，意向性学说指出，每一个意识行为都指向某种对象。意识本质上是“对”某事或其他事物的意识。现在，当我们看到这个教义时，当我们被告知这个学说是现象学的核心时，我们很可能会感到失望。这个想法有什么重要的？为什么现象学要对意向性如此大做文章？意识是对某物的意识，体验是对某种对象的体验，这对每个人来说不是很明显吗？这种鸡毛蒜皮的事还需要说吗？</p><p>The doctrine of intentionality, then, states that every act of consciousness is directed toward an object of some kind. Consciousness is essentially consciousness "of" something or other. Now, when we are presented with this teaching, and when we are told that this doctrine is at the core of phenomenology, we might well react with a feeling of disappointment. What is so important about this idea? Why should phenomenology make such a fuss about intentionality? Isn't it completely obvious to everyone that consciousness is consciousness of something, that experience is experience of an object of some sort? Do such trivialities need to be stated?</p>

  <p>它们确实需要被断言，因为在过去三四百年的哲学中，人类意识和经验已经以一种非常不同的方式被理解。在主导我们文化的笛卡尔、霍布斯和洛克的传统中，我们被告知，当我们有意识时，我们主要是意识到我们自己或我们自己的想法。意识就像一个泡沫或一个封闭的柜子；思想来自一个盒子。印象和概念发生在这个封闭的空间中，发生在这个想法和经验的圈子里，我们的意识是针对它们的，而不是直接针对“外部”的事物。我们可以通过推论来尝试走出去：我们可以推断我们的想法一定是由我们之外的事物引起的，并且我们可以构建这些事物必须是什么样子的假设或模型，但我们与他们没有任何直接联系。我们只能通过根据我们的心理印象进行推理来了解事物，而不是通过将它们呈现给我们。首先，我们的意识根本不属于任何事物。相反，我们陷入了所谓的“以自我为中心的困境”；一开始我们真正能确定的就是我们自己的意识存在和意识状态。</p><p>They do need to be asserted, because in the philosophy of the past three or four hundred years, human consciousness and experience have come to be understood in a very different way. In the Cartesian, Hobbesian, and Lockean traditions, which dominate our culture, we are told that when we are conscious, we are primarily aware of ourselves or our own ideas. Consciousness is taken to be like a bubble or an enclosed cabinet; the mind comes in a box. Impressions and concepts occur in this enclosed space, in this circle of ideas and experiences, and our awareness is directed toward them, not directly toward the things "outside". We can try to get outside by making inferences: we may reason that our ideas must have been caused by something outside us, and we may construct hypotheses or models of what those things must be like, but we are not in any direct contact with them. We get to things only by reasoning from our mental impressions, not by having them presented to us. Our consciousness, first and foremost, is not "of" anything at all. Rather, we are caught in what has been called an "egocentric predicament"; all we can really be sure of at the start is our own conscious existence and the states of that consciousness.</p>

  <p>我们对大脑和神经系统的了解加强了对人类意识的这种理解。似乎毫无疑问的是，一切认知都必须发生在“大脑内部”，而我们可能直接接触到的只是我们自己的大脑状态。我曾经听一位著名的脑科学家在一次演讲中几乎含泪地说，经过这么多年的大脑研究，他仍然无法解释“我们头骨中的鳄梨色器官”如何超越自身并伸入大脑世界。我还敢说，几乎所有上过大学并修过生理学、神经学或心理学课程的人都会遇到同样的困难。</p><p>This understanding of human awareness is reinforced by what we know about the brain and nervous system. It seems unquestionable that everything cognitional must happen "inside the head," and that all we could possibly be in touch with directly are our own brain states. I once heard a famous brain scientist say in a lecture, almost tearfully, that after so many years of studying the brain, he still could not explain how "that avocado-colored organ inside our skulls" could get beyond itself and reach out into the world. I would also venture to say that almost everyone who has gone to college and taken some courses in physiology, neurology, or psychology would have the same difficulty.</p>

  <p>这些对意识的哲学和科学理解在我们的文化中已经非常普遍，它们迫使我们陷入以自我为中心的困境，这让我们感到非常不安。我们本能地知道我们并没有陷入自己的主观性，我们确信我们确实超越了我们的大脑和内部心理状态，但我们不知道如何证明这种信念是正确的。我们不知道如何表明我们与“真实世界”的接触不是幻觉，而不仅仅是主观投射。在大多数情况下，我们不知道我们是如何走出自我的，我们可能只是通过忽略它来处理这个问题，并希望没有人会问我们这件事。当我们试图思考人类意识时，我们的前提是我们完全处于“内部”，</p><p>These philosophical and scientific understandings of consciousness have become quite widespread in our culture, and the egocentric predicament they force us into causes us great unease. We know instinctively that we are not trapped in our own subjectivity, we are sure that we do go beyond our brains and our internal mental states, but we do not know how to justify this conviction. We do not know how to show that our contact with the "real world" is not an illusion, not a mere subjective projection. For the most part we have no idea how we ever get outside ourselves, and we probably treat this issue simply by ignoring it and hoping that no one will ask us about it. When we try to think about human consciousness, we start with the premise that we are entirely "inside," and we are greatly perplexed as to how we could ever get "outside".</p>

  <p>如果我们失去了意向性，如果我们没有一个共同的世界，那么我们就不会进入理性、证据和真理的生活。我们每个人都转向自己的私人世界，在实际秩序中我们做自己的事：真相不会对我们提出任何要求。同样，我们知道这种相对主义不可能是最终的故事。我们确实会就应该做什么以及事实是什么争论不休，但从哲学和文化上来说，我们发现很难认可我们天真地接受一个共同的世界以及我们发现和交流它是什么的能力。对意向性的否认与对心灵对真理的取向的否认相关联。</p><p>If we are bereft of intentionality, if we do not have a world in common, then we do not enter into a life of reason, evidence, and truth. Each of us turns to his own private world, and in the practical order we do our own thing: the truth does not make any demands on us. Again, we know that this relativism cannot be the final story. We do argue with one another about what ought to be done and about what the facts are, but philosophically and culturally we find it difficult to ratify our naive acceptance of a common world and our ability to discover and communicate what it is. The denial of intentionality has as its correlate the denial of the mind's orientation toward truth.</p>

  <p><em>在塞缪尔贝克特的小说墨菲</em>中可以找到对自我中心困境的丰富多彩的表达<em></em>. 在本书的三分之一处，在第 6 章中，贝克特打断了他的叙述，开始“对‘墨菲的思想’这一表达方式进行辩护”。” 他说他不会试图描述“这个装置的真实面目”，而只会描述“它的感觉和想象中的样子”。他呈现的形象是我们发现非常普遍的形象：“墨菲的思想将自己描绘成一个巨大的空心球体，与外面的宇宙密不可分”。在这里，思想和它的“内心世界”，在那里是外部的“外部世界”，每一个都与另一个隔离开来。然而，思想并没有因为如此局限而变得贫乏；相反，外部宇宙中的一切都可以在内部表示，根据贝克特的说法，这些表示是“</p><p>A colorful expression of the egocentric predicament can be found in Samuel Beckett's novel <em>Murphy</em>. About a third of the way through the book, in chapter 6, Beckett interrupts his narrative to undertake "a justification of the expression, 'Murphy's mind.' " He says he will not try to describe "this apparatus as it really was," but only "what it felt and pictured itself to be". The image he presents is the one we have found to be all too common: "Murphy's mind pictured itself as a large hollow sphere, hermetically closed to the universe without". Here the mind, with its "intramental world," there the outside, the "extramental world," each sequestered from the other. However, the mind is not impoverished by being so confined; rather, everything in the outside universe can be represented in the inside, and the representations are, according to Beckett, either "virtual, or actual, or virtual rising into actual, or actual falling into virtual". These parts of the mind are differentiated from one another: "the mind felt its actual part to be above and bright, its virtual beneath and fading into dark".</p>

  <p>头脑不仅与宇宙或现实世界相对立；它也被放置在墨菲的另一部分身体上：“因此墨菲觉得自己被分成两部分，一个身体和一个思想”。不知何故，身与心相互作用：“他们显然有过往来，否则他不可能知道他们有什么共同之处。但他觉得他的心紧绷着，不知道通过什么渠道进行往来也不知道这两种经历是如何重叠的”。思想与身体的隔离意味着思想与世界的隔离：“他分裂了，他的一部分从未离开过这个将自己描绘成一个充满光明的球体的精神室逐渐消失在黑暗中，因为没有办法出去”。身体如何影响思想，或思想如何影响身体，</p><p>The mind is not only placed over against the universe or the real world; it is also placed over against the body that is Murphy's other part: "Thus Murphy felt himself split in two, a body and a mind". Somehow or other, the body and the mind interact: "They had intercourse, apparently, otherwise he could not have known that they had anything in common. But he felt his mind to be bodytight and did not understand through what channel the intercourse was effected nor how the two experiences came to overlap". The isolation of the mind from the body entails an isolation of the mind from the world: "He was split, one part of him never left this mental chamber that pictured itself as a sphere full of light fading into dark, because there was no way out". How the body could influence the mind, or the mind the body, remained an utter mystery to Murphy: "The development of what looked like collusion between such utter strangers remained to Murphy as unintelligible as telekinesis or the Leyden Jar, and of as little interest".*</p>

  <p>贝克特所描述的笛卡尔式困境，将思想视为这个巨大的空心球体，充满光明但又逐渐陷入黑暗，与身体和世界隔绝，这是哲学在我们这个时代所处的不幸境遇。哲学必须从文化情境、人类的自我理解开始。我们中的许多人不知道如何避免像贝克特笔下的墨菲那样理解自己的思想。这种认识论的困境是意向性学说的目标。</p><p>The Cartesian predicament that Beckett describes, with the mind taken as this large, hollow sphere, light-filled but shading off into darkness, closed off from both the body and the world, is the unfortunate situation in which philosophy finds itself in our time. It is the cultural situation, the human self-understanding, within which philosophy must begin. Many of us do not know how to avoid understanding our own minds the way Beckett's Murphy understands his. This epistemological dilemma is the target of the doctrine of intentionality.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_1.xhtml.heading_id_4"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_1.xhtml.ch1_pm"></a>思想的公开</h2><h2><a></a>THE PUBLICNESS OF MIND</h2>

  <p>因此，将意向性置于首位并使其成为哲学反思的中心一点也不多余。说意识是“对”对象的“意识”并不是微不足道的。相反，这种说法违背了许多共同的信念。现象学最伟大的贡献之一就是打破了以自我为中心的困境，将死了笛卡尔学说。现象学表明，思想是一种公共事物，它在公开场合行动和表现自己，而不仅仅是在自己的范围内。一切都在外面。“心内世界”和“心外世界”的概念本身就是不连贯的；它们是埃兹拉庞德所说的“思想凝块”的例子。思想和世界是相互关联的。事情确实出现在我们面前，事物真正地被揭示了，而我们，就我们而言，确实向我们自己和他人展示了事物的本来面目。考虑到现象学产生和我们继续生活的文化背景，关注意向性并非没有重要的哲学价值。通过讨论意向性，现象学帮助我们重新获得公众的思考、推理和感知意识。它帮助我们重新假设我们作为真理代理人的人类状况。</p><p>It is not at all otiose, therefore, to bring intentionality to the fore and to make it the center of philosophical reflection. It is not trivial to say that consciousness is "consciousness of" objects; on the contrary, this statement goes against many common beliefs. One of phenomenology's greatest contributions is to have broken out of the egocentric predicament, to have checkmated the Cartesian doctrine. Phenomenology shows that the mind is a public thing, that it acts and manifests itself out in the open, not just inside its own confines. Everything is outside. The very notions of an "intramental world" and an "extramental world" are incoherent; they are examples of what Ezra Pound called "idea-clots". The mind and the world are correlated with one another. Things do appear to us, things truly are disclosed, and we, on our part, do display, both to ourselves and to others, the way things are. Given the cultural setting in which phenomenology arose and in which we continue to live, a focus on intentionality is not without great philosophical value. By discussing intentionality, phenomenology helps us reclaim a public sense of thinking, reasoning, and perception. It helps us reassume our human condition as agents of truth.</p>

  <p>除了将我们的注意力吸引到意识的意向性之外，现象学还发现并描述了意向性中的许多不同结构。当心灵以笛卡尔或洛克的方式被理解为一个封闭的球体及其思想圈时，“意识”一词通常被认为是单义的。意识内部没有结构差异；只有觉知，纯粹而简单。我们注意到在我们身上出现的任何印象，然后我们将它们整理成判断或命题，试图宣布“外面”有什么。但对于现象学来说，意向性是高度分化的。有不同种类的意图，对应不同种类的对象。例如，当我们看到一个普通的物体时，我们会产生感性的意图，但是当我们看到一张照片或一幅画时，我们必须以图画的方式去意图。我们必须改变我们的意图；把某物当成一幅画不同于把某物当成一个简单的物体。图片与图片意图相关，感知对象与感知意图相关。当我们把某物当作一个词时，还有另一种意图在起作用，当我们记住某物时，另一种意图在起作用，当我们做出判断或将事物归为一组时，另一种意图在起作用。这些和许多其他类型的意图需要被描述和区分。此外，意向的形式可以相互交织：将某物视为图片涉及，作为基础，我们也将其作为感知事物。图像意识层叠在感性之上，</p><p>Besides drawing our attention to the intentionality of consciousness, phenomenology also discovers and describes many different structures in intentionality. When the mind is taken in the Cartesian or Lockean way, as an enclosed sphere with its circle of ideas, the term "consciousness" is usually considered to be simply univocal. There are no structural differences within consciousness; there is just awareness, pure and simple. We notice whatever impressions arise in us, and we then arrange them into judgments or propositions that take a stab at declaring what is "out there". But for phenomenology, intentionality is highly differentiated. There are different kinds of intending, correlated with different kinds of objects. For example, we carry out perceptual intentions when we see an ordinary material object, but we must intend pictorially when we see a photograph or a painting. We must change our intentionality; taking something as a picture is different from taking something as a simple object. Pictures are correlated with pictorial intending, perceptual objects are correlated with perceptual intending. Still another kind of intending is at work when we take something to be a word, another when we remember something, and others again when we make judgments or collect things into groups. These and many other kinds of intending need to be described and differentiated one from the other. Furthermore, the forms of intending can be interwoven: to see something as a picture involves, as a foundation, that we also have it as a perceived thing. The pictorial consciousness is layered upon the perceptual, just as the picture we see is layered on a fabric or a piece of paper that could also be looked at simply as a colored thing.</p>

  <p>还可以区分其他意向性，例如我们回想过去时出现的意向性。比方说，当考古学家找到罐子、灰烬和衣服碎片，并开始谈论 700 年前生活在某个特定地点的人时，他们在行使什么样的意向？这些物件，这些罐子和灰烬，是如何将人呈现在我们面前的？我们必须如何“接受”他们，以便他们以那种方式服务？什么样的意图与发现和解释化石相关？当我们谈论质子、中子和夸克时，什么样的意图在起作用？它们不是我们看到图片或旗帜时起作用的那种，也不是我们看到植物或动物时起作用的那种；与粒子物理学相关的一些困境的产生是因为我们假设我们以与台球相同的方式来研究亚原子实体。整理和区分所有这些意向性，以及与它们相关的特定种类的对象，是一种叫做现象学的哲学所做的。像这样的描述帮助我们理解人类知识的所有形式，它们也帮助我们理解我们可以通过多种方式与我们生活的世界联系起来。</p><p>Still other intentionalities can be distinguished, such as the kinds that occur when we think about the past. What sort of intending is exercised when, say, archaeologists find pots and ashes and scraps of cl?thing and begin to speak about people who lived in a given site seven hundred years ago? How do these objects, these pots and ashes, present human beings to us? How must we "take" them, so that they will serve in that way? What sort of intentions are correlated with finding and interpreting something as a fossil? What sort of intentions are at work when we speak about protons, neutrons, and quarks? They are not the kind that are at work when we see pictures or flags, nor the kind at work when we see something as a plant or an animal; some of the dilemmas associated with particle physics arise because we assume that we intend subatomic entities in the same way that we intend billiard balls. Sorting out and differentiating all these intentionalities, as well as the specific kinds of objects correlated with them, is what is done by the kind of philosophy called phenomenology. Descriptions like these help us to understand human knowing in all its forms, and they also help us understand the many ways in which we can be related to the world in which we live.</p>

  <p>“现象学”一词是希腊语<em>phainomenon</em>和<em>logos</em>的复合词。<em>它表示对各种现象</em>进行说明、给出逻各斯的活动<em></em>，事物出现的各种方式。例如，我们所说的现象是指图片而不是简单的对象，记住的事件而不是预期的事件，想象的对象而不是感知的，数学对象如三角形和集合而不是生物，单词而不是化石，其他人与非人类动物相对，政治现实与经济相对。当我们意识到意识是“对”某物的意识，而不是将它锁在自己的柜子里时，所有这些现象都可以被探索。与笛卡尔、霍布斯和洛克的知识哲学的狭隘限制相反，现象学是解放的。它让我们走出家门，恢复因将我们锁定在以自我为中心的困境中的哲学而迷失的世界。</p><p>The term "phenomenology" is a compound of the Greek words <em>phainomenon</em> and <em>logos</em>. It signifies the activity of giving an account, giving a logos, of various <em>phenomena</em>, of the various ways in which things can appear. By phenomena we mean, for example, pictures as opposed to simple objects, remembered events as opposed to anticipated ones, imagined objects as opposed to perceived, mathematical objects such as triangles and sets as opposed to living things, words as opposed to fossils, other people as opposed to nonhuman animals, political reality as opposed to the economic. All such phenomena can be explored when we realize that consciousness is consciousness "of" something, that it is not locked within its own cabinet. In contrast with the cramped confinement of the Cartesian, Hobbesian, and Lockean philosophy of knowledge, phenomenology is liberating. It gets us out of doors and restores the world that was lost by the philosophies that locked us into our egocentric predicament.</p>

  <p>现象学承认现象的真实性和真实性，即出现的事物。情况并非如此，正如笛卡尔传统让我们相信的那样，“成为一幅画”或“成为一个被感知的对象”或“成为一个符号”只是在头脑中。它们是事物存在的方式。事物出现的方式是事物存在的一部分；事物如其所是，又如其所见。事物不只是存在；他们也表现出他们本来的样子。动物有不同于植物的显现方式，因为动物与植物的存在方式不同。图片的出现方式不同于记忆中的对象，因为它们的存在方式不同。画布或木板上有一幅画；敬礼在被移动的手臂中，在敬礼的人和被敬礼的人之间。事实是事实的成分所在：草是湿的事实存在于湿草中，而不是当我说出这些话时在我的脑海中。我的思想在行动中是向我自己和其他人呈现草是湿的。当我们做出判断时，我们会清楚地表达世界的各个部分；我们不只是在脑海中整理想法或概念。</p><p>Phenomenology recognizes the reality and truth of phenomena, the things that appear. It is not the case, as the Cartesian tradition would have us believe, that "being a picture" or "being a perceived object" or "being a symbol" is only in the mind. They are ways in which things can be. The way things appear is part of the being of things; things appear as they are, and they are as they appear. Things do not just exist; they also manifest themselves as what they are. Animals have a way of appearing that is different from that of plants, because animals are different from plants in their being. Pictures have a way of appearing that is different from that of remembered objects, because their way of being is different. A picture is out there on the canvas or the wood panel; a salute is in the arm being moved, out there between the person saluting and the person saluted. A fact is where the ingredients of the fact are located: the fact that the grass is wet exists in the wet grass, not in my mind when I say the words. My mind in action is the presenting, to myself and to others, of the grass as being wet. When we make judgments we articulate the presentation of parts of the world; we do not just arrange ideas or concepts in our minds.</p>

  <p>有人可能会反驳说：“那幻觉和错误呢？有时候事情并不像看起来那样。我可能以为我看到了一个人，但结果只是一棵灌木；我可能认为我看到了一把匕首，但什么也没有。 ……很明显，那个人和那把匕首，只在我的脑海里，这不就说明一切都在脑海里吗？” 一点也不; 重点很简单，事物可以看起来像其他事物，有时我们似乎在感知，但实际上并没有。几年前的一个冬天的晚上，我开车去我的车库，看到车道上有一些“玻璃碎片”。我猜想一定是有人在那里砸碎了一个瓶子。我把车停在附近的马路上，打算第二天早上回来打扫车道。第二天回来时，发现只有一些水坑和小冰块；我“看到”的玻璃实际上只是冰。在这次经历中，我最初的设想和后来的修正都没有在我的脑海中形成；我并不是只是将我的印象和概念混在一起，或者我编造了一个新的假设来解释我的想法。相反，我以不同的方式与世界相关，而这些关系是基于冰在某些情况下看起来像玻璃的事实。一切，包括“玻璃”和冰块，都是公开的。错误是公开的，隐瞒和伪装也是公开的；所有这些都是一种事物被当作另一种事物的现象。错误、隐瞒和伪装以它们自己的方式是真实的；它们是存在的可能性，它们需要自己的分析。甚至幻觉也有自己的真实性。当它们发生时会发生什么，我们认为我们正在感知，而我们实际上是在想象，而这种紊乱只能寄生在真实的感知和想象上。为了能够产生幻觉，我们必须进入意图或瞄准事物的游戏。如果我们不知道感知和做梦之间的区别，我们就不会产生幻觉。</p><p>Someone might object, "What about hallucinations and mistakes? Sometimes things are not as they seem. I may think I see a man, but it turns out that it is only a bush; I may think I see a dagger, but nothing is there. Obviously, the man and the dagger are only in my mind; does not this show that everything is in the mind?" Not at all; the point is simply that things can look like other things, and sometimes we may seem to be perceiving when we really are not. One evening several years ago, in the wintertime, I drove toward my garage and saw some "pieces of glass" on the driveway. I assumed that someone must have smashed a bottle there. I parked my car nearby on the road, intending to come back the next morning to clean the driveway. When I returned the next day, I found only some puddles of water and small pieces of ice; what I had "seen" as glass was in fact only ice. In this experience, my original vision and my later correction were not worked out within the cabinet of my mind; it was not the case that I merely shuffled my impressions ard concepts, or that I made up a new hypothesis to explain the ideas that I had. Rather, I was related to the world in different ways, and these relationships were based on the fact that ice can look like glass under some circumstances. Everything, including the "glass" and the ice, is public. Mistakes are something public, and so are concealment and camouflage; all these are kinds of phenomena in which one thing is taken for another. Mistakes, concealment, and camouflage are real in their own way; they are possibilities of being, and they call for their own analysis. Even hallucinations have a kind of reality all their own. What happens when they occur is that we think we are perceiving when we really are imagining, and this disorder can take place only as parasitic on real perceptions and imaginations. In order to be able to hallucinate, we must have entered into the game of intending or targeting things. We could not hallucinate if we were not aware of the difference between perceiving and dreaming.</p>

  <p>现象学通过其意识的意向性学说所做的是克服笛卡尔和洛克对心灵公共性的偏见，这也是对事物表象的真实性的偏见。对于现象学来说，没有“纯粹”的表象，也没有什么“仅仅是”表象。外表是真实的；他们属于存在。事情确实出现了。现象学使我们能够认识并恢复当我们被哲学困惑锁在自己的内部世界时似乎已经丢失的世界。曾经被宣布为仅仅是心理上的事物现在被发现是本体论的，是事物存在的一部分。图片、文字、符号、感知对象、事态、其他思想、法律和社会习俗都被认为是真实存在的，</p><p>What phenomenology does through its doctrine of the intentionality of consciousness is to overcome the Cartesian and Lockean bias against the publicness of mind, which is also a bias against the reality of the appearance of things. For phenomenology, there are no "mere" appearances, and nothing is "just" an appearance. Appearances are real; they belong to being. Things do show up. Phenomenology allows us to recognize and to restore the world that seemed to have been lost when we were locked into our own internal world by philosophical confusions. Things that had been declared to be merely psychological are now found to be ontological, part of the being of things. Pictures, words, symbols, perceived objects, states of affairs, other minds, laws, and social conventions are all acknowledged as truly there, as sharing in being and as capable of appearing according to their own proper style.</p>

  <p>但现象学所做的不仅仅是恢复丢失的东西。它的那部分工作有些消极和有争议，取决于其自身价值的错误。除了这种反驳工作之外，现象学还为那些希望享受哲学的人提供了哲学的乐趣。在事物表现自己的方式以及我们说实话的能力和让事情出现的能力方面，有很多值得思考的地方。呈现和缺席巧妙地交织在一起，现象学帮助我们思考它们。它不仅消除了怀疑的障碍；它还提供了理解差异、同一性和形式的可能性，就像哲学家们对它们的经典理解一样。它是沉思的和理论的。它证实哲学生活是人类的最高成就。现象学不仅可以治愈我们的智力困境，它还可以治愈我们的智力障碍。它还为那些希望实践它的人打开了哲学探索的大门。</p><p>But phenomenology does more than restore what was lost. That part of its work is somewhat negative and contentious, dependent on an error for its own value. In addition to this refutational work, phenomenology offers the pleasure of philosophy for those who wish to enjoy it. There is much to think about in the way things manifest themselves and in our ability to be truthful, our ability to let things appear. Presentations and absences are exquisitely interwoven, and phenomenology helps us to think about them. It does not just remove skeptical impediments; it also affords the possibility of understanding differences, identities, and forms as philosophers have classically understood them. It is contemplative and theoretic. It validates the philosophical life as a culminating human achievement. Phenomenology does not only remedy our intellectual distress; it also opens the door to philosophical exploration for those who wish to practice it.</p>

  将立方体视为意识体验的范例</h1><h1><span class="small">2</span><br><br>
  Perception of a Cube as a Paradigm of Conscious Experience</h1>

  <p>我们将使用一个简单的例子来说明现象学为我们提供的那种对意识的描述性分析。这个例子会让我们了解现象学提供的哲学解释类型。它将作为我们稍后将进行的更复杂分析的模型。</p><p>We will use a simple example to illustrate the kind of descriptive analysis of consciousness that phenomenology offers us. This example will give us an idea of the type of philosophical explanation that phenomenology provides. It will serve as a model for the more complicated analyses that we will undertake later.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_2.xhtml.heading_id_3"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_2.xhtml.ch2_sap"></a>侧面、方面和轮廓</h2><h2><a></a>SIDES, ASPECTS, AND PROFILES</h2>

  <p>考虑一下我们感知物质对象（例如立方体）的方式。我从一个角度，从一个角度看立方体。我无法同时从所有侧面看到立方体。对于立方体的体验来说，重要的是感知是局部的，在任何时刻都只能直接给出物体的一部分。然而，我并不是只体验到从我现在的观点看得见的那些面。当我看到那些侧面时，我也打算，我共同打算，隐藏的侧面。我看到的不仅仅是眼睛所看到的。目前可见的侧面被一圈可能可见但实际上不存在的侧面所包围。这些其他方面是给定的，但恰恰是不存在的。它们也是我经历的一部分。</p><p>Consider the way in which we perceive a material object, such as a cube. I see the cube from one angle, from one perspective. I cannot see the cube from all sides at once. It is essential to the experience of a cube that the perception be partial, with only one part of the object being directly given at any moment. However, it is not the case that I only experience the sides that are visible from my present viewpoint. As I see those sides, I also intend, I cointend, the sides that are hidden. I see more than what strikes the eye. The presently visible sides are surrounded by a halo of potentially visible but actually absent sides. These other sides are given, but given precisely as absent. They too are part of what I experience.</p>

  <p>让我们根据其客观和主观维度来制定此结构。客观地，当我看到一个立方体时，给我的是一个混合体，它由存在的边和不存在但共同存在的边组成。被看到的事物包含了现在和不在场的混合体。主观上，我的感知，我的观察，是由充实和空洞的意图混合而成的。因此，我的感知活动也是一种混合；它的一部分意指存在的东西，而其他部分意指不存在的东西，即立方体的“另一面”。</p><p>Let us formulate this structure in regard to its objective and its subjective dimensions. Objectively, what is given to me when I see a cube is a blend made up of sides that are present and sides that are absent but cointended. The thing being seen involves a mixture of the present and the absent. Subjectively, my perception, my viewing, is a blend made up of filled and empty intentions. My activity of perceiving, therefore, is also a mixture; parts of it intend what is present, and other parts intend what is absent, the "other sides" of the cube.</p>

  <p>当然，“每个人都知道”感知涉及这样的融合，但并不是每个人都知道它们的哲学影响或哲学范围。所有体验都涉及存在与不存在的混合，在某些情况下，将我们的注意力吸引到这种混合上可能具有哲学启发性。例如，当我们听一个说话者说出一个句子时，我们的听力包括句子的一部分的存在，两侧是已经发音的部分和将要发音的部分的缺失。句子本身，作为一个整体，在寂静、喧嚣以及它之前、之后或伴随的其他句子中脱颖而出。我们对一个句子的体验中存在与不存在的混合不同于对立方体的感知，但在这两种情况下，都混合了在场与不在场、充实与空虚的意图。其他种类的物体还会有其他种类的混合，但它们都是存在与不存在的混合体。</p><p>Of course, "everyone knows" that perception involves such blends, but not everyone knows their philosophical impact or their philosophical range. All experience involves a blend of presence and absence, and in some cases drawing our attention to this mixture can be philosophically illuminating. When we listen to a sentence being uttered by a speaker, for example, our listening involves a presence of one part of the sentence, flanked by the absence of the parts that have already been pronounced and those that are to come. The sentence itself, as a whole, stands out against the silence, the noise, and the other sentences that precede, follow, or accompany it. The blend of presence and absence in our experience of a sentence is different from that involved in the perception of a cube, but in both cases there is a blend of presence and absence, of filled and empty intendings. Other kinds of objects would have still other kinds of blends, but all of them would be mixtures of presence and absence.</p>

  <p>让我们回到立方体的体验。在给定的时刻，只有立方体的某些面出现在我面前，而其他面则不存在。但我知道我可以绕着立方体走动或转动立方体，不存在的面会进入视野，而现在的面会消失。我的看法是动态的，而不是静态的；即使我只是看着立方体的一侧，我眼睛的扫视运动也会引入一种我什至没有意识到的搜索移动性。当我转动立方体或绕着它走动时，潜在感知变成了实际感知，而实际感知消失了；它变成了已经被看到的东西，再次只是潜在地被看到的东西。在主观方面，空意变得充实，充实变得空虚。</p><p>Let us return to the experience of the cube. At a given moment, only certain sides of the cube are presented to me, and the others are absent. But I know that I can either walk around the cube or turn the cube around and the absent sides will come into view, while the present sides go out of view. My perception is dynamic, not static; even if I just look at one side of the cube, the saccadic motion of my eyes introduces a kind of searching mobility that I am not even aware of. As I turn the cube or walk around it, the potentially perceived becomes the actually perceived, and the actually perceived slips into absence; it becomes that which has been seen, that which is again only potentially seen. On the subjective side, the empty intentions become filled and the filled become empty.</p>

  <p>此外，其他感知方式也开始发挥作用。我不仅可以看到立方体，还可以触摸它，我可以轻敲它看它发出什么样的声音，我可以品尝它（对于婴儿来说，嘴巴是主要的触觉器官），我什至可以闻它看它是由什么制成的。这些都是潜在的展示，伴随着我对立方体的任何展示，可以被激活并直接呈现的潜力。所有这些都围绕着立方体，即使它只是简单地呈现在我的视野中。然而，有趣的是，只有视觉和触觉才能将物体呈现为立方体；听觉、味觉和嗅觉代表立方体的材料，而不是立方体形状的特征。</p><p>Furthermore, other modalities of perception also come into play. I can not only see the cube but also touch it, I can tap it to see what sort of noise it makes, I can taste it (for infants, the mouth is the primary tactile organ), and I can even smell it to see what it is made of. These are all potential presentations that come along with any presentation I have of the cube, potentials that can be activated and brought into direct presence. All of them surround the cube even when it is simply given to my view. It is interesting to note, however, that only vision and touch present the object as a cube; hearing, taste, and smell present the material the cube is made of, not its character of being shaped as a cube.</p>

  <p>让我们更准确地阐明立方体的视觉体验。我们可以区分呈现给我们的三个层次。(1) 首先，立方体有六个边。每个方面本身都可以在不同的视角下给出。如果我直接在我面前拿一个边，它会呈现为一个正方形，但如果我将立方体稍微向远离我的方向倾斜，这个边就会变成一个角度；它看起来更像一个梯形。较远的角落似乎比较近的角落更接近彼此。如果我将立方体倾斜得更远，侧面几乎变成一条线，最后，如果我再倾斜一点点，侧面就会从视野中消失。换句话说，一面可以用不同的方式给出，就像立方体可以用不同的面给出一样。(2) 让我们称每一种给边的方式为 aspect。一条边直接面向我们时是正方形的，但当它与我们成一定角度时，它是梯形。正如一个立方体在许多方面向我们显现一样，每一面都可以在许多方面向我们显现，而这些方面，传递性地，也是立方体的方面。但我们可以更进一步。(3) 我可以看到特定时刻的特定方面；我可以闭上眼睛一分钟，然后再睁开。如果我没有移动，我将再次拥有相同的方面。通过时间上不同的外观的多样性，可以将方面本身作为身份赋予我。让我们称这些瞬间的每一个观点为 传递地，也是立方体的方面。但我们可以更进一步。(3) 我可以看到特定时刻的特定方面；我可以闭上眼睛一分钟，然后再睁开。如果我没有移动，我将再次拥有相同的方面。通过时间上不同的外观的多样性，可以将方面本身作为身份赋予我。让我们称这些瞬间的每一个观点为 传递地，也是立方体的方面。但我们可以更进一步。(3) 我可以看到特定时刻的特定方面；我可以闭上眼睛一分钟，然后再睁开。如果我没有移动，我将再次拥有相同的方面。通过时间上不同的外观的多样性，可以将方面本身作为身份赋予我。让我们称这些瞬间的每一个观点为<em></em>方面的<em>概况；</em>传递性地，它也是侧面的轮廓和立方体的轮廓。配置文件是对象的时间个性化表示。<em>英文单词“profile”是德文Abschattung</em>的译音，可以表示“profile”或“sketch”。因此，最终，立方体以多种配置文件的形式提供给我。</p><p>Let us spell out the visual experience of the cube a bit more precisely. We can distinguish three layers in what is presented to us. (1) First, there are the sides of the cube, six of them. Each side can itself be given under different perspectives. If I hold a side directly before me, it is presented as a square, but if I tilt the cube away from me slightly, the side becomes given at an angle; it looks more like a trapezoid. The farther corners seem closer to one another than do the nearer ones. If I tilt the cube still farther, the side becomes almost like a line, and then, finally, if I tilt it just a bit more, the side vanishes from view. In other words, a side can be given in different ways, just as the cube can be given in different sides. (2) Let us call each of the ways in which the side is given an aspect. A side has the aspect of a square when it faces us directly, but it has the aspect of a trapezoid when it is turned at an angle to us. As a cube appears to us in many sides, so each side can appear to us in many aspects, and these aspects, transitively, are also aspects of the cube. But we can go one step farther. (3) I can view a particular aspect at a given moment; I can close my eyes for a minute, then open them again. If I have not moved, I will have the same aspect given to me again. The aspect itself can be given to me as an identity through a manifold of temporally different appearances. Let us call each of these momentary views a <em>profile</em> of the aspect; it is, transitively, also a profile of the side and a profile of the cube. A profile is a temporally individuated presentation of an object. The English word "profile" is the translation of the German <em>Abschattung</em>, which can signify "profile" or "sketch". Ultimately, therefore, the cube is given to me in a manifold of profiles.</p>

  <p>让我们将示例从对立方体的感知更改为对建筑物的感知。我看着大楼的正面。我从中心偏左一点的角度看那一侧：在那一刻，我看到了建筑物正面的一个特定方面。假设我对你说，“这座建筑的景色很吸引人，从这里来看吧”。当我离开现场而你进入现场时，你会看到与我刚才看到的相同的方面，但你会体验到与我所经历的不同的轮廓，因为轮廓是瞬间呈现，而不是外观或许多观众可以看到的视图或方面。一个方面，一个侧面，当然还有建筑本身都是主体间的，但是一个侧面是私人的和主观的。个人资料甚至可能取决于我当时的性格和我的感觉器官的状况；如果我生病或头晕，轮廓可能会摇晃或呈灰色，而不是稳定或蓝色。侧面的相对和主观特征并不意味着通过它们给出的方面或侧面或事物以相同的方式是相对和主观的。</p><p>Let us change our example from the perception of a cube to the perception of a building. I look at the front side of the building. I look at that side from a point of view a little to the left of center: at that moment, I see one particular aspect of the front of the building. Suppose I say to you, "This view of the building is very attractive; come and look at it from here". As I move away from the spot and you move into it, you see the same aspect that I just saw, but you will be experiencing profiles that are different from the ones I experienced, because the profiles are the momentary presentations, not the look or the view or the aspect that can be seen by many viewers. An aspect, a side, and of course the building itself are all intersubjective, but a profile is private and subjective. The profile may even depend on my disposition at the time and on the condition of my sensory organs; if I am ill or dizzy, the profile may be wobbly or grayish instead of being steady or blue. The relative and subjective character of profiles does not mean that the aspects or the sides or the things given through them are relative and subjective in the same way.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_2.xhtml.heading_id_4"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_2.xhtml.ch2_ioi"></a>对象本身的身份</h2><h2><a></a>IDENTITY OF THE OBJECT ITSELF</h2>

  <p>因此，感知涉及综合层、呈现流形的层，包括实际的和潜在的。然而，现在必须发挥一个重要的新方面的作用。当我看到立方体的不同面时，当我从不同的角度和通过不同的侧面体验不同的方面时，我的体验必须将所有这些流形视为属于同一个立方体。侧面、方面和轮廓都呈现给我，但在它们中，呈现的是同一个立方体。我所经历的层层差异与在其中并通过它们不断赋予的身份相抵触。</p><p>Perception, therefore, involves layers of synthesis, layers of manifolds of presentation, both actual and potential. Now, however, an important new dimension must be brought into play. When I see the different sides of the cube, when I experience various aspects from various angles and through various profiles, it is essential to my experience that I perceive all these manifolds as belonging to one and the same cube. The sides, aspects, and profiles are presented to me, but in them all, one and the same cube is being presented. The layers of difference that I experience are played off against an identity that is given continuously in and through them.</p>

  <p>然而，说立方体只是其所有剖面的总和是错误的。立方体的身份属于不同于侧面、方面和轮廓的维度。身份与其提供的外观不同。身份从不作为侧面、方面或轮廓出现，但它仍然呈现给我们，恰恰是所有这些中的身份。我们可以从立方体的相同性来设计立方体，而不仅仅是它的侧面、方面和轮廓。当我绕着立方体移动，或在手中转动它时，轮廓的连续流动通过“属于”单个立方体而统一起来。当我们说“立方体”呈现给我们时，我们的意思是它的身份是给定的。</p><p>It would be wrong, however, to say that the cube is just the sum of all its profiles. The identity of the cube belongs to a dimension different from that of the sides, aspects, and profiles. The identity is other to the appearances it offers. The identity never shows up as a side, an aspect, or a profile, but still it is presented to us, precisely as the identity in all of them. We can intend the cube in its sameness, not just in its sides, aspects, and profiles. As I move around the cube, or turn it around in my hand, the continuous flow of profiles is unified by being "of" the single cube. When we say that "the cube" is presented to us, we mean that its identity is given.</p>

  <p>在这一点上，我们看到了意识的意向性比我们在第 1 章中所研究的更深的维度。意识是“属于”某物的，因为它意指对象的身份，而不仅仅是呈现给它的表象流. 当我们检查从知觉到智力的转变时，当被感知的对象成为事态或事实的一部分时，对象的身份问题将变得重要，但它甚至作为知觉的组成部分也很重要。当我们感知一个物体时，我们不只是有一系列的轮廓，一系列的印象；在它们中并通过它们，我们得到了一个相同的对象，并且该对象的身份是有意的并且是被赋予的。所有的轮廓和所有的方面，所有的外表，都被认为是同一件事。身份属于经验给定的东西，身份的识别属于经验的意向结构。让我们顺便注意一下，这个身份本身既可以在不在场也可以在场，我们可能会误解它。</p><p>At this point, we see a deeper dimension of the intentionality of consciousness than those we examined in Chapter 1. Consciousness is "of" something in the sense that it intends the identity of objects, not just the flow of appearances that are presented to it. The issue of the identity of the object will become important when we examine the transition from perception to intellection, when a perceived object becomes part of a state of affairs or a fact, but it is important even as a constituent of perception. When we perceive an object, we do not just have a flow of profiles, a series of impressions; in and through them all, we have one and the same object given to us, and the identity of the object is intended and is given. All the profiles and all the aspects, all the appearances, are appreciated as being of one and the same thing. Identity belongs to what is given in experience, and the recognition of identity belongs to the intentional structure of experience. Let us also note in passing that this identity itself can be intended in absence as well as in presence, and we can be mistaken about it.</p>

  <p>这种对侧面、方面和概况的分析有助于证实现象学相对于笛卡尔和洛克的知识哲学的现实主义。后者认为，我们立即意识到的只是触动我们感受力的印象；我们被包围在我们的思想圈子里。但是，一旦我们承认存在像面相和面相之类的东西，我们就会发现，用头脑中的简单印象和想法来解释这些结构是完全不可能的。如果一切都只是我们的内在，那么我们提供给我们的只是轮廓：颜色的闪光和声音的片段，必须从中构造物体。我们永远无法区分侧面、侧面和侧面。相比之下，侧面、方面之间的区别，和轮廓更清楚地表明事物的表面和外观是“在那里”供我们感知的；它们不仅仅是根据触及我们感受力的印象编造出来的。同一个人或几个不同的人在不同时间可以看到相同的侧面或方面，不可能仅仅是一种私下影响每个主观性的印象。此外，在侧面、方面和轮廓的“背后”和“之中”，还有对象本身的统一性，即赋予我们的身份。身份是公开的，所有人都可以使用；这不仅仅是我们投射到外表上的东西。它们不仅仅是根据触及我们感受力的印象编造出来的。同一个人或几个不同的人在不同时间可以看到相同的侧面或方面，不可能仅仅是一种私下影响每个主观性的印象。此外，在侧面、方面和轮廓的“背后”和“之中”，还有对象本身的统一性，即赋予我们的身份。身份是公开的，所有人都可以使用；这不仅仅是我们投射到外表上的东西。它们不仅仅是根据触及我们感受力的印象编造出来的。同一个人或几个不同的人在不同时间可以看到相同的侧面或方面，不可能仅仅是一种私下影响每个主观性的印象。此外，在侧面、方面和轮廓的“背后”和“之中”，还有对象本身的统一性，即赋予我们的身份。身份是公开的，所有人都可以使用；这不仅仅是我们投射到外表上的东西。还有对象本身的单一性，即赋予我们的身份。身份是公开的，所有人都可以使用；这不仅仅是我们投射到外表上的东西。还有对象本身的单一性，即赋予我们的身份。身份是公开的，所有人都可以使用；这不仅仅是我们投射到外表上的东西。</p><p>This analysis of sides, aspects, and profiles helps confirm the realism of phenomenology over against the Cartesian and Lockean philosophies of knowledge. According to the latter, all we are immediately aware of are impressions that strike our sensibility; we are enclosed in the circle of our ideas. But once we admit that there are such things as profiles distinguished from aspects, and aspects distinguished from sides, we find that it is quite impossible to account for such structures in terms of simple impressions and ideas within the mind. If everything were simply internal to us, all we would have given to us would be profiles: flashes of color and bits of sound, out of which objects would have to be constructed. We could never distinguish among a profile and an aspect and a side. In contrast, the distinctions between sides, aspects, and profiles make it more obviously clear that the surfaces and looks of things are "out there" for us to perceive; they are not just fabricated out of the impressions that strike our sensibility. The side or aspect that can be seen as the same at different times by the same person, or by several different persons, could not be merely an impression privately affecting each subjectivity. Furthermore, "behind" and "in" the sides, aspects, and profiles, there is also the oneness of the object itself, the identity that is given to us. The identity is public and available to all; it is not just something that we project into the appearances.</p>

  <p>我们使用了对物质对象（立方体）的感知作为意向性现象学分析的初始范式。其他种类的对象涉及其他复杂的表示形式。在继续分析此类对象及其相应的意向性之前，让我们考虑一些在现象学中发挥重要作用的形式结构。</p><p>We have used the perception of a material object, a cube, as an initial paradigm for the phenomenological analysis of intentionality. Other kinds of objects involve other complex forms of presentation. Before moving on to the analysis of such objects and their corresponding intentionalities, let us consider some formal structures that play an important role in phenomenology.</p>

  现象学中的三种形式结构</h1><h1><span class="small">3</span><br><br>
  Three Formal Structures in Phenomenology</h1>

  <p>在现象学的分析中经常出现三种结构形式。如果我们知道这些形式，就会更容易理解特定段落中发生的事情或特定主题的发展。<em>这三种形式是 (a)部分和整体</em>的结构，(b)<em>流形中同一性</em>的结构，以及 (c)<em>在场和不在场</em>的结构。三者相互关联，但不能相互还原。这些结构中的前两个是许多早期哲学家发展的主题；<em>亚里士多德在形而上学</em>中对部分和整体有很多话要说<em></em>，例如，柏拉图和新柏拉图思想家，以及经院哲学家，探索差异中的同一性，即许多人中的一个。</p><p>There are three structural forms that appear constantly in the analyses done in phenomenology. If we are aware of these forms, it will be easier to understand what is going on in a particular passage or the development of a particular theme. The three forms are (a) the structure of <em>parts and wholes</em>, (b) the structure of <em>identity in a manifold</em>, and (c) the structure of <em>presence and absence</em>. The three are interrelated, but they cannot be reduced to one another. The first two of these structures are themes that have been developed by many earlier philosophers; Aristotle has much to say about parts and wholes in the <em>Metaphysics</em>, for example, and Plato and the Neoplatonic thinkers, as well as the scholastics, explore the idea of the identity within differences, the one in many.</p>

  <p>然而，早期哲学家还没有以明确和系统的方式解决存在与不存在的主题。这个问题在胡塞尔和现象学中是原创的。在场和缺席可以以非凡的方式混合，对这种混合的探索可以作为哲学中一个有价值的主题。我相信现象学正是因为它试图抵消现代思想的认识论问题，即由笛卡尔发起的以自我为中心的困境，才得出了这个新的哲学维度。现象学通过回应哲学上的困惑而取得了积极的进步，就像柏拉图为了回应智者怀疑主义的挑战而制定出他对统一性和形式的理解一样。</p><p>However, the theme of presence and absence has not been worked out, in an explicit and systematic way, by earlier philosophers. This issue is original in Husserl and in phenomenology. Presences and absences can be blended in remarkable ways, and the exploration of such blends can serve as a valuable theme in philosophy. I believe that phenomenology worked out this new philosophical dimension precisely because it was trying to counteract the epistemological problems of modern thought, the egocentric predicament initiated by Descartes. Phenomenology made a positive advance by responding to a philosophical confusion, much as Plato worked out his understanding of unity and form in response to the challenge of Sophistic skepticism.</p>

  <p>我们将考虑三种结构形式中的每一种，因为它们在现象学中得到了发展。</p><p>We will consider each of the three structural forms as they are developed in phenomenology.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_3.xhtml.heading_id_3"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_3.xhtml.ch3_pw"></a>零件和整体</h2><h2><a></a>PARTS AND WHOLES</h2>

  <p>整体可以分析为两种不同的部分：片段和瞬间。<em>片段</em>是即使脱离整体也能存在和呈现的部分；他们可以脱离整体。棋子也可以称为<em>独立</em>零件。</p><p>Wholes can be analyzed into two different kinds of parts: pieces and moments. <em>Pieces</em> are parts that can subsist and be presented even apart from the whole; they can be detached from their wholes. Pieces can also be called <em>independent</em> parts.</p>

  <p>碎片的例子是树叶和橡子，它们可以从它们的树上分离出来，但仍然作为独立的实体出现。甚至树枝也是一个独立的部分，因为它可以与树分开；当这样分开时，它不再像一根活的树枝那样发挥作用，而只是一块木头，但它仍然可以作为一个独立的东西存在和被感知。此外，机器的零件、演员团的成员、排中的士兵都是各自整体中的碎片。这些东西实际上确实属于他们更大的整体（机器、剧团、排），但他们也可以是他们自己，并从那个整体中分离出来。当这样分开时，碎片本身就变成了整体，不再是部分。那么，碎片是可以成为整体的部分。</p><p>Examples of pieces are leaves and acorns, which can be separated from their tree and still present themselves as independent entities. Even a branch of a tree is an independent part, because it can be separated from the tree; when so separated it no longer functions as a living branch and becomes only a piece of wood, but it still can exist and be perceived as an independent thing. Also, the parts of a machine, a member of a troupe of actors, a soldier in a platoon are pieces within their respective wholes. Such things do in fact belong to their larger whole (the machine, the troupe, the platoon), but they can also be themselves and present themselves apart from that whole. When so separated, pieces become wholes in themselves and are no longer parts. Pieces, then, are parts that can become wholes.</p>

  <p><em>时刻</em>是无法独立于它们所属的整体而存在或呈现的部分；他们不能分离。矩<em>是非独立的</em>部分。</p><p><em>Moments</em> are parts that cannot subsist or be presented apart from the whole to which they belong; they cannot be detached. Moments are <em>nonindependent</em> parts.</p>

  <p>瞬间的例子是红色（或任何其他颜色），它不能离开某些表面或空间扩展而出现，音高，它不能存在，除非与声音混合，还有视觉，它不能发生，除非依赖于眼。这些部分是非独立的，不能单独存在或呈现。一根树枝可以从一棵树上砍下来，但音高不能脱离声音，视觉不能离开眼睛。时刻只能与其他时刻混合在一起。瞬间是那种不能成为整体的部分。</p><p>Examples of moments are the color red (or any other color), which cannot occur apart from some surface or spatial expanse, and musical pitch, which cannot exist except as blended with a sound, and also vision, which cannot occur except as dependent upon the eye. Such parts are nonindependent and cannot exist or be presented by themselves. A branch can be cut off from a tree, but the pitch cannot be isolated from a sound and vision cannot float away from the eye. Moments cannot be except as blended with other moments. Moments are the kind of part that cannot become a whole.</p>

  <p>力矩或非独立部分的好例子可以在物理学中区分的维度中找到。在力学中，运动中的物体具有质量、速度、动量和加速度的力矩，而质量和加速度又与力本质上相关联。在电磁理论中，电流具有每单位时间的电荷量纲，单位为安培，而该量纲又与电势（伏特）、电阻（欧姆）和功率（瓦特）相关联。所有这些维度都是相互依存的：没有质量和速度就没有动量，没有质量和力就没有加速度，没有电压就没有电流。</p><p>Good examples of moments or nonindependent parts can be found in the dimensions that are distinguished in physics. In mechanics, a body in motion possesses the moments of mass, velocity, momentum, and acceleration, and mass and acceleration in turn are associated essentially with force. In electromagnetic theory, an electrical current possesses the dimension of charge per unit of time, which is measured in amperes, and this dimension is associated in turn with electrical potential (volts), resistance (ohms), and power (watts). All these dimensions are interdependent: there cannot be momentum without mass and velocity, or acceleration without mass and force, or current without voltage.</p>

  <p>一个特定的项目可以在一个方面是一个片段，而在另一个方面是一个时刻。例如，橡子可以与其树分离，但作为感知对象，它不能与背景分离；要被感知，必须在某种背景下才能看到橡子。</p><p>A particular item can be a piece in one respect while being a moment in another. For example, an acorn can be separated from its tree, but as an object of perception it cannot be separated from a background; to be perceived, the acorn has to be seen against a background of some sort or other.</p>

  <p>瞬间融合成整体的方式有一定的必要性。<em>有些时刻是建立在其他时刻之上的，并且在建立的</em>部分和<em>建立的</em>部分之间出现了区别。色相以色为基础，反之，色为色相的基础或底色。视觉建立在眼睛之上，眼睛创造或支持视觉。此外，可以有几层基础：阴影是建立在色调之上的，而色调又是建立在颜色之上的。在这种情况下，阴影仅间接地建立在颜色之上（通过色调），而色调直接建立在颜色之上。然而，音高和音色都直接建立在声音之上。</p><p>There is a certain necessity in the way moments are blended together into their wholes. Some moments are founded upon others, and a distinction arises between the <em>founded</em> and the <em>founding</em> parts. Hue is founded upon color, while, conversely, color founds or is the substrate for hue. Vision is founded on the eye, and the eye founds or supports vision. Furthermore, there can be several layers of founding: shade is founded upon hue, which in turn is founded upon color. In this case, shade is only mediately founded upon color (via hue), while hue is immediately founded upon color. Pitch and timbre, however, are both immediately founded upon sound.</p>

  <p>让我们添加另一个术语精确性：整体可以称为<em>具体的</em>，可以存在和呈现自身并作为具体个体来体验的东西。一块，一个独立的部分，是一个本身可以成为混凝土的部分。然而，时刻不能变成具体的。每当它们存在并被体验时，它们就会拖走其他时刻；它们仅以与其互补部分混合的形式存在。</p><p>Let us add another terminological precision: a whole can be called a <em>concretum</em>, something that can exist and present itself and be experienced as a concrete individual. A piece, an independent part, is a part that can itself become a concretum. Moments, however, cannot become concreta. Whenever they exist and are experienced, they drag along their other moments with them; they exist only as blended with their complementary parts.</p>

  <p>然而，我们有可能自己思考和谈论瞬间：我们可以谈论音高而不谈论声音；不提颜色可以只提色相；我们可以谈论视觉而不提及眼睛。当我们单独考虑瞬间时，它们是<em>抽象的</em>，他们被抽象地认为。谈论这些抽象部分的可能性，抽象说话的可能性，是因为我们可以使用语言而产生的；正是语言使我们能够在与其他时刻及其整体的必要补充之外处理一个时刻。然而，伴随这种能力出现的危险是：因为我们可以单独提及一个时刻，而不提及其关联的时刻，我们可能会开始认为这个时刻可以单独存在，它可以成为具体的。例如，我们可能会开始考虑视觉，就好像它可以独立于眼睛一样。</p><p>However, it is possible for us to think and speak about moments by themselves: we can speak about pitch without mentioning sound; we can refer to hue without mentioning color; we can talk about vision without mentioning the eye. When we consider moments simply by themselves, they are <em>abstracta</em>, they are being thought of abstractly. The possibility of speaking about such abstract parts, the possibility of speaking abstractly, arises because we can use language; it is language that permits us to deal with a moment apart from its necessary complement of other moments and its whole. However, a danger arises along with this ability: because we can refer to a moment by itself, without mentioning its associated moments, we may begin to think that this moment can exist by itself, that it can become a concretum. We may begin to think about vision, for example, as though it could be by itself, apart from the eye.</p>

  <p>片段和时刻之间的区别在哲学分析中非常重要。哲学中经常发生的事情是，作为瞬间的东西被认为是一个片段，被认为可以从更广泛的整体和其他部分中分离出来；那么一个关于如何重构原始整体的人为哲学“问题”就出现了。解决此类问题的真正方法不是采用某种新方法从这些错误分割的部分构建整体，而是简单地表明所讨论的部分是一个瞬间，而不是一个片段，它永远不应该是首先从整体中分离出来。许多哲学论证只是复杂的尝试，试图表明某物是一个依赖的部分，而不是一个独立的部分，是一个瞬间而不是一个片段。</p><p>The distinction between pieces and moments is very important in philosophical analysis. What often happens in philosophy is that something that is a moment is taken to be a piece, taken to be separable from its wider whole and other parts; then an artificial philosophical "problem" arises about how the original whole can be reconstituted. The true solution to such a problem is not to fashion some new way of building up the whole out of such falsely segmented parts, but simply to show that the part in question was a moment, not a piece, and that it never should have been separated from the whole in the first place. Many philosophical arguments are simply complicated attempts to show that something is a dependent, not an independent part, a moment and not a piece.</p>

  <p>例如，这种人为的问题出现在心及其对象方面。正如我们在第 1 章中所看到的，人们通常会将心灵视为一个自我封闭的领域，也就是说，一个可以从它自然而本质地所属的世俗环境中分离出来的部分。然后他们会问头脑如何能够走出自身并找出世界上正在发生的事情。但是头脑不能以这种方式被分离出来；头脑是世界和其中事物的一个时刻；头脑本质上与其对象相关联。头脑本质上是有意的。不存在“知识的问题”或“外部世界的问题”，也不存在我们如何到达“超外”现实的问题，因为头脑从一开始就不应该与现实分离。思想和存在是彼此的瞬间；它们不是可以从它们所属的整体中分割出来的部分。同样，人的思想常常与大脑和身体分离，就好像它们是一体的，而不是建立在它们之上的。“心脑”问题也可以被视为混淆部分和整体的一个例子。</p><p>This sort of artificial problem arises in regard to the mind and its objects, for example. As we have seen in Chapter 1, people will often take the mind to be a self-enclosed sphere, that is, a piece that can be separated from the worldly context to which it naturally and essentially belongs. Then they will ask how the mind can ever get outside itself and find out what is going on in the world. But the mind cannot be separated out in this way; the mind is a moment to the world and the things in it; the mind is essentially correlated with its objects. The mind is essentially intentional. There is no "problem of knowledge" or "problem of the external world", there is no problem about how we get to "extramental" reality, because the mind should never be separated from reality from the beginning. Mind and being are moments to each other; they are not pieces that can be segmented out of the whole to which they belong. Likewise, the human mind is often separated from the brain and the body as though it were a piece and not a moment founded upon them; the "mind-brain" problem can also be treated as an instance of confusion regarding parts and wholes.</p>

  <p>部分和整体逻辑的另一个例子可以在我们对立方体感知的分析中找到。轮廓、方面和侧面，以及立方体本身的身份，都是物体呈现中彼此的瞬间。除非通过方面，否则我们无法展示侧面，而这些方面又只能通过配置文件呈现。立方体本身作为一个身份不能在感知上呈现，除非通过侧面、方面和轮廓的多样性。这将是一个错误放置的具体性，寻找片段而不是时刻，想要单独拥有立方体，而不是建立在其多种表现形式之上的情况。</p><p>Another example of the logic of parts and wholes can be found in our analysis of the perception of a cube. The profiles, aspects, and sides, as well as the identity of the cube itself, are all moments to one another in the presentation of the object. We could not have the presentation of sides except through aspects, which in turn are only presented through profiles. The cube itself as an identity cannot be presented perceptually except through the manifolds of sides, aspects, and profiles. It would be a case of misplaced concreteness, of looking for the piece rather than the moment, to want to have the cube just by itself, not as founded on its manifolds of presentations.</p>

  <p>总是存在这样的危险，即我们会将不可分割的东西分开，我们会将抽象变成具体的，因为在我们的演讲中，我们可以谈论一个时刻而不会提及它的基础是什么。例如，我们可以谈论“三角形”，过了一会儿，我们开始认为除了具体的三角形之外，还存在一个三角形。当我们允许这种情况发生时，我们将一个时刻变成一个片段，将一个抽象的片段变成一个具体的片段，然后我们开始问我们究竟如何才能遇到那个片段，它如何将自己呈现给我们。我们让我们讲话的抽象性误导我们认为我们谈论的事情可以具体地呈现给我们。我们引入一个分离，我们应该简单地进行区分。</p><p>There is always a danger that we will separate the inseparable, that we will make the abstractum into a concretum, because in our speech we can talk about one moment without mentioning what it is founded upon. We can talk about "the triangle", for example, and after a while we start to think that there exists a triangle apart from embodied triangles. When we allow this to happen, we make a moment into a piece, an abstractum into a concretum, and we begin to ask how on earth we could encounter that piece, how it could present itself to us. We let the abstractness of our speech mislead us into thinking that the thing we talk about could present itself concretely to us. We introduce a separation where we should simply make a distinction.</p>

  <p>片断和瞬间的对比，对我们介绍现象学有很大的帮助。许多看起来很复杂的问题，如果按照其中发挥作用的部分的种类来表述，就会变得很简单。哲学分析通常包括列出构成给定整体的各种时刻。例如，对视觉的哲学分析将表明视觉是如何建立在眼睛和身体运动（眼睛的扫视运动、头部转动的能力、整个身体移动的能力）之上的。从一个地方到另一个地方，从一个视点到另一个），看和被看是一个整体中的瞬间，以及看是如何受到其他感官方式（如触觉、听觉和运动感觉）的制约。</p><p>The contrast between pieces and moments is of great help in our introduction to phenomenology. Many issues that seem very complicated turn out to be simple when formulated in terms of the kinds of parts that function within them. A philosophical analysis usually consists in laying out the various moments that go to make up a given whole. The philosophical analysis of vision, for example, will show how vision is founded upon the eye and also upon bodily mobility (on the saccadic movements of the eye, on the ability of the head to be turned, on the ability of the whole body to go from one place to another, from one viewpoint to another), how both seeing and that which is seen are moments within a whole, and how seeing is conditioned by other sensory modalities, such as touch, hearing, and kinesthesia. A philosophical analysis will help us avoid the temptation to turn moments into pieces, as we might do, for example, when we attempt to separate vision from mobility.</p>

  <p>即使是人类灵魂或任何生物的灵魂问题，也可以通过求助于部分和整体来阐明。灵魂是一瞬间；它与身体有着本质的联系，并且建立在身体之上，它赋予生命力，决定身体，并在身体中表达它。人类是有生命的身体，而不是被束缚的灵魂。但是灵魂常常被讽刺成一个片段，一个生命力或一个可以存在、被呈现和理解的东西，脱离它的有机基础，甚至变成可以先于它的身体存在的东西。当然，灵魂之于生命体的方式与色相之于颜色的方式不同，但澄清灵魂本质的第一步是表明它不是一个可以分离的东西除了与身体的关系之外，还可以理解。</p><p>Even the question of the human soul, or the soul of any living thing, can be clarified by an appeal to parts and wholes. The soul is a moment; it bears an essential relation to the body and is founded on the body that it enlivens and determines and in which it is expressed. Human beings are animated bodies, not enmattered spirits. But the soul is often caricatured by being turned into a piece, into a vital force or a thing that could exist and be presented and understood apart from its organic base, even into something that can preexist its body. Of course, the manner in which the soul is a moment to the living body is different from the way hue is a moment to color, but the first step in clarifying the nature of soul is to show that it is not a separable thing that can be understood apart from its involvement with the body.</p>

  <p>时刻，非独立的部分，被安排成一个整体的方式是有必要的。某些时刻为其他时刻调解，这些时刻仅通过前者加入整体：在立方体的感知中，方面在侧面和侧面之间进行调解，侧面在侧面和立方体本身之间进行调解（侧面不呈现立方体本身，仅呈现其侧面和侧面，因此中间是立方体）。布置这样的时刻阵列提供了对所讨论的整体的理解。然而，经常发生的情况是，我们将某些部分表达为一个整体，而忽略了其他部分；或者我们尝试分割时刻，将我们挑选出来的时刻分割成碎片；或者我们把一个时刻等同于另一个时刻，也就是说，我们无法维持区分。我们可能会混淆政治和经济，例如，在整个人际关系中，或者我们可能认为经济学，实际上只是一个瞬间，是一个整体。例如马克思把经济学上升为社会关系的整体，霍布斯则把契约关系从社会整体的一部分上升为整体。部分和整体的计算是哲学和人类理解的核心。</p><p>There is necessity in the way moments, nonindependent parts, are arranged into a whole. Certain moments mediate for others, which join the whole only through the former: in the perception of the cube, aspects mediate between profiles and sides, and sides mediate between aspects and the cube itself (profiles do not present the cube itself, only its aspects and sides and thus mediately the cube). To layout such arrays of moments provides an understanding of the whole in question. What often happens, however, is that we articulate some of the parts in a whole but neglect others; or we try to segment the moments, taking as pieces the moments we have singled out; or we take one moment as being equivalent to another, that is, we fail to sustain a distinction. We may confuse politics with economics, for instance, within the whole of human relationships, or we may think that economics, which is really only a moment, is the whole. Marx, for example, elevates economics to the whole of social relationships, and Hobbes elevates contractual relations, which are only a part of the social whole, into being the whole. The working out of parts and wholes is central to philosophy and human understanding.</p>

  <p>每当我们思考某事时，我们都会将其中的部分和整体联系起来。当我们超越简单的感性和相当无声的感知时，部分和整体构成了我们思考的内容。部分的命名是思想的本质，当我们试图从哲学上理解什么是理解时，重要的是要看到片段和时刻之间的区别。</p><p>Whenever we think about something, we articulate parts and wholes within it. The parts and wholes make up the content of what we think when we go beyond simple sensibility and rather mute perception. The naming of parts is the essence of thought, and it is important to see the difference between pieces and moments when we try, philosophically, to understand what understanding is.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_3.xhtml.heading_id_4"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_3.xhtml.ch3_im"></a>流形中的身份</h2><h2><a></a>IDENTITY IN MANIFOLDS</h2>

  <p>当我们考虑对立方体的感知时，我们已经遇到了流形中同一性的主题：立方体作为一个同一性被证明与它的侧面、方面和轮廓不同，但它是通过它们全部呈现出来的。我们现在可以做的是展示这种呈现形式的范围有多么广泛，并揭示它的一些哲学含义。正如我们所见，结构在所有物质对象的感知中运作，但它也在可以呈现给我们的任何事物中运作。首先，让我们研究一下它如何通过语言表达意义。</p><p>We have already encountered the theme of identity in manifolds when we considered the perception of a cube: the cube as an identity was shown to be distinct from its sides, aspects, and profiles, and yet it was presented through them all. What we can do now is to show how wide-ranging this form of presentation is, and to bring out some of its philosophical implications. The structure operates in the perception of all material objects, as we have seen, but it also operates in any kind of thing that can be presented to us. To begin, let us examine how it functions in the presentation of meaning through language.</p>

  <p>当我们想表达某事时，我们总是可以区分表达和被表达的东西，即实验。如果我说“The snow has covered the street”、“The street is covered with snow”和“Die Strasse ist verschneit”，我说了三种不同的表达方式，但我可以认为这三种表达方式都表达了一种和相同的含义或实验，相同的事实或信息。这三个表达式就像一个对象的三个方面，只是在这种情况下对象是复杂的，它的存在状态与立方体不同。我可以通过用不同的方式朗读我的句子来进一步放大流形：通过大声喊出这句话，然后耳语，然后用高音调说出来，等等。</p><p>When we wish to express something, we can always distinguish between the expression and what is expressed, the exprimend. If I say, "The snow has covered the street", "The street is covered with snow", and "Die Strasse ist verschneit", I have uttered three different expressions, but I can consider all three of them to have expressed one and the same meaning or exprimend, one and the same fact or bit of information. The three expressions are like three aspects of one and the same object, except that in this case the object is complicated and its status in being is different from that of a cube. I could amplify the manifold still further by intoning my sentences in different ways: by shouting the sentence once, then whispering it, then saying it in a high-pitched voice, and so on. These would all be various ways of presenting one and the same sentence, and yet all the utterances and all the sentences (and many possible others as well) would present one and the same meaning, and one and the same fact.</p>

  <p>关键是同一事实可以用多种方式表达，而事实与它的任何和所有表达方式都是不同的。正如立方体属于不同于侧面、侧面和轮廓的维度，意义或事实属于不同于赋予它的表达和话语的多样性的维度。出于这个原因，将意义或事实视为某种心理句子，一种我们公开表达的表达的幽灵般的类比，会产生误导；这样做将是常见的哲学错误，即放错了具体性，将片刻视为一个片段。意义只是在其所有表达之内和背后的身份。我们还应该注意到，相同的含义可以通过许多其他的句子或表达方式（在其他语言中，在手语中，通过手势和其他符号）来表达，这些句子或表达方式还没有而且大多数情况下不会被陈述，就像立方体是可以通过我们尚未激活的配置文件感知的身份。潜在和缺席的视野围绕着事物的实际存在。事物总是可以以比我们已知的更多的方式呈现；这东西总是会保留更多的外观。潜在和缺席的视野围绕着事物的实际存在。事物总是可以以比我们已知的更多的方式呈现；这东西总是会保留更多的外观。潜在和缺席的视野围绕着事物的实际存在。事物总是可以以比我们已知的更多的方式呈现；这东西总是会保留更多的外观。</p><p>The point is that the identical fact can be expressed in a manifold of ways, and the fact is other to any and all of its expressions. Just as the cube belongs to a dimension different from that of the sides, aspects, and profiles, so the meaning or the fact belongs to a dimension different from that of the manifold of expressions and utterances through which it is given. For this reason, it would be misleading to look for a meaning or a fact as some sort of mental sentence, a kind of ghostly analogue of the expressions we publicly utter; to do so would be the usual philosophical mistake of misplaced concreteness, of taking a moment as a piece. The meaning just is the identity that is within and yet behind all of its expressions. We should also notice that the identical meaning is capable of being presented through many other sentences or expressions (in still other languages, in sign languages, through gestures and other symbols) that have not and mostly will not be stated, just as the cube is an identity that could be perceived through profiles we have not yet activated. The horizon of the potential and the absent surrounds the actual presences of things. The thing can always be presented in more ways than we already know; the thing will always hold more appearances in reserve.</p>

  <p>作为多重身份的另一个例子，考虑一个重要的历史事件，例如第二次世界大战中的诺曼底入侵。参与事件的人以一种方式体验了这一事件，当他们记得它时，他们以另一种方式体验了它，阅读报纸报道的人以另一种方式体验了它，写作的人以另一种方式体验了这一事件以及那些后来阅读有关它的书籍的人，以另一种方式由那些参加诺曼底海滩上的纪念庆典的人，以另一种方式由那些观看实际事件拍摄的电影的人，以及以另一种方式由那些看电影的人以及关于它的电视节目。同样的事情，既有想做的，也有想抵制的。毫无疑问，有</p><p>As another example of an identity in a manifold, consider an important historical event, such as the Normandy Invasion in the Second World War. This event was experienced in one way by those who participated in it, in another way by those same people when they remembered it, in another way by those who read about it as it was reported in the newspapers, in another way by those who write and those who read books about it later on, in another way by those who join in a memorial celebration on the Normandy beaches, in another way by those who see films taken of the actual event, and in still another way by those who see movies and television shows made about it. The same event was also anticipated by those who were planning to do it and those who, on the other side, were planning to resist it. There are, undoubtedly, still other ways in which one and the same event can be intended and made present, and the identity of the event is sustained through them all.</p>

  <p>让我们转向审美对象。一部和同一部戏剧，比如说，<em>马尔菲公爵夫人</em>, 出现在所有的舞台和所有的阅读中, 以及他们的各种解释, 其中给出了剧本, 并且在约翰韦伯斯特写剧本时也呈现给了他。同一首交响曲，例如莫扎特的哈夫纳交响曲，在所有的演奏中都有演奏。Bruno Walter 的解释与 Klaus Tennstedt 的解释不同，的确二十世纪初的一般解释方式与二十世纪后期的普遍解释方式不同，但所有的解释都是同一部交响曲. 有趣的是，一段音乐的录音与现场表演不同，因为录音只捕捉其中一次表演，而每场现场表演都不同于其他所有表演。如果我对同一个录音听两遍，我会两次听到相同的表演，而不仅仅是相同的交响乐，但每次我听到的都是不同的：某些维度而不是其他维度会脱颖而出，我的心情可能会有所不同，这一天本身可能会很明亮或阴沉。当一段录音只记录一次表演时，就好像一部电影只记录了一个立方体的一个方面，只让我看到了立方体本身的特定表现形式。</p><p>Let us turn to aesthetic objects. One and the same drama, say, <em>The Duchess of Malfi</em>, is presented in all the stagings and all the readings, with all their various interpretations, in which the play is given, and it was also presented to John Webster when he wrote the play. One and the same symphony, such as the Hafner Symphony of Mozart, is given in all its executions. The interpretation given by Bruno Walter is different from that given by Klaus Tennstedt, and indeed the general way of interpreting it in the early twentieth century was different from that common in the late twentieth century, but all the interpretations are of one and the same symphony. It is interesting to note that a recording of a piece of music is different from a live performance because the recording captures just one of the performances, whereas each live performance is different from all the others. If I were to listen twice to the same recording, I would hear the same performance both times, not just the same symphony, and yet my hearing of it would be different each time: some dimensions and not others would come to the fore, my mood might be different, the day itself might be bright or gloomy. When a recording captures just one performance, it is as though a movie captured just one aspect of a cube and only let me see that particular manifestation of the cube itself.</p>

  <p>如果我们从需要表演的艺术转向不需要表演的艺术，我们会发现身份和流形结构的进一步差异。一幅画不是通过类似于管弦乐队表演的任何东西来执行的；它在查看时直接呈现，而不是在有人执行时呈现。任何表演者都不得介于观众和作品之间，就像音乐家必须介于听众和作品之间一样。然而，一幅和同一幅画可以在某一时刻看到并在另一时刻被记住，可以对这幅画进行书面分析，可以绘制它的副本，并且可以制作这幅画的印刷品，即“复制品”。这幅画对艺术家的看法与对观众的看法之间也存在差异，以及有教养的观众和纯粹的好奇者的看法之间的差异。这幅画等待它的观看者作为一件艺术品来完成，但它的完成方式不同于交响乐等待表演以进入实际存在的方式。恒等式和流形在每种情况下都不同。</p><p>If we turn from the arts that require performance to those that do not, we find further differences in the structure of identity and manifold. A painting is not executed by anything analogous to an orchestra performance; it is presented directly when it is viewed, not when someone performs it. No performer must come between the viewers and the work as the musicians must come between the listeners and the work. However, one and the same painting can be seen at one moment and remembered at another, written analyses of the painting can be given, copies of it can be painted, and prints, "reproductions", of the painting can be made. There is also a difference between how the painting appeared to the artist and how it appears to the viewer, as well as differences between the viewing of a cultivated viewer and a mere curiosity seeker. The painting waits for its viewers in order to be completed as a work of art, but it does so in a way different from how a symphony waits for performances in order to come into actual being. The identities and the manifolds are different in each case.</p>

  <p>如果我们可以转向宗教事件以获得更多例子，出埃及记是呈现给参与其中的犹太人，但同样的事件呈现给那些在圣经中读到它的人和那些庆祝逾越节的人。对于基督徒来说，基督的死亡和复活的事件是门徒所经历的，并以不同的方式进一步呈现，通过阅读圣经，通过殉道者和忏悔者的见证，通过圣礼，尤其是圣体圣事. 事实上，对于基督徒来说，庆祝圣体圣事不仅是对基督死亡和复活的展示，也是对逾越节和出埃及记的中介展示。因此，即使是神圣的也是多种表现形式中的一种身份。</p><p>If we may turn to religious events for further examples, the Exodus was presented to the Jewish people who were involved in it, but the same event is presented to those who read about it in the Scriptures and those who celebrate the Passover. For Christians, the event of the death and resurrection of Christ was experienced by the disciples, and is further presented, in different ways, through the reading of the Scriptures, through the witness of martyrs and confessors, and through the sacraments and especially the Eucharist. Indeed, for Christians the celebration of the Eucharist is not only a presentation of the death and resurrection of Christ, but also a mediated presentation of the Passover and the Exodus. Thus, even the sacred is an identity within a manifold of presentations.</p>

  <p>通过其表象的多样性而被赋予的同一性属于不同于多样性的维度。同一性不是流形的一个成员：立方体不是一个方面或轮廓之一，命题不是说出的句子之一，戏剧不仅仅是它的表演之一。身份超越了它的多种表现形式，它超越了它们。身份不仅仅是其外表的总和；将其视为它们的总和会使此处必须区分的两个维度变平。它会使一切都只是一系列表象，都在一个维度中，而不是将身份识别为超出表象维度的东西，作为通过所有表象以及其他可能的表象呈现的东西。</p><p>The identity that is given through its manifold of appearances belongs to a dimension different from that of the manifold. The identity is not one member of the manifold: the cube is not one of the aspects or profiles, the proposition is not one of the uttered sentences, the play is not simply one of its performances. The identity transcends its manifold of presentations, it goes beyond them. The identity is not merely the sum of its appearances; to see it as just their sum would flatten out the two dimensions that must be distinguished here. It would make everything just a series of appearances, all in one dimension, instead of recognizing the identity as beyond the dimension of appearances, as something presented through them all, and through other possible appearances as well.</p>

  <p>这种身份的存在是相当难以捉摸的。我们自以为很清楚什么是表象——我们看到的一个方面、我们说出的一句话、我们听到的表演——但身份似乎不是我们可以放在手上或放在眼前的东西。它似乎逃避了我们的掌握。然而我们知道身份永远无法还原为它的一种表象；我们知道，身份必须与这个以及我们喜欢的每一个展示区分开来。如果身份现在以一种方式呈现自己，那么它也保留了其他方式，可以以同样的方式再次出现，对我们自己和他人；它总是既显露又隐藏自己。东西总是可以再次被给予，也许是以我们自己无法预料的方式。</p><p>The being of this identity is rather elusive. We think we know rather clearly what an appearance is — an aspect that we see, a sentence that we utter, a performance that we hear — but the identity seems not to be something we can put our hands on or put before our eyes. It seems to elude our grasp. And yet we know that the identity is never reducible to one of its appearances; we know that the identity must be distinguished from this and every presentation that we enjoy of it. If the identity presents itself now in one way, it also holds in reserve other ways of being given and of reappearing as the same thing again, to ourselves and to others; it always both reveals and conceals itself. The thing can always be given again, perhaps in ways we ourselves cannot anticipate. What we try to do in our philosophical analysis is to secure the reality of such identities, to bring out the fact that they are different from their manifolds of presentation, and to show that despite their slippery status they truly are a component of what we experience.</p>

  <p>事实上，对于“什么是现象学分析？”这个问题，也许是最简单的答案。可以说它描述了适合给定种类的对象的流形。意义现象学将阐明赋予意义的多样性；艺术现象学将描述艺术对象自我呈现和识别的各种流形；想象的现象学将描述想象对象被赋予的外观的多样性；宗教现象学将讨论宗教事物特有的多种表象。每一个流形都是不同的，每一个都适合它的身份，并且身份在种类上也不同。“外观的多样性”和“身份”是类似的术语；艺术品的身份不同于政治事件的身份，但两者都是身份，并且都有其适当的赋予方式。通过仔细地阐明不同的流形和身份，现象学帮助我们保持每一个的真实性和独特性。它不仅在其独立存在方面，而且在其呈现能力方面，通过揭示每种存在的适当性，帮助我们避免还原论。例如，如果我们能够制定出适合每个人的多种表现形式，那么道德行为将与强迫行为更加生动地区分。现象学帮助我们保持每个事物的真实性和独特性。它不仅在其独立存在方面，而且在其呈现能力方面，通过揭示每种存在的适当性，帮助我们避免还原论。例如，如果我们能够制定出适合每个人的多种表现形式，那么道德行为将与强迫行为更加生动地区分。现象学帮助我们保持每个事物的真实性和独特性。它不仅在其独立存在方面，而且在其呈现能力方面，通过揭示每种存在的适当性，帮助我们避免还原论。例如，如果我们能够制定出适合每个人的多种表现形式，那么道德行为将与强迫行为更加生动地区分。</p><p>Indeed, perhaps the easiest answer one might give to the question, "What is a phenomenological analysis?" would be to say that it describes the manifold that is proper to a given kind of object. A phenomenology of meaning would spell out the manifold through which meanings are given; a phenomenology of art would describe the various manifolds by which art objects present themselves and are identified; a phenomenology of the imagination would describe the multiplicities of appearance through which imaginary objects are given; a phenomenology of religion would discuss the manifolds of appearance proper to religious things. Each manifold is different, each is proper to its identity, and the identities are different in kind. "Manifold of appearance" and "identity" are analogous terms; the identity of an art object is different from the identity of a political event, and yet both are identities and both have their proper ways of being given. By carefully spelling out the diverse manifolds and identities, phenomenology helps us to preserve the reality and distinctiveness of each. It helps us avoid reductionism by bringing out what is proper to each kind of being, not only in its independent existence, but also in its power of presentation. A moral action, for example, will be more vividly distinguished from compulsive conduct if we are able to formulate the manifold of presentations proper to each.</p>

  <p>我们考虑过的关于流形中身份的大多数例子都与单个感知者或单个知者有关。当我们引入其他人的存在时，当我们包括主体间性的维度时，一个更丰富的流形阵列开始发挥作用。例如，侧面、方面和轮廓的流形向我呈现了一个身体对象，流形随着我自己在空间中的运动而变化。但是当其他感知者被带入画面时，同一身份呈现出更深的客观性，更丰富的超越性；我现在不仅将它视为如果我以这种方式移动时我会看到不同的东西，而且将其视为现在从其他人的另一个角度看到的同一件事。对象通过与我面对的不同的流形提供给其他观众，我看到的对象恰恰是别人通过我不同意的观点看到的。我意识到它向其他人展示了未向我展示的方面，因此这些其他方面是我共同意向的，而不是我自己的。事物的身份不仅对我而且对其他人都存在，因此它对我来说是一个更深刻、更丰富的身份。那里有更多的“那里”；主体间视角的引入加强了事物的存在和身份。为他人和我而存在的维度增加了事物的存在和身份。因此，这些其他方面是我共同提出的，恰恰不是我自己的。事物的身份不仅对我而且对其他人都存在，因此它对我来说是一个更深刻、更丰富的身份。那里有更多的“那里”；主体间视角的引入加强了事物的存在和身份。为他人和我而存在的维度增加了事物的存在和身份。因此，这些其他方面是我共同提出的，恰恰不是我自己的。事物的身份不仅对我而且对其他人都存在，因此它对我来说是一个更深刻、更丰富的身份。那里有更多的“那里”；主体间视角的引入加强了事物的存在和身份。为他人和我而存在的维度增加了事物的存在和身份。</p><p>Most of the examples we have considered of identities in manifolds have been related to a single perceiver or a single knower. When we introduce the presence of other persons, when we include the dimension of intersubjectivity, a much richer array of manifolds comes into play. For example, the manifolds of sides, aspects, and profiles present a bodily object to me, and the manifolds change in response to my own movements in space. But when other perceivers are brought into the picture, the same identity takes on a deeper objectivity, a richer transcendence; I now see it not only as the thing I would see differently if I were to move this way and that, but also as the very same thing that is being seen, right now, from another perspective by someone else. The object is given to other viewers through manifolds that are different from those facing me, and I see the object precisely as being seen by others through viewpoints that I do not share. I realize that it presents facets to others that are not being presented to me, and hence these other facets are cointended by me, precisely as not my own. The identity of the thing is there not only for me but also for others, and therefore it is a deeper and richer identity for me. There is more "there" there; the being and the identity of the thing are heightened by the introduction of intersubjective perspectives. The very dimension of being there for others as well as for me adds to the being and identity of the thing.</p>

  <p>同样的丰富性增加也发生在其他身份方面，例如文本的意义、艺术和文化对象、人类事件、道德状况和宗教身份。例如，打开的可能性之一是能够欣赏到一个对象，比如一段文本，可以被另一个人比我更好地理解。我可能会意识到，与我的同事所掌握的相比，给我的身份和多样性是非常模糊和混乱的，他从文本中带出了我自己似乎永远无法发现的东西。同样，我可能对某个特定的人际交流感到困惑，而另一个人则立即掌握并表达了正在发生的事情；当我感知到这个事件时，我把它交给了我，因为它被其他人比我更好地感知和理解了，然而我确实掌握了这件事。即使在它的晦涩中，而且恰恰是晦涩难懂的情况下，这件事还是交给了我。</p><p>The same increase of richness occurs in regard to other identities, such as those of the meaning of a text, artistic and cultural objects, human events, moral situations, and religious identities. One of the possibilities that is opened up, for example, is the power to appreciate that an object, say a text, can be far better understood by another than by me. I may realize that the identity and the manifold given to me are very obscure and confused compared to what is grasped by my colleague, who brings out of the text things I never seem able to discover on my own. Again, I may be quite befuddled by a particular human exchange, while another person immediately grasps and expresses what is going on; as I then perceive this event, I have it given to me as being better perceived and better understood by someone else than by me, and yet I do grasp the event. Even in its obscurity, and precisely as obscure, the event is given to me.</p>

  <p>作为流形中身份结构的最后一个例子，让我们提到我们对自己的意识。我们的自我认同是通过一组特殊的外表来呈现的。当我们识别立方体、命题、事实、交响乐、绘画、道德交流和宗教事物时，我们也总是在建立我们自己的身份，即所有这些事物都被赋予的人。我们正在将自己确立为表现的与格。我们个人身份的一个重要组成部分存在于记忆、想象和感知的相互作用中，以及我们对内部时间的意识流动中。稍后我们将详细研究这些结构。我们自己的身份显然与给予我们的任何物体的身份不同，但它与其他自我的身份是同一类的，其他人。然而，即使在这种情况下，即使在主体间体验中，我们也作为我们自己意识的中心脱颖而出。即使在我们自己的同类中，我们也有一种特殊的不可避免的优越性；我们以一种我们永远无法逃脱的方式处于我们的中心。我们永远不会成为其他任何人或其他任何东西；我们不能抛下自己。</p><p>As a final example of the structure of identity in manifolds, let us mention the very awareness we have of our own selves. Our self-identity is something that presents itself through a special set of appearances. While we identify cubes, propositions, facts, symphonies, paintings, moral exchanges, and religious things, we also, always, are establishing our own identities as the ones to whom all these things are given. We are establishing ourselves as datives of manifestation. An important constituent of our personal identity is found in the interplay of memories, imaginations, and perceptions, and in the flow of our awareness of interior time. We will examine these structures in detail later on. Our own identity is obviously not the same as that of any of the objects that are given to us, but it is of the same kind as that of other selves, other persons. However, even in this context, even in intersubjective experience, we stand out as the center of our own consciousness. Even among our own kind, we have a special ineluctable preeminence; we are at our center in a way that we cannot ever escape. We never become anyone else or anything else; we cannot leave ourselves behind.</p>

  <p>当我们研究现象学中的其他主题时，我们将有机会应用流形中的同一性结构。让我们暂时离开这个话题，转到我们开始研究的第三种结构，存在与不存在。</p><p>We will have occasion to apply the structure of identity in manifolds as we examine other themes in phenomenology. Let us for the moment leave this topic and move on to the third of the structures we set out to investigate, that of presence and absence.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_3.xhtml.heading_id_5"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_3.xhtml.ch3_paib"></a>在场与不在场以及他们之间的同一性</h2><h2><a></a>PRESENCE AND ABSENCE AND THE IDENTITY BETWEEN THEM</h2>

  <p>我们已经观察到，存在与不存在，或充满与空虚的意图的哲学主题，对于现象学来说是非常原始的。出于某种原因，古典哲学家并没有关注当下与不在场之间的区别。我认为是现代的、笛卡尔式的对世界真实性的怀疑激发了现象学来研究这个问题。</p><p>We have already observed that the philosophical theme of presence and absence, or of filled and empty intentions, is quite original with phenomenology. For some reason, the classical philosophers have not focused on the distinction between the present and the absent. I suggest that it was modern, Cartesian skepticism about the reality of the world that provoked phenomenology into examining this issue.</p>

  <p><em>存在与不存在是实心</em>与<em>空心</em>的客观关联。空洞的意图是一种针对不存在的东西，不存在的东西，不存在于想要的人的东西的意图。充满的意向是指在意向者面前以身体存在的方式为目标。让我们看一些例子来展示这些结构。</p><p>Presence and absence are the objective correlates to <em>filled</em> and <em>empty intentions</em>. An empty intention is an intention that targets something that is not there, something absent, something not present to the one who intends. A filled intention is one that targets something that is there, in its bodily presence, before the one who intends. Let us look at some examples to bring out these structures.</p>

  <p>假设我们想去巴尔的摩的 Camden Yards 观看一场棒球比赛。去的想法是在我和朋友们的一次谈话中产生的。我们决定让约翰拿到票。他这样做了。我们谈论比赛以及谁可能获胜。我们开车去看比赛，还在谈论它。我们走进体育馆。到目前为止，游戏对我们来说是缺席的，但我们一直想要它，但只是空洞的。我们在没有它的情况下谈论过它，我们想象过在比赛中，我们在走向座位时期待比赛。这一切都是空想。现在，随着比赛的开始，我们开始观看比赛，我们练习充满的意图；游戏逐渐呈现在我们面前。空洞的意图，我们对游戏所说的和想象的，被游戏的实际存在所填充，这需要一些时间来展开。<em></em>游戏的<em>直觉。</em>这就是直觉在现象学词汇中的全部内容。直觉不是神秘或神奇的东西。它只是将某物呈现给我们，而不是在它不存在的情况下对其进行预期。比赛结束后，我们开车离开体育场，谈论和记住比赛，再一次通过空洞的意图和比赛的缺席，但在另一种缺席中，那种出现在记忆中的缺席，而不是呈现给期待的那种。缺席是不同的。我们在存在之后给予我们的缺席不同于我们在存在之前的缺席。</p><p>Suppose we wish to go to a baseball game in Camden Yards in Baltimore. The idea of going arises in a conversation my friends and I are having. We decide that John will get the tickets. He does so. We talk about the game and about who might win. We drive to the game, still talking about it. We walk into the stadium. So far, the game has been absent to us, and yet we have been intending it, but only emptily. We have talked about it in its absence, we have imagined being at the game, we anticipate the game as we walk toward our seats. All these have been empty intendings. Now, as the game starts and we begin to watch it, we exercise filled intentions; the game is gradually presented to us. The empty intentions, what we said and imagined about the game, become filled by the actual presence of the game, which takes some time to unfold. Our watching of the game is our <em>intuition</em> of the game. This is all that intuition is in the phenomenological vocabulary. Intuition is not something mystical or magical; it is simply having a thing present to us as opposed to having it intended in its absence. When the event is over, we drive away from the stadium and talk about and remember the game, once again through empty intentions and in the absence of the game, but in a different kind of absence, the kind that is presented to memory, not the kind presented to anticipation. The absences are different. The absences we have given to us after a presence are different from the absences we have before a presence.</p>

  <p>再举一个例子，假设你访问华盛顿特区，我说我们应该去国家美术馆看达芬奇的<em>Ginevra de' Benci</em>。当我们去画廊时，我告诉你关于这幅画的事：所有这一切都是在空想中完成的，即使你的空想与我不同。你从未见过这幅画，而我却见过，但我们都没有看到我们正在谈论的东西。然后，我们走到画前，继续讨论它，我们的意图现在已经充满了。这幅画呈现给我们；我们凭直觉。当我们离开这幅画时，它又不在了，我们又回到了空虚的意图。</p><p>As another example, imagine that you visit Washington, DC, and I say that we should go to the National Gallery of Art to see Leonardo da Vinci's <em>Ginevra de' Benci</em>. As we go to the gallery I tell you about the painting: all this is done in empty intending, even though your empty intentions are different from mine. You have never seen the painting whereas I have, but nevertheless we both are in the absence of what we are talking about. Then, we walk up to the painting and continue to discuss it, with our intentions now filled. The painting is present to us; we intuit it. When we leave the painting, it is absent again, and we are back to empty intentions.</p>

  <p>还有其他例子如下：另一个人的“内部体验”对我们来说总是不可还原的；不管你对我有多了解，我内心感受和体验的真实流动永远无法真正地与你的融合，例如，我的记忆或幻想突然开始在你的意识中浮现。另一方面，相互了解的人之间可能存在某种同情心，仅仅谈论别人的愤怒与直接看到那个人被激怒是有区别的。<em>再举个例子，当我提到仲夏夜之梦</em>中希波吕忒说的前两句时<em></em>, 我在他们不在的时候提到他们，但是当我背诵这句话时，“四天很快就会沉浸在黑夜中；/四夜很快就会梦到时间”，我在他们实际存在的时候提供了这两行。当我提到某个数学证明的名字时，我空洞地表示它不存在，但当我深思熟虑地进行证明时，我让它出现。在场和不在场的游戏可以适用于不同种类的事物，在每种情况下，在场和不在场的种类对于所讨论的事物都是特定的。我们之前注意到，哲学或现象学分析在于列出适合特定种类对象的流形；同样真实的是，现象学试图阐明属于所讨论的对象的在场和不在场、充满和空洞的意图的混合。</p><p>Still other examples are the following: the "internal experiences" of another person are always irreducibly absent to us; no matter how well you may know me, my actual flow of internal feelings and experiences could never become truly blended with yours in a way that would allow, for example, my memories or fantasies to suddenly start surfacing within your consciousness. On the other hand, a certain kind of sympathy can exist between people who know one another well, and there is a difference between merely talking, say, about someone else's anger in its absence and directly seeing that person enraged. As another example, when I refer to the first two lines said by Hippolyta in <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, I refer to them in their absence, but when I recite the words, "Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;/Four nights will quickly dream away the time", I offer the two lines in their actual presence. When I refer to a certain mathematical proof by name, I signify it emptily in its absence, but when I thoughtfully carry out the proof, I make it present. The play of presence and absence can work for different kinds of things, and in each case the kinds of presences and absences are specific to the thing in question. We noted earlier that philosophical or phenomenological analysis consists in laying out the manifolds that are proper to a particular kind of object; it is also true that phenomenology tries to spell out the blends of presences and absences, of filled and empty intentions, that belong to the object in question.</p>

  <p>直觉的概念在哲学上是有争议的。它通常被认为是私人的，无法解释的，几乎是非理性的，是一种凌驾于争论之上且无法传达的愿景。但是直觉不需要以这种神秘的方式来理解。现象学可以对这个概念给出一个相当清晰和有说服力的解释：直觉只是让对象实际呈现给我们，而不是在它不存在的情况下有意向。一场棒球比赛的深思熟虑的体验，实际看到一个立方体，找到我正在寻找的眼镜都是直觉，因为它们使事物出现。这种呈现与针对不存在的事物的空洞意图相抵触。矛盾的是，这是因为现象学非常重视事物的不存在，以至于它可以澄清直觉的意义；通过与空洞的意图及其缺席形成对比，直觉及其实现的存在变得更容易理解。</p><p>The concept of intuition is philosophically controversial; it is often taken to be something private, something inexplicable, something almost irrational, a kind of vision that overrides argument and cannot be communicated. But intuition need not be understood in this mysterious way. Phenomenology can give a rather clear and persuasive explanation for the concept: intuition is simply having the object actually present to us, in contrast with having it intended in its absence. The thoughtful experience of a baseball game, the actual seeing of a cube, finding the glasses I was looking for are intuitions, because they bring a thing to presence. Such presentation is played off against the empty intentions directed to the thing in its absence. Paradoxically, it is because phenomenology takes the absence of things so seriously that it can clarify the meaning of intuition; intuition, with the presence it achieves, is made to be much more understandable by being contrasted with empty intentions and their absences.</p>

  <p>存在和不存在、充满和空虚的意图的维度，我们还没有检查过。事实上，空洞的意图和充满的意图都指向同一个对象。同一件事有时不在场，有时又在场。换句话说，存在与不存在“背后”和“之中”都有一个身份。在场和不在场是“属于”同一件事。当我们期待棒球比赛并谈论它时，我们空洞地想到了我们将要看到的那场比赛。在真正的游戏出现之前，我们不打算提供该游戏或我们现在关注的某些替代游戏的图像。我们想要的游戏不在这里，还不存在。如果我和你谈论莱昂纳多的画，你和我想要的是同一幅画，当我们走进它所在的房间时，我们将直接看到的是同一个。在场就是画的在场，不在场就是同一幅画的不在场，跨越在场与不在场，这幅画就是一回事。这幅画被识别为横跨两者。绘画属于不同于在场和不在场的维度，但它只能呈现和不在场。存在与不存在属于在它们中被识别的事物的存在。事物以存在和不存在的混合形式给出，就像它们以多种呈现形式给出一样。我们还应该注意到，当我们用词来命名一个事物时，我们所指的正是这种身份，这种存在和不存在的不变性。在场就是画的在场，不在场就是同一幅画的不在场，跨越在场与不在场，这幅画就是一回事。这幅画被识别为横跨两者。绘画属于不同于在场和不在场的维度，但它只能呈现和不在场。存在与不存在属于在它们中被识别的事物的存在。事物以存在和不存在的混合形式给出，就像它们以多种呈现形式给出一样。我们还应该注意到，当我们用词来命名一个事物时，我们所指的正是这种身份，这种存在和不存在的不变性。在场就是画的在场，不在场就是同一幅画的不在场，跨越在场与不在场，这幅画就是一回事。这幅画被识别为横跨两者。绘画属于不同于在场和不在场的维度，但它只能呈现和不在场。存在与不存在属于在它们中被识别的事物的存在。事物以存在和不存在的混合形式给出，就像它们以多种呈现形式给出一样。我们还应该注意到，当我们用词来命名一个事物时，我们所指的正是这种身份，这种存在和不存在的不变性。这幅画被识别为横跨两者。绘画属于不同于在场和不在场的维度，但它只能呈现和不在场。存在与不存在属于在它们中被识别的事物的存在。事物以存在和不存在的混合形式给出，就像它们以多种呈现形式给出一样。我们还应该注意到，当我们用词来命名一个事物时，我们所指的正是这种身份，这种存在和不存在的不变性。这幅画被识别为横跨两者。绘画属于不同于在场和不在场的维度，但它只能呈现和不在场。存在与不存在属于在它们中被识别的事物的存在。事物以存在和不存在的混合形式给出，就像它们以多种呈现形式给出一样。我们还应该注意到，当我们用词来命名一个事物时，我们所指的正是这种身份，这种存在和不存在的不变性。正如它们在多种演示文稿中给出的那样。我们还应该注意到，当我们用词来命名一个事物时，我们所指的正是这种身份，这种存在和不存在的不变性。正如它们在多种演示文稿中给出的那样。我们还应该注意到，当我们用词来命名一个事物时，我们所指的正是这种身份，这种存在和不存在的不变性。</p><p>There is a dimension of presence and absence, of filled and empty intentions, that we have not yet examined. It is the fact that both the empty and the filled intending are directed toward one and the same object. One and the same thing is at one time absent and at another present. In other words, there is an identity "behind" and "in" presence and absence. The presence and the absence are "of" one and the same thing. When we anticipate the baseball game and talk about it, we emptily intend the very same game that we will see. We do not intend an image of that game, or some substitute game that we have in focus now until the real game shows up. We intend the game that is not here, that does not yet exist. If I talk to you about Leonardo's painting, you and I intend one and the same painting, the same one that we will see directly when we walk into the room where it is present. The presence is the presence of the painting, the absence is the absence of the same painting, and the painting is one and the same across presence and absence. The painting is identified across the two. The painting belongs to a dimension different from the presence and the absence, but it could not be except as capable of presenting and absenting itself. The presence and absence belong to the being of the thing identified in them. Things are given in a mixture of presences and absences, just as they are given in a manifold of presentations. We should also notice that it is this identity, this invariant in presence and absence, to which we refer when we use words to name a thing.</p>

  <p>在这种存在与缺席的相互作用中，必须在哲学上特别注意缺席和空洞意图的作用。在场一直是哲学的主题，但缺席却没有得到应有的重视。事实上，缺席通常被忽视和回避：我们倾向于认为我们所知道的一切都必须实际呈现给我们；我们似乎无法认为我们可以真正意图缺失的东西。我们回避缺席，即使它就在我们身边并且一直占据着我们的注意力。因此，当我们想要解释我们如何谈论不存在的对象时，我们倾向于说我们正在处理一个存在的对象的图像或概念，并且通过该图像或概念我们达到了缺席的东西。但是，这种以在场代替不在场的假设是非常不充分的。<em>如果我们对真实事物的不在场没有某种感觉，如果我们没有在事物不在场时意图它，那么仅仅是</em>一个概念或图像吗？出于某种原因，哲学家们倾向于忽视缺席在人类意识中的根本作用，他们试图通过诉诸隐秘形式的存在来掩盖这种作用，通过插入奇怪的存在，例如概念或想法，这将掩盖缺席的。</p><p>In this interplay of presence and absence, special attention must be given, philosophically, to the role of absence, of empty intending. Presence has always been a theme in philosophy, but absence has not been given its due. In fact, absence is usually neglected and evaded: we tend to think that everything we are aware of must be actually present to us; we seem incapable of thinking that we can truly intend what is absent. We shy away from absence even though it is all around us and preoccupies us all the time. Thus, when we want to explain how we can speak about objects that are not present, we tend to say that we are dealing with an image or a concept of the object, which is present, and through that image or concept we reach toward the absent thing. But this postulation of a presence to substitute for the absent is highly inadequate. For one thing, how would we ever know that what is given to us is <em>only</em> a concept or an image if we did not have some sense of the absence of the real thing, if we did not already intend the thing in its absence? For some reason, philosophers have tended to overlook the radical role of absence in human consciousness, and they have tried to conceal this role by appealing to surreptitious forms of presence, by inserting strange presences, such as concepts or ideas, that will cover up for the absent.</p>

  <p>但我们确实意在缺席，否认它在现象学上是错误的。我们可能需要文字或心理图像的支持来帮助我们意向不存在的事物，但这些存在并不会妨碍我们真正意向我们面前不存在的事物。不在场的是不在场的；缺席是一种现象，必须对其给予应有的重视。事实上，除了作为对特定缺席的反应之外，人类的许多性格或情绪无法理解。例如，希望和绝望都预设了我们可以打算实现一些尚未实现的好处，并且对实现它有信心或不自信。遗憾只有在我们意识到过去的情况下才有意义，而如果不通过对不在场的认识，又怎么能理解乡愁呢？当我们正在寻找某物却找不到时，这件事的缺席对我们来说太过分了。我们不断地生活在未来和过去、遥远和超越、未知和怀疑之中；我们不仅仅生活在我们周围的世界中，因为它被赋予了五种感官。</p><p>But we do intend the absent, and it is phenomenologically false to deny it. We may need the support of words or mental images to help us intend the absent, but these presences do not impede us from truly intending what is not there before us. The absent is given to us as absent; absence is a phenomenon, and it must be given its due. In fact, there are many human dispositions or emotions that cannot be understood except as responses to a given absence. Hope and despair, for example, presuppose that we can intend some good that is not yet achieved and are either confident or diffident about attaining it. Regret makes sense only because we are aware of the past, and how could homesickness be understood except through a recognition of the absent? When we are looking for something and cannot find it, the absence of the thing is all too present to us. We live constantly in the future and in the past, in the distant and the transcendent, in the unknown and the suspected; we do not live only in the world around us as it is given to the five senses.</p>

  <p>围绕人类状况的缺席有不同的种类。有些东西不存在是因为它们是未来的，有些是因为它们是当代的但很遥远，有些是因为它们被遗忘了，有些是因为它们被隐藏或秘密，还有一些是因为它们超出了我们的理解范围，但却被赋予了我们这样的东西：我们可以知道这是我们不了解的事情。缺席有多种颜色和味道，区分和描述它们是一项伟大的哲学任务。胡塞尔最原始的见解之一是将我们的注意力吸引到空洞的意图，即我们意图不在场的方式，并强调它们在存在、思想和人类状况的哲学探索中的重要性。</p><p>The absences that surround the human condition are of different kinds. Some things are absent because they are future, others because they are contemporary but far away, others because they are forgotten, others because they are concealed or secret, and still others because they are beyond our comprehension and yet are given to us as such: we can know that this is something we do not understand. Absences come in many colors and flavors, and it is a great philosophical task to differentiate and describe them. One of Husserl's most original insights was to draw our attention to empty intentions, our ways of intending the absent, and to highlight their importance in the philosophical exploration of being, the mind, and the human condition.</p>

  <p>我们似乎更熟悉存在；我们似乎更容易考虑它们。我们可能认为它们的问题要小得多：我们认为我们知道以肉体形式给予我们的东西意味着什么，可以这么说。然而，当从哲学上看，在场与不在场时，在场也具有更深的意义。当我们欣赏一个事物的在场时，我们准确地把它欣赏为不在场：如果我们要意识到在场，那么它可能不在场的地平线就必须在那里。在场是为了取消缺席。有时现在的对象是我们一直在寻找的东西。当我们通过空洞的意图寻找它时，它的缺失被生动地呈现给我们（“我的眼镜在哪里？我把它们放在哪里了？”）。然后，当我们找到对象时，它的存在恰好在这些仍在回荡的缺席中得到了缓冲。该物体正是我们一直在寻找的东西。在其他时候，对象可能还没有被寻找或等待，而是在没有期望的情况下突然出现；这让我们感到惊讶。即便如此，它似乎也取消了缺席。</p><p>Presences seem to be more familiar to us; it seems easier for us to think about them. We might think they are far less problematic: we think we know what it means for a thing to be given to us in the flesh, so to speak. And yet presences also take on a deeper meaning when they are seen, philosophically, as played off against the absent. When we appreciate the presence of a thing, we appreciate it precisely as not absent: the horizon of its being possibly absent must be there if we are to be aware of the presence. The presence is given as canceling an absence. Sometimes the present object is something we have been looking for. Its absence was vividly given to us while we searched for it through our empty intentions ("Where are my glasses? Where did I leave them?"). Then, when we find the object, its presence comes to light precisely as cushioned by these still-reverberating absences. The object comes to light precisely as what we have been looking for. At other times the object may not have been searched for or awaited but appears suddenly without expectation; it surprises us. Even then, it appears as canceling an absence.</p>

  <p>然而，无论如何，我们必须强调，对象的身份只能跨越存在与不存在的差异。身份<em>不仅仅</em>在存在时给出。即使当对象不存在时，我们也会意向对象本身，我们意向它的身份。当它在场时，我们再次意向身份，这次是在它现在的模式下，而且恰恰是没有缺席。</p><p>In any case, however, we must emphasize that the identity of the object is given only across the difference of presence and absence. The identity is <em>not</em> given only in the presence. Even when the object is absent, we intend the object itself, we intend it in its identity. When it is present, we intend the identity again, this time in its present mode and precisely as not absent.</p>

  <p>当我们从哲学上谈论存在与不存在时，我们关注的是有意识的主体与客体之间相关性的客观方面。对象及其身份是在存在和不存在的情况下给出的。如果我们转向主观方面，我们会说我们是在用空意，我们是在空意所缘，当我们成功地意境时，这些空意才能被填满。空的意图与对象的不存在相关，填充的意图与其存在相关。然而，除了空意和实意之外，还有一种<em>认可的行为</em>，一种<em>认同的行为</em>，这与对象本身的身份相关。这第三幕超越了空洞和充满的意图，就像物体的身份超越了它的存在和不存在一样。</p><p>When we speak philosophically about presence and absence, we focus on the objective side of the correlation between the conscious subject and the object. The object and its identity are given across presence and absence. If we turn to the subjective side, we would say that we exercise empty intentions, that we intend the object emptily, and that these empty intentions can be filled when we succeed in intending the object in actual presence. The empty intention is correlated with the absence of the object, the filled intention is correlated with its presence. However, in addition to the empty and the filled intending, there is also an <em>act of recognition</em>, an <em>act of identification</em>, that is correlated with the identity of the object itself. This third act transcends the empty and the filled intentions, just as the object's identity transcends its presences and absences.</p>

  <p>我们注意到缺勤有很多种。确实存在不同种类的在场和在场，每一种都适合所讨论的事物种类。未来随着时间的流逝而出现；遥远的事物通过克服距离而呈现；通过转动立方体，立方体的另一面就出现了；一个困难的数学证明是通过思考它的步骤来呈现的；通过提供翻译或学习语言来表达外文的意思；只有冒险才能面对危险。在每一种情况下，所讨论的事物都规定了适合它的缺席和在场的混合。</p><p>We have noted the fact that there are many different kinds of absences. It is also true that there are different kinds of presences and presencings, each appropriate to the kind of thing in question. The future comes to presence by letting time go by; something far away is brought to presence by overcoming distance; the other side of the cube is made present by turning the cube around; a difficult mathematical proof is made present by thinking through its steps; the meaning of a foreign text is made present by providing a translation or by learning the language; a danger can be faced only by taking a risk. In each case, the thing in question prescribes the blends of absences and presences that are proper to it.</p>

  <p>有时我们不会直接从空洞的意图转向实现；有时需要一系列步骤，或者至少是可能的，这些步骤来自一个<em>中间体</em>对另一个人的满足，直到最终达到目标本身。我曾经参加过一场高尔夫锦标赛，想看杰克·尼克劳斯打球。我在体育版上读到过他。我在报纸上看到他的照片。我看到他在电视上接受采访。在我参加比赛之后，我在高尔夫球场里走来走去，试图找到他的三人组。最后，我看到了排行榜（用来识别玩家并给出分数的排行榜），上面有他的名字；在那里看到他的名字但还没有看到他，我仍然有意或空洞地想要他，但现在我更接近实现，因为我不再只在报纸或体育杂志上看到他的名字，而是在他的排行榜上，这有点像他存在的指示标志或信号。然后我看到了他的球童，我从其他照片中认出了他（因此我进一步了解了他的存在）。最后，我见到了杰克尼克劳斯本人。在那一点上，我进入了知觉，离开了空洞的、有符号的意图、图形意图、联想意图和所有其他中间类型。一旦我进入知觉，我就无法进入任何其他更好的实现，但我可以继续拥有越来越多的知觉（我做到了，因为我跟随尼克劳斯打了接下来的几个洞）。然而，进一步的知觉并不是进入另一种意向性，而只是更加相似。履行链已达到顶峰。图形意图、联想意图和所有其他中间类型。一旦我进入知觉，我就无法进入任何其他更好的实现，但我可以继续拥有越来越多的知觉（我做到了，因为我跟随尼克劳斯打了接下来的几个洞）。然而，进一步的知觉并不是进入另一种意向性，而只是更加相似。履行链已达到顶峰。图形意图、联想意图和所有其他中间类型。一旦我进入知觉，我就无法进入任何其他更好的实现，但我可以继续拥有越来越多的知觉（我做到了，因为我跟随尼克劳斯打了接下来的几个洞）。然而，进一步的知觉并不是进入另一种意向性，而只是更加相似。履行链已达到顶峰。但更多的是相同的。履行链已达到顶峰。但更多的是相同的。履行链已达到顶峰。</p><p>Sometimes we do not move directly from an empty intention to a fulfillment; sometimes a series of steps is required, or at least is possible, that goes from one <em>intermediate</em> fulfillment to another until at last the object itself is reached. I once attended a golf tournament and wanted to see Jack Nicklaus play. I had read about him in the sports pages. I saw his picture in the newspaper. I saw him being interviewed on television. After I got to the tournament, I walked around the golf course, trying to find his threesome. Finally, I saw the leader board (the board identifying the players and giving their scores) with his name on it; on seeing his name there but not yet seeing him, I still intended him signitively or emptily, but now I was closer to fulfillment, because I was no longer seeing his name just in the papers or the sports magazines, but on his leader board, which was something like an indication sign or signal of his presence. Then I saw his caddy, whom I recognized from other pictures (and so I had a further indication of his presence). Finally, I saw Jack Nicklaus himself. At that point I entered into perception and left the empty, signitive intentions, the pictorial intentions, the associative ones, and all the other intermediate kinds. Once I entered into perception, I could not move into any other kind of better fulfillment, but I could continue to have more and more perceptions (and I did, as I followed Nicklaus while he played the next several holes). The further perceptions were, however, not a move into yet another kind of intentionality, but simply more of the same. The fulfillment chain had reached its apogee.</p>

  <p>因此，我们可以区分两种履行。(1) 一个人通过许多不同种类的中间体，最终达到直觉。例如，我们可能会从某个人的名字到他的面部素描，再到真人大小的肖像，再到雕像，再到电视图像再到这个人本人。这些阶段中的每一个都在性质上不同于其他阶段，每个阶段都完成了前一个阶段，但仍指向下一个阶段。然而，最后一个直觉并没有指向任何其他东西。它是终点站，是最后的证据。让我们称这种链为<em>分级</em>链或<em>累积链</em>履行。同样，最终的实现，即直觉，没有任何神奇或绝对的东西；它根本没有指向任何新的意图。在这一点上，它不同于中间阶段，中间阶段确实指向前方。我们还应该注意到，对象的最终直觉收集了它被预期的所有中间阶段的意义：准确地说，它不是<em>这些</em>阶段——而是它们的完成。看到尼克劳斯<em>并不是</em>看到他的名字、他的照片或他的球童，而是所有这些东西所指向的。</p><p>We can distinguish, therefore, two kinds of fulfillment. (1) The one leads through many intermediates, of different kinds, and finally reaches intuition. We might, for example, go from a name of some person to a sketch of his face to a life-sized portrait to a statue to a televised image to the person himself. Each of these stages is qualitatively different from the others, and each fulfills the previous one but still points on to the next. The final one, however, the intuition, does not point on to anything else. It is the terminus, the final evidence. Let us call this sort of chain a <em>graded</em> or <em>cumulative</em> fulfillment. Again, the final fulfillment, the intuition, has nothing magical or absolute about it; it simply does not point on to any new kind of intending. In this it differs from the intermediate stages, which do point onward. We should also notice that the final intuition of the object collects the sense of all the intermediate stages through which it has been anticipated: it is, precisely, <em>not</em> these stages — but it is their completion. Seeing Nicklaus is <em>not</em> seeing his name or his picture or his caddy, but it is what all these things were pointing toward.</p>

  <p>(2) 另一种实现链不会导致高潮。它只是<em>加法</em>，提供越来越多关于相关事物的资料。当我继续观察尼克劳斯的比赛时，我看到了越来越多的他的人和他的高尔夫技巧。随着感知的继续，还有更多，但它“更多”的方式与在分级实现中实现的接近度的质的增加不同。另一个仅仅加法实现的例子是提供越来越多的数字 15 的定义：作为 5 的三次，作为 16 减 1，作为 12 加 3，作为 225 的平方根，等等。因此，当我们达到某个特定目标的直觉时，我们的探索并没有结束。我们可能已经经历了许多引导我们形成直觉的中间演示，但目标本身现在仍有待展开。我们可以发现更多事物本身，但这种探索并不是分级实现的另一个新阶段。</p><p>(2) The other kind of fulfillment chain does not lead up to a climax. It is simply <em>additive</em>, providing more and more profiles on the thing in question. As I continued to perceive Nicklaus play, I saw more and more of his person and his golfing skill. There was more as the perception went on, but it was "more" in a different way from the qualitative increase in proximity achieved in a graded fulfillment. Another example of a merely additive fulfillment would be providing more and more definitions of the number 15: as thrice 5, as 16 minus 1, as 12 plus 3, as the square root of 225, and so on. Thus, when we reach an intuition of some particular target, our quest is not over. We may have gone through many of the intermediate presentations that led us up to our intuition, but the target itself now remains to be unfolded. We can discover more of the thing itself, but such exploration is not another new stage in graded fulfillment. It is a deepening of our understanding of what we have brought to intuitive presence.</p>

  <p>让我通过提出一个关于术语的观点来结束这种存在和不存在的处理。在本书的开头，我谈到了意向性是现象学的主要主题。我们刚刚探讨了空意和充满意向之间的区别。我们可能会倾向于认为意向性等同于空洞的意图，相当于我们对不在场的意识。这是不正确的；即使当某物在场时被给予我们，我们仍然想要它。意向性作为一个通用术语，涵盖了空洞的和充满的意向，以及意在识别对象身份的识别行为。</p><p>Let me conclude this treatment of presence and absence by making a point about terminology. At the beginning of this book I spoke about intentionality as the major theme in phenomenology. We have just explored the difference between empty and filled intendings. We might be tempted to think that intentionality is equivalent to empty intentions, to our awareness of the absent. This would not be correct; even when a thing is given to us in its presence, we still intend it. Intentionality as a generic term covers both empty and filled intentions, as well as the recognitional acts that intend the identity of the object.</p>

  <p>我们还应该注意到，本章所展开的主题逐渐丰富了意向性的概念。在第 1 章介绍时，意向性似乎微不足道且显而易见，但我们现在看到，它不仅反驳了现代思想的自我中心困境，而且还说明了我们在多种经验中识别同一性、处理不存在的事物的能力，并注册存在和不存在的身份。</p><p>We should also note that the concept of intentionality has been gradually enriched by the themes developed in this chapter. Intentionality seemed trivial and obvious when it was introduced in Chapter 1, but we now see that it not only counters the egocentric predicament of modern thought, but also accounts for our ability to recognize identities in manifolds of experience, to deal with things that are absent, and to register the identities given across presence and absence.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>我们现在已经完成了对贯穿现象学的三个结构的初步考察。每当我们希望探索一个现象学问题时，我们都应该问，在所讨论的问题中起作用的部分和整体、身份和流形以及缺席和在场的混合是什么。情感客体有一种模式，审美客体有另一种模式，数学客体、政治客体、经济客体、简单的物质客体、语言、记忆和主体间性各有各的模式。当我们在本书的其余部分进行我们自己的分析时，这三种结构通常会脱颖而出。</p><p>We have now completed our initial examination of the three structures that run through phenomenology. Whenever we wish to explore a phenomenological issue, we should ask what are the parts and wholes, the identities and the manifolds, and the blends of absences and presences that are at work in the issue in question. Emotional objects have one pattern, aesthetic objects another, and mathematical objects, political objects, economic things, simple material objects, language, memory, and intersubjectivity each have patterns of their own. The three structures will often come to the fore as we proceed with our own analyses in the rest of this book.</p>

  <p>到目前为止，我的大部分（但不是全部）评论都集中在相当简单的体验形式上，比如对立方体等物质对象的感知。从这种感知转变为更复杂的意识形式（如记忆和想象），再转变为智力，转变为我们进入语言和句法结构时、开始记录事实和交流时所拥有的那种体验是合乎逻辑的对其他人的意义。然而，在继续讨论这些主题之前，让我们暂时中断我们的进程，以便以一种初步的方式澄清我们所说的哲学分析的含义。我们应该考虑，至少在大纲上（目前），我们一直在进行的分析的性质和我们一直在工作的观点。</p><p>Most, but not all, of my remarks so far have been centered on rather simple forms of experience, on things like the perception of a material object such as a cube. It would be logical to move from such perception to more complicated forms of awareness, such as memory and imagination, and to intellection, to the kind of experience we have when we enter into language and syntactic structures, when we begin to register facts and communicate meanings to other people. However, before moving on to these topics, let us interrupt our progress for a moment in order to clarity, in an initial way, what we mean by philosophical analysis. We should consider, at least in outline (for the present), the nature of the analyses we have been carrying out and the point of view from which we have been working. We now have enough samples of philosophical analysis to allow us to convey an initial idea of how philosophy, as understood in phenomenology, differs from prephilosophical experience and speech.</p>

  <p>为了理解什么是现象学，我们必须区分我们可以采用的两种态度或观点。我们必须区分自然态度和现象学态度。当我们专注于我们最初的、面向世界的立场时，当我们意图事物、情况、事实和任何其他种类的物体时，自然态度是我们所拥有的<em>焦点</em>。我们可以说，自然的态度是默认的视角，我们开始的视角，我们最初的视角。我们不会从任何更基本的东西进入它。<em>现象学</em>态度<em></em>另一方面，当我们反思自然态度和其中发生的所有意向性时，它是我们关注的焦点。我们是在现象学的态度中进行哲学分析的。现象学态度有时也被称为<em>先验态度</em>。让我们检查一下态度或焦点，自然的和现象学的。我们可以通过对比来准确地理解每一个。</p><p>In order to understand what phenomenology is, we must make a distinction between two attitudes or perspectives that we can adopt. We must distinguish between the natural attitude and the phenomenological attitude. The <em>natural attitude</em> is the focus we have when we are involved in our original, world-directed stance, when we intend things, situations, facts, and any other kinds of objects. The natural attitude is, we might say, the default perspective, the one we start off from, the one we are in originally. We do not move into it from anything more basic. The <em>phenomenological attitude</em>, on the other hand, is the focus we have when we reflect upon the natural attitude and all the intentionalities that occur within it. It is within the phenomenological attitude that we carry out philosophical analyses. The phenomenological attitude is also sometimes called the <em>transcendental attitude</em>. Let us examine both attitudes or focuses, the natural and the phenomenological. We can understand each precisely in its contrast with the other.</p>

  <p>在我们平常的生活中，我们直接被世界上的各种事物所吸引。当我们坐在餐桌旁与他人交谈时，当我们步行去上班时，或者当我们填写护照或驾照申请表时，我们都会看到呈现在我们面前的物质对象，我们通过侧面、方面、以及它们被赋予的概况，我们谈论和表达它们，我们对有吸引力或令人厌恶的事物有情绪反应，我们发现一些事物看起来或听起来愉快，而另一些事物则令人不愉快和破坏性，等等。有些东西对我们来说是存在的，有些东西是不存在的，我们克服了一些不存在并使它们存在，但我们也让其他东西从存在中消失到不存在中。我们识别并认出一件事又一件事：我们房间里的椅子和图片，外面鸟儿在歌唱，汽车在街上开过，风吹过树林。此外，除了这些实体之外，世界还包含三角形和正方形、闭集和开集、有理数和无理数等数学实体。此类数学事物需要一种特殊的意向性，但它们仍将自己呈现为嵌套在世界中，即使它们以不同于树木和卡车的方式存在。还有政治宪法、法律、合同、国际协定、选举、慷慨和勇气的行为，以及仇恨和懦弱的行为。所有这些东西都可以在我们生活的世界中被识别出来；所有这些事物的身份都与我们的意图相关。风吹过树林。此外，除了这些实体之外，世界还包含三角形和正方形、闭集和开集、有理数和无理数等数学实体。此类数学事物需要一种特殊的意向性，但它们仍将自己呈现为嵌套在世界中，即使它们以不同于树木和卡车的方式存在。还有政治宪法、法律、合同、国际协定、选举、慷慨和勇气的行为，以及仇恨和懦弱的行为。所有这些东西都可以在我们生活的世界中被识别出来；所有这些事物的身份都与我们的意图相关。风吹过树林。此外，除了这些实体之外，世界还包含三角形和正方形、闭集和开集、有理数和无理数等数学实体。此类数学事物需要一种特殊的意向性，但它们仍将自己呈现为嵌套在世界中，即使它们以不同于树木和卡车的方式存在。还有政治宪法、法律、合同、国际协定、选举、慷慨和勇气的行为，以及仇恨和懦弱的行为。所有这些东西都可以在我们生活的世界中被识别出来；所有这些事物的身份都与我们的意图相关。世界还包含数学实体，例如三角形和正方形、闭集和开集、有理数和无理数。此类数学事物需要一种特殊的意向性，但它们仍将自己呈现为嵌套在世界中，即使它们以不同于树木和卡车的方式存在。还有政治宪法、法律、合同、国际协定、选举、慷慨和勇气的行为，以及仇恨和懦弱的行为。所有这些东西都可以在我们生活的世界中被识别出来；所有这些事物的身份都与我们的意图相关。世界还包含数学实体，例如三角形和正方形、闭集和开集、有理数和无理数。此类数学事物需要一种特殊的意向性，但它们仍将自己呈现为嵌套在世界中，即使它们以不同于树木和卡车的方式存在。还有政治宪法、法律、合同、国际协定、选举、慷慨和勇气的行为，以及仇恨和懦弱的行为。所有这些东西都可以在我们生活的世界中被识别出来；所有这些事物的身份都与我们的意图相关。尽管它们以不同于树木和卡车的方式存在。还有政治宪法、法律、合同、国际协定、选举、慷慨和勇气的行为，以及仇恨和懦弱的行为。所有这些东西都可以在我们生活的世界中被识别出来；所有这些事物的身份都与我们的意图相关。尽管它们以不同于树木和卡车的方式存在。还有政治宪法、法律、合同、国际协定、选举、慷慨和勇气的行为，以及仇恨和懦弱的行为。所有这些东西都可以在我们生活的世界中被识别出来；所有这些事物的身份都与我们的意图相关。</p><p>In our ordinary living, we are directly caught up with the various things in the world. As we sit conversing with others at the dinner table, as we walk to work, or as we fill out an application for a passport or for a driver's license, we have material objects presented to us, we identify them through the sides, aspects, and profiles through which they are given, we speak about and articulate them, we have emotional responses to things that are attractive or repellent, we find some things pleasant to look at or hear and others unpleasant and disruptive, and so on. Some things are present to us and other things are absent, we overcome some of the absences and bring things to presence, but we also let other things go out of presence into absences. We identify and recognize one thing after another: the chairs and pictures in our room, the birds singing outside, the car going by down the street, the wind blowing through the trees. Furthermore, in addition to such substantial things, the world also contains mathematical entities such as triangles and squares, closed and open sets, rational and irrational numbers. Such mathematical things require a special kind of intentionality, but they still present themselves as nested within the world, even though they exist in a manner different from trees and trucks. There are also political constitutions, laws, contracts, international agreements, elections, acts of generosity and courage, as well as acts of hatred and cowardice. All such things can be identified within the world in which we live; all such things in their identities are correlated with our intendings.</p>

  <p>此外，我们的世界不仅仅包含我们直接体验过的事物。我们还空洞地意向许多我们认为是真实的事物，即使我们从未经历过它们。我从未去过中国，但有时我确实会去看看中国，它的山川、它的外交和国内政策、它的经济状况。巴西、南极洲和格陵兰也是如此。如果我要去南极洲，我会实现我的许多空洞的意图，有些以令人惊讶的方式，有些则以不足为奇的方式。我们生活的世界超越了我们的直接体验和可能的体验：我们还感知到天堂中的一个我们永远无法到达的领域。我们可能会到达月球或某些行星，但我们不可能到达宇宙最远的地方。</p><p>Moreover, our world does not contain only the things that we have directly experienced. We also intend, emptily, many things that we take to be real even though we have never experienced them. I have never been to China, but from time to time I do intend China, its mountains and rivers, its foreign and domestic policy, its economic condition. The same is true of Brazil, Antarctica, and Greenland. If I were to visit Antarctica I would fulfill many of my empty intentions, some in surprising and others in unsurprising ways. The world we live in expands beyond our immediate experience and beyond our possible experience: we also perceive a domain in the heavens that we could never reach bodily. We might get to the moon or some of the planets, but it is impossible for us to reach to the farthest parts of the universe. We can learn a lot about those places, but much of it will always remain the target of empty intentions rather than fulfillments or perceptions.</p>

  <p>所以世界上有很多东西，都以不同的方式呈现。还有<em>世界</em>本身，它以不同的方式给出。世界不是一个大的“物”，也不是已经经历过或可以经历的事物的总和。世界不是漂浮在太空中的球体，也不是运动物体的集合。世界更像是一个语境、一个背景、一个背景，或者是所有事物的地平线，所有可以被意图和给予我们的事物；世界不是与他们竞争的另一件事。它是他们所有人的整体，而不是他们所有人的总和，它是作为一种特殊的身份赋予我们的。我们永远不可能将世界作为许多项目中的一个项目给予我们，甚至也不可能作为一个项目：它只是作为包含所有项目的给予。它包含一切，但不像任何世俗的容器。“世界”一词是<em>单数</em>; 只能是其中之一。可能有很多星系，可能有很多有意识生命的家园星球（虽然我们只有一个），但只有一个世界。“世界”不是一个天文概念；这是一个与我们直接经验相关的概念。世界是我们自己和我们经历的所有事物的终极背景。世界是经验的具体和实际的整体。</p><p>So there are many things in the world, all given in different manners of presentation. There is also <em>the world</em> itself, which is given in still a different way. The world is not a large "thing", nor is it the sum of the things that have been or can be experienced. The world is not like a sphere floating in space, nor is it a collection of moving objects. The world is more like a context, a setting, a background, or a horizon for all the things there are, all the things that can be intended and given to us; the world is not another thing competing with them. It is the whole for them all, not the sum of them all, and it is given to us as a special kind of identity. We could never have the world given to us as one item among many, nor even as a single item: it is given only as encompassing all the items. It contains everything, but not like any worldly container. The term "world" is a <em>singulare tantum</em>; there could only be one of them. There may be many galaxies, there may be many home planets for conscious beings (although there is only one for us), but there is only one world. "The world" is not an astronomical concept; it is a concept related to our immediate experience. The world is the ultimate setting for ourselves and for all the things we experience. The world is the concrete and actual whole for experience.</p>

  <p>我们自发体验中的另一个重要的奇点是自我<em>，</em>自我<em>，</em>我。如果世界是最广阔的整体和最包容的环境，那么我就是这个中心，这个最广阔的整体及其中的所有事物都围绕着它排列. 矛盾的是，我是世界上的一个东西，但它是一个与众不同的东西：它是一个世界上的东西，在认知上也<em>有</em>世界，整个世界及其中的所有事物向其显现的事物。I 是表现的与格。它是可以给予世界和其中所有事物的实体，是可以在知识中接受世界的人。当然，有许多“我”、许多自我、许多自我，但即使在所有这些之中，也有一个作为卓越的中心脱颖而出，即我（也就是你，当你阅读这些文字并自己思考它们时）。这些关于自我或自我的奇怪事实不仅仅是语言的把戏，不仅仅是第一人称和第二人称单数的特殊性；他们属于理性生物的那种，会思考，会说“我”，能拥有世界，同时又是世界的一部分。正如亚里士多德所说，理性的灵魂在某种程度上是万物。作为一个整体的世界和作为中心的我是两个奇点，所有其他事物都可以放置在它们之间。世界和我以一种不同于特定意向性与它所意向的事物相关联的方式相互关联。世界和自我为一切事物提供了终极的双重、椭圆形背景。</p><p>Another important singularity in our spontaneous experience is the <em>self</em>, the <em>ego</em>, the I. If the world is the widest whole and the most encompassing context, the I is the center around which this widest whole, with all the things in it, is arranged. Paradoxically, the I is a thing in the world, but it is a thing like no other: it is a thing in the world that also cognitively <em>has</em> the world, the thing to whom the world as a whole, with all the things in it, manifests itself. The I is the dative of manifestation. It is the entity to whom the world and all the things in it can be given, the one who can receive the world in knowledge. Of course, there are many I's, many egos, many selves, but even among all of them one stands out as the preeminent center, namely me (that is, you, as you read these words and think them through for yourself). These strange facts about the self or the ego are not just tricks of language, not just peculiarities of the first and second person singular; they belong to the kind of being a rational creature is, a creature that can think, that can say "I", and that can have the world even while being a part of the world. The rational soul, as Aristotle says, is somehow all things. The world as a whole and the I as the center are the two singularities between which all other things can be placed. The world and the I are correlated with one another in a way different from the manner in which a particular intentionality is correlated with the thing that it intends. The world and the ego provide an ultimate dual, elliptical context for everything.</p>

  <p>所有这些结构元素都属于我们从一开始就始终处于的自然态度。在我们继续讨论现象学态度之前，我们还必须检查自然态度中的一项。我们必须检视贯穿自然态度的那种信念。</p><p>All these structural elements belong to the natural attitude in which we find ourselves from the start and always. There is still one more item in the natural attitude that we must examine before we move on to discuss the phenomenological attitude. We must examine the kind of conviction that pervades the natural attitude.</p>

  <p>我们接受世界上的事物以及世界本身的方式是一种<em>信仰</em>。当我们体验其他人、树木、建筑物、猫、石头、太阳和星星时，我们体验到它们就在那里，真实，真实。基本特征，即我们接受世界和其中事物的默认模式，是一种信念，或者用希腊语术语<em>doxa</em>. 我们的信念与事物的存在相关联，事物的存在首先也是最重要的是被简单地接受。随着时间的流逝，我们变得越来越老，越来越聪明，我们将模式引入我们的信念中；在发现我们在某些情况下犯了错误之后，我们逐渐引入幻觉、错误、欺骗或“仅仅是”表象的维度。我们逐渐知道，事情并不总是像看起来那样；存在与表象之间的区别开始发挥作用，但这种区别只是偶尔出现，而且需要非常复杂的方法才能实现。我们可能会发现这只“猫”只是一个玩具，或者这个人的讲话是骗人的，或者那个“人”只是一个影子，或者我们似乎看到的“玻璃”真的是冰块；然而，这种偶然的错误，不要让我们对我们所经历的一切和所说的一切产生怀疑。默认条件仍然是信念之一。然而，这种基本的信念现在与一系列可能的选择形成对比：怀疑、怀疑、拒绝、概率、可能性、否定、反驳，以及我们的意向性可以采取的所有可能的论证方式。</p><p>The manner in which we accept the things in the world, and the world itself, is one of <em>belief</em>. As we experience other people, trees, buildings, cats, stones, and the sun and stars, we experience them as being there, as true, as real. The basic character, the default mode of our acceptance of the world and things in it, is one of belief or, to use the Greek term, <em>doxa</em>. Our belief is correlated with the being of things, which first and foremost is simply accepted as such. As time goes on and we become older and more clever, we introduce modalities into our belief; after finding we were mistaken in some instances, we gradually introduce the dimensions of illusion, error, deception, or "mere" appearance. We gradually come to know that things are not always as they seem; a distinction between being and seeming comes into play, but this distinction is exercised only episodically, and it takes great sophistication to bring it about. We may find that this "cat" is only a toy, or that this person's speech was deceptive, or that that "man" was only a shadow, or that the "glass" we seemed to see was really ice; such occasional mistakes, however, do not cause us to become suspicious about everything we experience and everything that is said. The default condition remains one of belief. However, this belief, as fundamental, is now contrasted with a whole array of possible alternatives: suspicion, doubt, rejection, probability, possibility, negation, refutation, all the possible doxic modalities that our intentionality can take on.</p>

  <p>在我们所有的信念中，最突出的是我们对整个世界的信念。这种信念，我们不仅可以称之为<em>doxa</em>，还可以称之为<em>Ur-doxa</em>（如果我们可以将德语和希腊语的术语结合起来），不仅是一种信念，而且是基本信念，它是我们所有特定信念的基础。<em>世界信仰</em>不像任何特定的信念那样受到更正或反驳。如果我们作为有意识的存在而活着，那么世界信念就会巩固我们可能行使的任何特定信念。我们从来没有真正学习或获得我们的世界信仰，也就是我们实现信仰的方式，比如说，帝国大厦或犹他州的圣胡安河。当我们体验或听到所讨论的事物时，当我们通过赋予我们的多样性（无论存在还是不存在）来承认它的身份时，所有这些特定的信念都会随之出现。但我们永远无法学习或获得我们的世界信念。在学习它之前我们的状态是什么？我们将不得不处于一种沉默和封闭的唯我论中，一种没有意识到的纯粹<em>意识</em>任何事物。这种状态是不可思议的；这需要自我将自己视为事物的中心和事物的总和，一个没有半径的枢纽。即使我们承认它的可能性，地球上（甚至地球之外）到底有什么能让我们摆脱这种状态？如果它从一开始就不存在，那么关于“外部”事物的想法怎么可能会出现呢？</p><p>Prominent among all our beliefs is the belief we have in the world as a whole. This belief, which we could call not just a <em>doxa</em> but the <em>Ur-doxa</em> (if we may combine a German and a Greek term), not just a belief but the basic belief, underlies all the specific beliefs we have. <em>World belief</em> is not subject to correction or refutation the way any particular belief is. If we are alive at all as conscious beings, world belief is there undergirding any particular conviction we may exercise. We never really learn or acquire our world belief, the way we might achieve our belief in, say, the Empire State Building or the San Juan River in Utah. All such particular beliefs arise concomitantly when we experience or hear about the thing in question, when we come to acknowledge its identity through the manifolds in which it is given to us, whether in presence or in absence. But we could never learn or acquire our world belief. What would be our state prior to learning it? We would have to be in a mute and encapsulated solipsism, a sheer awareness that was not aware <em>of</em> anything. Such a state is inconceivable; it would require that the ego think of itself as both the center of things and the sum of things, a hub without a radius. And even if we were to grant its possibility, what on earth (or even outside the earth) could jar us out of such a state? How could the very idea of something "outside" ever arise if it were not there from the beginning?</p>

  <p>我们不能从以自我为中心的困境开始；我们的世界信念从一开始就存在，甚至在我们出生之前，一直到我们走到哪里。除非基于世界信念，否则即使是我们最基本的自我意识也无法产生。同样，即使我们发现自己在很多事情上都错了，我们的世界信念仍然没有动摇，世界仍然存在，无论多么破烂和破烂，除非我们完全失去了自我意识，陷入了一种自闭症隔离; 但即使在那里，如果有意识的话，肯定会留下一些感觉。自闭症中必然存在的痛苦之所以存在，正是因为世界信念仍在起作用；否则，根本就没有觉知，也没有自我意识。</p><p>We cannot start off in the egocentric predicament; our world belief is there from the start, even before we are born, as far back as we go. Even our most rudimentary sense of self could not arise except on the basis of world belief. Similarly, even if we discover that we were wrong about very many things, our world belief remains untouched and the world is still there, no matter how ragged and tattered, unless perhaps we lost our sense of self entirely and fell into a kind of autistic isolation; but even there, some sense of what there is would surely remain, if there is awareness at all. The suffering that must exist in autism is there precisely because the world belief is still at work; if it were not, there would be no awareness at all and no sense of self.</p>

  <p>由于我们生活在既拥有世界又是世界的一部分的矛盾状态中，我们知道当我们死后世界仍将继续，因为我们只是世界的一部分，但从另一种意义上说，世界是对我来说，在我所知道的所有事物背后，当我不再是其中的一部分时，它们就会消失。这种灭绝是我们在亲密朋友去世时遭受的损失的一部分；不仅仅是他不在了，而且世界对他来说也已经失去了。世界已经失去了一种被给予的方式，一种在一生中建立起来的方式。</p><p>Since we live in the paradoxical condition of both having the world and yet being part of it, we know that when we die the world will still go on, since we are only a part of the world, but in another sense the world that is there for me, behind all the things I know, will be extinguished when I am no longer part of it. Such an extinction is part of the loss we suffer when a close friend dies; it is not just that he is no longer there, but the way the world was for him has also been lost for us. The world has lost a way of being given, one that had been built up over a lifetime.</p>

  <p>世界和自我都援引了整体的观念。集合论的悖论，即终极集合是否包含自身的问题，比世界和自我的逻辑问题更容易：这些整体，世界和自我，如何相互包含或排除，它们的总和与存在的事物的总和有何关系？集合论的悖论可能只是以下问题的形式化版本：世界如何包含一切，包括自我，以及自我如何意向万物，包括世界和自身。</p><p>Both the world and the self invoke the idea of a whole. The paradoxes of set theory, the problem of whether the ultimate set includes itself or not, are less difficult than the problems of the logic of the world and the self: How do these wholes, the world and the self, include or exclude one another, and how are their totalities related to the sum of the things that exist? It may be the case that the paradoxes of set theory are only formalized versions of the problems of how the world contains everything, including the self, and how the self can intend all things, including the world and also itself.</p>

  <p>总而言之，在自发的、自然的态度中，我们被指向各种事物，但我们也被指向世界，作为所有可以给予的事物的地平线或背景，与世界相关的是自我或自我，自然态度的代理人，世界及其事物被赋予的人，既是世界的一部分又是有意识地拥有它的人。</p><p>In conclusion, then, in the spontaneous, natural attitude we are directed toward all sorts of things, but we are also directed toward the world as the horizon or context for all the things that can be given, and correlative to the world is the self or the ego, the agent of the natural attitude, the one to whom the world and its things are given, who is both part of the world and yet in intentional possession of it.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_4.xhtml.heading_id_4"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_4.xhtml.ch4_pa"></a>现象学的态度</h2><h2><a></a>THE PHENOMENOLOGICAL ATTITUDE</h2>

  <p>读者一定已经注意到，这里所说的关于自然态度的一切都不可能是从自然态度内部陈述的。就是说，我们不加注意，一直从现象学的态度来考虑这些问题；在过去的几页中，我们一直在这样做，事实上，几乎在整本书中，除了导言，它必须从自然的态度中写出来。当我们在第 1 章考虑意向性和在第 2 章感知立方体时，我们是从现象学的角度考虑这些主题的。</p><p>The reader must have noticed that everything that has been said here about the natural attitude could not have been stated from within the natural attitude. That is, without having drawn attention to it, we have been considering these matters all along from within the phenomenological attitude; we have been doing so in the past several pages and, indeed, practically throughout this entire book, with the exception of the introduction, which had to be written from within the natural attitude. When we considered intentionality in Chapter 1, and perceiving a cube in Chapter 2, we considered these subjects from the phenomenological viewpoint.</p>

  <p>即使在自然的态度中，也有许多不同的观点和态度。有日常生活的观点，有数学家的观点、医学专家的观点、物理学家的观点、政治家的观点等等，甚至还有几种特殊的反思态度，正如我们将要看到的。但是现象学的态度与这些中的任何一个都不一样。它更加激进和全面。观点和焦点的所有其他转变都受到我们潜在的世界信念的缓冲，这种信念始终有效，并且所有转变都将自己定义为从一种观点转变为另一种观点，其中许多观点对我们开放。然而，向现象学态度的转变是一种“全有或全无”的转变，它完全脱离了自然态度，并以反思的方式关注，对一切事物的自然态度，包括潜在的世界信念。在进入现象学态度时，我们以一种独特的方式“被推上楼”。进入现象学的态度并不是要成为一种或另一种知识形式的专家，而是要成为哲学家。从现象学的角度，我们以分析的方式看待和描述所有特定的意向性及其关联物，以及世界信念，并将世界作为其关联物。</p><p>There are many different viewpoints and attitudes even within the natural attitude. There is the viewpoint of ordinary life, there is the viewpoint of the mathematician, that of the medical specialist, the physicist, the politician, and so on, and there are even several special kinds of reflective attitudes, as we shall see. But the phenomenological attitude is not like any of these. It is more radical and comprehensive. All the other shifts in viewpoint and focus remain cushioned by our underlying world belief, which always remains in force, and all the shifts define themselves as moving from one viewpoint into another among the many that are open to us. The shift into the phenomenological attitude, however, is an "all or nothing" kind of move that disengages completely from the natural attitude and focuses, in a reflective way, on everything in the natural attitude, including the underlying world belief. In moving into the phenomenological attitude we get "nudged upstairs" in a way that is unique. To move into the phenomenological attitude is not to become a specialist in one form of knowledge or another, but to become a philosopher. From the phenomenological viewpoint we look at and describe, analytically, all the particular intentionalities and their correlates, and world belief as well, with the world as its correlative.</p>

  <p>如果我们要对自然态度中的任何和所有意向性进行描述性分析，我们就不能分享其中任何一个。我们必须与它们保持距离，进行反思，并使它们成为主题。这意味着当我们处于现象学态度时，我们暂停了我们正在研究的所有意向性。我们中和他们。然而，这种焦点的改变最强调并不意味着我们开始怀疑这些意向性和它们所拥有的对象；我们不会将它们从信念保证变为怀疑。我们不会改变我们的意图，我们保持它们的本来面目，但我们会思考它们。如果我们沉思它们，那一刻我们就不会运用它们。然而，如果我们要将它们从一种形态改变为另一种形态，我们将无法思考它们的本质；如果我们进入哲学反思意味着我们改变，比方说，我们的信念变成了怀疑，或者我们的确定变成了怀疑，那么我们就无法思考信念或确定性。从一种形态到另一种形态的变化发生在自然态度内。他们必须有动力。我们必须有理由从确信到怀疑，从确定到怀疑；如果没有这些理由，我们方式的改变将是不合理和武断的。</p><p>If we are to give a descriptive analysis of any and all of the intentionalities in the natural attitude, we cannot share in any of them. We must take a distance to, reflect upon, and make thematic any and all of them. This means that while we are in the phenomenological attitude, we suspend all the intentionalities that we are examining. We neutralize them. This change of focus most emphatically does not mean, however, that we begin to doubt these intentionalities and the objects they have; we do not change them from, say, doxic assurance to doubt. We do not change our intentionalities, we keep them as they are, but we contemplate them. If we contemplate them, we do not exercise them at that moment. However, we would not be able to contemplate them for what they are if we were to change them from one modality to another; if our move into philosophical reflection meant that we changed, say, our conviction into doubt, or our certainty into suspicion, then we could not contemplate conviction or certainty. Changes from one modality to another take place within the natural attitude. They have to be motivated. We have to have reasons to move from conviction to doubt, from certainty to suspicion; without such reasons, the change in our modality would be irrational and arbitrary.</p>

  <p>当我们进入现象学的态度时，我们就变成了过往场景的超然观察者或比赛的旁观者。我们成为旁观者。我们思考我们与世界和其中事物的关系，我们思考世界与人类的关系。我们不再只是世界的参与者；我们考虑成为世界和表现形式的参与者是什么。但是我们所考虑的意图——我们检查和描述的信念、怀疑、怀疑、确定性和感知——仍然是我们的意图。我们没有失去他们；我们只考虑他们。它们保持原样，它们的对象也保持原样，意图和对象之间的相关性仍然有效。以一种非常奇怪的方式，我们将它们全部暂停，我们将它们“冻结”到位。成为哲学家的我们也是行使自然意向性的自我。一种自我的增强发生了，在这种自我中，生活在自然态度中的同一个自我开始明确地生活在现象学态度中，并开始进行哲学生活。</p><p>When we move into the phenomenological attitude, we become something like detached observers of the passing scene or like spectators at a game. We become onlookers. We contemplate the involvements we have with the world and with things in it, and we contemplate the world in its human involvement. We are no longer simply participants in the world; we contemplate what it is to be a participant in the world and in manifestations. But the intentionalities that we contemplate — the convictions, doubts, suspicions, certainties, and perceptions that we examine and describe — are still our intentions. We have not lost them; we only contemplate them. They remain exactly as they were, and their objects remain exactly as they were, with the same correlations between intentions and objects still in force. In a very curious way, we suspend them all just as they are, we "freeze" them in place. And we who become philosophical are also the same selves who exercise natural intentionalities. A kind of enhancement of the self occurs, in which the same self that lived in the natural attitude begins to live explicitly in the phenomenological attitude and begins to carry on the philosophical life.</p>

  <p>所有的人，所有的自己，都会不时地进行这种反思性的哲学分析，但是当大多数人进入这种生活时，他们通常对自己在做什么感到很困惑。他们认为他们只是瞥见了某种普遍真理，某种自然法则。他们倾向于将转向哲学视为对自然态度的又一次调整；他们看不出有什么不同。我们讨论现象学态度的要点是帮助我们明确而清晰地转向哲学，更充分地理解自然态度和哲学态度之间的差异。我们做出了明确的区分，而大多数人在边界之间来回徘徊。</p><p>All human beings, all selves, do this sort of reflective philosophical analysis from time to time, but when most people enter into this kind of life they usually are very confused about what they are doing. They think they are just getting glimpses of some sort of general truths, some sort of laws of nature. They tend to take the move into philosophy as one more adjustment in the natural attitude; they do not see how different it is. The point of our discussion about the phenomenological attitude is to help us to make the shift into philosophy explicitly and clearly, with a fuller appreciation of the difference between the natural and the philosophical attitudes. We make a definite distinction, whereas most people wander unclearly back and forth across the border.</p>

  <p>向现象学态度的转向被称为<em>现象学还原</em>，这个术语表示从我们关注的自然目标“引开”，“回到”似乎更受限制的观点，一个只针对意向性本身的观点。Reduction 的拉丁词根是<em>re-ducere</em>，是前导、扣留或撤回。当我们进入这个新观点时，我们<em>暂停了</em>我们现在思考的意向性。这种暂停，这种对我们的 doxic 模态的中和，也被称为<em>epochē</em>，这个词取自希腊怀疑主义，表示怀疑论者认为我们对事物的判断应该有的克制；他们说我们应该在证据明确之前不要做出判断。尽管现象学从希腊的怀疑主义中使用了这个术语，但这个术语的怀疑色彩并没有保留下来。现象学中的epochē只是对自然意图的中和，当我们思考这些意图时，这些自然意图必然会发生<em>。</em></p><p>The turn to the phenomenological attitude is called the <em>phenomenological reduction</em>, a term that signifies the "leading away" from the natural targets of our concern, "back" to what seems to be a more restricted viewpoint, one that simply targets the intentionalities themselves. Reduction, with the Latin root <em>re-ducere</em>, is a leading back, a withholding or a withdrawal. When we enter into this new viewpoint, we <em>suspend</em> the intentionalities we now contemplate. This suspension, this neutralization of our doxic modalities, is also called the <em>epochē</em>, a term taken from Greek skepticism, where it signifies the restraint the Skeptics said we should have toward our judgments about things; they said we should refrain from judging until the evidence is clear. Although phenomenology takes this term from Greek skepticism, the skeptical overtone of the term is not kept. The <em>epochē</em> in phenomenology is simply the neutralizing of natural intentions that must occur when we contemplate those intentions.</p>

  <p>最后，为了完成对术语的简短处理，让我们谈谈术语<em>包围</em>。当我们进入现象学的态度时，我们暂停了我们的信念，我们<em>将</em>世界和世界上的所有事物。我们把世界和其中的事物“放入括号”或“放入圆括号”。当我们如此将世界或某个特定对象括起来时，我们并没有把它变成一种纯粹的表象、一种幻觉、一种纯粹的想法，或任何其他类型的纯粹主观印象。相反，我们现在恰如其分地考虑自然态度中意向性的意图。我们认为它与任何针对它的意向性相关。如果它是一个被感知的对象，我们就以被感知的方式检查它；如果它是一个被记住的对象，我们现在检查它是否被记住；如果它是一个数学实体，我们认为它与数学意图相关；如果它只是一个可能的对象，或者是一个经过验证的对象，我们将其视为意向性的对象，该意向性仅意向可能的事物，或意图验证某事的意向性。包围式恰好保留了对象在自然姿态下对主体的表现形式和表现方式。</p><p>Finally, to complete this brief treatment of terminology, let us speak of the term <em>bracketing</em>. When we enter into the phenomenological attitude, we suspend our beliefs, and we <em>bracket</em> the world and all the things in the world. We put the world and the things in it "into brackets" or "into parentheses". When we so bracket the world or some particular object, we do not turn it into a mere appearance, an illusion, a mere idea, or any other sort of merely subjective impression. Rather, we now consider it precisely as it is intended by an intentionality in the natural attitude. We consider it as correlated with whatever intentionality targets it. If it is a perceived object, we examine it as perceived; if it is a remembered object, we now examine it as remembered; if it is a mathematical entity, we consider it as correlated with a mathematical intention; if it is a merely possible object, or a verified one, we consider it as the object for an intentionality that intends something only possible, or an intentionality that intends something verified. Bracketing retains exactly the modality and the mode of manifestation that the object has for the subject in the natural attitude.</p>

  <p>因此，当我们进入现象学反思时，我们不会将注意力仅仅局限于意识的主观方面；我们不仅仅关注意图。我们也关注给予我们的对象，但我们关注的是它们以我们自然的态度出现在我们面前。在自然的态度中，我们直接朝向目标；我们直接通过对象的外观到对象本身。从哲学反思的立场出发，我们使表象成为主题。我们看<em>我们</em>通常看的<em>东西</em>. 例如，我们关注立方体通过其将自身呈现为身份的侧面、方面和轮廓。我们关注对象通过其呈现给我们的多种表象。然而，当我们这样做时，我们并没有将客体的同一性变成“纯粹”的表象之一；恰恰相反，我们能够更好地将物体与其外观区分开来，我们能够更好地保存事物本身的真实性。我们也能够更好地对“世界”的本质进行适当的描述。如果我们试图从自然的态度来谈论世界，我们往往会把它当作一个大实体或所有实体的总和。只有从现象学的角度，我们才能得到正确的术语来谈论世界作为事物表现的背景。</p><p>Thus, when we enter into phenomenological reflection, we do not restrict our focus just to the subjective side of consciousness; we do not focus only on the intentionalities. We also focus on the objects that are given to us, but we focus on them as appearing to us in our natural attitude. In the natural attitude we head directly toward the object; we go right through the object's appearances to the object itself. From the philosophically reflective stance, we make the appearances thematic. We look <em>at</em> what we normally look <em>through</em>. We focus, for example, on the sides, aspects, and profiles through which the cube presents itself as an identity. We focus on the manifold of appearances through which the object is given to us. When we do so, however, we do not turn the identity of the object into one of the "mere" appearances; quite on the contrary, we are better able to distinguish the object from its appearances, we are better able to preserve the reality of the thing itself. We are also better able to provide an appropriate description of the nature of "the world". If we were to try to speak about the world from the natural attitude, we would tend to take it as a large entity or as the sum of all entities. Only from the phenomenological perspective can we get the right terminology to speak about the world as the context for the manifestation of things.</p>

  <p>用一个有点粗略的空间隐喻，当我们进入现象学态度时，我们就从自然态度中爬出来，超越它，将它理论化，区分和描述构成它的主观和客观关联。从我们的哲学立场出发，我们描述了各种意向性及其各种对象，以及自我和世界。我们区分事物和它的表象，海德格尔称之为“本体论差异”的区别，即事物与事物的在场（或缺席）之间的差异。只有从现象学的角度才能恰当地作出这种区分。如果我们试图从自然的角度来区分事物和现象，要么我们倾向于实体化现象，要么 因为从那个角度来看，我们倾向于将我们关注的一切都视为实质性的事物，或者我们倾向于将事物简化为它的外观，成为其外观的总和。我们很可能要么将表象作为我们与事物之间的障碍，要么将事物变成纯粹的想法。我们不会正确地理解现象学的态度，我们也不会正确地理解自然的态度。</p><p>To use a somewhat crude spatial metaphor, when we enter into the phenomenological attitude, we crawl out of the natural attitude, rise above it, theorize it, and distinguish and describe both the subjective and the objective correlates that make it up. From our philosophical perch, we describe the various intentionalities and their various objects, as well as the self and the world. We distinguish between a thing and its appearances, a distinction that has been called by Heidegger the "ontological difference", the difference between a thing and the presencing (or absencing) of the thing. This distinction can be properly made only from the phenomenological perspective. If we try to make the distinction between thing and appearance from within the natural standpoint, either we will tend to substantialize appearances, because in that standpoint we tend to take everything we focus on as a substantial thing, or we will tend to reduce the thing just to its appearances, to being the sum of its appearances. We will be likely either to posit appearances as barriers between us and things, or to make things into mere ideas. We will not get the phenomenological attitude right, and we will not properly understand the natural attitude either.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_4.xhtml.heading_id_5"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_4.xhtml.ch4_alpa"></a>是否有论据可以引导我们进入现象学的态度？</h2><h2><a></a>ARE THERE ARGUMENTS THAT CAN LEAD US INTO THE PHENOMENOLOGICAL ATTITUDE?</h2>

  <p>既然我们对自然态度和现象学态度之间的区别有了一些了解，我们就可以提出一个问题，即是否有某种方式可以向其他人解释和证明第一种态度和第二种态度之间的转变。这个问题相当于问是否有某种论证可以说服别人成为哲学家，或者向他证明他应该这样做。这个问题不是微不足道的。它询问哲学是否可以在非哲学家面前自我介绍、解释它是什么并使自己合法化。它还追问哲学是否可以为自己辩护，是否可以澄清自己的起源，从而试图成为一门没有预设的科学。</p><p>Now that we have some sense of the difference between the natural and the phenomenological attitude, we can raise the question of whether there is some way to explain and justify, to other people, the shift between the first and the second. This question amounts to asking whether there is some sort of argument that can persuade someone else to become philosophical, or prove to him that he should do so. The question is not trivial; it asks whether philosophy can introduce itself, explain what it is, and legitimate itself before those who are not philosophers. It also asks whether philosophy can justify itself to itself, whether it can clarify its own origins and thus attempt to be a science without presuppositions.</p>

  <p>哲学开端的问题在现象学中以各种还原<em>方式</em>的标题提出。我们被赋予了各种“方式”或论证来帮助我们实现现象学的“还原”。正如我们所见，现象学还原是从自然态度到现象学态度的转变；它限制了我们的意向性，从它以世界上任何事物为目标的广泛的自然态度，到以我们自己的意向生活及其相关对象和世界为目标的明显更加局限的现象学态度。</p><p>The issue of the beginning of philosophy is raised in phenomenology under the rubric of the various <em>ways to reduction</em>. We are given various "ways" or arguments to help us attain the phenomenological "reduction". As we have seen, the phenomenological reduction is the move from the natural attitude to the phenomenological; it is the restriction of our intentionality from its expansive natural attitude, which targets any and all things in the world, to the apparently more confined phenomenological attitude, which targets our own intentional Iife, with its correlated objects and world.</p>

  <p>我们必须小心，不要让我们的任务变得比它需要的更困难。我们可能会倾向于认为自然态度是纯粹自然的，纯粹非哲学的，其中没有一丝哲学，而转向现象学是一种在自然焦点中完全闻所未闻的转变。如果真是这样，我们似乎几乎不可能向那些尚未进入哲学领域的人传达什么是哲学的概念。但实际上，自然中蕴含着哲学态度的预示。自然态度中有对哲学的伪足。作为理性的存在，我们已经有了整体感、自我感、意向性和表象感。然而，问题在于我们试图用属于自然态度的范畴来处理所有这些事情。我们神话，将它们心理化、现象化或实体化；我们把世界变成了一个东西，外表变成了障碍，自我被实体化，意图被心理学化。我们没有正确理解术语和区别。减少的方法并不试图开辟一个全新的和意想不到的维度；相反，他们试图澄清我们已经拥有的自然和哲学之间的区别，并且他们试图解释这两种态度之间的转变。它们通过展示我们进入哲学时发生的视角变化，以及我们必须遵循的术语含义的转变，帮助我们获得正确的哲学立场。我们将考虑两种还原方法，本体论的和笛卡尔的。这是胡塞尔开发的两种方法。我们把世界变成了一个东西，外表变成了障碍，自我被实体化，意图被心理学化。我们没有正确理解术语和区别。减少的方法并不试图开辟一个全新的和意想不到的维度；相反，他们试图澄清我们已经拥有的自然和哲学之间的区别，并且他们试图解释这两种态度之间的转变。它们通过展示我们进入哲学时发生的视角变化，以及我们必须遵循的术语含义的转变，帮助我们获得正确的哲学立场。我们将考虑两种还原方法，本体论的和笛卡尔的。这是胡塞尔开发的两种方法。我们把世界变成了一个东西，外表变成了障碍，自我被实体化，意图被心理学化。我们没有正确理解术语和区别。减少的方法并不试图开辟一个全新的和意想不到的维度；相反，他们试图澄清我们已经拥有的自然和哲学之间的区别，并且他们试图解释这两种态度之间的转变。它们通过展示我们进入哲学时发生的视角变化，以及我们必须遵循的术语含义的转变，帮助我们获得正确的哲学立场。我们将考虑两种还原方法，本体论的和笛卡尔的。这是胡塞尔开发的两种方法。意图是心理化的。我们没有正确理解术语和区别。减少的方法并不试图开辟一个全新的和意想不到的维度；相反，他们试图澄清我们已经拥有的自然和哲学之间的区别，并且他们试图解释这两种态度之间的转变。它们通过展示我们进入哲学时发生的视角变化，以及我们必须遵循的术语含义的转变，帮助我们获得正确的哲学立场。我们将考虑两种还原方法，本体论的和笛卡尔的。这是胡塞尔开发的两种方法。意图是心理化的。我们没有正确理解术语和区别。减少的方法并不试图开辟一个全新的和意想不到的维度；相反，他们试图澄清我们已经拥有的自然和哲学之间的区别，并且他们试图解释这两种态度之间的转变。它们通过展示我们进入哲学时发生的视角变化，以及我们必须遵循的术语含义的转变，帮助我们获得正确的哲学立场。我们将考虑两种还原方法，本体论的和笛卡尔的。这是胡塞尔开发的两种方法。他们试图澄清我们已经拥有的自然和哲学之间的区别，他们试图解释这两种态度之间的转变。它们通过展示我们进入哲学时发生的视角变化，以及我们必须遵循的术语含义的转变，帮助我们获得正确的哲学立场。我们将考虑两种还原方法，本体论的和笛卡尔的。这是胡塞尔开发的两种方法。他们试图澄清我们已经拥有的自然和哲学之间的区别，他们试图解释这两种态度之间的转变。它们通过展示我们进入哲学时发生的视角变化，以及我们必须遵循的术语含义的转变，帮助我们获得正确的哲学立场。我们将考虑两种还原方法，本体论的和笛卡尔的。这是胡塞尔开发的两种方法。本体论和笛卡尔。这是胡塞尔开发的两种方法。本体论和笛卡尔。这是胡塞尔开发的两种方法。</p><p>We must be careful not to make our task more difficult than it needs to be. We might be tempted to think that the natural attitude is purely natural, purely nonphilosophical, without a shred of philosophy in it, and that the turn to phenomenology is a move into something totally unheard of in the natural focus. If this were the case, it would seem almost impossible for us to convey an idea of what philosophy is to those who have not yet entered it. But in fact, there are anticipations of the philosophical attitude within the natural. There are pseudopods toward philosophy in the natural attitude. Simply as rational beings, we already have a sense of the whole, a sense of self, a sense of intentionality and appearance. However, the trouble is that we try to handle all these things with categories that belong to the natural attitude. We mythologize, psychologize, phenomenalize, or substantialize them; we make the world a thing, appearances become barriers, the self is substantialized, intentions are psychologized. We do not get the terms and distinctions right. The ways to reduction do not try to open up an absolutely new and unanticipated dimension; rather, they try to clarify a distinction that we already possess, between the natural and the philosophical, and they try to explain the transition between the two attitudes. They help us to get the philosophical stance right by showing the change in perspective that occurs when we move into philosophy, and the shift in the meanings of our terms that must follow. We will consider two ways to reduction, the ontological and the Cartesian. These are two approaches that were developed by Husserl.</p>

  <p><em>还原的本体论</em>方法<em></em>是两者中较不可怕的那个。（笛卡尔似乎使我们陷入了最激进的怀疑和现象主义。）本体论的方式诉诸于人类对真正和完全科学的渴望。它指出，当我们科学地探索存在领域时，我们获得了关于所讨论事物的知识宝库和判断系统。假设我们已经对某个领域（例如分子生物学或固态物理学）有了相当透彻的理解。无论我们对所讨论事物的了解多么完整，我们仍然不会探索已经实现的真理的主观相关性。客观方面可能已经完全了解，但与客观相关的主观成就将被忽略：</p><p>The <em>ontological way to reduction</em> is the less frightening of the two. (The Cartesian seems to plunge us into the most radical doubt and phenomenalism.) The ontological way appeals to the human desire to be truly and fully scientific. It points out that when we scientifically explore a domain of being, we acquire a treasure of knowledge, a system of judgments, about the things in question. Let us say that we have achieved a rather thorough understanding of a field, such as molecular biology or solid state physics. No matter how complete our knowledge of the things in question may be, we still will not have explored the subjective correlatives of the truths that have been achieved. The objective side may be quite completely known, but the subjective accomplishments that are correlated with the objective will have been neglected: the kind of intentions that present the things being studied, the manner of verification proper to the objects, the methods followed, the forms of intersubjective correction and confirmation, and so on.</p>

  <p>只要一门科学仅仅是客观的，它就会迷失在实证性中。我们知道关于事物的真相，但我们不了解我们拥有这些东西的真相。即使我们对我们所知道的事物着迷，我们也会忘记自己并迷失自己。科学真理漂浮不定，无人问津。他们似乎不是任何人的真相。为了使这门科学更加完善，成为完全的科学，我们需要研究在科学中起作用的主观结构活动，而这样做并不是简单地继续做分子生物学或固态物理学。它是从这些科学转向一种新的、反思性的立场，即现象学，它公正地对待我们行使的意向性，但不要在我们以前的科学努力中成为主题。一旦我们转向分子生物学和固态物理学，我们开始看到我们不能只为这两个学科做现象学；我们必须扩大我们的努力，以涵盖意向性本身甚至世界本身（作为意向性的客观相关物），因为任何部分科学中的意向性都无法理解，除非由意向性的更广泛方面完成。如果不谈论识别身份本身，我们就不能谈论识别分子生物学中的身份。</p><p>So long as a science is merely objective, it is lost in positivity. We have truth about things, but we have no truth about our possession of these things. We forget ourselves and lose ourselves even as we are fascinated by the things we know. The scientific truths are left floating and unpossessed. They seem to be nobody's truth. To round out the science, to be fully scientific, we would need to investigate the subjective structural activities at work in the science, and to do so is not simply to continue doing molecular biology or solid state physics. It is to turn from such sciences and to enter into a new, reflective stance, the phenomenological, which does justice to the intentionalities that we exercise but do not make thematic in our prior scientific endeavors. Once we make this turn for molecular biology and solid state physics, we come to see that we cannot do phenomenology just for these two disciplines; we have to expand our effort to cover intentionality as such and even the world as such (as the objective correlate of intentionality), because the intentionalities in any partial science cannot be understood except as completed by wider aspects of intentionality. We could not speak about recognizing the identities in molecular biology without speaking about recognizing identities as such.</p>

  <p>因此，通过逐渐扩展，还原的本体论方法帮助我们完成部分科学。我们移向越来越广泛的语境，直到我们到达现象学态度所提供的那种最广泛的语境。我们扩展的动机是希望完全科学，避免遗漏与所讨论的调查相关的任何维度。实证科学、分子生物学或固态物理学可能存在某种部分完整性，但任何想要全面的科学最终都必须探究科学的成就，探究建立科学的意图。只要这些被排除在外，科学就悬而未决，不完整，缺乏适当的背景。还原的本体论方法让我们想起了亚里士多德在<em>形而上学</em>IV.1 关于超越局部科学到整体科学的需要，即作为存在的存在的科学（而不是简单地作为物质的、量化的、生活的或经济的）。</p><p>By a gradual expansion, therefore, the ontological way to reduction helps us to complete the partial sciences. We move out to wider and wider contexts, until we come to the kind of widest context provided by the phenomenological attitude. The motivation to our expansion is the desire to be fully scientific, to avoid leaving out any dimension that is relevant to the inquiry in question. There may be a kind of partial completeness in a positive science, in molecular biology or solid state physics, but any science that wants to be comprehensive will ultimately have to inquire into the very achieving of the science, into the intentionalities that establish it. So long as these are left out, the science is left dangling and incomplete, lacking its proper context. The ontological way to reduction reminds us of Aristotle's remark in <em>Metaphysics</em> IV.1 about the need to go beyond partial sciences to the science of the whole, the science of being as being (and not being simply as material, or quantified, or living, or economic).</p>

  <p>从这些关于还原的本体论方法的评论中应该清楚的是，现象学作为一门科学，作为一门严谨、明确、自觉的事业，实际上是一门比任何部分研究都更具体的科学。我们可能认为物理学或生物学是所有科学中最具体的，因为它研究的是摆在我们面前的物质事物，但只要这些科学不关注实现它们的活动，它们就真的是抽象的。他们不仅遗漏了世界的重要部分，而且遗漏了他们自己的重要部分。现象学科学补充并完善了这些部分科学，同时保留了它们及其有效性，因此，自相矛盾的是，现象学是最具体的科学。它恢复了更广泛的整体，更大的背景。它克服了偏科的忘我。它考虑了其他科学从中抽象出来的维度，意向性和外观的维度。它表明科学本身是一种展示，因此它显示了客观主义的天真，认为存在对展示无动于衷。因此，减少实际上不是限制，也不是“远离”任何事物。它保留了自然的态度和其中的一切，即使它使我们远离它。它放大而不是剥夺。不是任何事情的“引导”。它保留了自然的态度和其中的一切，即使它使我们远离它。它放大而不是剥夺。不是任何事情的“引导”。它保留了自然的态度和其中的一切，即使它使我们远离它。它放大而不是剥夺。</p><p>It should be clear from these remarks about the ontological way to reduction that phenomenology as a science, as a rigorous, explicit, self-conscious enterprise, is in fact a more concrete science than any of the partial inquiries. We might think that physics or biology is the most concrete of all sciences because it studies the material things right there before us, but so long as such sciences do not look at the activity by which they are achieved, they are really abstract. They leave out an essential part not only of the world but of themselves. The science of phenomenology complements and completes these partial sciences, while retaining them and their validities, so that, paradoxically enough, phenomenology is the most concrete of the sciences. It recovers the wider whole, the greater context. It overcomes the self-forgetfulness of the partial sciences. It considers dimensions the other sciences abstract from, the dimensions of intentionality and appearance. It shows how science itself is a kind of display, and hence it shows the naivete of objectivism, the belief that being is indifferent to display. The reduction, therefore, really is not a confinement, not a "leading away" from anything. It preserves the natural attitude and everything in it, even as it distances us from it. It amplifies and does not deprive.</p>

  <p><em>我们得到的印象与笛卡尔归约方式</em>截然不同。这种现象学方法仿照笛卡尔试图通过做出“一生只有一次”的决定来怀疑他所认为的所有真实判断来开创哲学。笛卡尔引入了这种有条不紊的怀疑，因为他认为他从别人那里吸收的判断被偏见所污染。在采纳了这种普遍的怀疑之后，他将继续根据他所发展的方法，只接受那些他自己可以证明是正确的判断。</p><p>We get a very different impression from the <em>Cartesian way to reduction</em>. This approach to phenomenology is modeled on Descartes' attempt to initiate philosophy by making a "once in a lifetime" decision to doubt all the judgments he holds as true. Descartes introduces this methodic doubt because he thinks that the judgments he has absorbed from others are contaminated by prejudices. After adopting this universal doubt, he will go on to accept as true only those judgments that he himself can justify, according to the method he has developed.</p>

  <p>笛卡尔试图开创哲学的问题在于，它将我们所有自然的信念模态变成了可疑的模态。他从几种自然模态——确定性、怀疑、经过验证的接受、可能性、概率——转移到另一种自然模态：怀疑。他的怀疑可能只是有条不紊的，但它仍然是怀疑。笛卡尔试图将自己提升到哲学中，但他只是成功地滑入了另一种自然态度，而且是一种极端怀疑的态度。他试图让哲学走上成为一门严谨科学的道路，但失败了。他转向一边，给哲学和科学带来了灾难性的后果。</p><p>The problem with Descartes' attempt to begin philosophy is that it changes all our natural doxic modalities into doubted ones. He moves from several natural modalities — certainty, suspicion, verified acceptance, possibility, probability — into another natural modality: doubtfulness. His doubt may only be methodical, but it still is doubt. Descartes tries to lift himself into philosophy, but he succeeds only in sliding over into another one of the natural attitudes, and a radically skeptical one at that. His attempt to put philosophy on the road to being a rigorous science misfires. He veers off to the side, with disastrous consequences for philosophy and science.</p>

  <p>笛卡尔减少现象学的方法是尝试接受笛卡尔试图达到的目标并正确地做到这一点。它并不建议我们发起普遍怀疑。<em>相反，它建议我们采取尝试</em>的态度<em></em>怀疑我们的各种意图。这可能看起来很小，但很重要。怀疑的尝试与怀疑有很大的不同。当我们试图怀疑我们的一个信念时，会发生什么情况是我们对该信念采取中立立场；我们还不怀疑它，我们只是暂停我们的信念。我们停下来看看我们是否应该怀疑它。然而，这种尝试，这种停止，不是怀疑，而是类似于我们进入哲学时所达到的中和。这种中立的立场就像一种钥匙孔，通过它我们可以了解什么是现象学态度，我们在这种态度中立并思考我们所有的意向性。</p><p>The Cartesian way to reduction in phenomenology is an attempt to take up what Descartes was trying to get at and to do it properly. It does not propose that we initiate a universal doubt. Rather, it suggests that we adopt the attitude of <em>attempting</em> to doubt our various intentions. This may look like a small difference, but it is crucial. The attempt to doubt is very different from doubt. What happens when we attempt to doubt one of our beliefs is that we adopt a neutral stance toward that conviction; we do not yet doubt it, we only suspend our belief. We stop to see whether we should doubt it. This attempt, this stop, however, is not doubt, but it is something like the neutralization we achieve when we enter into philosophy. This neutral stance then serves as a kind of keyhole through which we can get a sense of what the phenomenological attitude is, the attitude in which we neutralize and contemplate all our intentionalities.</p>

  <p>尝试怀疑的另一个重要特征如下。除非我们有理由怀疑，否则我们不能真正怀疑任何事情。假设我知道这个房间的门是白色的，并且假设我看到猫走进了房间。我不能继续说我怀疑门是白色的或者猫正穿过门槛，除非我有理由怀疑这些明显的事情是真的：我可能突然意识到是光让门更亮了比正常情况下，它可能是灰色阴影; 我可能会突然意识到门附近有一面镜子，我可能真的只看到猫走进另一个房间的倒影。作为自然态度的模态之一，怀疑需要有理由的推动。我不能只说我怀疑事情。</p><p>Another important feature of the attempt to doubt is the following. We cannot truly doubt anything unless we have reasons to doubt it. Suppose I know that the door to this room is white, and suppose I see the cat walking into the room. I cannot go on to say that I doubt that the door is white or that the cat is walking across the threshold unless I have reasons to doubt that these apparent things are true: I may suddenly realize that it is the light that makes the door brighter than normal, and that it may be a shade of gray; I may suddenly realize that there is a mirror near the door, and that I may really be seeing only a reflection of the cat walking into another room. As one of the modalities in the natural attitude, doubt needs to be motivated by reasons. I cannot just say I doubt things.</p>

  <p>尝试<em>_</em>然而，怀疑取决于我们的自由选择。我们可以尝试怀疑任何事情，甚至是摆在我们面前最明显的事实或最确定的观点。以类似的方式，当我们转向现象学视角时，我们可以自由地发起中和，我们的意向性被悬置或“停止行动”，事物和世界被置之不理；这些事情都在我们的力量之中，并受制于我们的自由选择。我们可以决定要过这样的生活。我们不需要因为那些迫使我们怀疑或怀疑的理由而被迫进入它。所以，虽然怀疑不是一个很好的模型来帮助我们进入现象学转向，但尝试怀疑是。怀疑的尝试让我们很好地瞥见了我们意图的现象学中和是什么样的。以这种方式，</p><p>The <em>attempt</em> to doubt, however, is subject to our free choice. We can attempt to doubt anything, even the most obvious fact before us or the most established opinion. In a similar way, we are free to initiate the neutralization that occurs when we turn to the phenomenological perspective, the suspension or "putting out of action" of our intentionalities, the bracketing of things and the world; these things are in our power and subject to our free choice. We can decide that we want to carry out this kind of life. We do not need to be forced into it by reasons like those that force us into doubt or suspicion. So, whereas doubt is not a good model to use to help us into the phenomenological turn, the attempt to doubt is. The attempt to doubt gives us a good glimpse of what the phenomenological neutralization of our intentions is like. In this manner, the Cartesian way to reduction tries to "kick" us into the philosophical attitude.</p>

  <p>笛卡尔将一种激进的怀疑主义引入了知识分子的生活，这种怀疑主义继续困扰着他所激发的思想。尽管如此，正如我们所做的那样，采用笛卡尔主题并为现象学服务对其进行修改仍然是有用的，因为许多人错误地认为从自然态度转向现象学态度是向笛卡尔主义的倒退。即使是一些杰出的现象学解释者也无法弄清楚这一点。因此，对我们来说，区分笛卡尔所做的和现象学所取得的成就是很重要的。</p><p>Descartes introduced a radical skepticism into the intellectual life that continues to plague the thought that he inspires. Still, it is useful to adopt the Cartesian theme and to modify it in the service of phenomenology, as we have done, because the turn from the natural attitude to the phenomenological is mistakenly seen by many as a relapse into Cartesianism. Even some prominent interpreters of phenomenology cannot get this straight. It is important, therefore, for us to make the distinction between what Descartes does and what phenomenology achieves.</p>

  <p>笛卡尔错误的严重有害影响之一是，他怀疑自然态度的意向性。他破坏了我们对我们所经历的事物的真实性、我们所认识的身份的自然而有效的信念。他引入了怀疑主义的习惯，这种习惯使我们倾向于在未向我们证明之前什么都不相信。但是，这种对一切都有证据的渴望是不合理的。证明只有在某些不可证明的真理的基础上才有可能，这些真理本身就有证据并且不需要证明。我们无法证明一切；我们知道很多不需要证明的事情。现象学恢复了我们对自然态度的信念的有效性。它承认我们的意图确实以各种方式达到了事物本身。它区分并描述了各种意图是如何实现和确认的。它还意识到我们经常超越证据，我们经常对我们的意图含糊不清，而且错误很常见；但错误的存在并不能抹杀一切。这只能说明我们必须小心。通过澄清各种意向性并将它们彼此区分开来，现象学帮助我们保持谨慎。</p><p>One of the seriously pernicious effects of Descartes' error is that he discredits the intentionalities of the natural attitude. He undermines our natural and valid belief in the reality of the things we experience, the identities we recognize. He introduces the habit of skepticism that makes us tend to believe nothing until it has been proved to us. But this desire for a proof for everything is unreasonable. Proof is only possible on the basis of some truths that are not provable, truths that have their evidence within themselves and do not need proof. We cannot prove everything; we know many things that do not need to be proved. Phenomenology restores the validity of the convictions we have in the natural attitude. It acknowledges that our intentions do, in their various ways, reach the things themselves. It distinguishes and describes how the various intentions are fulfilled and confirmed. It also realizes that we often go beyond the evidence, that we often are vague in what we intend, and that errors are common; but the presence of error does not discredit everything. It only shows that we must be careful. By clarifying the various intentionalities and distinguishing them from one another, phenomenology helps us to be careful.</p>

  <p>最后，我们应该注意本体论和笛卡尔归约方法之间的区别。本体论方式是递增的。它从科学成就开始，逐步增加维度，一路推动我们，直到达到现象学的态度。笛卡尔方式试图一步到位地快速完成所有工作。它立即暂停所有意向性。它确实比本体论方式更好地强调了在哲学中发挥作用的新形式，即中和，但就像匆忙完成的任何其他事情一样，它会严重误导我们。它可以让我们认为现象学是怀疑论的和现象学的，并且剥夺了我们对真实世界和其中事物的了解。它甚至似乎会导致唯我论。本体论的方式缓慢但确定；笛卡尔方式快速但有风险。最好的方法是同时使用它们，利用对方的优势来弥补各自的弱点。然而，在这两种方法中，关键是要感受自然态度与现象学态度之间、我们的自然参与与哲学超然之间的差异。</p><p>Finally, we should note the difference between the ontological and the Cartesian ways to reduction. The ontological way proceeds incrementally. It begins with scientific achievements and adds dimensions to them step-by-step, nudging us all the way along, until it arrives at the phenomenological attitude. The Cartesian way tries to do it all in a hurry, in one step. It suspends all the intentionalities at once. It does highlight a little better than the ontological way the new kind of modality, the neutralization, that comes into play in philosophy, but like anything else done in a hurry it can seriously mislead us. It can make us think of phenomenology as skeptical and phenomenalistic, and as depriving us of the real world and the things in it. It even seems to lead to solipsism. The ontological way is slow but sure; the Cartesian way is quick but risky. The best approach is to use both of them, correcting the weaknesses of each by the strengths of the other. In both approaches, however, the key thing is to get a feeling for the difference between the natural attitude and the phenomenological, between our natural involvements and philosophical detachment.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_4.xhtml.heading_id_6"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_4.xhtml.ch4_strpa"></a>与现象学态度有关的一些特殊术语</h2><h2><a></a>SOME SPECIAL TERMS RELATING TO THE PHENOMENOLOGICAL ATTITUDE</h2>

  <p>还有许多其他问题可以帮助我们更准确地定义现象学态度。对它们的处理本质上将是对现象学词汇中的几个术语的解释。</p><p>There are a number of other issues that can help us define the phenomenological attitude more precisely. The treatment of them will be essentially an explanation of several terms in the phenomenological vocabulary.</p>

  <p>我们从现象学观点出发的经验和分析得出的断言在原则上是<em>确定无疑的</em>。肯定的陈述表达了不可能有的东西；他们表达了必要的真理。而且，他们被<em>看到</em>表达这样必要的真理。我们看到他们所说的不可能不是这样。向现象学态度提出的证据具有哲学上的必然性。例如，考虑这样的陈述，即像立方体这样的物质空间对象只能以多种轮廓、方面和侧面给出，并且立方体是在这些外观中给出的身份。还要考虑这样一种说法，即身份是在存在和不存在的混合中赋予我们的，或者我们只能用暂时的现在来对抗过去和未来。这些陈述是毫无疑问的。我们看到立方体不能以任何其他方式给出，现在从来都不是似是而非的，但总是涉及过去和未来。</p><p>Our experience and analysis from within the phenomenological viewpoint yields assertions that are, in principle, <em>apodictic</em>. Apodictic statements express things that could not be otherwise; they express necessary truths. Moreover, they are <em>seen</em> to express such necessary truths. We see that what they say could not be otherwise. There is philosophical necessity in the evidences presented to the phenomenological attitude. Consider, for example, the statement that a material, spatial object like a cube can only be given in a manifold of profiles, aspects, and sides, and that the cube is the identity given in such appearances. Consider also the statement that an identity is given to us in a blend of presences and absences, or the statement that we can only have a temporal present played off against a past and future. These statements are apodictic. We see that a cube could not be given in any other way, and that the present is never specious but always involves the past and future.</p>

  <p>有人可能会反对说这样的陈述是无可置疑的，因为它们是如此明显、如此微不足道，几乎是没有必要的；但这正是重点。现象学陈述，就像一般的哲学陈述一样，陈述明显的和必要的。他们告诉我们我们已经知道的事情。它们不是新信息，但即使它们没有告诉我们任何新信息，它们仍然很重要且具有启发性，因为我们常常对这些琐碎和必要的事情感到非常困惑。当我们想到大多数人如何理解记忆（如观看内部图片），或者许多哲学家如何糟糕地描述知觉（例如，在大脑的某种内部屏幕上吸收印象）时，那么重要性陈述显而易见的事情本身就变得显而易见了。现象学断言声称是无可置疑的，因为它们是如此基本，如此不可避免，如此不可避免。它们的绝对性并非源于这样一个事实，即制造它们的人享受一些其他人从未听说过的异国真理的特殊启示。</p><p>Someone might object that such statements are apodictic because they are so obvious, so trivial, almost so gratuitous; but that is exactly the point. Phenomenological statements, like philosophical statements generally, state the obvious and the necessary. They tell us what we already know. They are not new information, but even if they do not tell us anything new, they can still be important and illuminating, because we often are very confused about just such trivialities and necessities. When we think of how most people understand memory (as the viewing of internal pictures), or how poorly many philosophers have described perception (as, for example, the intake of impressions on some sort of internal screen in the brain), then the importance of stating the obvious becomes obvious itself. Phenomenological assertions claim to be apodictic because they are so basic and so unavoidable, so ineluctable. Their apodicticity does not stem from the fact that the people who make them enjoy some special revelation of exotic truths that other people have never heard about.</p>

  <p>此外，现象学陈述和证据是必然的这一事实并不意味着我们永远无法改进它们或加深我们对它们的理解。哲学陈述可以是无可置疑的，但却不<em>充分</em>. 充分意味着声明中的所有含糊之处都已清除。事物的所有维度都已经展现出来，所有的含义都已经被描绘出来了。几乎没有什么能如此完整地呈现给我们，即使在哲学中也是如此。结果是现象学陈述可以被看作是必要的（我们可以看到它们不可能是其他的），但它们也需要进一步的澄清。例如，完全有可能知道现在必然涉及过去和未来，但不清楚现在、过去和未来的全部含义。我们可以毫无疑问地知道，一个对象是在存在和不存在的混合中被识别出来的，但是我们仍然可能对什么是存在的和什么是不存在的完整含义含糊不清。</p><p>Furthermore, the fact that phenomenological statements and evidences are apodictic does not mean that we can never improve on them or deepen our understanding of them. A philosophical statement can be apodictic and yet fail in <em>adequacy</em>. Adequacy means that all vagueness has been purged from the statement. All the dimensions of the thing have been brought out, all the implications have been drawn. Practically nothing can be so fully presented to us, even in philosophy. The result is that phenomenological statements can be seen to be necessary (we can see that they could not be otherwise), but they can also call for further clarification. It is perfectly possible to know, for example, that the present necessarily involves the past and future but to be unclear about the full meaning of present, past, and future. We can know apodictically that an object is identified in blends of presence and absence, but we can still be vague about the full import of what it is to be present and what it is to be absent.</p>

  <p>现象学的还原和现象学的态度常被称为<em>先验的</em>。我们谈到先验还原和先验态度。甚至会遇到“先验现象学的还原”和“先验现象学的观点”这些相当笨拙的词组。“先验”一词是什么意思？</p><p>The phenomenological reduction and the phenomenological attitude are often called <em>transcendental</em>. We speak of the transcendental reduction and the transcendental attitude. One even encounters the rather clumsy phrases, "the transcendental-phenomenological reduction" and "the transcendental-phenomenological viewpoint". What does the term "transcendental" mean?</p>

  <p>这个词的意思是“超越”，基于其拉丁词根<em>transcendere ，从</em><em>trans</em>和<em>scando</em>翻越或超越。意识，即使是自然的态度，也是超验的，因为它超越了自身，到达了赋予它的身份和事物。就自我参与认知、接触事物而言，自我可以被称为先验的。先验自我是作为真理代理人的自我或自我。先验还原是转向作为真理代理人的自我，先验态度是当我们使这个自我及其意向性成为主题时所采取的立场。</p><p>The word means "going beyond", based on its Latin root, <em>transcendere</em>, to climb over or go beyond, from <em>trans</em> and <em>scando</em>. Consciousness, even in the natural attitude, is transcendental because it reaches beyond itself to the identities and things that are given to it. The ego can be called transcendental insofar as it is involved, in cognition, in reaching out to things. The transcendental ego is the ego or the self as the agent of truth. The transcendental reduction is the turn toward the ego as the agent of truth, and the transcendental attitude is the stance we take up when we make this ego and its intentionalities thematic.</p>

  <p>当我们进入现象学或先验的态度时，我们必须对我们使用的词语进行适当的修改。新的上下文，因为它是如此独特，需要调整我们的自然语言。让我们把这些变化产生的新语言称为<em>超验</em>语言，让我们把我们以自然态度所说的语言称为<em>世俗</em>语言。这两种态度是由各自特有的意向性构成的，各自使用的语言反映了视角的差异。研究先验语言和世俗语言这两种语言之间的相互作用，是梳理哲学与自然经验之间差异的好方法。</p><p>When we enter into the phenomenological or transcendental attitude, we have to make appropriate modifications in the words that we use. The new context, since it is so unique, requires adjustments in our natural language. Let us call the new language that results from these changes <em>transcendentalese</em>, and let us call the language we speak in the natural attitude <em>mundanese</em>. The two attitudes are constituted by the kind of intentionalities proper to each, and the languages spoken in each reflect the differences in perspective. The study of the interplay between the two languages, transcendentalese and mundanese, is a good way of teasing out the differences between philosophy and natural experience.</p>

  <p>超验语中的一些词是从世俗语中提取出来的，例如“身份”、“外表”、“存在与不存在”和“自我”等词，但我们需要记住，这些词在表达意思时会发生微妙的变化。被吸收到新的哲学语言中。例如，当说哲学是一门严密的科学时，“科学”一词的含义不同于物理学和生物学。引入了一种新的精确性。现象学是一门与自然态度科学不同的科学，与先验还原相关的整个论证旨在帮助我们了解新意义是什么。</p><p>Some of the words in transcendentalese are drawn from mundanese, words such as "identity", "appearance", "presence and absence", and "ego", but we need to remember that the terms take on a subtle shift in meaning when they are absorbed into the new, philosophical language. The word "science", for example, takes on a sense different from that of physics and biology when it is said that philosophy is a rigorous science. A new kind of exactness is introduced. Phenomenology is a science in a way different from the sciences of the natural attitude, and the whole argument associated with the transcendental reduction is supposed to help us see what the new sense is.</p>

  <p>也有一些词是专门为超验语而创造的，这些词没有自然态度或世俗的基础。其中两个是<em>noema</em>及其相关的<em>noesis</em>. “意向关系”一词指的是意向性的客观关联；它指的是我们自然态度的意图所指的任何东西：一个物质对象、一幅图画、一个词、一个数学实体、另一个人。但更具体地说，它恰恰是指从先验的态度来看的这种客观关联。它指的是它们被先验-现象学还原括起来了。有时该术语可以用作形容词和副词：我们可以说提供了意向分析，我们可以研究某些事物的意向结构，我们可以从意向角度考虑对象。任何使用这些词的短语都是用先验语说出来的。它们是哲学短语。他们假定已经引入了适合于哲学的中立修改。</p><p>There are also some words that are coined especially for transcendentalese, words that have no basis in the natural attitude or in mundanese. Two of these are <em>noema</em> and its correlative, <em>noesis</em>. The term "noema" refers to the objective correlates of intentionalities; it refers to whatever is intended by the intentions of our natural attitude: a material object, a picture, a word, a mathematical entity, another person. But more specifically, it refers to such objective correlates precisely as being looked at from the transcendental attitude. It refers to them as having been bracketed by the transcendental-phenomenological reduction. Sometimes the term can be used adjectivally and adverbially: we can be said to provide a noematic analysis, we can study the noematic structure of some thing, we can consider objects noematically. Any phrases in which these words are used are uttered in transcendentalese. They are philosophical phrases. They presume that the neutrality modification proper to philosophy has been introduced. The use of the term "noema" signals that we are in phenomenology, in philosophical discourse, and that the things being talked about are being discussed from a philosophical viewpoint, not from one of the viewpoints within the natural attitude.</p>

  <p>这些要点需要强调，因为 noema 很容易被误解。noema 通常被认为是某种实体，类似于概念或与意识对象不同的“感觉”，作为意识与特定事物相关的载体。意向目标被认为是将意向性赋予意识的东西，就好像如果不向意识中添加意向目标，意识就会自我封闭。noema 也被认为是意识通过它瞄准这个或那个特定对象的实体，我们的意识通过它来指代外部世界中的某个特定项目：noema 被视为一种意向性的瞄准器。我认为，将 noema 理解为中介实体是不正确的。后来，在第 13 章中，我们将更详细地了解为什么它会产生问题和产生误导。目前，如果我介绍这个术语并初步解释它的含义就足够了。noema 是意向性的任何对象，任何客观的相关物，但从现象学的态度来看，被认为是经验丰富的。它不是任何对象的复制品，不是任何对象的替代品，也不是将我们引向对象的意义；它是对象本身，但从哲学的角度考虑。不是任何对象的替代品，也不是将我们引向该对象的意义；它是对象本身，但从哲学的角度考虑。不是任何对象的替代品，也不是将我们引向该对象的意义；它是对象本身，但从哲学的角度考虑。</p><p>These points need to be emphasized because the noema can easily be misunderstood. The noema is often taken to be an entity of some sort, something like a concept or a "sense" distinct from the object of consciousness, something that serves as the vehicle by which consciousness becomes referred to a particular thing. The noema is thought to be that by which intentionality is bestowed on consciousness, as though awareness would be self-enclosed if noemas were not added to it. The noema is also thought to be the entity through which consciousness targets this or that particular object, that by which our consciousness is referred to some specific item in the world outside: the noema is taken as a kind of bombsight for intentionality. This understanding of the noema as a mediating entity is, I believe, incorrect. Later, in Chapter 13, we will see in greater detail why it is problematic and misleading. At present it is sufficient if I introduce the term and give an initial explanation of what it means. The noema is any object of intentionality, any objective correlate, but considered from the phenomenological attitude, considered just as experienced. It is not a copy of any object, not a substitute for any object, not a sense that refers us to the object; it is the object itself, but considered from the philosophical standpoint.</p>

  <p>“noesis”一词的误导性较小，但它也假定我们已经进入了现象学。“意念”指的是我们意向事物的意向行为：感知、意指行为、空洞意向、填充意向、判断、记忆。但它所指的正是从现象学的角度来看的它们。它假设我们已经进行了先验还原。<em>它考虑那些被现象学时代</em>暂停或停止活动后的意识行为<em></em>. Noeses 比 noemas 争议小，因为我们不会被这个术语诱惑将另一个影子行为与原始行为平行放置，就像我们被术语“noema”诱惑将影子“对象”或“感觉”平行于实物。我们不太愿意在我们自己和我们的心理行为之间设置“意识”的原因是，生活在笛卡尔传统中的我们已经习惯于接受我们的内省是现实的，因为它让我们直接接触到我们自己的精神生活。同样的传统使我们倾向于否认我们直接接触世界上的事物；它让我们需要一个中介，一种表征（“意向标”），将我们与外界联系起来。</p><p>The term "noesis" is less misleading, but it also assumes that we have entered into phenomenology. "Noesis" refers to the intentional acts by which we intend things: perceptions, signifying acts, empty intentions, filled intentions, judgings, rememberings. But it refers to them precisely as looked at from the phenomenological standpoint. It assumes that we have carried out the transcendental reduction. It considers those acts of consciousness after they have been suspended or put out of action by the phenomenological <em>epochē</em>. Noeses are less controversial than noemas because we are not tempted by the term to posit another shadow act parallel to the original one, as we are tempted by the term "noema" to posit a shadow "object" or a "sense" parallel to the real object. The reason we are less tempted to posit "a noesis" between ourselves and our psychological acts is that we, living in the Cartesian tradition, have become habituated to accept our introspections as realistic, as putting us in direct touch with our own mental life. This same tradition makes us inclined to deny that we have a direct exposure to things in the world; it makes us demand an intermediary, a representation (the "noema"), to connect us to the things outside.</p>

  <p>我们还可以提到一个事实，即现象学中创造的“noesis”和“noema”，它们具有相同的希腊词根，即动词 noein，意思是“思考”、“考虑”、“感知<em>”</em>。希腊语术语<em>nōesis</em>的意思是一种思考行为，而术语<em>noēma 的</em>意思是所思考的。在希腊语中，添加到动词词干的后缀 - <em>ma</em>表示动词所表达的动作的结果或效果。因此，<em>phantasma</em>表示幻想的对象，<em>politeuma</em>表示政治化的效果（政治实体），<em>rhēma</em>表示说话的效果（这个词），<em>horama</em>表示看到的对象（视图，如“全景”），而<em>migma</em>表示混合效果（混合物）。<em>noēma</em>一词表示正在思考的事物或我们意识到的事物。</p><p>We might also mention the fact that "noesis" and "noema", both of which were coined in phenomenology, have the same Greek root, the verb <em>noein</em>, which means "to think", "to consider", "to perceive". The Greek term <em>nōesis</em> means an act of thinking, and the term <em>noēma</em> means that which is thought. In Greek the suffix -<em>ma</em> added to a verb stem signifies the result or effect of the action expressed in the verb. Thus, <em>phantasma</em> signifies the object of fantasizing, <em>politeuma</em> means the effect of politicizing (the political entity), <em>rhēma</em> signifies the effect of speaking (the word), <em>horama</em> means the object of seeing (the view, as in "panorama"), and <em>migma</em> means the effect of mixing (the mixture). The term <em>noēma</em> then means the thing being thought or the thing we are aware of.</p>

  <p>将希腊术语改编为现象学是恰当的。noema 是思想的任何对象，但被精确地视为被思考或意向的对象，被视为意向性的相关物。我们以这种方式看待它的观点是现象学的态度。因此，“意向”这个词只能从那种态度中说出来。不幸的是，人们经常在心理学、认识论或语义学的意义上理解“意向标”。他们忽略了先验态度与自然态度之间的焦点差异，并且他们从自然主义、认识论或语义学的角度来看待意向目标。他们将 noema 定位为自我与世界事物之间的中介，而它应该被视为从现象学的角度来看的世界事物。</p><p>The adaptation of the Greek term to phenomenology is appropriate. The noema is any object of thought, but considered precisely as such, as being thought about or intended, as the correlate of an intentionality. The viewpoint from which we look at it in that way is the phenomenological attitude. The word "noema" is therefore uttered only from within that attitude. What happens, unfortunately, is that people often take "noema" in a psychological, epistemological, or semantic sense. They miss the difference of focus between the transcendental attitude and the natural, and they take the noema naturalistically, epistemologically, or semantically. They posit the noema as an intermediary between the self and things in the world, when it should be seen as the things in the world viewed from a phenomenological perspective. Instead of seeing it as a "moment" (an abstract part) in the manifestation of things, they reify it and make it serve as the link between the mind and things.</p>

  <p>本节中关于与现象学还原有关的各种术语的评论不仅仅是口头约定的问题。他们带出了定义现象学的新态度的重要方面。此外，术语的定义将使现象学中的某些学说更容易表达。掌握适当的词汇并不是知识领域中的偶然事件；如果没有为它们命名的词，就无法正确地揭示所讨论的事物。</p><p>The remarks in this section about various terms relating to the phenomenological reduction are not a matter of mere verbal convention. They bring out important aspects of the new attitude that defines phenomenology. Also, the definition of the terms will make it easier to express certain doctrines in phenomenology. Mastery of an appropriate vocabulary is not an incidental matter in a domain of knowledge; the things in question cannot be properly brought to light without the words that name them.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_4.xhtml.heading_id_7"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_4.xhtml.ch4_tri"></a>为什么先验还原很重要？</h2><h2><a></a>WHY IS THE TRANSCENDENTAL REDUCTION IMPORTANT?</h2>

  <p>乍一看，我们可能会认为现象学本质上是知识理论的练习，是认识论的研究，但它远不止于此。它不只是试图解决“知识的问题”，试图确定是否存在任何真理，以及我们是否可以到达“现实世界”或“外部”世界。现象学确实出现在认识论是主要哲学关注点的历史时期，它的一些词汇和论证听起来很认识论，但它成功地突破了这种限制性语境。它超越了它的起源。它接受现代哲学并从中学习，但它也克服了一些局限性并重新建立了与古代思想的联系。对现象学的大多数误解来自仍然如此陷入现代思维的问题和立场的解释，仍然如此受困于笛卡尔和洛克传统，以致于他们未能掌握现象学中的新事物。现象学要求对哲学是什么的理解进行重大调整，而许多人无法做出这种改变，因为他们无法摆脱自己的背景和文化背景。现象学恢复了古代哲学的可能性，甚至在解释现代科学的存在等新维度时也是如此。现象学提供了一个最好的例子，说明如何在新的背景下重新利用传统并使其重新焕发活力。</p><p>At first glance, we might be tempted to think that phenomenology is essentially an exercise in the theory of knowledge, a study in epistemology, but it is far more than that. It does not just try to deal with "the problem of knowledge", with trying to establish whether or not there is any truth, and with whether or not we can get to the "real world" or the "extramental" world. Phenomenology did arise in the historical period during which epistemology was the major philosophical concern, and some of its vocabulary and argument sound very epistemological, but it succeeded in breaking out of this restrictive context. It surpasses its origins. It comes to terms with modern philosophy and learns from it, but it also overcomes some of its limitations and reestablishes a link with ancient thought. Most of the misunderstandings of phenomenology come from interpretations that are still so caught up in the problems and positions of modern thinking, still so trapped by the Cartesian and Lockean tradition, that they fail to grasp what is new in phenomenology. Phenomenology calls for a major readjustment in the understanding of what philosophy is, and many people cannot make this change, because they cannot free themselves from their background and their cultural context. Phenomenology restores the possibilities of ancient philosophy, even while accounting for new dimensions such as the presence of modern science. Phenomenology provides one of the best examples of how a tradition can be reappropriated and brought to life again in a new context.</p>

  <p>先验还原学说特别重要，因为它给出了哲学如何与前哲学生活和经验相关的新定义。哲学的危险之一是它可能认为它可以取代前哲学生活。诚然，哲学达到了理性的顶峰。它包括其他推理练习，例如在特定科学和实际生活中发现的推理练习。它研究了所有这些部分练习是如何相互关联的，以及它们如何适应最终的背景。因为哲学是对前哲学推理的补充，所以人们可能会认为它可以替代这种推理练习。它可能会开始认为它可以做得更好，更专业的思维方式可以完成。哲学可能会开始认为，它可以比政治家更好地开展政治生活，比那些无休止地讨论我们的社区生活应该如何领导的人更好。它可能会开始认为，在阐明神圣和终极是什么方面，它可以比宗教人士做得更好。它可能开始认为它可以取代特殊科学，例如化学或生物学或语言学，因为它们都没有整体感。如果哲学试图取代前哲学思维，结果就是理性主义，即马基雅维利在政治和道德生活方面以及笛卡尔在理论问题方面引入现代哲学的那种理性主义。比那些无休止地讨论我们的社区生活应该如何过的人要好。它可能会开始认为，在阐明神圣和终极是什么方面，它可以比宗教人士做得更好。它可能开始认为它可以取代特殊科学，例如化学或生物学或语言学，因为它们都没有整体感。如果哲学试图取代前哲学思维，结果就是理性主义，即马基雅维利在政治和道德生活方面以及笛卡尔在理论问题方面引入现代哲学的那种理性主义。比那些无休止地讨论我们的社区生活应该如何过的人要好。它可能会开始认为，在阐明神圣和终极是什么方面，它可以比宗教人士做得更好。它可能开始认为它可以取代特殊科学，例如化学或生物学或语言学，因为它们都没有整体感。如果哲学试图取代前哲学思维，结果就是理性主义，即马基雅维利在政治和道德生活方面以及笛卡尔在理论问题方面引入现代哲学的那种理性主义。它可能开始认为它可以取代特殊科学，例如化学或生物学或语言学，因为它们都没有整体感。如果哲学试图取代前哲学思维，结果就是理性主义，即马基雅维利在政治和道德生活方面以及笛卡尔在理论问题方面引入现代哲学的那种理性主义。它可能开始认为它可以取代特殊科学，例如化学或生物学或语言学，因为它们都没有整体感。如果哲学试图取代前哲学思维，结果就是理性主义，即马基雅维利在政治和道德生活方面以及笛卡尔在理论问题方面引入现代哲学的那种理性主义。</p><p>The doctrine of the transcendental reduction is especially important because it gives a new definition of how philosophy can be related to prephilosophical life and experience. One of the dangers to philosophy is that it may think that it can replace the prephilosophical life. It is true that philosophy reaches the summit of reason. It encompasses other exercises of reason, such as those found in the particular sciences and in practical life. It studies how all such partial exercises are related to one another and how they fit into a final context. Because philosophy complements prephilosophical reason, it may be tempted to think that it can substitute for such exercises of reason. It may begin to think that it can do better what the more specialized kinds of thinking accomplish. Philosophy may begin to think that it can carry out political life better than the statesmen, better than those who are involved in the perpetual discussion about how our life in community should be led. It may begin to think that it can do a better job than religious persons do in spelling out what the sacred and the ultimate are. It may begin to think that it can replace special sciences such as chemistry or biology or linguistics, because none of them has a sense of the whole. If philosophy tries to substitute for prephilosophical thinking, the result is rationalism, the kind of rationalism introduced into modern philosophy by Machiavelli in regard to political and moral life, and by Descartes in regard to theoretic matters.</p>

  <p>现象学对文化和知识生活的最重要贡献是验证了前哲学生活、经验和思维的真实性。它坚持以自然态度进行的理性运用是有效和真实的。在哲学出现之前，真理就已经实现了。自然意向性确实达到了实现和证据，哲学永远不能代替他们所做的。现象学寄生于自然态度及其所有成就。除了通过自然态度及其意向性之外，现象学无法接触到世界的事物和揭示。现象学只是后来出现的。它必须是谦虚的；它必须认识到自然态度在实践和理论实践中的真实有效成就。然后思考这些成就及其相关的主观活动，但如果没有这些成就，哲学就没有什么可思考的。必有真意，必有先见之明<em>doxa</em>，如果有哲学的话。现象学可以帮助自然意向性阐明它们所追求的东西，但它永远不会取代它们。</p><p>The most important contribution phenomenology has made to culture and the intellectual life is to have validated the truth of prephilosophical life, experience, and thinking. It insists that the exercises of reason that are carried out in the natural attitude are valid and true. Truth is achieved before philosophy comes on the scene. The natural intentionalities do reach fulfillment and evidence, and philosophy can never substitute for what they do. Phenomenology is parasitic on the natural attitude and all the achievements thereof. Phenomenology has no access to the things and disclosures of the world except through the natural attitude and its intentionalities. Phenomenology comes only later. It has to be modest; it must recognize the true and valid achievements of the natural attitude, in both its practical and theoretic exercise. It then contemplates these achievements and their correlative subjective activities, but if the achievements were not there, there would be nothing for philosophy to think about. There must be true opinion, there must be prior <em>doxa</em>, if there is to be philosophy. Phenomenology may help the natural intentionalities clarify what they are after, but it never replaces them.</p>

  <p>当现象学以自然态度“中和”工作中的意向性时，它不会稀释、破坏、扰乱或嘲笑它们。它只是对它们采取一种沉思的立场，一种它可以将它们理论化的立场。现象学补充自然态度；哲学补充了真实的观点和科学。现象学也可能指出以自然态度获得的真理和证据的局限性，但各种艺术和科学已经意识到它们各自是局部的和有限的，尽管它们可能无法非常准确地表述它们的局限性. 有时特定的艺术和科学可能想要自己成为帝国主义者并支配所有其他艺术和科学：物理学可能会试图说它解释了整体和其中的一切，或者语言学可能会尝试这样做，或者心理学，或者历史。当这种部分的艺术和科学试图掌握整体和其他艺术和科学时，它们就变成了伪哲学，但当哲学试图支配前哲学形式的知识时，当它试图取代它们时，它也可以伪造自己。</p><p>When phenomenology "neutralizes" the intentionalities at work in the natural attitude, it does not dilute, destroy, upset, or ridicule them. It merely adopts a contemplative stance toward them, a stance from which it can theorize them. Phenomenology complements the natural attitude; philosophy complements true opinion and science. Phenomenology may also point out the limitations of the truth and evidences achieved in the natural attitude, but the various arts and sciences already are aware of the fact that they are each partial and limited, although they may not be able to formulate their limitations very exactly. And sometimes the particular arts and sciences may want to become imperialistic themselves and dominate over all the others: physics may try to say that it explains the whole and everything in it, or linguistics may try to do so, or psychology, or history. When such partial arts and sciences try to master the whole and the other arts and sciences, they become pseudo philosophies, but philosophy can also falsify itself when it tries to lord it over the prephilosophical forms of knowledge, when it tries to substitute for them.</p>

  <p>现象学通过承认艺术和科学在自然态度中的有效性，以及常识和审慎在实践秩序中的有效性，提供了一个重要的文化修复。现代思想中有一种理性主义倾向，它想让哲学成为所有前哲学形式的理性的完美替代品，而现象学则抵消了这种倾向。近年来，现代理性主义趋势已经分解为后现代主义，后现代主义退缩到另一个极端，根本否认任何理性中心。现象学也避免了这种消极的极端，因为它从来没有首先采取理性主义的立场。</p><p>Phenomenology provides a major cultural restoration by recognizing the validity of the arts and sciences in the natural attitude, and also the validity of common sense, of prudence in the practical order. There is a rationalist tendency in modern thought that wants to make philosophy the perfect substitute for all pre philosophical forms of reason, and phenomenology counteracts this tendency. The modern rationalist trend has, in recent years, broken down into postmodernism, which recoils to the other extreme and denies any center to reason at all. Phenomenology avoids this negative extreme as well, because it never adopted the rationalist position in the first place.</p>

  <p>古典希腊和中世纪思想认为，哲学前的理性获得真理和证据，哲学反思在其后发生，不会干扰它之前发生的事情。亚里士多德没有干预政治生活或数学；他只是想了解它们是什么，也许自己弄清楚它们。现象学加入了这种经典理解，但它可以添加的是对进入哲学生活所需的焦点变化的明确讨论。<em>关于纪元</em>的学说<em></em>，自然态度与现象学态度的区分，中和自然态度中的意向，世界的作用和世界信仰，都是对什么是哲学超然，什么是哲学思考的澄清。这些与还原相关的学说不是试图让我们强迫性地内省的令人费解的难题，也不是关于我们是否可以摆脱自我进入“外部”世界的困惑；它们是对哲学本质的澄清。它们有助于展示哲学话语、超验语与人类实践话语以及艺术和科学、世俗话语、自然态度的语言有何不同。如果理解得当，它们可以阐明前哲学生活和哲学生活。</p><p>Classical Greek and medieval thought understood that prephilosophical reason achieves truth and evidence, and that philosophical reflection comes afterward and does not disturb what goes before it. Aristotle did not tamper with the political life or with mathematics; he only tried to understand what they were and perhaps to clarify them to themselves. Phenomenology joins this classical understanding, but what it can add to it is the explicit discussion of the change of focus that is required to enter into the philosophical life. The doctrine about the <em>epochē</em>, the distinction between the natural and the phenomenological attitude, the idea of neutralizing the intentions in the natural attitude, the role of the world and world belief, are all clarifications of what it means to adopt philosophical detachment and to enter into philosophical thinking. These doctrines associated with the reduction are not mind-bending conundrums that try to make us obsessively introspective, or puzzles about whether we can get out of ourselves into the "extramental" world; they are clarifications of the nature of philosophy. They are useful in showing how philosophical discourse, transcendentalese, differs from the discourse of human practice and the arts and sciences, mundanese, the language of the natural attitude. When properly understood they can illuminate both the prephilosophical and the philosophical life.</p>

  <p>最后，先验还原不应被视为逃避存在问题或对存在作为存在的研究；恰恰相反。当我们从自然的态度转向现象学的态度时，我们提出了存在的问题，因为我们开始准确地按照事物被赋予我们的方式来看待事物，准确地按照它们的表现形式，准确地按照它们由“形式”决定的方式来看待事物，是事物的公开原则。我们开始根据事物的真相和证据来看待事物。这是看他们的存在。我们也开始将自我视为存在者被揭示的与格：我们将自我视为显化的与格。这是看它<em>的</em>存在，因为其存在的核心是探究事物的存在。“存在”不仅仅是“类物”；存在涉及披露或真相，而现象学主要在其真实的标题下着眼于存在。它将“人类”视为世界上真理出现的地方。通过其所有关于还原方法的笛卡尔式的评论，现象学能够恢复古老的存在问题，这总是新的。</p><p>Finally, the transcendental reduction should not be seen as an escape from the question of being or the study of being as being; quite the contrary. When we shift from the natural attitude to the phenomenological, we raise the question of being, because we begin to look at things precisely as they are given to us, precisely as they are manifested, precisely as they are determined by "form", which is the principle of disclosure in things. We begin to look at things in their truth and evidencing. This is to look at them in their being. We also begin to look at the self as the dative to whom beings are disclosed: we look at the self as the dative of manifestation. This is to look at it in <em>its</em> being, because the core of its being is to inquire into the being of things. "Being" is not just "thing-like"; being involves disclosure or truth, and phenomenology looks at being primarily under its rubric of being truthful. It looks at "human" being as the place in the world where truth occurs. Through all its Cartesian-sounding remarks about the ways to reduction, phenomenology is able to recover the ancient issue of being, which is always new.</p>

  Perception, Memory, and Imagination</h1>

  <p>我们现在对现象学分析是什么以及为什么它是哲学的有了一个概念。在检查立方体的感知时，我们还通过了此类分析的示例。我们已经考虑了部分和整体的结构、流形中的同一性以及存在与不存在在人类经验中所扮演的角色。我们现在可以开始通过发展更多的现象学描述来扩大所有这些主题。到目前为止，我们所做的只是初步的草图。我们现在将回到感知并更详细地研究它如何向我们呈现对象，以及它如何与意向性的衍生形式（例如记忆、想象和对未来的投射）相抗衡。</p><p>We now have an idea of what phenomenological analysis is and why it is philosophical. We have also gone through an example of such analysis in our examination of the perception of a cube. We have considered the role played in human experience by the structures of parts and wholes, identity in manifolds, and presence and absence. We can now begin to amplify all these themes by developing yet more phenomenological descriptions. What we have done so far have been only preliminary sketches. We will now go back to perception and examine in greater detail how it presents objects to us, and how it is played off against derivative forms of intentionality such as remembering, imagination, and projection into the future.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_5.xhtml.heading_id_3"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_5.xhtml.ch5_r"></a>记住</h2><h2><a></a>REMEMBERING</h2>

  <p>知觉直接向我们呈现一个对象，而这个对象总是以存在和不存在的混合形式给出。当一侧被赋予时，其他的就不存在了。物体的某些部分隐藏其他部分：正面隐藏背面，表面隐藏内部。如果这个物体是我们听到的，那么在一个地方听到它就排除了在另一个地方可以听到的声音方面。我们可以克服这种缺席，但代价是失去我们拥有的存在，而这些存在变得缺席。在这种存在与不存在的动态混合中，在这种呈现的多样性中，同一个对象不断地向我们呈现自己。身份是在不同于侧面、方面和轮廓的维度中给出的；身份永远不会作为侧面、方面或轮廓之一出现。</p><p>Perception directly presents an object to us, and this object is always given in a mixture of presences and absences. When one side is given, others are absent. Some parts of the object conceal other parts: the front hides the back, the surface hides the inside. If the object is one that we hear, then hearing it at one place excludes the aspects of sound that would be available at another. We can overcome such absences, but only at the cost of losing presences we have, which become absent. Throughout this dynamic blending of presence and absence, throughout this manifold of presentation, one and the same object continues to present itself to us. The identity is given in a dimension different from that of the sides, aspects, and profiles; the identity never shows up as one of the sides, aspects, or profiles.</p>

  <p>但是当对象被记住时，也可以给出身份。记忆提供了另一组表象，另一个流形，通过它我们得到了同一个对象。记忆涉及一种比感知过程中缺席双方的共同意图更为彻底的缺席，但它仍然呈现相同的对象。它呈现相同的对象，但具有新的意向层：如记忆中一样，如过去一样。</p><p>But the identity can also be given when the object is remembered. Remembering provides another set of appearances, another manifold through which one and the same object is given to us. Memory involves a much more radical kind of absence than does the cointending of absent sides during perception, but it still presents the same object. It presents the same object but with a new noematic layer: as remembered, as past.</p>

  <p>我们可能会试图以下列方式思考记忆：当我们记住某事时，我们会在脑海中唤起该事物的图像，并认出这幅图像呈现的是我们曾见过的同一事物。按照这种观点，记忆与看某人的照片并认出这个人是谁以及拍摄照片的环境并没有太大区别。唯一的区别是照片是在“心外”世界，而记忆图像是在“心内”世界。</p><p>We might be tempted to think of memory in the following way: when we remember something, we call up a mental image of the thing and recognize this picture as presenting the same thing we once saw. In this view, remembering would be not all that much different from looking at a photograph of someone and recognizing who the person is and the setting in which the photograph was taken. The only difference would be that the photograph is in the "extramental" world, while the memory image is in the "intramental" world.</p>

  <p>这种对记忆的解释是非常错误的。它混淆了记忆和另一种意向性，即想象。我们倾向于混淆这两种类型也就不足为奇了。似乎我们的脑海中确实有内在的图像，一旦我们了解了大脑，我们似乎不可避免地要假设某种图像在大脑中的某种屏幕上的某种投影。但是当我们考虑记忆中出现的身份类型时，这种解释的不连贯性就变得很明显了。</p><p>This interpretation of remembering is very wrong. It confuses remembering with another kind of intentionality, picturing. It is not surprising that we tend to confuse these two types; it does seem that we have inner images in the mind's eye, and once we learn about the brain it seems inevitable that we are going to postulate some sort of projection of some sort of image on some sort of screen in the brain. But the incoherence of this interpretation becomes obvious when we consider the type of identity that occurs in remembering.</p>

  <p>在描绘中，我们看着一个物体描绘另一个物体。我们看着这幅彩色画布或那张纸，从中我们看到了别的东西：一个女人，一个乡村景色。在记忆中，我们不会看一个描绘另一个的物体。我们只是直接“看到”或可视化对象。记忆更像是感知而不是想象。在记忆中，我看不到与我记忆中相似的东西；我记得那个物体本身，在另一个时间。如果我们被难以忘怀的记忆所困扰，严格来说，我们不应该说：“我无法摆脱那个形象！” 相反，我们应该惊呼，“我无法停止想象那个东西！”</p><p>In picturing, we look at one object that depicts another. We look at this piece of colored canvas or that piece of paper, and in it we see something else: a woman, a rustic scene. In remembering, we do not look at one object that depicts another. We simply "see" or visualize the object directly. Remembering is more like perceiving than like picturing something. In memory I do not see something that looks like what I remember; I remember that object itself, at another time. If we are pestered by a memory that will not leave us, we should, strictly speaking, not say, "I can't get that image out of my mind!" Rather, we should exclaim, "I can't stop visualizing that thing!"</p>

  <p>假设我们愿意说我们在记忆时不看内部图片；我们还有什么要说的？从先验的观点来看，我们如何表达记忆中发生了什么？如果我们不看内在的画面，为什么看起来我们在看，我们怎么能解释似乎出现在我们心灵之眼或心灵之耳中的东西呢？我们对这些问题的回答可以这样说：我们作为记忆储存起来的不是我们在某一时刻感知到的事物的图像。相反，我们自己储存了早期的看法。我们储存了我们曾经经历过的看法。然后，当我们真正记住时，我们不会唤起图像；相反，我们唤起那些早期的看法。当这些知觉被唤起并重新制定时，它们会带来它们的对象，它们的客观相关物。在记忆中发生的事情是我们重温早先的知觉，并且我们记得当时给定的对象。我们捕捉了我们有意生活的早期部分。我们让它重新焕发生机。这就是为什么记忆会如此怀旧。它们不仅仅是提醒，它们是重温的活动。过去连同其中的事物再次苏醒到房间的另一部分，从那里看。他们是重温的活动。过去连同其中的事物再次苏醒到房间的另一部分，从那里看。他们是重温的活动。过去连同其中的事物再次苏醒到房间的另一部分，从那里看。</p><p>Suppose we are willing to say that we do not look at internal pictures when we remember; what else are we supposed to say? How can we express, from the transcendental viewpoint, what happens in remembering? If we do not look at inner pictures, why does it seem that we do, and how can we account for what seems to show up in our mind's eye or our mind's ear? Our reply to such questions can be put this way: what we store up as memories is not images of things we perceived at one time. Rather, we store up the earlier perceptions themselves. We store up the perceptions we once lived through. Then, when we actually remember, we do not call up images; rather, we call up those earlier perceptions. When these perceptions are called up and reenacted, they bring along their objects, their objective correlates. What happens in remembering is that we relive earlier perceptions, and we remember the objects as they were given at that time. We capture that earlier part of our intentional life. We bring it to life again. That is why memories can be so nostalgic. They are not just reminders, they are the activity of reliving. The past comes to life again, along with the things in it, but it comes to life with a special kind of absence, one that we cannot bridge by going anywhere, as we can bridge the absences of the other side of the table by going over to another part of the room and looking at it from there.</p>

  <p>一种新的存在与不存在的混合通过记忆产生，一种新的外观多样性，通过它可以在其身份中给出一个和相同的对象。在记忆中，我们不仅重新激活了一个对象，而且重新激活了一个对象，它当时在那里呈现自己，但此时此地再次呈现自己，但只是作为过去。这是被记住的对象所采用的向列形式，一种不同于感知对象的形式，感知对象只存在于此时此地，而不存在于彼时。我们可以用以下相当巧妙的方式来区分想象和记忆之间的区别：当我们看到一幅图片时，我们<em>看到的东西似乎</em>是别的东西；但在回忆中，我们<em>似乎看到了</em>别的东西。这个神秘的表述抓住了两种形式的意向性之间的区别。</p><p>A new blend of presences and absences arises through memory, a new manifold of appearance through which one and the same object can be given in its identity. In memory we reactivate not just an object but an object as presenting itself there and then, and yet presenting itself again here and now, but only as past. This is the noematic form that remembered objects take on, a form different from that of perceived objects, which are only here and now, not there and then. We could put the difference between picturing and remembering in the following rather tricky way: when we see a picture, we <em>see something that seems</em> to be something else; but in remembering, we <em>seem to be seeing</em> something else. This cryptic formulation catches the difference between the two forms of intentionality.</p>

  <p>有人可能会反驳说：“这种事情是胡说八道。我怎么能重温过去的感觉？当时的同一件事怎么会在此时此地再次给我？这是不可能的，必须有一个画面我看着它”。但这种体验的重温正是记忆的本质。这非常了不起，但这就是我们的联系方式。我们可以重温我们有意识生活的早期部分，我们可以重新激活意向性。显然，这必须有某种神经学基础。与知觉有关的神经活动以某种方式被重新激活，有意识的知觉被重新制定，并且它呈现出与在其原始场所具有的完全相同的对象。如果我们要忠实于现象，就必须如实描述它，而不是将我们的愿望投射到它上面。我们确实通过记忆延伸到过去；我们带回了一个逝去的世界和其中的一种情况。我们可以活在过去，也可以活在现在。事实上，除非我们通过记忆获得对过去的一般感觉，否则我们如何将“心理图片”解释为我们过去所见事物的图像？我们怎么会生起过去的感觉呢？正如我们在现象学上描述的那样，过去的维度或地平线是通过记忆给予我们的。作为我们过去看到的东西的图像？我们怎么会生起过去的感觉呢？正如我们在现象学上描述的那样，过去的维度或地平线是通过记忆给予我们的。作为我们过去看到的东西的图像？我们怎么会生起过去的感觉呢？正如我们在现象学上描述的那样，过去的维度或地平线是通过记忆给予我们的。</p><p>Someone might object, "This sort of thing is nonsense. How could I relive a past perception? How could the very same thing, there and then, be given to me again here and now? This is impossible; there must be a picture of it that I look at". But such reliving of an experience is just what remembering is. It is quite marvelous, but that is how we are wired. We can relive an earlier part of our conscious life, we can reactivate an intentionality. Clearly, there must be some sort of neurological basis for this. The neural activity that is involved in perception is somehow reactivated, the conscious perception is reenacted, and it presents the very same object it had at its original venue. Ifwe are to be faithful to the phenomenon, we have to describe it as it is and not project our wishes onto it. We do stretch into the past through memory; we bring back an elapsed world and a situation in it. We can live in the past as well as in the present. In fact, unless we had the general sense of the past that comes to us through memory, how could we interpret a "mental picture" as an image of something we saw in the past? How would the sense of pastness ever arise for us? The very dimension or horizon of the past is given to us through remembering, as we have described it phenomenologically.</p>

  <p>在记忆中，曾经被感知的对象被赋予过去，如记忆中的那样。此外，它是按照当时所感知的那样给予的；如果我看到一场车祸，我会从我看到的相同角度、相同的侧面、方面和轮廓来记住它。又一次发生了同样的事故，如果我必须就事故作证，我可能不得不重新运行该事件几次，以试图将细节记在脑海中。（“试着记住：行人是在红绿灯改变之前还是之后进入街道？”）当我重新运行事件时，我不会检查内部图片；我试着再次运用我当时的知觉，把我看到的东西带回来，我按照我们记住事情时的方式来做。当然，错误确实会悄悄出现；我经常将事情投射到我想看到或我认为我应该看到的记忆事件中。我在记忆和想象之间摇摆不定。众所周知，记忆是难以捉摸的。它们不是防篡改的，但这就是内存的局限性。因为记忆经常错误并不意味着它们不存在或它们总是错误的。只是因为有回忆，才会有的时候是骗人的。此外，他们的对与错方式与认知上的对与错方式不同。一种新的流形，一种新的身份可能性，由记忆引入，新的错误可能性也出现了。现象学的任务是找出所讨论的结构，并将它们与那些在知觉和其他类型的意向性中起作用的结构区分开来。</p><p>In memory the object that was once perceived is given as past, as remembered. Moreover, it is given as it was then perceived; if I saw an automobile accident, I remember it from the same angle, with the same sides, aspects, and profiles, from which I saw it. One and the same accident is given to me again, and if I have to testify about the accident, I may have to rerun the event a few times to try to bring the details back to mind. ("Try to remember: Did the pedestrian step into the street before or after the traffic light changed?") When I do rerun the event, I do not inspect an inner picture; I try to exercise again the perception I had then and bring back the thing I saw, and I do this the way it is done when we remember things. Of course, errors do creep in; often I project things into the remembered event that I want to see or that I think I should be seeing. I oscillate between memory and imagination. Memories are notoriously elusive; they are not tamper proof, but such are the limitations of memory. Because memories are often wrong does not mean that they do not exist or that they are always wrong. Only because there are memories can they be sometimes deceptive. Furthermore, their way of being right and their way of being wrong are different from the ways of being right and wrong in perception. A new manifold, a new possibility of identity, is introduced by memory, and new possibilities of error arise as well. It is the task of phenomenology to bring out the structures in question and to distinguish them from those at work in perception and in other kinds of intentionality.</p>

  <p>到目前为止，在这种记忆处理中，我们一直专注于意向方面，即记住的对象。当我们说记忆不是图像的感知而是感知的复兴时，我们已经提到了理性的一面。但我们必须更进一步地转向主观，谈谈作为记忆代理人的自我。对象的新维度通过记忆出现，但自我的新维度也会出现。</p><p>So far in this treatment of remembering we have been focusing on the noematic side, on the object remembered. We have mentioned the noetic side when we said that remembering is not the perception of an image but a revival of a perception. But we must move a bit farther to the subjective and talk about the self who is the agent of remembering. New dimensions of the object arise through memory, but new dimensions of the self arise as well.</p>

  <p>当我想起过去的事情时，我也将自己置身于过去。此时此地的我，坐在房间里的椅子上，感知着我周围的墙壁、窗户和声音，与那时的我，昨天在威斯康星大道和马科姆街的拐角处看到一起事故发生，或者我参与在上周痛苦的告别中。我早先知觉的复兴涉及我自己在那个时候的知觉的复兴。正如过去的客体再次重见天日，作为那次经历的代理人的我过去的自我也再次重见天日。通过记忆，在记忆自我和记忆自我之间引入了区别。</p><p>When I remember something past, I also displace myself into the past. A distinction arises between me here and now, sitting in a chair in a room and perceiving the walls, windows, and sounds around me, and me then, watching an accident occur on the corner of Wisconsin Avenue and Macomb Street yesterday, or me involved in a painful farewell last week. The revival of my earlier perception involves a revival of myself as perceiving at that time. Just as the past object is brought to light again, so my past self as an agent of that experience is brought to light again. Through memory a distinction is introduced between the remembering self and the remembered self.</p>

  <p>我们可能会忍不住说，我的“真实自我”就是此时此地的那个人，那个做记忆的人。重新激活的自我只是某种形象。但这是不准确的。更恰当地说，我的自我是在现在记忆中的我和当时记忆中的我之间构成的身份。我的自我，自我，恰恰建立在感知和记忆之间发生的相互作用中。这种将自己转移到过去的做法为我的精神或内心生活引入了一个全新的维度。我不局限于此时此地；我不仅可以提及过去（以及未来，正如我们将要看到的），而且我还可以通过记忆生活在其中。</p><p>We might be tempted to say that my "real self" is the one here and now, the one doing the remembering. The reactivated self is only an image of some sort. But this would be inaccurate. It would be more appropriate to say that my self is the identity constituted between myself now remembering and myself then remembered. My self, the self, is established precisely in the interplay that occurs between perception and memory. This displacement of myself into the past introduces a whole new dimension into my mental or inner life. I am not confined to the here and now; I can not only refer to the past (and to the future, as we shall see), but I can also live in it through memory.</p>

  <p>有时生活在过去可能会很麻烦。如果我们做了让我们深感羞愧的事情，或者如果我们陷入了创伤性事件，我们可能无法摆脱这些经历。它们帮助构成我的自我，我无法摆脱它们；无论我们旅行多远，我们都会随身携带。我们粘在他们身上。登山家彼得·希拉里 (Peter Hillary) 谈到他在喜马拉雅山与死亡擦肩而过的经历时说：“幸存有时是这一生中最痛苦的角色。你……一次又一次地在脑海中重演那些结束的场景“（“珠穆朗玛峰是强大的，我们是脆弱的”，<em>纽约时报</em>，星期六，1996 年 5 月 25 日，p. AI9)' 一名参与杀害囚犯的男子说，“我在布宜诺斯艾利斯的广场上睡了很多个晚上，拿着一瓶酒，试图忘记。我毁了我的生活。我必须有收音机或电视任何时候都开着，或者做一些让我分心的事情。有时我害怕一个人思考”（“阿根廷人讲述倾倒‘肮脏战争’俘虏”，纽约<em>时报</em>, 星期一, 1995 年 3 月 13 日, p. 人工智能）。引述一位出过车祸的人说：“几个月来，我以慢动作重温车祸”。当我们在记忆中重演事物时，我们有点像旁观者，但我们不仅仅是旁观者，我们不像是单独场景的观众。我们正在参与当时发生的事情。我们是参与行动的人；记忆将我们带回当时的行动和体验。没有记忆和它带来的位移，无论好坏，我们都不会完全实现自我和人类。同一性综合发生在记忆的意向侧和意向侧。</p><p>Sometimes this living in the past can be troublesome. If we have done things we are deeply ashamed of, or if we were caught up in traumatic incidents, we may be unable to rid ourselves of the experiences in question. They help constitute my self, and I cannot cut loose from them; no matter how far away we travel, we take them with us. We are glued to them. The mountaineer Peter Hillary, speaking of brushes with death he experienced in the Himalayas, says, "Surviving is sometimes the most painful role to play in this life. You ... re-enact in your mind those closing scenes again and again and again" ("Everest is Mighty, We Are Fragile", <em>New York Times</em>, Saturday, May 25,1996, p. AI9)' A man involved in the killing of prisoners says, "I have spent many nights sleeping in the plazas of Buenos Aires with a bottle of wine, trying to forget. I have ruined my life. I have to have the radio or television on at all times or something to distract me. Sometimes I am afraid to be alone with my thoughts" ("Argentine Tells of Dumping 'Dirty War' Captives", <em>New York Times</em>, Monday, March 13, 1995, p. AI). A man who had been in an automobile accident is quoted as saying, "For months, I relived the crash in slow motion". We are something like spectators when we reenact things in memory, but we are not just spectators, and we are not like viewers of a separate scene. We are engaged in what happened then. We are the same ones who were involved in the action; the memory brings us back as acting and experiencing there and then. Without memory and the displacement it brings we would not be fully actualized as selves and as human beings, for good and for ill. Identity syntheses occur on both the noetic and the noematic side of memory.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_5.xhtml.heading_id_4"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_5.xhtml.ch5_ia"></a>想象与期待</h2><h2><a></a>IMAGINATION AND ANTICIPATION</h2>

  <p>记忆和想象在结构上非常相似，并且很容易滑入另一个。我们在记忆中发现的相同类型的自我或自我的置换也发生在想象中。在这两种意向性形式中，此时此地的我可以在精神上生活在另一个时间和地点：在记忆中，当时是特定的和过去的，但在想象中它处于一种无处和“无时”的状态，但即使在想象中它也是如此与我实际居住的此时此地不同。即使我生活在真实的世界中，我也会流离失所到一个想象的世界中。此外，一个想象中的对象，一个想象中的对象，很可能来自我的真实感知或我的记忆，但它现在被投射到没有发生的情况和交易中。</p><p>Memory and imagination are structurally very similar, and one easily slips into the other. The same sort of displacement of the ego or the self that we find in memory also occurs in imagination. In both forms of intentionality, I here and now can mentally live in another place and time: in memory the there and then is specific and past, but in imagination it is in a kind of nowhere and "nowhen", but even in imagination it is different from the here and now I actually inhabit. I am displaced into an imaginary world, even as I live in the real one. Furthermore, an object in imagination, an imaginary object, might well be taken from my real perceptions or from my memories, but it is now projected into situations and transactions that did not occur.</p>

  <p>记忆和想象之间的主要区别在于它们各自所特有的论证方式。记忆与信念一起运作。我唤起的或闯入我的记忆是关于真实发生的事情以及我确实经历和做过的事情。我不是先有记忆，再加上信念；相反，它们最初是伴随着信念而来的（关于它是怎样的），就像我的感知来自于信念（关于它是怎样的）一样。我们必须努力消除记忆中的信念，或将其改变为另一种形式，例如怀疑或否认。</p><p>The major difference between memory and imagination lies in the doxic modality proper to each. Memory operates with belief. The memories I call up, or that intrude on me, are of what really happened and what I did experience and do. It is not the case that I first have the memories and then add belief to them; rather, they originally come with belief (of how it was), just as my perceptions come with belief (of how it is). We have to make an effort to delete the belief in memory, or to change it into another modality, such as doubt or denial.</p>

  <p>另一方面，想象力充满了一种信念的悬置，转向“好像”的模式。这种模态变化是一种中和，但不同于先验还原中发挥作用的那种。在想象中，我将自己置身于一个想象的世界中，但我周围的真实世界仍然是我所相信的、默认的想象环境，我从中流离失所。我想象的一切都充满了不真实感；想象中的事件不会让我为过去的可怕事件给我带来真正的遗憾或恐惧。可能是过于活跃的想象力会扭曲我的记忆，让我认为有些事情发生了，但实际上并没有发生，</p><p>Imagination, on the other hand, is pervaded by a kind of suspension of belief, a turn in to the mode of "as if". This modal change is a kind of neutralizing, but one different from the kind that comes into play in the transcendental reduction. In imagination I displace myself into an imaginary world, but the real world around me remains as the believed-in, default context within which I imagine, from which I am displaced. All the things I imagine are pervaded with a sense of unreality; imagined events do not strap me with the true regret or terror that horrible events from my past can inflict on me. It may be the case that an overactive imagination can skew my memories and make me think that some things happened that did not, but such a breach of the boundary between memory and imagination is possible only if imagination and memory are indeed two different kinds of intentionalities.</p>

  <p>然而，即使在我想象的时候，适用于所有意向性的身份综合仍然有效。一个虚构的对象通过对它的多次想象而保持不变。即使在想象中，也存在以身份为核心的流形。我们可以把我们实际感知到的事物加入到想象的场景中，而事物仍然是一样的；或者我们可以编造纯粹虚构的事物并将它们放入虚构的例程中，它们也自始至终保持不变。显然，想象的对象没有感知对象的厚实感，因为我们可以将它们幻想成各种不可能的情况，但即使在我们的想象中我们也不是完全自由的；我们想象的事物限制了我们对它们的幻想。如果事物要保持其自身，则无法想象关于它的某些事物；如果他们被提议，事情就会变成别的东西。我可以想象一只猫在空中飞翔（虽然我不记得有一只猫这样做过），但我无法真正想象一只猫被当作一首诗来读，或者一只猫微笑着和我说话。猫不是那种可以大声朗读的东西，会笑会说话的猫就不再只是一只猫了。以这种方式混合“想法”甚至图像是没有意义的。</p><p>However, even when I imagine, the identity synthesis that is proper to all intentionality remains in force. An imaginary object stays one and the same through many imaginings of it. There is a manifold with an identity at its core even in imagination. We can take things we have actually perceived and enroll them into imaginary scenarios, and the things remain the same; or we can fabricate purely imaginary things and put them into an imaginary routine, and they too remain the same throughout. Obviously, imaginary objects do not have the thick solidity of perceived objects, since we can fantasize them into all sorts of improbable situations, but we are not totally free even in our imaginings; the things we imagine put some restrictions on what we can fantasize about them. If the thing is to remain itself, certain things cannot be imagined about it; if they were to be proposed, the thing would become something else. I can imagine a cat flying through the air (although I cannot remember a cat doing this), but I cannot truly imagine a cat being read as a poem, or a cat smiling and talking to me. A cat is not the kind of thing that can be read out loud, and a cat that smiled and spoke would not be just a cat any longer. It makes no sense to blend the "ideas" or even the images in that way.</p>

  <p>因此，想象力以一种不同于知觉和记忆的方式运作；它是不真实的，只是“好像”。然而，有一种想象形式必须变得现实，必须回到信念模式。当我们计划某事时，当我们想象自己处于某种未来状态时，我们可以通过我们所做的选择来实现这种想象。这是一种预期的想象形式，可以说，它把我们从纯粹的幻想中带回现实。假设我们想买房子。我们看了几个房子，将可能的选择缩小到两个或三个，然后我们考虑购买哪个。我们的部分思考包括想象我们自己住在每一所房子里，使用房间，在外面散步等等。这样的投射回到类似于记忆的doxic模式；我们回到了一种信念模式，它与我们想象中的现实感相关联。如果我们真的要买房子，我们就不会想象自己像气球一样漂浮在它上面，或者像白蚁一样爬过墙壁。那种虚幻的投射，对于梦想和幻想是可以的，但对于买房却毫无帮助。（有趣的是，电视广告是如何利用幻想和严肃投影之间的差异的。它展示了各种引人入胜但完全不真实的场景——一辆被美女包围的汽车，一辆飞越大峡谷的卡车，一场浪漫的邂逅通过牙膏 - 目的是让观众真实地想象自己进入购买产品的未来。</p><p>Imagination therefore works in a doxic modality different from that of perception and memory; it is unreal, only "as if". However, there is a form of imagination that has to get realistic, that has to move back into the mode of belief. It is the kind of imagination we engage in when we are planning something, when we imagine ourselves in some future condition that we can bring about through the choices that we make. This is an anticipatory form of imagination, and it brings us back to earth, so to speak, from the flights of pure fantasy. Suppose that we wish to buy a house. We look at several homes, we narrow the possible options down to two or three, and then we deliberate about which to buy. Part of our deliberation involves imagining ourselves living in each of the houses, using the rooms, walking outside, and the like. Such projections come back to a doxic mode analogous to that of memory; we come back to a mode of belief, correlated with a sense of reality in what we imagine. If we are serious about buying the house, we do not imagine ourselves floating over it like a balloon or crawling through the walls like a termite. That sort of imaginary projection is all right for dreams and fantasy, but it is not helpful in buying a house. (It is interesting to note how television advertising takes advantage of the difference between fantasy and serious projection. It displays all sorts of attractive but totally unreal situations — a car surrounded by beautiful people, a truck flying over the Grand Canyon, a romantic encounter facilitated by toothpaste — with the intention of getting the viewer to realistically imagine himself into a future in which he buys the product.)</p>

  <p>自己在新情境中的超前体验是自我的置换，却是记忆的倒置。我们没有重温早期的体验，而是期待未来的体验。由于未来尚未确定，我们可以现实地预测自己在多个可能的未来，而不仅仅是一个：我们想象如果做出选择我们会怎样，并且在这一点上我们仍然可以想象自己在几种不同的情况下. 我们以不同的方式将自己投射到完美的未来。在买房这件事上，我们设想自己住在三四个不同的房子里；我们试穿它们的尺寸。我们可能会在实际参观房屋时这样做，或者在之后做白日梦时这样做。</p><p>The advance experience of ourselves in a new situation is a displacement of the self, but it is the reverse of memory. Instead of reviving an earlier experience, we anticipate a future one. Since the future has not yet been determined, we can realistically anticipate ourselves in several possible futures and not only one: we imagine how we will have been if the choice has been made, and we can at this point still imagine ourselves in several different circumstances. We project ourselves into the future perfect in different ways. In the enterprise of buying a house, we project ourselves as living in three or four different homes; we try them on for size. We might do so while actually visiting the houses or else afterward, when we daydream about what it would be like.</p>

  <p>我们可能认为这种自我投射是理所当然的，并假设任何人都可以轻松地执行它们，但在某些情况下，需要相当大的自我力量才能有效地执行它们。对于某些人来说，有时现实地想象自己进入新环境的压力太大了；他们在情绪上崩溃并感到困惑，他们的自我没有灵活性和身份来投射到他们尚未经历过的环境中。一想到要搬到新地方、换工作或离开某个人，他们可能会感到恐慌。死亡的恐惧部分在于我们的想象力在面对它时变得一片空白。</p><p>We may take such projections of the self for granted and assume that anyone can easily perform them, but in some situations it takes considerable ego strength to be able to carry them out effectively. For some people at some times the strain of realistically imagining themselves into new circumstances is too great; they collapse emotionally and get all confused, and their self does not have the flexibility plus the identity to project into circumstances they have not yet lived through. They may panic at the thought of moving to a new place or changing a job or leaving a certain person. Part of the terror of death lies in the fact that our imagination turns blank in the face of it.</p>

  <p>有人可能会反对，认为对未来行动的审议比这更理智。当我们深思熟虑时，我们会设定目标，列出优点和缺点，并找出实现我们想要的目标的方法。我们权衡利弊并做出决定。这种理性的计算确实是深思熟虑的一部分，但它是对未来的深思熟虑的全部意义首先是由我们的想象力投射给我们的。只有当我们意识到这些信息与我们未来的方式有关时，利弊清单才适用，而正是我们富有想象力的预测为我们打开了那个维度。我们提前对未来的自己进行采样。我们想象某些希望得到的满足。在某些情况下，我们可能会发现我们的预期是完全错误的；事情可能不会像我们想象的那样发展；但这样的错误是可能的，只是因为我们首先处理的是未来。未来的新维度具有一系列可能性，可以通过我们所做的选择确定为现实，它不是通过理性的列表，而是通过富有想象力的预测向我们敞开的。因为我们可以想象，我们才能活在未来。富有想象力的投射也进入了推动我们做出这种或那种选择的动机；俗话说，我们对一个特定的未来比对其他人拥有完美的未来感到更“舒服”，因此我们倾向于做出导致那个未来的选择。智力清单与富有想象力的预期相悖。但这样的错误是可能的，只是因为我们首先处理的是未来。未来的新维度具有一系列可能性，可以通过我们所做的选择确定为现实，它不是通过理性的列表，而是通过富有想象力的预测向我们敞开的。因为我们可以想象，我们才能活在未来。富有想象力的投射也进入了推动我们做出这种或那种选择的动机；俗话说，我们对一个特定的未来比对其他人拥有完美的未来感到更“舒服”，因此我们倾向于做出导致那个未来的选择。智力清单与富有想象力的预期相悖。但这样的错误是可能的，只是因为我们首先处理的是未来。未来的新维度具有一系列可能性，可以通过我们所做的选择确定为现实，它不是通过理性的列表，而是通过富有想象力的预测向我们敞开的。因为我们可以想象，我们才能活在未来。富有想象力的投射也进入了推动我们做出这种或那种选择的动机；俗话说，我们对一个特定的未来比对其他人拥有完美的未来感到更“舒服”，因此我们倾向于做出导致那个未来的选择。智力清单与富有想象力的预期相悖。向我们开放的不是理性的清单，而是富有想象力的预测。因为我们可以想象，我们才能活在未来。富有想象力的投射也进入了推动我们做出这种或那种选择的动机；俗话说，我们对一个特定的未来比对其他人拥有完美的未来感到更“舒服”，因此我们倾向于做出导致那个未来的选择。智力清单与富有想象力的预期相悖。向我们开放的不是理性的清单，而是富有想象力的预测。因为我们可以想象，我们才能活在未来。富有想象力的投射也进入了推动我们做出这种或那种选择的动机；俗话说，我们对一个特定的未来比对其他人拥有完美的未来感到更“舒服”，因此我们倾向于做出导致那个未来的选择。智力清单与富有想象力的预期相悖。所以我们倾向于做出导致那个选择的选择。智力清单与富有想象力的预期相悖。所以我们倾向于做出导致那个选择的选择。智力清单与富有想象力的预期相悖。</p><p>One might object that deliberation about future action is more intellectual than this. When we deliberate, we set down our goals, we draw up lists of advantages and disadvantages, and we figure out the means by which we can attain what we want. We weigh the pros and cons and make our decision. Such rational calculation is indeed part of deliberation, but the whole sense of its being deliberation about the future is given to us first of all by our imaginative projection. The list of pros and cons only applies if we realize that this information has to do with the way we will be in the future, and it is our imaginative projections that open that dimension to us. We sample in advance our future selves. We imagine certain wished-for satisfactions. We may in some cases find that our anticipations were quite wrong; things may not turn out as we imagined they would; but such errors are possible only because we are dealing with the future in the first place. That new dimension, of a future that has a range of possibilities that can be determined into actuality by the choices we make, is opened up to us not by rational lists, but by imaginative projections. Only because we can imagine can we live in the future. And the imaginative projections also enter into the motivations that nudge us into this choice or that; we feel more "comfortable", as the saying goes, with one particular future perfect than with others, and so we are inclined to make the choices that lead to that one. The intellectual lists are played off against the imaginative anticipation.</p>

  <p>流离失所的正式结构，在其中我此时此地可以想象自己或记住自己或预期自己进入某个地方和某个时间的情况，从而使我们能够生活在未来和过去，以及无人区——自由想象的土地。这些被取代的意识形式是感知的衍生形式，感知为它们提供了原材料和内容。此外，情况并非如此，我们首先只是简单地生活在感知中，然后在某些时刻决定投入位移；相反，感知的自我和流离失所的自我总是在相互对抗。如果不与想象、记忆和预期形成对比，即使是知觉也不能成为它的本来面目。所有这些形式都与意识的初始未分化状态区分开来。介绍与每种形式相关的 doxic 模态的差异也需要一些技巧。知道有些经历是真实的过去，知道有些只是幻想，不是每个人都能做到的。许多人认为梦和白日梦是对不寻常事物的真实感知。</p><p>The formal structure of displacement, in which I here and now can imagine myself or remember myself or anticipate myself into a situation somewhere and sometime else, thus allows us to live in the future and the past, as well as in the no-man's-land of free imagination. These displaced forms of consciousness are derivative upon perception, which gives the raw material and content for them. It is not the case, moreover, that we first of all live simply in perception, then at some moments decide to plunge into displacements; rather, the perceiving and the displaced selves are always being played off against one another. Even perception cannot be what it is without being contrasted with imagination, memory, and anticipation. All these forms differentiate themselves from an initial undifferentiated condition of consciousness. It also takes some sophistication to introduce the differences in doxic modality associated with each form. To know that some experiences are truly past, to know that some are just fantasy, is not achieved by everyone. Many people think that dreams and daydreams are true perceptions of unusual kinds of things.</p>

  <p>每当我们生活在刚才描述的那种内在位移中时，可以说，我们生活在两条平行的轨道上。我们生活在我们周围世界的直接性中，这是感知给我们的，但我们也生活在流离失所的自我的世界中，即记忆或想象或预期的世界。有时我们会越来越多地陷入其中的一个或另一个：我们可能会被周围的事物所包围，以至于我们失去了对它的所有想象力，或者我们可能会越来越多地陷入遐想和白日梦，成为实际上，但从未完全与我们周围的世界脱节。此外，我们储存在我们内心的想象意图有助于融合和修改我们的感知。我们以某种方式看人脸，我们以某种方式看建筑物和风景，因为当我们看到新的东西时，我们以前看到的东西会重新焕发活力，并对给我们的东西产生偏见。位移允许这种情况发生。</p><p>Whenever we live in the kind of inner displacement just described, we live, so to speak, in two parallel tracks. We live in the immediacy of our surrounding world, which is perceptually given to us, but we also live in the world of the displaced self, the remembered or imagined or anticipated world. Sometimes we can drift as a more and more into one or other of these: we might get so wrapped up with what is immediately around us that we lose all imaginative detachment from it, or we may drift more and more into reverie and daydreaming, becoming practically, but never entirely, disconnected from the world around us. Furthermore, the imaginative intentions we have stored up within us serve to blend with and modify the perceptions we have. We see faces in a certain way, we see buildings and landscapes in a certain way, because what we have seen before comes back to life when we see something new and puts a slant on what is given to us. Displacement allows this to happen.</p>

  <p>当记忆、想象和预期与知觉区分开来时，自我和客体，经验的主观和客观两极，都会呈现出更多的表象。所有这些结构和放大都以自然的态度运作，但它们可以从先验的、现象学的态度来认识和描述。</p><p>Both the self and the object, both the subjective and objective poles of experience, take on a much greater reservoir of manifolds of appearance when memory, imagination, and anticipation are differentiated from perception. All these structures and amplifications operate in the natural attitude, but they can be recognized and described from the transcendental, phenomenological attitude.</p>

  <p>在本章结束时，展示第 4 章中区分的自然态度和现象学态度如何各自以不同的方式处理记忆可能会有所帮助。以自然的态度，过去已死去；它肯定不存在了。自然的态度被当下吞没了。在这种态度下，我们拒绝将任何存在归因于过去，因此当我们试图解释记忆时，我们倾向于将某些东西（图像，记忆的想法）作为过去的现在替代品。我们四处寻找可以代表我们记得的事件的东西。因此，试图从自然态度内部处理记忆现象会导致我们对过去经验的哲学扭曲。然而，从先验的角度来看，凭借对在场和缺席的更精细和差异化的理解，我们能够认识到缺席的过去对我们的特殊存在。我们看到没有必要将图片作为过去对象的一种替代品，事实上，这样做是不可能的。正如我们现在所看到的，这样的记忆图像是不连贯的。</p><p>It might be helpful, at the close of this chapter, to show how the natural and the phenomenological attitudes, which were distinguished in Chapter 4, each approaches memory in a different way. To the natural attitude, the past is dead and gone; it is definitely not there any longer. The natural attitude is swallowed up by the present. In this attitude we resist attributing any presence to the past, and therefore when we try to explain memory we are inclined to posit something (an image, an idea of memory) as a present substitute for the past. We look around for a thing to stand in for the event that we remember. Thus, trying to handle the phenomenon of memory from within the natural attitude leads to a philosophical distortion of our experience of the past. From the transcendental perspective, however, with its more refined and differentiated understanding of presence and absence, we are able to recognize the special kind of presence that the absent past has for us. We see that there is no need to posit a picture as a kind of surrogate for the past object, and that, indeed, it is impossible to do so. Such memory images, as we now can see, are incoherences.</p>

  <p>我们可能还会观察到，记忆中过去的维度揭示了我们在感知中对现在的体验。因为我们知道事物可以过去，所以当它们被提供给我们时，我们可以注意它们的存在：它们现在被提供为尚未流逝到暂时的不在场。不仅他们出现在我们面前；他们的存在本身就呈现给我们。我们变得能够区分事物和事物的存在。然而，再一次，如果我们试图从自然态度中处理这种存在，我们将把它变成另一件事（感官数据，大脑中的图像），因为自然态度倾向于实体化它所关注的任何东西。事物的存在（以及不存在）是如此微妙和脆弱，如此接近于虚无，只有现象学的态度，凭借其微妙的存在感，可以找到合适的术语和语法来表达它。自然的态度，在这些事情上相当笨手笨脚，总是在寻找一个物的替身来调解我们作为与格与我们在场和不在场的事物之间的关系。</p><p>We might also observe that the dimension of the past in memory sheds light on the experience of the present we have in perception. Because we are aware that things can be past, we can advert to their presence when they are given to us: they now are given as not yet having elapsed into temporal absence. It is not only they that are present to us; their presence itself becomes present to us. We become able to distinguish between a thing and the presence of a thing. Once again, however, if we try to handle this presence from within the natural attitude, we will turn it into another thing (a sensory datum, an image in the brain), because the natural attitude tends to substantialize whatever it is concerned with. The presence (as well as the absence) of things is so subtle and fragile, so close to nothing, that only the phenomenological attitude, with its sense of the delicacy of presencing, can find the proper terms and grammar to express it. The natural attitude, rather ham-handed in these matters, always looks for a thingly stand-in to mediate between us as datives and the things that are present and absent to us.</p>

  <p>我们已经考虑了知觉及其变体，但我们检查过的所有变体都属于我们的“内部”生活：记忆、想象和预期。我们经验的这种内部重演并不是意向性发生变化的唯一领域。感知让我们接触到世界上的事物，而我们直接解释世界提供给我们的物体的方式可能会发生变化。</p><p>We have considered perception and its variants, but all the variants we have examined belong to our "internal" life: memory, imagination, and anticipation. This internal reenactment of our experiences is not the only domain in which changes in intentionality occur. Perception puts us in touch with things in the world, and variations can take place in how we directly interpret the objects that the world offers us.</p>

  <p>有时我们只是接受给我们的对象（一棵树，一只猫）。然后我们进行简单的感知。但有时我们会改变我们对待被呈现事物的方式：我们有一些声音或标记给我们，但我们不仅将它们当作声音或标记，而且将它们当作文字；我们有一块木板给了我们，我们把它当作一幅画；我们有一小堆石头给我们，我们把它当作路标。在这些情况下，我们添加并因此修改了仍然作为此类意向性基础的感知。我们引入了基于感知的新意图。我们继续感知标记、木头和石头，但除了感知它们之外，我们还以一种新的方式意向它们。当然，这些更高的意向性与那些在记忆、想象和预期中发挥作用的意向性截然不同，</p><p>Sometimes we just accept the object that is given to us (a tree, a cat). We are then engaged in simple perception. But sometimes we modify the way we take the thing being presented: we have some sounds or marks given to us, but we take them not just as sounds or marks, but as words; we have a panel of wood given to us, and we take it as a picture; we have a small pile of stones given to us, and we take it as a trail marker. In these cases we add to and hence modify the perception that remains as the base for such intentionalities. We introduce new intentionalities founded upon perceptions. We continue to perceive the marks, the wood, and the stones, but besides just perceiving them we intend them in a new way. These higher intentionalities, of course, are quite different from those at work in memory, imagination, and anticipation, which are internal reenactments of perception, not intentions built upon it.</p>

  <p>我们将在本章中研究的新型意向性将使我们有更多的流形，我们可以通过这些流形来识别我们遇到的对象，还有更多的流形，我们可以在更多的流形中建立我们自己作为人的身份。</p><p>The new kinds of intentionality we will study in this chapter will allow us still more manifolds through which we can identify the objects that we encounter, and still more manifolds within which we establish our own identity as human persons.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_6.xhtml.heading_id_3"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_6.xhtml.ch6_pw"></a>文字的存在</h2><h2><a></a>THE PRESENCE OF WORDS</h2>

  <p>假设我们正在看一张上面刻有装饰的纸：交织的花饰覆盖在它的表面。我们感知并欣赏线条的复杂和优雅。然后，突然间，一些台词将自己组合成单词“The Burritt Hotel”。文字跳出图案。我们仔细检查纸张，发现装饰线条中隐藏着整句话：“Burritt Hotel has the best prices”。装饰纸实际上是当地旅馆的神秘广告。</p><p>Suppose we are looking at a sheet of paper that has decorations inscribed on it: interwoven curlicues cover its surface. We perceive and admire the intricacy and elegance of the lines. Then, suddenly, some of the lines configure themselves into words, "The Burritt Hotel". The words leap out of the patterns. We inspect the paper more closely and find a whole sentence hidden in the decorative lines: "The Burritt Hotel has the best prices". The ornamented paper is really a cryptic advertisement for the local hotel.</p>

  <p>作为哲学家，我们感兴趣的不是布里特酒店的低价，而是当这些词突然脱颖而出时发生的意向性变化。在发生变化之前，我们只是感知到了摆在我们面前的东西。感知是一个连续的过程，涉及焦点的变化和注意力从纸的一部分到另一部分的移动。但是，当这些词脱颖而出时，我们的意图不再只是眼前的事物。一种新的意图开始发挥作用，一种将这些感知到的标记转化为文字，同时让我们不仅意图存在的标记，而且意图不存在的 Burritt 酒店。这种新的意图被称为<em>符号</em>意图，因为它赋予标记意义。这显然是一个空洞的意图。它是一种有根据的意向性，是一个更大整体的非独立部分，因为它依赖于呈现成为文字的标记的感知基础。</p><p>What interests us as philosophers is not the bargain prices at the Burritt Hotel, but the change in intentionality that takes place when the words suddenly stand out. Before the change, we simply perceived something that was there before us. The perception was a continuous process that involved changes of focus and movements of attention from one part of the paper to another. But when the words stand out, we no longer intend just what is before us. A new kind of intending comes into play, one that makes these perceived marks into words and at the same time makes us intend not just the marks that are present, but the Burritt Hotel, which is absent. The new kind of intending is called a <em>signitive</em> intention, because it bestows meaning on the marks. It is obviously an empty intention. It is a founded intentionality, a nonindependent part of a larger whole, because it rests upon the perceptual base that presents the marks that become the words.</p>

  <p>这种符号意向在哲学上是极其重要的。我们必须通过一些比较来更准确地定义它。</p><p>Such signitive intending is extremely important philosophically. We must define it more exactly by making a few comparisons.</p>

  <p>符号意图与想象不同。我们可能会想说，当单词对我们来说很突出时，我们突然有了 Burritt Hotel 的视觉图像，而这个图像就是单词的含义。这种解释是错误的；内象不是文字的意思。我们可能有这样的视觉图像，但我们也可能没有，但我们仍然可以有相同的含义。当我们听到一个词时脑海中浮现的形象可能只是偶然地与这个词相关：“The Burritt Hotel”这个名字可能会在我脑海中唤起酒店老板约翰·史密斯的形象。符号意图的“箭头”直接穿过感知到的词指向真正的 Burritt 酒店，而不是图像。布里特旅馆离我们可能有五十英里；它甚至可能已经被拆除，以便为高速公路腾出空间，但我们确实通过出现在我们面前的文字来表达它的意图。布里特酒店可能不存在，但我们仍然通过文字指向它。我们有这种空想的能力；我们就是这样形成的，这种意图缺席的能力是建立人类状况的主要因素。</p><p>Signitive intending is not the same as imagining. We might be tempted to say that when the words stand out for us, we suddenly have a visual image of the Burritt Hotel, and that this image is what serves as the meaning of the words. This explanation would be false; internal images are not the meaning of words. We might well have such a visual image, but then again we might not, and we could still have the same meaning. The image that comes to mind when we hear a word might be only accidentally related to the word: the name "The Burritt Hotel" might call up in my mind the image of John Smith, the owner of the hotel. The "arrow" of the signitive intention goes right through the perceived word toward the real Burritt Hotel, not to an image. The Burritt Hotel might be fifty miles away from us; it might even have been demolished to make room for a highway, and yet we do intend it through the words that appear to us. The Burritt Hotel may be absent, but we still are directed toward it through the words. We are capable of such empty intending; we are formed that way, and this ability to intend the absent is a major element in establishing the human condition.</p>

  <p>出于某种原因，我们似乎抵制我们真正想要缺席的想法。我们想把一些在场的东西作为词的意义：一个形象、一个概念、一个感官印象、这个词本身。只要我们试图将空洞的意向减少为其他形式的意向性，只要我们否认我们可以意向不在场，只要我们试图找到在场作为不在场的替代品，我们就无法正确理解我们是什么以及意识的结构是什么。我们甚至无法理解知觉，除非我们知道它的反面，即指示性意图是什么。我们必须更准确地了解缺席者及其在人类意识中的作用。</p><p>For some reason, we seem to resist the idea that we truly intend the absent. We want to posit something present as the meaning of the words: an image, a concept, a sense impression, the word itself. So long as we try to reduce empty intending to other forms of intentionality, so long as we deny that we can intend the absent, so long as we try to find presences as substitutes for the absent, we will be blocked from a proper understanding of what we are and what the structure of consciousness is. We cannot even understand perception unless we know what its contrary, the signitive intention, is. We must get a more precise sense of the absent and its role in human awareness.</p>

  <p>此外，符号意图也不同于伴随感知的那种空意图。当我看到建筑物的正面时，我会倾向于不存在的侧面、背面和内部，但这种空虚在文字的使用上不同于工作中的那种空虚。遍观的空性意图是连续不断的，不断变化的。它们就像一个垫子或一个光环，围绕着中央给出的任何东西滑动。他们逐渐让位给存在。另一方面，口头指示意图是离散的而不是连续的。它意味着它的目标是一次性的和作为一个整体的。它比感知中的空洞意图更准确、更明确地指定其目标。符号意图不是平滑和渐进的，而是起伏不定的，更容易被识别为一个：凭借“The Burritt Hotel”这个词，我指的是伯里特酒店本身，仅此而已。因此，符号意图建立了离散的意义，这些意义可以放入句法中并构建到语句中。表意是进入理性的入口，而遍及知觉的空意则停留在感性中。一旦我们意识到某些声音或标记是名称，一旦我们意识到所有事物都可以命名，我们就进入了一个不同于动物感知、呼唤和信号的世界；我们已经进入了语言推理。一旦我们意识到某些声音或标记是名称，一旦我们意识到所有事物都可以命名，我们就进入了一个不同于动物感知、呼唤和信号的世界；我们已经进入了语言推理。一旦我们意识到某些声音或标记是名称，一旦我们意识到所有事物都可以命名，我们就进入了一个不同于动物感知、呼唤和信号的世界；我们已经进入了语言推理。</p><p>Furthermore, signitive intending is also different from the kind of empty intentions that accompany perception. When I see the front of the building, I coin tend the absent sides, the back, and the inside, but this sort of emptiness is different from the kind at work in the use of words. The empty intentions pervading perception are continuous and ever changing. They are like a cushion or a halo that slides around whatever is centrally given. They give way gradually to presence. The verbal signitive intention, on the other hand, is discrete and not continuous. It means its target all at once and as a whole. It specifies its target more exactly and more explicitly than do the empty intentions in perception. Signitive intentions are not smooth and gradual, but choppy, more identifiable as one: by virtue of the words, "The Burritt Hotel", I mean the Burritt Hotel just by itself, nothing more. Signitive intentions therefore establish discrete meanings that can be placed into syntax and built up into statements. Signitive intentions are the entrance into reason, while the empty intentions pervading perception remain in sensibility. Once it dawns on us that certain sounds or marks are names, and once we realize that all things can be named, we have entered into a world different from that of animal perception, calling, and signaling; we have entered into linguistic reasoning.</p>

  <p>让我们回想一下从感知纸上的标记到通过脱颖而出的文字来表达不存在的 Burritt Hotel 的转变。我们经历过这种变化，而且我们中的大多数人都曾有过这样或那样的经历；但是，我们对它的体验不一定是情绪化的或明显的。我们感觉不到胸部、胃部或眼睛后面的变化。这种转变只是意向性的改变。这是从一种意图到另一种意图的纯粹理性变化。我们如何意识到这些意图？我们是通过内省“看到”它们吗？它们是我们以某种方式看到或感觉到的精神事物吗？不; 然而，我们确实知道其中一个或另一个何时在我们体内起作用，我们确实知道我们是在感知还是在表示。我们知道这两个活动之间的区别，我们也知道它们与其他意图之间的区别，例如描绘或记忆。当我突然把一个表面当作一幅画时，我不一定有什么感觉，但新的表面拍摄方式与旧的不同，我只是在其中感知它。</p><p>Let us think back to the shift from perceiving marks on paper to intending the absent Burritt Hotel through words that stand out of the lines. We experience this change, and most of us have had some such experience at one time or another; however, the experience we have of it is not necessarily emotional or palpable. We do not feel the change in our chest or in the pit of our stomach or behind our eyes. The shift is simply a change of intentionality. It is a purely rational change from one kind of intending to another. How do we become aware of such intentions? Do we "see" them by introspection? Are they mental things that we somehow look at or feel? No; and yet we do know when one or the other is operative within us, we do know whether we are perceiving or signifying. We know the difference between these two activities, and we also know the difference between them and other intentions, such as picturing or remembering. I do not necessarily feel anything when I suddenly take a surface as a picture, but the new way of taking the surface is different from the old, in which I simply perceived it.</p>

  <p>当我们采取先验态度时，这些意向性差异成为我们直接关注的焦点。它们是我们甚至在进入哲学之前就已经认识到的差异；在进行先验转向之前，我们已经知道看到图案与看到文字不同，并且我们知道看到表面与看到图片不同。哲学将这些差异视为既定的，并系统地研究它们。它明确转向他们。</p><p>These differences in intentionality become the focus of our direct attention when we adopt the transcendental attitude. They are differences that we recognize even before we enter into philosophy; before we make the transcendental turn, we already know that seeing a pattern is not the same as seeing a word, and we know that seeing a surface is different from seeing a picture. Philosophy takes these differences as already given, and it systematically investigates them. It turns explicitly toward them.</p>

  <p>现象学的批评者经常说它依赖于内省和对主观、心理事物的直觉。但是现象学所关注的是那些已经被任何思考和言说的人所认识的东西，比如知觉、符号意图和图画意图。现象学检查这些意图、这些理智活动，它还检查它们的客观关联、它们的意向、它们建立或针对的对象的种类：感知对象、图片、单词、语言意义、语言所指。</p><p>Critics of phenomenology often say that it relies on introspection and on the intuition of subjective, mental things. But the things phenomenology looks at are those that have already been recognized by anyone who thinks and speaks, things like perceptions, signitive intentions, and pictorial intentions. Phenomenology examines these intentions, these noetic activities, and it also examines their objective correlates, their noemas, the kinds of objects that are established or targeted by them: the perceptual object, the picture, the word, the verbal meaning, the verbal referent.</p>

  <p>我们使用了一个例子作为我们的介绍性范例，当我们突然在一个线条模式中发现一个名字时会发生什么。这种类型的发现时常发生在我们身上，而且我们很容易理解，作为一个例子很有用，但它并不是我们使用单词的典型方式。事实上，作为人类，我们总是以口头的方式生活；言语不仅仅是零星或偶然的事件。我们总是已经处于一种语言模式中。我们总是在别人的谈话和谈话中、在手势（“退出”、“请勿进入”）和我们内心想象的生活中识别我们周围的词语。词语总是比比皆是，将它们确立为词语的符号意图也比比皆是。甚至我们的感知也会被出现时想起的词语所改变；当我们第一次看到 一个我们听说过或读到过的地方，比如战场或名人的故乡，各种名字和模糊的断言在我们心中升起，就像一枪响了，一群黑鸟突然从树上飞了起来。感性直觉实现了许多空洞的符号意图并激发了更多。</p><p>We have used as our introductory paradigm the example of what happens when we suddenly discover a name within a pattern of lines. This type of discovery, which happens to us from time to time and which we can easily understand, is useful as an example, but it is not typical of how we use words. In fact, as human beings we always live in a verbal manner; words are not just sporadic or occasional events. We are always already in a linguistic mode. We are always recognizing words around us in the chatter and speech of others, in signs ("Exit", "Do Not Enter"), and in our internal imaginary life. Words always abound, and the signitive intentions that establish them as words abound as well. Even our perceptions are modified by the words that are called to mind when they occur; when we see, for the first time, a site we have heard and read about, such as a battlefield or the home of a famous person, all sorts of names and vague assertions arise within us, like a flock of blackbirds suddenly rising from a tree after a shot has been fired. The perceptual intuition fulfills many empty signitive intentions and stimulates many more.</p>

  <p>意指意图的存在使我们有可能以特定的人类方式感知事物。意指的意图是在事物不在场时被命令的，但这种意图也可以在知觉中、在直觉中找到实现。我们已经注意到在建立人类理性的过程中，空洞和充满的意图、不在场和在场的相互作用。在各种空虚和充满的意图中，那些与意指行为相关联的意图是最适合人类的意图。因为我们可以在不存在的情况下命名和表达某物，所以我们也可以转向事物本身，看看我们是否可以在它存在时，在它自己的证据中，以我们在它的存在中听到的相同方式来命名和表达它缺席。我们问是否可以将符号表达转化为感知表达。我们可以从其他人那里接收到有关事物现状的信息，然后深入研究事物本身，并自行发现它们是否如人们所说的那样。尤其是在语言的缺席和存在之间的相互作用中，可以实现事物同一性的高度形式。我们可以比我们想象或预期的更准确地命名和表达。</p><p>The presence of signifying intentions makes it possible for us to perceive things in a specifically human way. The signifying intention is ordered to the thing in its absence, but this intention can also find fulfillment in a perception, in an intuition. We have already noted the interplay of empty and filled intentions, of absence and presence, in establishing human rationality. Amid all the kinds of empty and filled intentions, those associated with signifying acts are among the most properly human kinds of intentionality. Because we can name and articulate something in its absence, we can also go to the thing itself and see whether we can name and articulate it in its presence, in its own evidence, in the same way that we have heard it spoken about in its absence. We ask whether the signitive articulations can be transformed into perceptual articulations. We can receive messages from others about how things are and then go to the things themselves and find out on our own whether they are the way they were said to be. It is especially in the interplay between linguistic absence and presence that a heightened form of the identity of things can be achieved. We can name and articulate in words with far greater exactness than we can merely imagine or anticipate.</p>

  <p>在我们结束对意指意图的处理之前，还有一点需要说明。我们注意到，当我们突然在页面的图案中看到“The Burritt Hotel”字样时，我们所指的不再只是装饰纸，而是 Burritt Hotel 本身，因为它不存在。标志性意图是针对酒店的。其次，同一意图将某些商标确定为词。第三，相同的意图确立了作为词的一部分的意义。因此，符号意图的引入引入了三个要素：指称、词和含义或含义。前两个，参考和词，似乎没有争议，但第三个呢？这一切的意义如何？意义不仅仅是已经成为一个词的标志，也不仅仅是简单的酒店。意义似乎是词与物之间的一个奇怪的中间实体，一个似乎是响应于意指行为而产生的实体。它似乎是某种精神主义的存在，一种所谓的“内涵”。这个意义在哪里，是个什么东西？是在心里还是在字里行间？它到底存在吗？言语意义的地位是一个哲学困惑。我们现在注意到这个问题，但我们不会在这里探讨；我们将在第 7 章对其进行更广泛的处理。它是什么样的东西？是在心里还是在字里行间？它到底存在吗？言语意义的地位是一个哲学困惑。我们现在注意到这个问题，但我们不会在这里探讨；我们将在第 7 章对其进行更广泛的处理。它是什么样的东西？是在心里还是在字里行间？它到底存在吗？言语意义的地位是一个哲学困惑。我们现在注意到这个问题，但我们不会在这里探讨；我们将在第 7 章对其进行更广泛的处理。</p><p>There is one more point to be made before we close this treatment of signifying intentions. We have noted that when we suddenly see the words, "The Burritt Hotel", in the pattern on the page, we intend no longer just the decorated paper but the Burritt Hotel itself, in its absence. The signitive intention is directed toward the hotel. Secondly, the same intention establishes some of the marks as a word. And thirdly, the same intention establishes a meaning as part of the word. The introduction of the signitive intention thus introduces three elements: a reference, a word, and a meaning or sense. The first two, the reference and the word, seem noncontroversial, but what about the third? How does the meaning fit in all this? The meaning is not just the marks that have become a word, nor is it simply the hotel. The meaning seems to be a strange intermediate entity between the word and the object, an entity that seems to spring into being in response to the signifying act. It seems to be a mentalistic being of some sort, an "intension", as it has been called. Where is this meaning, and what kind of thing is it? Is it in the mind or in the word? Does it exist at all? The status of the verbal meaning is a philosophical perplexity. We note this problem now, but we will not explore it here; we leave it for more extensive treatment in Chapter 7.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_6.xhtml.heading_id_4"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_6.xhtml.ch6_p"></a>图片</h2><h2><a></a>PICTURES</h2>

  <p>如果文字有时能让我们大吃一惊并跳出页面，那么图片也可以。假设我们正在看我之前提到的同一张装饰过的纸；突然，除了“伯里特旅馆”这几个字之外，哈里·杜鲁门的脸出现在线条网络中。也许布里特酒店的老板想建议杜鲁门总统曾在那里住过一次。现在，我们面前不仅有一个词，还有一幅图画，相应地，我们进入的不是意指意向，而是图画或形象的意向性。知觉仍然是两种意向的基础，但意指和图画这两者是彼此不同的。把某物当成一个词和把它当成一幅画是不同的。再一次，描绘意向性并不罕见或令人惊讶，但在我们有意识的生活中很常见；图片围绕着我们。我看到这里的照片，那里的风景，书柜上方墙上的弗朗西斯·培根的肖像。</p><p>If words can sometimes surprise us and leap off a page, so can pictures. Suppose we are looking at the same decorated sheet of paper I spoke of earlier; suddenly, besides the words, "The Burritt Hotel", the face of Harry Truman appears in the network of lines. Perhaps the owners of the Burritt Hotel would like to suggest that President Truman stayed there once. We now have not just a word but also a picture asserting itself before us, and correspondingly we have entered not into a signifying intention but into a pictorial or imaging intentionality. Perception remains as a base for both intendings, but the two, the signifying and picturing, are different from each other. Taking something as a word is different from taking it as a picture. Once again, the picturing intentionality is not rare or surprising, but very common in our conscious life; pictures surround us. I see the photograph here, the landscape there, the portrait of Francis Bacon on the wall above my bookcase.</p>

  <p>符号意图和图形意图之间存在差异。在意指中，意向性的“箭头”穿过词到达缺席的对象。它是向外的。它离开了我和我在这里的处境，转移到了其他地方。然而，在图中，箭头的方向是相反的。预期的对象被带到我身边，靠近我；物体的存在体现在我面前的一块木板或一张纸上。符号意图指向事物，图形意图将事物拉近。意图的方向是不同的。在这幅画中，我指的是弗朗西斯培根此时此地，而不是彼时彼地。弗朗西斯·培根曾经在那里，现在在这里。</p><p>There are differences between signitive and pictorial intentions. In signification the "arrow" of intentionality goes through the word to an absent object. It is outward bound. It goes away from me and my situation here to something somewhere else . In picturing, however, the direction of the arrow is reversed. The object intended is brought toward me, into my own proximity; the presence of the object is embodied before me on a panel of wood or a piece of paper. Signitive intentions point away to the thing, pictorial intentions draw the thing near. The direction of the intending is different. In the picture I intend Francis Bacon here and now, not there and then. Francis Bacon as he was there and then is made present here and now.</p>

  <p>符号意向和图形意向之间的另一个区别是，意向符号一次性地意指整个对象（当我说出它的名字时，我只表示纯粹和简单的 Burritt 酒店，我并不是在任何特殊角度下表示它)，而画报则是在一定的视角下，在一定的光线下，以一定的姿势，在一定的时刻，突出一定的特征。描绘更具体，象征更抽象。</p><p>Another difference between signitive and pictorial intending is that the signitive intends the object at one stroke, all at once, as a whole (I signify just the Burritt Hotel pure and simple when I utter its name, 1 do not mean it under any special angle), while the pictorial presents the object under a certain perspective, in a certain light, with a certain pose, at a certain moment, with certain features highlighted. Picturing is more concrete, signifying is more abstract.</p>

  <p>此外，图形意图比符号意图更像是一种感知。图片意图非常像看到或听到事物：当然，我们并没有真正看到或听到它，因为我们只得到了一幅图片，而不是事物本身，但是给出图片的方式与事情本身将被给予。与感知一样，图画意向是连续的，我们可以关注图像的一部分或另一部分，图像可以清晰也可以褪色，其部分可以或多或少地生动地表达出来。然而，在想象和普通感知之间存在差异：例如，对于被描绘的物体，没有“立方体的另一面”；木板的另一面只有图片存在。唯一的方面，方面，</p><p>Furthermore, pictorial intending is more like a perception than is signitive intending. Pictorial intending is very much like seeing or hearing the thing: we do not really see or hear it, of course, because we are given only a picture and not the thing itself, but the way the picture is given has analogies with the way the thing itself would be given. Like perception, pictorial intending is continuous, we can focus on one or another part of the image, the image can be clear or faded, its parts can be more or less vividly articulated. There are differences, however, between picturing and ordinary perceiving: there is, for example, no "other side of the cube" for objects that are depicted; there is only the other side of the wooden panel on which the picture exists. The only sides, aspects, and profiles of the pictured object are those that are depicted.</p>

  <p>意指和描绘是两种意向性，但它们可以相互作用。我们可以用文字来谈论一幅画，当我们这样做时，我们可以谈论身体材料或图像的内容。绘画涉及对基底或车辆（木板、彩色纸）的感知以及对所描绘对象的意图（弗朗西斯培根，威文霍公园）。我们可以将我们的语言意图指向底物或主题：我们可以将图片中的培根描述为腼腆、不屑一顾、老人，我们可以将 Wyvenhoe 公园的房子描述为隐藏在树丛中，将牛描述为在草地上吃草。但我们也可以说油漆开裂了，这些蓝色斑点与那些白色斑点形成鲜明对比。看画的一些乐趣来自于关注主题和关注底材之间的转换：我们可能会走得很近，或者我们可能会缩小视野，以便专注于主题材料基材，欣赏这些特定位置的笔触和颜色；然后我们回过头来查看更广泛的整体，同时始终保留我们最近对事物物质性的理解。基材和形式之间的相互作用增强了艺术作品的存在感，而这种相互作用之所以可能，是因为我们在所看事物上训练了各种意向性意图。欣赏这些特定位置的笔触和颜色；然后我们回过头来查看更广泛的整体，同时始终保留我们最近对事物物质性的理解。基材和形式之间的相互作用增强了艺术作品的存在感，而这种相互作用之所以可能，是因为我们在所看事物上训练了各种意向性意图。欣赏这些特定位置的笔触和颜色；然后我们回过头来查看更广泛的整体，同时始终保留我们最近对事物物质性的理解。基材和形式之间的相互作用增强了艺术作品的存在感，而这种相互作用之所以可能，是因为我们在所看事物上训练了各种意向性意图。</p><p>Signifying and picturing are two kinds of intentionalities, but they can interact. We can use words to talk about a picture, and when we do so we can talk about either the bodily material or the content of the image. Picturing involves a perception of a substrate or a vehicle (the wood panel, the colored paper) and an intending of the depicted object (Francis Bacon, Wyvenhoe Park). We can direct our verbal intentions either to the substrate or to the theme: we can describe Bacon in the picture as coy, as disdainful, as elderly, and we can describe the house in Wyvenhoe Park as hidden by the trees, and the cattle as grazing in the meadow. But we can also say that the paint is cracked, and that these blue patches contrast nicely with those white ones. Some of the pleasure of looking at paintings comes from shifting between a focus on the theme and a focus on the substrate: we might step up very close to the painting, or we might narrow the scope of our vision, in order to concentrate on the material substrate, to appreciate the brushstrokes and colors in these particular spots; then we move back for a view of the wider whole, retaining all the while our recent grasp of the materiality of the thing. The interplay between substrate and form enhances the presence of the work of art, and such an interplay is possible because of the various signitive intentions we train on the thing we are looking at.</p>

  <p>当我们确定图片的内容时，也会发生符号和图片意图的相互作用。如果我们举起布鲁克林大桥的照片问：“这是什么？” 人们通常会回答，“布鲁克林大桥”，但严格来说，这只是可能的答案之一。人们也可以说“一张图片”或“一张纸”。人们通常会将其识别为布鲁克林大桥，因为人们认为应该进入问题似乎预设的图形意向性。图片巧妙的模糊性向我们展示了在我们的日常经验中有多少意向性总是在起作用。</p><p>The interaction of signitive and pictorial intending occurs also when we identify what the picture is about. If we were to hold up a picture of the Brooklyn Bridge and ask, "What is this?" people would normally answer, "The Brooklyn Bridge", but strictly speaking this is only one of the possible answers. One might just as well have said, "A picture" or "A piece of paper". One would generally identify it as the Brooklyn Bridge because one assumes that one should enter into the pictorial intentionality that seems to be presupposed by the question. The clever ambiguity of the presence of the picture shows us how many intentionalities are always at work in our ordinary experience.</p>

  <p>最后，让我们观察一下，描绘不仅仅是基于相似性。一幅画可能与它所描绘的相似，但它并不是因为相似而成为一幅画；一个双胞胎姐妹长得像另一个，但她不是另一个的照片。成为一幅画不仅仅是像其他东西，它是所描绘事物的呈现。如果我看到哈里·杜鲁门的照片，我看到的是<em>杜鲁门</em>的个性。我不只是看到看起来像他的东西。</p><p>Let us observe, finally, that picturing is based on more than similarity. A picture may resemble what it depicts, but it is not made to be a picture by virtue of the resemblance; one twin sister resembles another, but she is not a picture of the other. Being a picture is not just being like something else, it is being the presentation of what is depicted. If I see a picture of Harry Truman, I see <em>Truman</em> depicted, in his individuality; I do not just see something that looks like him.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_6.xhtml.heading_id_5"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_6.xhtml.ch6_iss"></a>指示、符号或信号</h2><h2><a></a>INDICATIONS, SYMBOLS OR SIGNALS</h2>

  <p>如果我沿着小径远足，看到一堆约 18 英寸高的石头，我会认为这是我仍在小径上的标志。我会向前看并尝试看到另一堆或树上的标记，以确认路径的延续。石头堆不是一个字，也不是一幅画；这是另一种迹象。在现象学中，这种符号被称为<em>指示</em>，但我们也可以称它们为符号或信号。它们带来了另一种意向性，象征性的或指示性的。</p><p>If I am hiking along a trail and see a pile of stones about eighteen inches high, I take it as a sign that I am still on the trail. I will look ahead and try to see another pile or a mark on a tree, to confirm the continuation of the trail. The pile of stones is not a word, nor is it a picture; it is another kind of sign. In phenomenology, such signs have been called <em>indications</em>, but we could also call them symbols or signals. They bring forth another kind of intentionality, the symbolic or the indicational.</p>

  <p>指示标志就像文字，因为它们通常将我们指向一个不存在的对象（一缕头发让我们想起某人，一面四星旗帜代表一位陆军将军），但它们与文字不同，因为它们没有非常清楚地说明如何我们要打算的对象。他们只会记住指定的对象。相比之下，文字通常会为我们表达对象；他们给这个物体命名，然后说一些关于它的事情。当我们命名某物时，我们通常会为谓词做好准备，即使是一个词也通常会在某个方面呈现该对象（“dog”和“cur”这两个词都指的是同一种动物，但意义不同）。然而，一个符号只是让我们指向对象并停在那里。它只是向对象发出信号并毫无限制地将其带入脑海。</p><p>Indication signs are like words in that they generally point us to an absent object (a lock of hair reminds us of someone, a flag with four stars represents an army general), but they are unlike words in that they do not specify very clearly how we are to intend the object. They only call the indicated object to mind. In contrast, words generally articulate the object for us; they name the object and then say something about it. When we name something we usually make it ready for predication, and even a single word usually presents the object under a certain aspect (the words "dog" and "cur" both designate the same animal, but with a different sense). A symbol, however, just refers us to the object and stops there. It just signals the object and brings it to mind without qualification.</p>

  <p>指示符号和单词之间的一个重要区别是前者不进入句法，而后者本质上是句法。符号不进入语法。的确，一个指示很可能会导致另一个指示（一堆石头让我们寻找下一个路标，开始击球需要标志比赛结束的旗帜），但这是连接而不是句法。符号系列的组合方式没有不同；它们只是按顺序放置，就像在比赛的开始和结束时一样。语言的语法具有很大的灵活性；我们可以用许多不同的方式来意指一件事物，因为我们可以通过我们的语言语法来表达它，但符号并不能让我们自由地以这种方式塑造事物的存在。他们只是把事情记在心里。</p><p>An important difference between indication signs and words is that the former do not enter into syntax while the latter are essentially syntactic. Symbols do not enter into grammar. It is true that one indication might well lead on to another (the pile of stones makes us look for the next trail marker, the starting shot calls for the flag signaling the end of the race), but this is concatenation and not syntax. There are not different ways in which the series of symbols could be composed; they are merely placed in sequence, as at the start and the end of a race. The syntax in language allows great flexibility; we can intend a thing in many different ways because we can articulate it through the grammar of our language, but symbols do not leave us free to shape the presence of the thing in that way. They merely bring the thing to mind.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_6.xhtml.heading_id_6"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_6.xhtml.ch6_emei"></a>丰富歧管，提升身份</h2><h2><a></a>ENRICHMENT OF MANIFOLDS, ENHANCEMENT OF IDENTITY</h2>

  <p>在第 3 章中，我们考虑了以多种表象形式赋予我们的身份。单个立方体是通过一系列侧面、方面和轮廓提供给我们的。现在我们已经检查了知觉可以进行的修改，我们看到侧面、方面和轮廓的多样性只是事物呈现给我们的多样性中的一小部分。我们在本章和第 5 章中考虑的所有意向性都扩展了现象的多样性。让我们总结一下我们检查过的形式。在我们的内在生活中，经验可以通过以下方式进行修改：</p><p>In Chapter 3 we considered identities that are given to us in manifolds of appearance. The single cube is given to us through an array of sides, aspects, and profiles. Now that we have examined the modifications that perception can take on, we see that the manifolds of sides, aspects, and profiles are only a few of the manifolds through which things are presented to us. All the intentionalities we have considered in this chapter and in Chapter 5 expand the manifolds of appearances. Let us summarize the forms we have examined. In our internal life, experience can be modified in the following ways:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>洞察力</li><li>Perception</li>

    <li>记住</li><li>Remembering</li>

    <li>想像力</li><li>Imagination</li>

    <li>预期</li><li>Anticipation</li>
  </ol>

  <p>同一个立方体不仅可以从多个角度被感知，也可以被想象、记忆和期待，在所有这些体验中它都是同一个立方体。</p><p>One and the same cube can be not only perceived through many perspectives, but also imagined, remembered, and anticipated, and it is one and the same cube in all these experiences.</p>

  <p>然而，这种知觉的“内在”修正更属于感性层面。尽管它们在建立人类条件方面很重要，但它们也以简单的形式存在于高等动物中：狗做梦，猫有某种等待老鼠的感觉。我们在本章中研究的其他范围的意图是建立在感知之上的，更恰当地说是理性的和人类的意图：</p><p>However, such "internal" modifications of perception belong rather to the level of sensibility. As important as they are in establishing the human condition, they are also found, in simple forms, in the higher animals: dogs dream, and cats have some sense of awaiting a mouse. The other range of intentions we have studied in this chapter are built upon perception and are more properly rational and human intentions:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>洞察力</li><li>Perception</li>

    <li>意义</li><li>Signification</li>

    <li>图画</li><li>Picturing</li>

    <li>适应症</li><li>Indication</li>
  </ol>

  <p>在每个组中，所有变体都是相互依赖的。没有想象和期待，我们就不可能有记忆；如果我们没有执行意指意图的能力以及建立和识别指示标志的能力，我们就不可能拥有描绘的能力。我们与世界的感性交流分支为我们内心生活的变化，在这些变化中，我们将自己置身于记忆、想象和预期的情境中，并进入我们看待世界事物的方式的变化：表示特定的事物和事态，描绘我们不存在的事物，并象征无法描绘或用语言表达的事物。</p><p>In each group, all the variants are interdependent. We could not have memory without imagination and anticipation; we could not have the power to picture without also having the power to carry out signifying intentions and the power to establish and recognize indication signs. Our perceptual intercourse with the world branches off into variations in our internal life, in which we displace ourselves into remembered, imagined, and anticipated situations and into variations in our way of taking the things in the world: signifying particular things and states of affairs, picturing things that are not present to us, and symbolizing what cannot be pictured or brought into words.</p>

  <p>同一个对象或事件现在可以被符号化、被描绘、被口头表达、被感知；它也可以被想象、记住和预期。通过所有这些排列，它仍然是同一件事。我们不会看到许多与同一事物相关的不同外观，而是同一事物本身以新的和不同的方式呈现。在这一系列的演示中，同一件事被一遍又一遍地识别出来。它自己的身份得到了增加和强化。我们甚至可以说，它的存在是通过它的表象多样性的丰富而增强的，因为一个事物的存在与其真实性不无关系，当然，当它的表象扩大时，该事物就享有更多的真实性。<em>仲夏夜之梦</em>还有更多内容<em></em>经过几个世纪的解释和演出，比以前更好了。在动物和人类通过生活事件表现出来之后，它们比以前有了更多。真理所涉及的现实不仅完善了感知者，而且完善了所展示的实体。</p><p>One and the same object or event can be now symbolized, now pictured, now verbally intended, and now perceived; it can also be imagined, remembered, and anticipated. Through all these permutations it remains the same thing. We do not see many different appearances that we just relate to one and the same thing, but rather one and the same thing is itself given in new and varied ways. In this flow of presentations, the same thing is recognized over and over again. Its own identity is increased and intensified. We could even say its being is enhanced through the enrichment of its manifolds of presentation, since the being of a thing is not unrelated to its truth, and certainly the thing enjoys more truth as its displays are enlarged. There is more to <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em> after centuries of interpretation and staging than there was before. There is more to an animal and to a human being after they have manifested themselves through the events of life than there was before. The actuality involved in truth perfects not only the perceiver, but the entity that is displayed as well.</p>

  <p>我们所研究的各种意向性都是在我们处于自然态度时实现的。我们感知、想象、记忆和预期，我们也表示、描绘和象征，同时保持作为自然态度特征的世界信念和以世界为导向的焦点。我们在这里考虑的所有身份都是在我们保持自然态度时赋予我们的：小径标记、弗朗西斯·培根和他的肖像、威文霍公园和描绘它的画、伯里特酒店及其名称，都是通过我们在自然态度中出现的表象层。然而，所有这些活动、流形和身份的反思描述都是以先验的、哲学的态度进行的。作为哲学家，我们与所有这些意向性及其对象保持距离；我们从不同于实现它们的角度思考、区分和描述它们。我们搁置了我们的自然意向性，我们将与它们相关的身份放在一起，我们解开了构成我们作为拥有世界并在其中体验事物的理性人的状况的复杂性。我们提供了意念和意向分析，从而阐明了作为显化的与格在世界上是什么，并且我们阐明了存在和显化是什么。</p><p>The various intentionalities we have investigated are achieved while we are in the natural attitude. We perceive, imagine, remember, and anticipate, and we also signify, picture, and symbolize, while maintaining the world belief and world-directed focus that characterize the natural attitude. All the identities we have considered here are given to us while we remain in the natural attitude: the trail markers, Francis Bacon and his portrait, Wyvenhoe Park and the painting that depicts it, the Burritt Hotel and its name, are all recognized through the layers of appearance that occur to us in the natural attitude. However, the reflective descriptions of all these activities, manifolds, and identities are carried out in the transcendental, philosophical attitude. We as philosophers take a distance to all these intentionalities and their objects; we contemplate, distinguish, and describe them, from a point of view different from that in which we achieve them. We suspend our natural intentionalities, we bracket the identities correlated with them, and we unravel the complexities that make up our condition as rational human beings who have a world and experience things in it. We provide a noetic and a noematic analysis and thus shed light on what it is to be in the world as datives of manifestation, and we clarify what it is for beings to be and to be manifest.</p>

  范畴意图和对象</h1><h1><span class="small">7</span><br><br>
  Categorial Intentions and Objects</h1>

  <p>我们在第 5 章和第 6 章中探讨的意向性种类相当丰富和具体。我们检查了我们经验中的想象力、想象、记忆和其他熟悉的元素。在本章中，我们将转向一种更严肃、更纯粹理性的意向性。我们将研究现象学所谓的<em>范畴</em>意向性。这是一种阐明事态和命题的意图，当我们对我们的经验进行断言、关联、收集和引入逻辑运算时，这种意图就会发挥作用。例如，我们将检查简单地意向一个对象和对该对象做出判​​断之间的区别。</p><p>The kinds of intentionality we explored in Chapters 5 and 6 were rather colorful and concrete. We examined imagination, picturing, memory, and other familiar elements in our experience. In this chapter we will move to a kind of intentionality that is more austere and more purely rational. We will examine what phenomenology calls <em>categorial</em> intentionality. This is the kind of intending that articulates states of affairs and propositions, the kind that functions when we predicate, relate, collect, and introduce logical operations into what we experience. We will examine the difference, for example, between simply intending an object and making a judgment about that object.</p>

  <p><em>我们记得“范畴”这个词与希腊词katēgoreō</em>有关<em></em>, 原意指告发或控告某人的行为，公开声明他的某些特征，他是杀人犯或小偷。在哲学中，这个词的意思是关于某事说某事的行为。现象学术语“范畴的”借鉴了这个词源。它指的是表达一个对象的意图，将句法引入我们体验的那种。房子是一个简单的对象，但房子是白色的这一事实是一个范畴对象。术语“Fido”或“dog”的含义很简单，但“Fido is hungry”或“Dogs are domesticed”的含义是绝对的。当我们转向范畴域时，我们从简单的“单向”意图转向复杂的“多向”意图。我们如何从简单转移到分类？我们如何将语法注入我们所经历的事物？我们如何从知觉转变为智力？</p><p>We recall that the word "categorial" is related to the Greek term <em>katēgoreō</em>, which originally meant the act of denouncing or accusing someone, of stating publicly that some feature belongs to him, that he is a murderer or a thief. In philosophy, the term came to mean the act of saying something about something. The phenomenological term "categorial" draws on this etymology. It refers to the kind of intending that articulates an object, the kind that introduces syntax into what we experience. A house is a simple object, but the fact that the house is white is a categorial object. The meaning of the term "Fido" or "dog" is a simple meaning, but the sense of "Fido is hungry" or "Dogs are domesticated" is categorial. When we move to the categorial domain, we move from simple, "one-rayed" intentions to complex, "many-rayed" intentions. How do we move from the simple to the categorial? How do we infuse the things we experience with syntax? How do we move from perception to intellection?</p>

  <p>我们将要研究的问题是第 6 章中介绍的符号意图的发展。符号意图，与词相关的那些，实际上总是把我们置于句法和范畴形式中。我们几乎从不只说一个词，而当我们这样做时，这个词通常更像是一种感叹或咒骂（“哈利！”“麻烦！”“快点！”），而不是作为一个完全有效的语言单位。当我们使用语言时，我们最充分地发挥了人性，我们作为理性动物的行为最为强烈，我们对真理和思考的成就与我们对语言的使用有关；因此，对范畴意向性的讨论在现象学中非常重要，在我们研究什么是人类以及什么是表现的与格中。此外，现象学尤其是在处理范畴意图时，为摆脱现代哲学的自我中心困境提供了资源。现象学对哲学的一些最原始和最有价值的贡献可以在其关于范畴意图的学说中找到。</p><p>The issue we are about to study is a development of the signitive intentions that were introduced in Chapter 6. Signitive intentions, those associated with words, practically always put us into syntax and categorial form. We almost never just say a single word, and when we do, the word usually serves more as an exclamation or expletive ("Harry!" "Trouble!" "Hurry!") than as a fully operative linguistic unit. We exercise our humanity most fully, we act as rational animals most intensely, when we use words, and our achievement of truth and thinking is implicated in our use of language; the discussion of categorial intentionality is therefore of great importance in phenomenology, in our study of what it is to be human and what it is to be a dative of manifestation. Furthermore, it is especially in its treatment of categorial intending that phenomenology provides resources to escape the egocentric predicament of modern philosophy. Some of phenomenology's most original and valuable contributions to philosophy are found in its doctrines about categorial intentions.</p>

  <p>在我们检查范畴意图的重要性之前，让我们试着更全面地了解它们是什么。范畴意图如何从简单对象的经验中产生？要说清楚这个过程，我们必须区分三个阶段。</p><p>Before we examine the importance of categorial intentions, let us try to obtain a more complete idea of what they are. How do categorial intentions arise from the experience of simple objects? To spell out the process, we must distinguish three stages.</p>

  <p>假设我们正在感知一个物体；假设我们正在看一辆汽车：</p><p>Suppose we are perceiving an object; suppose we are looking at a car:</p>

  <p>(1) 起初，我们只是比较被动地看待它。我们的目光从一个部分移动到另一个部分，我们浏览侧面、方面和轮廓的多样性，我们浏览颜色、光滑度、表面的光泽、它的硬度或柔软感。所有这一切都是一种连续的感知，都在一个层面上进行。当我们继续感知时，没有特别的想法参与。此外，当我们经历呈现的各种流形时，一辆和同一辆车不断地作为流形中的身份提供给我们。</p><p>(1) At first, we just look at it in a rather passive way. Our gaze moves from one part to another, we go through the manifolds of sides, aspects, and profiles, we go through the color, the smoothness, the shine of the surface, its feel of hardness or softness. All this is a continuous perception, all carried out on one level. No particular thinking is engaged as we continue to perceive. Furthermore, as we go through the various manifolds of presentation, one and the same car is continuously given to us as the identity in the manifold.</p>

  <p>(2) 现在，假设汽车表面的一些擦伤引起了我们的注意。我们对他们归零。我们突出显示汽车的这一部分；不仅仅是这个空间部分，还有这个特征，这个空间部分的磨蚀性。这种关注不仅仅是之前的混日子。这种突出显示与之前一直在进行的突出显示有质的不同。但是，它还没有建立一个类别对象。到目前为止，我们处于中间点：我们继续体验汽车的外观，并且我们继续在所有外观中认出一辆和同一辆车，但我们现在已经聚焦其中一个外观并将其带到中心舞台；它脱颖而出。在整体的总体背景下，一部分出现在前景中。</p><p>(2) Now, suppose that some abrasions on the surface of the car catch our attention. We zero in on them. We highlight this part of the car; not just this spatial part, but this feature, this abrasiveness, in the spatial part. This focus is not just more of the dawdling perception that preceded; this highlighting is qualitatively different from what had been going on continuously before. However, it is not yet the establishment of a categorial object. So far, we are at an in-between point: we continue to experience the appearances of the car, and we continue to recognize one and the same car in all the appearances, but we have now spotlighted one of the appearances and brought it to center stage; it stands out from all the rest. A part comes into the foreground against the general background of the whole.</p>

  <p>(3) 需要多一步建立类别对象。我们打断了持续不断的知觉；我们回到整体（汽车），现在我们将它准确地视为整体，同时我们将我们强调的部分（磨损）视为整体的一部分。我们现在将整体注册为包含部分。整体和部分之间的关​​系被表达和记录下来。此时我们可以声明，“This car is damaged”。这一成就是一种<em>范畴直觉</em>，因为范畴对象，即其表述中的事物，实际上呈现在我们面前。我们不仅拥有<em>汽车，</em>还拥有汽车；相反，<em>汽车被损坏</em>是存在的。</p><p>(3) One more step is needed to establish a categorial object. We interrupt the continuous flow of perception; we go back to the whole (the car), and we now take it precisely as being the whole, and simultaneously we take the part we had highlighted (the abrasion) as being a part in that whole. We now register the whole as containing the part. A relation between whole and part is articulated and registered. At this point we can declare, "This car is damaged". This achievement is a <em>categorial intuition</em>, because the categorial object, the thing in its articulation, is made actually present to us. We do not just have <em>the car</em> present to us; rather, <em>the car's being damaged</em> is made present.</p>

  <p>第三阶段发生的事情是，整体（汽车）作为整体具体呈现，而部分（损坏）作为部分具体呈现。整体和部分是明确区分的。它们之间的关系被清楚地记录下来。实现了清晰度。事态点击到位。我们已经从感性走向理智，从单纯的体验走向初步的理解。我们已经从单一的感知意向性转向了判断的多向意向性。我们已经进入了分类思维。</p><p>What happens in this third stage is that the whole (the car) is presented specifically as the whole, and the part (damaged) is presented specifically as a part. The whole and its part are explicitly distinguished. A relation between them is distinctly registered. An articulation is achieved. A state of affairs clicks into place. We have moved from sensibility to intellection, from mere experiencing to an initial understanding. We have moved from the single-rayed intentionality of perception to the many-rayed intentionality of judgment. We have entered into categorial thinking.</p>

  <p>在第一阶段和第二阶段，整体和部分都被体验或经历过，但没有主题化。严格来说，它们还没有明确表达。即使在第二阶段，当这个部分被提出来时，它也被突出显示，但还没有被明确承认为一个部分。部分被带到了前面，但它作为一个部分并没有被带到前面。在第二阶段中，该部分正在准备中，可以说，被认为是一个属性，但它还没有被如此识别。在第三阶段，整体和部分被明确地表达出来。</p><p>In the first and second stages, the whole and the parts were experienced or lived through, but they were not made thematic. Strictly speaking, they were not yet articulated. Even in the second stage, when the part was brought to the fore, it was highlighted, but it was not yet acknowledged explicitly as a part. The part was brought to the fore, but its being a part was not brought to the fore. In this second stage the part is being prepped, so to speak, to become acknowledged as an attribute, but it has not been so identified as yet. In the third stage the whole and the parts are explicitly articulated.</p>

  <p>然而，我们应该注意到，如果没有第二阶段提供的准备，没有结构的第一眼红，没有对超越简单持续感知的特征的专注，就无法达到第三阶段。第一阶段的差异化程度不足以直接产生类别结构。需要第二阶段的特别关注。我们必须开始体验整体中的一部分（磨损），然后才能如此表达（“汽车损坏了！”）。</p><p>We should note, however, that the third stage could not be reached without the preparation afforded in the second, without the first blush of structure, the concentration on a feature, that goes beyond simple continuous perception. The first stage is not differentiated enough to yield a categorial structure directly. The special focus that occurs in the second stage is needed. We have to begin to experience a part within the whole (the abrasion) before we can articulate it as such ("The car is damaged!").</p>

  <p>我们刚才所描述的内容包含了很多哲学材料。我们已经描述了当我们从简单的感知到分类意图，再到思考时发生的意向性转变。我们所描述的有意成就是人类语言和言语的深思熟虑的基础。语言不会自行漂浮在我们的情感之上；我们可以使用语言的原因是我们能够进行构成范畴对象的那种意图。定义语言的句法是基于范畴意图中发生的整体和部分的表达。语言中的句法只是表达范畴意识中所带出的部分与整体的关系。我们可以交流的原因，我们可以告诉别人“那边那辆车坏了”的原因，是因为我们有能力从感知到分类思维。并不是因为我们有语言，我们才能思考；相反，我们拥有语言是因为我们可以思考，因为我们有能力实现明确的意图。理性意识的力量是语言能力的基础。的确，我们继承的语言将我们的范畴活动向这个或那个方向施加压力，进入这些或那些范畴形式，但拥有语言的能力本身是基于我们在范畴领域中享有的那种意向性。理性意识的力量是语言能力的基础。的确，我们继承的语言将我们的范畴活动向这个或那个方向施加压力，进入这些或那些范畴形式，但拥有语言的能力本身是基于我们在范畴领域中享有的那种意向性。理性意识的力量是语言能力的基础。的确，我们继承的语言将我们的范畴活动向这个或那个方向施加压力，进入这些或那些范畴形式，但拥有语言的能力本身是基于我们在范畴领域中享有的那种意向性。</p><p>A lot of philosophical material is contained in what we have just described. We have described the shift in intentionality that occurs when we go from simple perception to categorial intending, to thinking. The intentional achievement we have described is the thoughtful basis for human language and speech. Language does not float by itself on top of our sensibility; the reason we can use language is that we are capable of the kind of intending that constitutes categorial objects. The syntax that defines language is grounded on the articulation of wholes and parts that takes place in categorial intending. Syntax in language simply expresses the relations of part and whole that are brought out in categorial consciousness. The reason we can communicate, the reason we can tell someone, "That car over there is damaged", is because we have the power to go from perception to categorial thinking. It is not the case that we can think because we have language; rather, we have language because we can think, because we have the ability to achieve categorial intentions. The power of rational consciousness underlies the capacity for language. It is true that the language we inherit pressures our categorial activities in this direction or that, into these or those categorial forms, but the very ability to have language is based on the kind of intentionalities that we enjoy in the categorial domain.</p>

  <p>我们需要一些时间来解开这种从经验到判断的转变的含义。首先，我们应该注意到，进入范畴领域显然与之前的体验不连续。进入范畴不仅仅是更多的感知；它不仅仅是感知中给出的流形的进一步展开。在前面提到的第三个阶段，当我们回到整体并将其准确地记录为包含所讨论部分的整体时，我们中断了知觉的连续性。我们在一个新的水平上重新开始；我们回顾我们一直在经历的事情，并开始一个新的身份认同水平。这个新的开端安装了一种新的意识和一种新的对象，即事态，作为该意识的客观相关物。</p><p>It will take us some time to unpack the implications of this transition from experience to judgment. First of all, we should note that the move into the categorial domain is obviously discontinuous with the experiencing that preceded it. The move into the categorial is not just more perception; it is not just a further unrolling of the manifolds that are given in perception. In the third stage noted earlier, when we go back to the whole and register it precisely as the whole containing the part in question, we interrupt the continuity of perception. We start again on a new level; we go back over what we had been experiencing and initiate a new level of identity. This new beginning installs a new kind of consciousness and a new kind of object, the state of affairs, as the objective correlate of that consciousness.</p>

  <p>第二，被登记的事态，汽车被损坏，是一个“一”，一个不同于感知中给出的身份的统一体。这是一种高度的团结。它更加离散和可识别。随着越来越多的配置文件被提供，持续的感知一直在继续，这个过程本可以无限期地持续下去。然而，现在我们有一个单一的事态（“汽车损坏了”）可以被捡起并随身携带，可以这么说；它可以脱离直接的感知和我们目前的处境。它可以在交流中传达给其他人。（相比之下，我们不能真正将我们的感知或记忆交给其他人。）它可以在逻辑上与我们登记的其他事态相关。身份主题，这甚至在知觉中也非常重要，在知觉中，身份是通过流形给出的，获得了新的意义和新的强度水平。我们现在在范畴意识中有了身份，这种身份通过言语呈现、保存和传递。</p><p>Second, the state of affairs that is registered, the car's being damaged, is a "one", a unity in a way that is different from the identity that was given in perception. It is a heightened unity. It is more discrete and identifiable. The continuous perception just went on and on as more and more profiles were given, in a process that could have continued indefinitely. Now, however, we have a single state of affairs ("The car is damaged") that can be picked up and carried around, so to speak; it can be detached from the immediacy of perception and from our present situation. It can be conveyed to someone else in a communication. (In contrast, we cannot really hand our perceptions or our memories over to someone else.) It can be logically related to other states of affairs that we register. The theme of identity, which was so important even in perception, where an identity is given through manifolds, acquires a new sense and a new level of intensity. We now have identity in categorial consciousness, the kind of identity that is presented, preserved, and transported through speech.</p>

  <p>第三，范畴对象的身份一目了然。在知觉中，我们有一个过程，在这个过程中，轮廓依次相继出现，但在类别登记中，整体和部分是同时给出的。并不是我们首先拥有整体本身（“汽车”），然后作为单独的成就，部分或谓词（“损坏”），然后在两者之间建立关系（“是”）。相反，即使我们将汽车注册为整体，我们也必须已经考虑到零件。整体与部分同时出现。当我们得到一个清晰的整体时，我们并不是先有整体，然后才有清晰度。整体本身仅以明确表达的形式呈现。范畴对象的这种同时性是其离散性的另一个方面，</p><p>Third, the identity of the categorial object is presented all at once. In perception we have a process in which profiles follow one another sequentially, but in categorial registration the whole and the part are given simultaneously. It is not the case that we first have the whole all by itself ("the car") and then, as a separate achievement, the part or the predicate ("damaged"), and then a relation drawn between the two ("is"). Rather, even as we register the car as the whole, we must already have the part in mind. The whole-with-part comes all at once, synchronously. When we have an articulated whole given to us, we do not have the whole first and then the articulation. The whole as such is presented only as articulated. This simultaneity of the categorial object is a further aspect of its discreteness, which must be contrasted with the continuous character of perceptual experience.</p>

  <p>在现象学术语中，范畴对象的成立称为它们的<em>构成</em>. “宪法”一词不应被理解为任何类似于创造或将主观形式强加于现实的东西。在现象学中，“构成”一个范畴对象意味着将其暴露、阐明、产生、实现其真理。我们不能随心所欲地表现一件事；我们不能让一个对象代表我们想要的任何意思。只有当某物在某种光线下出现时，我们才能将其暴露出来。如果我们要能够宣布它具有某些特征，那么它必须显示出我们可以关注的某些方面。如果我们没有经历过像车内擦伤这样的事情，我们就不能认定这辆车是损坏的。当然，我们可能会被假象所误导，汽车只是被刮了一下，我们可能会错误地声明它已损坏，而实际上它没有；但是我们只是通过进一步和更近距离地体验汽车，或者通过倾听其他人对它的看法，或者通过弄清楚事情的真相来纠正这种情况；然后我们就会发现我们错了。我们必须服从事物自我展现的方式。以这种方式服从并不是要限制我们的自由，而是要实现我们的智慧的完美，而智慧的本性就是揭示事物的本来面目。以这种方式服从就是带来客观性的胜利，这是我们的思想应该做的。“构成”事态，就是运用我们的理解力，让一件事向我们显现。但是我们只是通过进一步和更近距离地体验汽车，或者通过倾听其他人对它的看法，或者通过弄清楚事情的真相来纠正这种情况；然后我们就会发现我们错了。我们必须服从事物自我展现的方式。以这种方式服从并不是要限制我们的自由，而是要实现我们的智慧的完美，而智慧的本性就是揭示事物的本来面目。以这种方式服从就是带来客观性的胜利，这是我们的思想应该做的。“构成”事态，就是运用我们的理解力，让一件事向我们显现。但是我们只是通过进一步和更近距离地体验汽车，或者通过倾听其他人对它的看法，或者通过弄清楚事情的真相来纠正这种情况；然后我们就会发现我们错了。我们必须服从事物自我展现的方式。以这种方式服从并不是要限制我们的自由，而是要实现我们的智慧的完美，而智慧的本性就是揭示事物的本来面目。以这种方式服从就是带来客观性的胜利，这是我们的思想应该做的。“构成”事态，就是运用我们的理解力，让一件事向我们显现。然后我们就会发现我们错了。我们必须服从事物自我展现的方式。以这种方式服从并不是要限制我们的自由，而是要实现我们的智慧的完美，而智慧的本性就是揭示事物的本来面目。以这种方式服从就是带来客观性的胜利，这是我们的思想应该做的。“构成”事态，就是运用我们的理解力，让一件事向我们显现。然后我们就会发现我们错了。我们必须服从事物自我展现的方式。以这种方式服从并不是要限制我们的自由，而是要实现我们的智慧的完美，而智慧的本性就是揭示事物的本来面目。以这种方式服从就是带来客观性的胜利，这是我们的思想应该做的。“构成”事态，就是运用我们的理解力，让一件事向我们显现。这就是我们的思想应该做的。“构成”事态，就是运用我们的理解力，让一件事向我们显现。这就是我们的思想应该做的。“构成”事态，就是运用我们的理解力，让一件事向我们显现。</p><p>In phenomenological terminology, the establishment of categorial objects is called their <em>constitution</em>. The term "constitution" should not be taken to mean anything like a creation or an imposition of subjective forms on reality. In phenomenology, to "constitute" a categorial object means to bring it to light, to articulate it, to bring it forth, to actualize its truth. We cannot manifest a thing any way we please; we cannot make an object mean anything we wish. We can bring a thing to light only if the thing offers itself in a certain light. The thing has to show up with certain aspects that we can spotlight if we are to be able to declare that it has certain features. If we did not experience something like the abrasions in the car, we would not be able to constitute the car as damaged. Of course, we might be misled by false appearances, in which the car merely seems to be scraped, and we might erroneously declare that it is damaged when it is not; but then we remedy this situation simply by further and closer experience of the car, or by listening to what other people have to say about it, or by figuring out what must really be the case; we will then come to see that we were wrong. We have to submit to the way things disclose themselves. To submit in this way is not to place limitations on our freedom, but to achieve the perfection of our intelligence, which is geared by its nature to disclosing the way things are. To submit in this way is to bring about the triumph of objectivity, which is what our minds are supposed to do. To "constitute" a state of affairs is to exercise our understanding and to let a thing manifest itself to us.</p>

  <p>关于术语的一些进一步说明：范畴对象从经验中的发展被称为<em>发生</em>构造，因为较高的客观性通过这些阶段来自较低的客观性。范畴对象和意图显然是<em>建立</em>在简单对象和意图之上的。它们<em>是非独立的</em>部分。人类的智力活动是基于感性的。最后，<em>谓语</em>意向性，其中我们谓述一个对象的特征并声明“S 是 p”，是范畴活动的卓越形式；术语<em>谓词</em>相比之下，用于指定范畴之前的那种体验和意向性。现象学的主要课题之一是预测性经验，即先于但也导致范畴成就的那种经验。</p><p>Some further remarks on terminology: the development of categorial objects from experience is called <em>genetic</em> constitution, because of the stages through which the higher objectivities come to be from the lower. The categorial objects and intentions are obviously <em>founded</em> on the simple objects and intentions. They are <em>nonindependent</em> parts. Human intellectual activity is based on the sensible. Finally, <em>predicative</em> intentionality, in which we predicate a feature of an object and declare that" S is p", is the preeminent form of categorial activity; the term <em>prepredicative</em>, in contrast, is used to designate the kind of experience and intentionality that precedes the categorial. One of the major topics in phenomenology is that of prepredicative experience, the sort of experiencing that precedes but also leads up to categorial achievements.</p>

  <p>我们在对范畴意向性的分析中仍然使用谓词，但是一旦我们进入这种更高层次的意识形式，就会发生许多其他类型的表达。除了说“这辆车坏了”之外，我们还可以表达汽车的其他内部特征：“这辆车很大”、“它很旧”、“它是一辆福特”。我们可以表达它的外部关系：“它在停车场”，“它在本田旁边”，“它比我的卡车小”。我们可以将其包含在一个集合中：“有五辆车”，“其中三辆车似乎损坏了”。我们可以引入独立和从句、连词、介词、关系代词和关系从句、副词、形容词和许多其他语法特征，所有这些都表达了允许表达事物的各种方式。范畴的范围非常广泛，与人类语言的语法一样广泛。</p><p>We have remained with predication in our analysis of categorial intentionality, but there are many other kinds of articulation that can take place once we move into this higher-level form of consciousness. Besides saying, "The car is damaged", we can articulate other internal features of the car: "The car is large", "It is old", "It is a Ford". We can articulate its external relations: "It is in the parking lot", "It is next to the Honda", "It is smaller than my truck". We can include it in a collection: "There are five cars", "Three of the cars seem to be damaged". We can introduce independent and subordinate clauses, conjunctions, prepositions, relative pronouns and relative clauses, adverbs, adjectives, and many other grammatical features, all of which express various ways of allowing things to be articulated. The range of the categorial is very wide, as extensive as the grammar of human language.</p>

  <p>范畴表达的整个领域，以其所有的多样性和细微差别，连同图画和象征，都依赖于感知、想象、记忆和预期等“较低”的意向性。范畴语言的意向性使我们的感知、想象、记忆和预期变得人性化；它将他们提升到比他们在动物王国中达到的更理性的水平。范畴意图引入了新的流形，这些流形补充和渗透了在预测体验中发现的流形。</p><p>This whole domain of categorial articulation, in all its variety and nuances, rests, together with picturing and symbolizing, upon the "lower" intentionalities of perception, imagination, remembering, and anticipation. The categorial linguistic intentionality humanizes our perception, imagination, remembering, and anticipation; it raises them to a more rational level than they achieve in the animal kingdom. Categorial intending introduces new manifolds that supplement and penetrate the manifolds found in prepredicative experience.</p>

  <p>范畴意向性本身就是一种新的认同，一种新的身份综合，它也补充和渗透了那些在预测性经验中获得的东西。当我们明确地意指立方体时，我们不仅拥有立方体的同一性，它是通过多种侧面、方面和轮廓，以及通过多种多样的记忆、想象和预期来感知的；我们还可以通过我们可以对它做出的陈述、我们可以听到别人从他们的角度对它发表的陈述以及当我们倾听别人所说的然后尝试确认他们的观点时我们可以获得的成就感通过去寻找并直接表达自己。在范畴域中开辟了全新的表现形式和真理范围。甚至我们的想象、记忆，预期呈现出一种范畴上的复杂性：我们不仅可以预期“水”，还可以预期“来自山泉的凉水”。在人的意识中，知觉、想象、记忆和预期都表现出在理性思维中被命令完成的效果。我们运用这些意图形式的方式取决于它们对类别意向性的参与。</p><p>Categorial intentionality is itself a new kind of identification, a new kind of identity synthesis, that also supplements and penetrates those achieved in prepredicative experience. When we categorially intend the cube, we have not just the identity of a cube that is perceived through a manifold of sides, aspects, and profiles, and through the manifolds of memory, imagination, and anticipation; we also have the identity achieved through the statements we can make about it, the statements we can hear others make about it from their points of view, and the fulfillments we can achieve when we listen to what others say and then try to confirm their opinions by going and looking and directly articulating for ourselves. A whole new range of manifestation and truth is opened up in the categorial domain. Even our imaginings, memories, and anticipations take on a categorial complexity: we can anticipate not only "water" but "the cool water from the mountain spring". In human consciousness, perception, imagination, remembering, and anticipation all show the effects of being ordered toward their completion in rational thinking. The way we exercise these forms of intending is shaped by their involvement in categorial intentionality.</p>

  <p>在范畴意图中发生的事情是，我们感知到的事物被提升到理性的空间、逻辑、论证和理性思维的领域。范畴经验是从感知到智能的转折点，语言和句法在此发挥作用。通过范畴表述，我们感知到的事物被记录下来并进入推理和对话领域。简单的感知更多的是生理和心理过程，而分类注册是进入逻辑的第一步。</p><p>What happens in categorial intentions is that the things we perceive become elevated into the space of reasons, the domain of logic, argument, and rational thinking. Categorial experience is the transit point leading from perception to intelligence, where language and syntax come into play. Through categorial articulation, the things we perceive become registered and admitted into the field of reasoning and conversation. Simple perception is more of a physiological and psychological process, while categorial registration is the first move into logic.</p>

  <p>当我在第 3 章谈到对象作为多种呈现中的身份时，我坚持认为身份本身永远不会作为它被赋予的侧面、方面和轮廓之一出现。它的身份属于另一个维度。然而，当我们为对象命名并将其纳入范畴表述时，我们所指的正是这种同一性。因此，当我们说出“立方体”这个词并开始断言它的特征时，我们所指的身份就是我们在说出“立方体”这个词时所指的同一性。立方体的身份是感知和思想之间的桥梁。</p><p>When I spoke, in Chapter 3, about the object as an identity within a manifold of presentation, I insisted that the identity itself never shows up as one of the sides, aspects, and profiles through which it is given. Its identity belongs to another dimension. It is this identity, however, that we refer to when we name the object and bring it into categorial articulation. Thus, the cube that is perceptually given in and through a manifold of sides, aspects, and profiles is the identity that we refer to when we utter the words "the cube" and begin to predicate features of it. The identity of the cube is the bridge between perception and thought.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_7.xhtml.heading_id_5"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_7.xhtml.ch7_co"></a>分类对象</h2><h2><a></a>CATEGORIAL OBJECTS</h2>

  <p>通过我们的范畴意图，我们建立了范畴对象。我们构成事态，例如汽车损坏的事实。这些分类对象确实是对象；它们不仅仅是概念或想法的排列。它们不是“心智内”的对象；它们是发生在我们遇到的事物中的智力结晶。在分类活动中，我们阐明了事物呈现给我们的方式；我们揭示了存在于世界事物中的关系。此外，我们有这种以世界为导向的关注点，无论我们想要呈现给我们的事物还是不存在的事物。我们必须强调一个事实，范畴对象是事物出现的方式；它们不是主观的、心理上的“头脑中的东西”。</p><p>Through our categorial intentions, we establish categorial objects. We constitute states of affairs, such as the fact that the car is damaged. These categorial objects truly are objects; they are not just arrangements of concepts or ideas. They are not "intramental" objects; they are intellected crystallizations that take place in the things we encounter. In categorial activity we articulate the way things are presented to us; we bring to light relationships that exist in things in the world. We have this world-directed focus, moreover, whether we intend things that are present to us or things that are absent. We must emphasize the fact that categorial objects are ways in which things appear; they are not subjective, psychological "things in the mind".</p>

  <p>为了说明范畴对象的客观性，让我们考察其他几个例子。我们已经讨论过声明所表达的事态，“这辆车被损坏了”。再举一个例子，假设我正在与另外两个人进行讨论。讨论继续进行，但随后一些可疑的事情开始浮出水面；他们说的话和说话方式有些奇怪。这个中间阶段就像我们前面例子中的阶段，当汽车上的擦伤开始引起我们的注意时。然后，突然间，我记下了当时的情况：“他们正试图对我施加影响！” 事态一目了然，分类直觉得以实现，整体和部分都得到了表达，句法融入了我的体验。</p><p>To bring out the objectivity of categorial objects, let us examine a few other examples. We have already talked about the state of affairs expressed by the statement, "This car is damaged". As another example, suppose I am engaged in a discussion with two other people. The discussion progresses, but then something fishy begins to surface; something smells strange in what they are saying and the way they are saying it. This intermediate stage is like the stage, in our previous example, when the abrasions on the car begin to attract our attention. Then, suddenly, I register the situation: "They are trying to put something over on me!" The state of affairs clicks into place, a categorial intuition is achieved, the wholes and parts are articulated, syntax is installed into what I experience.</p>

  <p>再一次，假设我正沿着一条小径行走，看着旁边的岩石。突然我意识到那边的东西不是石头而是化石。相当被动的知觉水平，通过许多侧面连续识别一个和同一物体，让位于对事态的记录，“那不仅仅是一块岩石；它是地下的化石！”</p><p>Again, suppose I am walking along a trail, looking at the rocks along the side. Suddenly I realize that the thing over there is not a rock but a fossil. The rather passive level of perception, the continuous identification of one and the same object through many profiles, gives way to a registration of the state of affairs, "That is not just a rock; it's a fossil in the ground!"</p>

  <p>我们检查过的例子——损坏的汽车、欺骗行为、化石而不是岩石——是对我们面前事物的表述。它们不是精神实体，它们不仅仅是头脑中的意义；它们改变了事物呈现给我们的方式。这些修改，这些呈现方式的变化，是“在世界上”的，但显然它们并不像一棵树或一张桌子在世界上那样在世界上。相反，它们是更高级别的对象。它们“在那里”作为更复杂的呈现模式，更复杂的表现方式。我们使用的词语（“车坏了”、“他们在欺骗我”）所表达的事态确实是世界的一部分。它们是世界的某些部分——这辆车，</p><p>The examples we have examined — the damaged car, the deceptive behavior, the fossil and not the rock — are articulations of things that are before us. They are not mental entities, they are not just meanings in the mind; they are modifications in the way things are being presented to us. These modifications, these changes in the mode of presentation, are "in the world", but obviously they are not in the world in the manner in which a tree or a table is in the world. Rather, they are higher-level objects. They are "out there" as more complex modes of presentation, more intricate ways of being manifested. The states of affairs expressed by the words that we use ("The car is damaged", "They are deceiving me") are truly parts of the world. They are how certain segments of the world — this car, this behavior — can be articulated.</p>

  <p>这些例子中的事态就在我们面前。我们凭直觉。然而，在我们说话的大部分时间里，我们所表达的事态并不存在。我们谈论不存在的东西：昨天的足球比赛，我们的国会议员如何投票，在夏普斯堡战役中发生了什么。人类拥有的语言给了我们巨大的影响力；我们可以谈论很久以前和非常遥远的事情，甚至可以谈论距我们极其遥远的星系和数十亿年前的时间段。我们的大部分谈话都没有达到那么远；其中大部分是更本地化的（“你砰地关上门后她做了什么？”“牙医小心吗？”），但它仍然主要涉及缺失的内容。</p><p>The states of affairs in these examples are there directly before us. We intuit them. Most of the time that we speak, however, the states of affairs that we express are absent from us. We talk about what is not present: yesterday's football game, how our congressman is voting, what happened at the Battle of Sharpsburg. The human possession of language gives us enormous reach; we can talk about things long ago and very far away, even about galaxies that are incredibly distant from us and periods of time billions of years ago. Most of our talk does not reach quite that far; most of it is much more local ("What did she do after you slammed the door?" "Was the dentist careful?"), but it still reaches largely into what is absent.</p>

  <p>非常重要的一点是，当我们谈论不在场时，我们仍然在表达世界的一部分。我们不会将我们的想法或概念作为缺席事物的替代存在。我们是如此的构成，以至于我们可以在它们不存在和存在的情况下意图它们。意识的意向性是这样的，它总是向外延伸，即使它针对的是不在它面前的事物。如果我就安提塔姆战役发表演讲，我和我的听众想要这场战役，即使它发生在一百三十多年前；如果你和我在华盛顿特区谈论帝国大厦，我们谈论的就是这座建筑，而不是我们谈话时可能会想到的某些含义或图像。</p><p>An extremely important point is the fact that when we speak about the absent, we still are articulating a part of the world. We are not turning to our ideas or concepts as substitute presences for the things that are absent. We are so constituted that we can intend things in their absence as well as in their presence. The intentionality of consciousness is such that it reaches outward all the time, even when it targets things that are not before it. If I give a speech about the Battle of Antietam, I and my audience intend that battle even though it happened over one hundred thirty years ago; if you and I, here in Washington, DC, talk about the Empire State Building, it is the building we are talking about, not some meanings or images that might come to mind during our conversation.</p>

  <p>然而，我们关于不在场的话语被我们谈论在场的情节打断了。有时我们可能只是对附近的物体、我们可以感知的物体有话要说。在其他时候，我们谈论不存在的事情可能会要求我们去查明我们所说的是否属实。我们可能会因为我们说的话而受到质疑，至少在某些情况下，我们可以通过去看看是什么情况来解决这个问题，也就是说，通过去某个地方并在其出现时明确地记录情况（“看；我告诉过你一只猫头鹰在这个谷仓里筑巢”）。当我们做不到时，我们可以求助于他人的见证、文件、遗迹等其他形式的间接证实，</p><p>Our discourse about the absent is, however, punctuated by episodes in which we speak about what is present. Sometimes we might just have something to say about the objects that are nearby, objects that we can perceive. At other times, our speech about absent things might demand that we go and find out whether what we say is true or not. We might be questioned about what we say, and at least in some cases we can resolve the question by going to see what is the case, that is, by going somewhere and categorially registering the situation in its presence ("See; I told you that an owl was nesting in this barn"). When we cannot do this, we may resort to the witness of others, to documents, to relics, and to other forms of indirect confirmation, but many of these in turn will have been based on direct categorial registrations that were carried out by someone else.</p>

  <p>因此，虽然我们的讲话主要针对不存在的事物，但它可以转向存在的事物来证实或否定我们所说的不存在的事物。同一性综合发生在我们在其不存在时所期望的事态与我们现在在其确认存在时所期望的相同事态之间。我们将现在给出的情况确定为与我们仅谈论它时预期的情况相同。</p><p>Thus, although our speech is mostly directed toward things that are absent, it can turn to things that are present to confirm or disconfirm what we say about the absent. An identity synthesis takes place between the state of affairs that we intended in its absence and the same state of affairs we now intend in its confirming presence. We identify the situation given now as the same as the one we intended when we only spoke about it.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_7.xhtml.heading_id_6"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_7.xhtml.ch7_emmct"></a>消除作为精神或概念事物的意义</h2><h2><a></a>THE ELIMINATION OF MEANINGS AS MENTAL OR CONCEPTUAL THINGS</h2>

  <p>在讨论从处理不在场的范畴行为到处理现在的范畴行为的转变时，我们引入了真理的问题。我们注意到，在我们的世俗经验中，我们试图看看在没有对象的情况下所做的陈述是否真实。但到目前为止，我们的分析似乎缺少一些东西。</p><p>In discussing the transition from categorial actions dealing with the absent to those dealing with the present, we have introduced the issue of truth. We noted that in our worldly experience we try to see whether the statements made in the absence of the objects are true or not. But something seems to be missing in our analysis so far.</p>

  <p>我们话语的“意义”在哪里？我们执行的判断在哪里？传统上，我们所说的话的意义，我们所做的判断或命题，我们所拥有的观念，都被看作是某种精神上或概念上的东西，是离我们更近的东西，是从不缺席的东西。因为人们认为这些东西总是直接呈现在我们的脑海中，所以它们似乎能够充当我们和我们想要的东西之间的桥梁，尤其是当我们想要一些不存在的东西时。这些事情可以解释我们如何被引导到不靠近我们的地方。这种对意义和命题的理解可以在一些中世纪思想家、笛卡尔、英国经验主义者和康德、当代认知科学和许多语言哲学家中找到。</p><p>Where does "the meaning" of our words exist? Where are the judgments we perform? Traditionally, the meaning of our words, the judgments or the propositions that we make, the ideas that we possess, have all been taken as some sort of mental or conceptual things, something closer to us, some sort of things that are never absent. Because such things were thought always to be directly present to our minds, they seemed able to serve as a bridge between us and what we intend, especially when we intend something that was absent. These things could explain how we could be directed toward that which was not near us. This understanding of meanings and propositions can be found in some medieval thinkers, in Descartes, the British Empiricists, and Kant, in contemporary cognitive science, and in many philosophers of language.</p>

  <p>此外，真理的问题似乎需要我们与事物之间的某种意义、概念或判断：当我们声称我们说的是真理时，我们暗示——我们不是吗？– 我们所说的，我们所拥有的意义，与外面的事物相对应。如果在我们所知道的事物之外没有意义和命题，我们怎么能说我们的判断符合事物的本来面目呢？有什么符合事实的？如果我们不把意义和判断设定为某种精神事物，我们怎么能解释什么是真理呢？常识似乎要求我们将意义设定为头脑中的某种实体。</p><p>Furthermore, the issue of truth seems to require some sort of meaning or concept or judgment between us and the thing: when we claim we have told the truth, we imply – do we not? – that what we said, the meanings we had, correspond to what is out there. If there are no meanings and propositions apart from the things we know, how can we ever say that our judgments conform to things as they are? What is there that could conform to the facts? How can we explain what truth is if we do not posit meanings and judgments as some sort of mental things? Common sense seems to demand that we posit meanings as some sort of entities in the mind.</p>

  <p>然而，尽管我们似乎被迫将意义和判断设定为心理或概念上的事物，但事实证明这些事物在哲学上令人尴尬和困惑。我们从不直接体验它们。它们被假定为我们离不开的东西，但没有人见过其中之一。它们是理论结构而不是熟悉的实体。它们是假定的，而不是给定的，它们之所以被假定是因为我们认为没有它们我们就无法解释知识和真理。它们是如何存在的？它们是什么类型的实体？它们是在头脑中还是在头脑与世界之间的某种第三领域？他们是如何将我们引向对象的？我们有多少人？他们是否进入真实存在然后离开它，从虚拟到实际再回到虚拟，当我们打电话给他们？它们似乎是我们之外事物和事态的复制品；为什么我们需要放置它们？但是我们怎样才能避免这样做呢？作为心理或表象实体的命题和意义似乎是一个陷阱，一个死胡同，一个难题。我们被哲学上的困惑困在其中。</p><p>And yet, although we seem forced to posit meanings and judgments as mental or conceptual things, such things turn out to be philosophically embarrassing and perplexing. We never directly experience them. They are postulated as something we cannot do without, but no one has ever seen one of them. They are theoretical constructs rather than familiar entities. They are postulated, not given, and they are postulated because we think we cannot explain knowledge and truth without them. How do they exist? What sort of entities are they? Are they in the mind or in some sort of third realm between the mind and the world? How do they do their work of referring us to objects? How many of them do we have? Do they come into actual existence and then go out of it, moving from virtual to actual and back to virtual again, as we call them up? They seem to be duplicates of the things and states of affairs outside us; why do we need to posit them? But how can we avoid doing so? Propositions and meanings as mental or representational entities seem to be a pis aller, a cuI de sac, an aporia. We are boxed into them by philosophical confusions.</p>

  <p>我相信现象学对哲学最复杂和最有价值的贡献之一在于它对判断和意义的处理。现象学能够表明，我们无需将判断和感觉设定为精神实体或思想与事物之间的中介。我们无需将它们介绍为哲学上令人费解的奇怪生物，它们具有将我们的意识与外部世界联系起来的神奇力量。现象学对判断、命题和概念的状态提供了一种新的解释，一种简单、优雅、真实的解释。它以下列方式进行。</p><p>I believe that one of the most sophisticated and most valuable contributions of phenomenology to philosophy lies in its treatment of judgments and meanings. Phenomenology is able to show that we need not posit judgments and senses as mental entities or as intermediaries between the mind and things. We need not introduce them as the philosophically perplexing, strange beings that have the magical power of relating our consciousness to the world outside. Phenomenology provides a new interpretation of the status of judgments, propositions, and concepts, one that is simple, elegant, and true to life. It does so in the following manner.</p>

  <p>假设你告诉我你给我看的餐具是纯银的。起初我只是附和你说的，把它看成是银子。在您的带领下，我记录了事态，“这个餐具是银的”。然后我开始怀疑。整件事并没有加起来；你怎么会有这么多银器？此外，它看起来或感觉起来都不像英镑；太轻了；它太小了。</p><p>Suppose you tell me that the flatware you are showing me is sterling silver. At first I simply go along with what you say and see it as silver. Following your lead, I register the state of affairs, "This flatware is silver". Then I begin to have doubts. The whole thing does not add up; how could you have so much silverware? Besides, it does not look or feel like sterling; it is too light; it is too tinny.</p>

  <p>此时发生的事情是，我改变了对我刚刚构成的事态的态度。最初，我只是想让餐具是银色的；我的意图是天真而直截了当。现在，我开始犹豫了。我进入了一种新的反思态度。我仍然打算将餐具作为银色，但现在我添加了限定词“按照你的建议”。我不再简单地相信；我暂停相信，但我仍然想要同样的东西和特征。我已经将事态“这个餐具是银的”变成了单纯的判断或意义“这个餐具是银的”。对我来说，这不再是简单的事态；<em>现在，对我来说，这是你所呈现</em>的情况；这个限定词只是你的判断，而不是简单的事实。</p><p>What happens at this point is that I have changed my attitude toward the state of affairs that I had just constituted. Originally, I simply intended the flatware's being silver; I intended it naively and straightforwardly. Now, I begin to hesitate. I enter into a new, reflective attitude. I still intend the flatware as silver, but now I add the qualifier, "As proposed by you". I no longer simply believe; I suspend belief, but I still intend the same thing-and-feature. I have changed the state of affairs, "This flatware is silver", into the mere judgment or meaning, "This flatware is silver". It is no longer a simple state of affairs for me; it is now, for me, a state of affairs <em>as being presented by you</em>; this qualifier makes it into just your judgment, not the simple fact.</p>

  <p>从事态到判断的变化是对我采取的新态度的回应。让我们把我的新态度称为“命题态度”，让我们把建立它的反思称为“命题（或判断）反思”。它也可以被称为apophantic reflection，因为它建立并转向判断，这在希腊语中被称为apophansis。判断、命题、意义、意义都是对这种新态度的回应。判断、命题或概念在被反思之前并不是作为一种中介实体提前存在的。它并没有预先进行将我们与现实世界联系起来的认识论工作。它不在那里，等待我们求助于它或推断它的存在。相反，它是呈现的一个维度，当我们通过命题反思进入命题态度时，呈现方式发生变化。当我们改变焦点时，它就会出现。该命题不是一个存在的实体；它是被表达出来的世界的一部分，但被当作只是某人的呈现：在这种情况下，它被当作你的呈现。这是你的判断。</p><p>The change from being a state of affairs to being a judgment occurs in response to a new attitude I have adopted. Let us call my new attitude the "propositional attitude", and let us call the reflection that establishes it the "propositional (or judgmental) reflection". It can also be called apophantic reflection, because it establishes and turns toward the judgment, which is called apophansis in Greek. The judgment, the proposition, the meaning, the sense arise in response to this new attitude. The judgment, proposition, or concept is not there ahead of time as a kind of mediating entity before it is reflected upon. It is not there beforehand doing its epistemological work of relating us to the real world. It is not there already, waiting for us to turn to it or to infer its presence. Rather, it is a dimension of presentation, a change in the mode of presentation, that arises when we enter into the propositional attitude by means of a propositional reflection. It arises when we change our focus. The proposition is not a subsistent entity; it is part of the world being articulated, but being taken as just someone's presentation: in this case, it is being taken as your presentation. It is your judgment.</p>

  <p>这种对命题和意义如何产生的新解释的好处是，它避免了将命题和意义设定为神秘的心理或概念实体的需要。它保留了所有意向性的世界指向性；甚至当我们提到判断时，我们指的是世界，但恰恰是指某人所提出的世界。</p><p>The benefit of this new explanation of how propositions and meanings come to be is that it avoids the need to posit propositions and meanings as mysterious mental or conceptual entities. It preserves the world directedness of all intentionality; even when we refer to a judgment, we are referring to the world, but to the world precisely as it has been proposed by someone.</p>

  <p>这种对判断的现象学分析也使我们能够阐明真理的对应理论。通常，真理对应论所讨论的最大问题是如何解释命题与事态的“匹配”。但实际上，更深层次的问题首先是什么命题；他们是怎么来的？他们有什么样的存在方式？在我们说它们如何对应事物之前，我们必须先说它们是什么样的。</p><p>This phenomenological analysis of judgment also allows us to clarify the correspondence theory of truth. Usually, the biggest problem discussed in the correspondence theory of truth is how to explain the "match" between the proposition and the state of affairs. But in fact, a deeper problem is the question of what propositions are in the first place; how do they come to be? What mode of existence do they have? Before we say how they can correspond to things, we have to say what they are like.</p>

  <p>现象学不是将判断、命题和感觉假定为中介实体，而是将它们视为与命题态度和命题反思相关联。它们的出现是为了回应我们将事态视为仅由某人提出的。在此分析中，不仅是“世界上”的事态；即使是一个命题也“在世界上”，但在世界上只是作为某人的投射。这就是通过某人所说的，世界被投射为存在的方式。</p><p>Instead of postulating judgments, propositions, and senses as mediating entities, phenomenology sees them as correlated to a propositional attitude and propositional reflection. They arise in response to our taking a state of affairs as being merely proposed by someone. In this analysis, not only is a state of affairs "in the world"; even a proposition is "in the world", but in the world only as being projected by someone. It is how the world is being projected as being, through what someone is saying.</p>

  <p>在我们的现象学分析中，我们已经达到了以下一点：我们已经从天真地意向事态转变为反思性地采取“如你所陈述或提议的”相同的事态。扁平餐具“是”银质的，但仅限于您声明或赠送的；我不再纯粹而简单地打算这样做。接下来发生什么？在这一点上，我们有你想要的事态。我们还没有解决问题的真相。</p><p>We have reached the following point in our phenomenological analysis: we have moved from naively intending the state of affairs to reflectively taking the same state of affairs "as stated or proposed by you". The flatware "is" silver, but only as stated or presented by you; I am no longer intending it purely and simply as such. What happens next? At this point we have a state of affairs as intended by you. We do not yet have the truth of the question resolved.</p>

  <p>接下来发生的是我回到餐具并更仔细地检查它，查看它的销售单，寻找上面的铭文，也许征求其他人的意见，等等。然后，在充分检查自己之后，我可能会得出结论，“是的，毕竟是银”。如果这是我的询问结果，那么我发现你的判断确实符合事情的本来面目。我不再认为事态只是你提出来的。我回到了餐具“是银”的直截了当的初衷，但我的回归并不像最初的天真。我现在已经确认了事态，因为它已经通过了命题反思和确认的严峻考验。事态与我原意相同，也与你刚才提出的一样；</p><p>What happens next is that I go back to the flatware and inspect it more closely, look at its bill of sale, look for inscriptions on it, perhaps ask other people's opinion, and so on. Then, after sufficient inspection of my own, I might conclude, "Yes, it is silver after all". If this is the outcome of my inquiry, then I find that your judgment does correspond to the way things are. I no longer take the state of affairs as just being proposed by you. I go back to a straightforward intending of the "being silver" of the flatware, but my return is not like the original naive intention. I now have the state of affairs as confirmed, as having gone through the acid test of propositional reflection and confirmation. The state of affairs is the same one I originally intended, and the same I took as just proposed by you; but now it takes on a new layer of sense, a new noematic dimension: it is now a confirmed fact and not just a naively intended state of affairs.</p>

  <p>这种对判断与事实之间对应关系的解释可以称为“不引用”的真理理论，因为它涉及首先仅“引用”事态的步骤（在批判性分析中，当我将事态仅视为你提出的）然后去掉引号，取消命题反思，留下命题态度，回到直截了当的接受。然而，它是一种不引号理论，它所处理的不仅仅是引入和删除引号的语言现象；该理论提供的不仅仅是语言解释，因为它描述了引文和反引文背后的意向性转变。我们从简单的事态开始，然后转向提议的事态，</p><p>This explanation of the correspondence between judgment and fact can be called a "disquotational" theory of truth, because it involves the step of first merely" quoting" the state of affairs (during the critical analysis, when I take the state of affairs as merely proposed by you) and then removing the quotation marks, annulling the propositional reflection, leaving the propositional attitude, and going back to the straightforward acceptance. However, it is a disquotational theory that deals with more than the merely linguistic phenomenon of introducing and removing the quotation marks; the theory provides more than a linguistic explanation, because it describes the shifts in intentionality that underlie the quotation and disquotation. We begin with the state of affairs simply, then move to the state of affairs as proposed, then move to the state of affairs as confirmed.</p>

  <p>当然，我的调查很可能会得出结论，这个餐具毕竟不是银的；然后，“提议的事态”将永久持续下去。我不反驳，我不废除命题反思；餐具从来不是银的，它只是你提议的。因此，那个特定的“事态”过去和现在都只是你的命题，只是你的判断，只是你的意思，而不是事物本来的样子。事态变得永远不符合真实情况；它永远只是你的意见，而且是错误的。有趣的是，顺便说一下，意见或判断通常是依附于某人的主张，而事实则不是特定任何人的财产；它适合每个人。</p><p>Of course, my investigation might well result in the conclusion that the flatware is not silver after all; then, the "state of affairs as proposed" continues permanently. I do not disquote, I do not annul the propositional reflection; the flatware never was silver, it was only proposed as such by you. Therefore, that particular "state of affairs" was and is only your proposition, only your judgment, only your meaning, never the way the things are. The state of affairs becomes permanently disqualified from being truly the case; it will always remain just your opinion, and a false one at that. It is interesting to note, incidentally, that an opinion or a judgment is usually attached to someone whose proposition it is, while a fact is not the possession of anyone in particular; it is there for everyone.</p>

  <p>这种关于真理的现象学理论，不是在心理或语义实体与真实实体之间移动，而是完全在呈现领域运作。它区分了呈现类型（简单的、范畴的、命题的、确认的）的变体，并谈到了在这些变体引入的新流形中实现的身份。通过轮廓给出的感知对象现在通过范畴表述得到进一步识别，并通过批判性反思和确认识别的动作进一步提升为对象。</p><p>This phenomenological theory of truth, instead of moving between mental or semantic entities and real entities, operates entirely in the domain of presentation. It distinguishes varieties in the kinds of presentation (the simple, the categorial, the propositional, the confirmatory) and speaks about the identities that are achieved within the new manifolds that these varieties introduce. The perceptual object, given through profiles, is now further identified through categorial articulation and heightened still further as an object through the moves of critical reflection and confirming identification.</p>

  <p>语言类别验证的维度也引入了极大的丰富性和多样性，因为它涉及主体间的维度。我们不仅拥有别人可以看到而我看到这一面的立方体的另一面；比如说，我们也有几个世纪前人们发表的、现在人们证实或否定的言论，或者与我们截然不同、生活在不同时代和地点的人们发表的言论，但我们的理解并在某种程度上证实或证伪了这些言论自己深思熟虑的经验。我们也有我们所做的陈述，这些陈述将在其他地点和时间被其他人证实或否定。言语允许主体间的交流，其范围比基于简单共同知觉的交流广泛得多。</p><p>The dimension of linguistic categorial verification also introduces great richness and variety, because it involves an intersubjective dimension. We have not only the other side of the cube that someone else can see while I see this side; we also have, say, the statements made by people centuries ago, confirmed or disconfirmed by people now, or statements made by people very different from us, living in different times and places, and yet understood and to some degree verified or falsified by our own thoughtful experience. We also have the statements made by us that will be confirmed or disconfirmed by others in other places and times. Speech allows intersubjective exchanges that range far more widely than do the exchanges based on simple common perceptions.</p>

  <p>我们已经考虑过的意向性步骤——朴素的、范畴的意向，批判的、命题的反思，以及返回确认或否定的步骤——都是在自然态度中进行的。现象学的真理和意义理论从先验的现象学态度的角度分析了这些步骤及其要素。从这个角度，它反思了我们在前哲学活动中所执行的真实和错误的意向性，并阐明了其中发生的事情。</p><p>The steps in intentionality that we have considered – of naive, categorial intending, of critical, propositional reflection, and of the return to confirmation or disconfirmation – are all carried out in the natural attitude. The phenomenological theory of truth and meaning analyzes these steps and their elements from the vantage point of the transcendental, phenomenological attitude. From this perch, it reflects on the true and false intentionalities that are carried out in our prephilosophical engagements and clarifies what goes on in them.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_7.xhtml.heading_id_7"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_7.xhtml.ch7_frcao"></a>关于范畴行为和对象的进一步说明</h2><h2><a></a>FURTHER REMARKS ON CATEGORIAL ACTS AND OBJECTS</h2>

  <p>显然，当我们进入分类意图时，我们比仅仅感知、想象、记忆和预期事物时更加活跃。在范畴意向性中有一个新的“产品”，范畴对象，无论该对象被视为事态还是判断（这是一种被提议的事态）。新产品，类别对象，可以从其直接上下文中分离出来，并通过使用语言与其他地方相关联。通过和你说话，我可以“给”你我现在看到和表达的同一个范畴对象。即使在不存在的情况下，您也可以清楚地表达同一对象。这种距离远比发生在记忆或想象的位移中的距离要激进得多，在记忆或想象的位移中，我也可以在他们不在的时候向自己展示事物。</p><p>Obviously, we are more active when we enter into categorial intentions than when we simply perceive, imagine, remember, and anticipate things. There is something like a new "product" in categorial intentionality, the categorial object, whether that object be taken as a state of affairs or a judgment (which is a state of affairs taken as proposed). The new product, the categorial object, can be detached from its immediate context and related somewhere else through the use of language. By speaking to you, I can "give" you the same categorial object that I see and articulate now. You can articulate that selfsame object even in its absence. This sort of distancing is much more radical than that which occurs in the displacements of remembering or imagining, in which I can also present things to myself in their absence. Remembering and imagining give us an original sense of the absent, but they do not allow the sort of communication of the absent, and the kind of control we can have over it, that occur in speech.</p>

  <p>范畴意向性将我们提升为一种适当的人类形式的真理，即涉及言语和推理的真理。但是，如果它允许这种形式的真理，那么它也允许人类适当地滥用真理；它使错误和谎言成为可能，其规模使低级意图的误解、失败的记忆和错误的想象相形见绌。如果我可以“给”你一个你没有经历过的事态，我也可以在我的演讲中“给”你一个虚假的版本，或者我可以“给”你一个根本没有发生过的事态。而且，我什至可以自相矛盾，即反对我自己。我可以有一个信念，然后有另一个取消第一个信念。我可能认为这个人很适合相处，并且也认为这个人讨厌与之相处的事态。我可以相信“S是<em>p</em> ”并且至少暗示地认为“S不是<em>p</em> ”。通常，这种矛盾是由情感牵扯引起的，在这种情况下，我们渴望两件不能同时拥有的东西，我们不希望正视它们事实上，我们不能同时拥有两者；它们也可能是由于混乱、注意力不集中和无法掌握手头事物的知识材料造成的。当我们谈到模糊这个话题时，我们将研究这种矛盾的知识根源。</p><p>Categorial intentionality elevates us into a properly human form of truth, the truth that involves speech and reasoning. But if it allows this form of truth, it also allows a properly human abuse of truth; it makes possible errors and falsehoods on a scale that dwarfs the misperceptions, failed memories, and misimaginings of the lower intentions. If I can "give" you a state of affairs that you have not experienced, I can also "give" you a false version of it in my speech, or I can "give" you a state of affairs that never happened at all. Also, I can even contradict, that is, speak against, my own self. I can have one conviction and then have another that annuls the first. I may hold as true the state of affairs that this person is good to be with, and also hold as true the state of affairs that this person is hateful to be with. I can believe that "S is <em>p</em>" and also hold, at least by implication, that "S is not <em>p</em>". Often, such contradictions are caused by emotional involvements, in which we desire two things that cannot be possessed together and we do not wish to face up to the fact that we cannot have both; they can also be caused by confusion, inattention, and inability to master the intellectual material of the thing at hand. We will examine this intellectual root of contradiction when we come to the topic of vagueness.</p>

  <p>进入范畴域也允许引入逻辑。逻辑不属于较低层次的感知及其变体，但它确实在范畴层次上发挥作用。一旦我们构成了范畴对象，我们就可以将这些对象形式化，并注意结果形式的一致性或不一致性。<em>我们可以处理纯形式“S is p</em> ”而不是处理范畴对象“The car is damaged” ，其中对象的内容变得无关紧要并且语法保持原样。我们处理的不是“汽车”，而是“任何对象”，而不是“损坏”，我们处理的是“任何属性”。然后，我们可以检查各种形式之间的关系，例如，形式“<em></em><em>”与“S p</em>是<em>q</em> ”的形式不一致。如果我们断言后者，然后继续断言前者（“这栋红房子很贵；这房子不是红的”），我们就会自相矛盾. 逻辑一致性是陈述为真的必要条件；如果陈述因其逻辑形式自相矛盾，那么它们就不能被我们对事物本身的经验先验地验证。</p><p>Entry into the categorial domain also permits the introduction of logic. Logic does not belong to the lower level of perception and its variants, but it does come into play on the categorial level. Once we have constituted categorial objects, we can formalize those objects and pay attention to the consistency or inconsistency of the forms that result. Instead of dealing with the categorial object, "The car is damaged", we can deal with the pure form, "S is <em>p</em>", in which the content of the object is rendered indifferent and the syntax is kept in place. Instead of "car" we deal with "any object whatever", and instead of "damaged" we deal with "any attribute whatever". Then, we can examine the relations among various forms and see, for example, that the form" S is not <em>p</em>" is not consistent with the form "S<em>p</em> is <em>q</em>". If we were to assert the latter and then go on to assert the former ("This red house is expensive; this house is not red"), we would be contradicting ourselves. Logical consistency is a necessary condition for the truth of statements; if statements contradict themselves by virtue of their logical form, then a priori they cannot be verified by our experience of the things themselves.</p>

  <p>在现象学中引入了两种形式系统的区别，一种是属于对象和事态以及事物的“本体论”方面的系统，另一种是属于判断或命题以及意义或意义领域的系统。研究对象和事态的形式结构的科学被称为<em>形式本体论</em>，而研究意义和命题的形式结构的科学被称为<em>形式断言学</em>。</p><p>A distinction is introduced in phenomenology between two kinds of formal systems, those belonging to objects and states of affairs and the "ontological" side of things, and those belonging to judgments or propositions and the region of sense or meaning. The science of the formal structures of objects and states of affairs is called <em>formal ontology</em>, while the science of the formal structures of senses and propositions is called <em>formal apophantics</em>.</p>

  <p>让我再评论一下我试图驳斥的将概念、判断、意义或感觉作为精神或概念实体的学说。认为需要这样的实体来解释知识表明未能认识到意识的意向性。它将意识视为简单的、纯粹的意识，只意识到自己，并假设必须通过插入某种表示来增加意向性：一个概念、一个词、一个命题、一个心理图像、一个符号，一种感觉，或者一个“意向标”。按照这种观点，意识本质上不是意向性的，而是表象。正是插入使意识成为有意的，并具体说明了意识的意图和意图：插入建立了一个意图，一个参考，和一种感觉。表征将我们与“外部”的对象联系起来，并赋予它们一定的意义。但是这样的添加剂怎么能赋予我们意识以意向性呢？我们怎么能知道给我们的是一个词或一个图像或一个概念，它代表了某种“超越”自身的东西？如果一开始不存在，“外部”的维度又如何为我们生起？如果意识一开始不是有意的，它就永远无法弄清楚如何变成这样。本身？如果一开始不存在，“外部”的维度又如何为我们生起？如果意识一开始不是有意的，它就永远无法弄清楚如何变成这样。本身？如果一开始不存在，“外部”的维度又如何为我们生起？如果意识一开始不是有意的，它就永远无法弄清楚如何变成这样。</p><p>Let me make one more comment about the doctrine that takes concepts, judgments, meanings, or senses as mental or conceptual entities, the doctrine that I have attempted to refute. To think that such entities are needed to explain knowledge betrays a failure to recognize the intentionality of consciousness. It is to take consciousness as simple, sheer awareness, conscious only of itself, and to assume that intentionality must be added to it by the insertion of some kind of representation: a concept, a word, a proposition, a mental image, a symbol, a sense, or a "noema". In this view, it is not consciousness that is essentially intentional, but the representation. It is the insert that makes consciousness intentional and specifies what the consciousness intends and how it intends it: the insert establishes an intention, a reference, and a sense. The representation relates us to the objects "outside" and gives them a certain meaning. But how could such an additive bestow intentionality on our awareness? How could we know that what is given to us is a word or image or a concept, and that it represents something "beyond" itself? How would the very dimension of an "outside" arise for us if it were not there in the beginning? If consciousness does not start out being intentional, it could never figure out how to become so.</p>

  <p>我们一直在考虑范畴意图及其相关对象，以及真理、意义、判断、事态、验证和逻辑。现象学还研究了另一个在这个现象网络中起着战略作用的主题，这个主题很少被大多数哲学家所关注。<em>就是模糊</em>现象。模糊性不仅在逻辑、意义和验证等更科学的问题上很重要，而且在语言的日常使用和负责任的说话者的建立方面也很重要。</p><p>We have been considering categorial intentions and their correlative objects, as well as truth, meaning, judgments, states of affairs, verification, and logic. Phenomenology also treats another topic that plays a strategic role in this network of phenomena, one that is only infrequently and marginally treated by most philosophers. It is the phenomenon of <em>vagueness</em>. Vagueness is important not only in regard to the more scientific issues of logic, meaning, and verification, but also in regard to the ordinary use of language and the establishment of a responsible speaker.</p>

  <p>当我们说或读到某事时，通常会假设我们会仔细思考我们所说或读到的内容。通常情况并非如此。经常不假思索地使用词语。我们可能在肤浅地阅读一些东西，或者我们可能听到某人说话但没有注意他在说什么，我们甚至可能在没有正确意识到我们所说的意思的情况下自己说一些事情，或者我们可能在死记硬背。有时我们正在谈论的材料超出了我们的范围；我们真的不明白我们在说什么。例如，人们谈论政治的大部分内容都是这样的。他们说的很多话都是含糊不清的：重复口号，说出最喜欢的想法，口头陈述他人的言论但不理解。大多数民意调查衡量的是模糊思维。人的言语力量，赋予我们作为人的尊严的崇高力量，也使我们有可能在实际上没有思考的时候似乎在思考。这是未能成为我们应该成为的人的一种特殊的人类方式，这在人类事务中非常重要。</p><p>When we say or read something, it is usually assumed that we think through what we say or read. This is often not the case. Words are frequently used without thought. We might be superficially reading something, or we might hear someone talk but fail to pay attention to what he says, we might even say things ourselves without being properly aware of the meaning of what we say, or we might be reciting something by rote. Sometimes the material we are talking about is beyond us; we really do not understand what we are saying. Much of what people say about politics, for example, is like this. Much of what they say is vague: slogans are repeated, favorite ideas are trotted out, statements made by others are stated verbally but without comprehension. Most public opinion polls measure vague thinking. The human power of speech, the noble power that gives us our dignity as human beings, also makes it possible for us to seem to be thinking when we really are not. This is a specifically human way of failing to be what we should be, and it is very important in human affairs.</p>

  <p>轻率的演讲中发生的是没有充分实现应该伴随演讲的范畴活动。有一些分类活动，但这不取决于正在讨论和断言的问题。有一系列的想法，但没有一个想法。如果我含糊其辞，那些听我说话的人，比我更有思想的人，随着时间的推移，通常会发现我说的话毫无意义。它是乱码。他会要求我澄清我的意思，从我提出的大杂烩中理解。如果他试图与我争论，他会一直感到沮丧；与含糊不清的人争论就像试图用手榴弹驱散迷雾。然而，一个不比我更深思熟虑的听众不会察觉到我在含糊其辞。在他自己的模糊中，他会，如果他喜欢我似乎采取的立场，就会觉得我成功地表达了我们共同的信念：“Un fou trouve toujours un plus fou qui l'admire”。如果听众不认同我似乎在说什么，他就会生我的气，并表达似乎是另一种观点。但是在所有这一切中，他的思想和我的思想都不是真正活跃的；我们表达的是情感态度，而不是截然不同的观点。没有真正的争论，只有半成型的思想碰撞。我们表达的是情感态度，而不是截然不同的观点。没有真正的争论，只有半成型的思想碰撞。我们表达的是情感态度，而不是截然不同的观点。没有真正的争论，只有半成型的思想碰撞。</p><p>What occurs in thoughtless speech is that the categorial activity that should accompany the speech is not adequately achieved. There is some categorial activity, but it is not up to the issues being discussed and asserted. There is a succession of ideas but not a thought. If I speak vaguely, someone who listens to me, and who is more thoughtful than I am, will usually find, as time goes on, that what I am saying makes no sense. It is garbled. He will ask me to clarify what I mean, to make sense out of the hodgepodge I am presenting. If he tries to argue with me he will be continuously frustrated; arguing with someone who speaks vaguely is like trying to use hand grenades to disperse a fog. A listener who is no more thoughtful than I am, however, will not perceive that I am speaking vaguely. In his own vagueness, he will, if he likes the position I seem to take, feel that I am successfully articulating our common belief: "Un fou trouve toujours un plus fou qui l'admire". If the listener does not sympathize with what I seem to be saying, he will be upset with me and express what seems to be another viewpoint. But in all this, neither his mind nor mine is truly active; we are expressing something like emotional attitudes rather than distinct opinions. There is no real argument, only a collision of half-formed thoughts.</p>

  <p>模糊性应该与关于真理和范畴对象的其他两种失败区分开来：无知和错误。在无知中，我们根本不试图阐明所讨论的范畴对象；我们只是对这个问题保持沉默。我们不会假装去思考它，我们似乎也没有在思考。当我们犯错时，我们会就某事形成一种观点，而且我们会明确地这样做，但结果证明它是不正确的。如果我们去谈论我们正在谈论的事情，并按照我们所说的那样去体验和记录它们，我们的意见就不会站得住脚。我们的提议将被否定。在这样的错误中，我们确实实现了分明思维，我们确实表达了一个范畴对象，但思维和对象都是错误的。如果我们要不正确，就必须克服模糊并达到清晰。</p><p>Vagueness should be distinguished from two other failures in regard to truth and categorial objects: ignorance and error. In ignorance we simply do not try to articulate the categorial objects in question; we just are silent about the issue. We do not pretend to think about it, and we do not seem to be thinking. When we are in error, we formulate an opinion about something, and we do so explicitly, but it turns out to be incorrect. Our opinion would not stand up if we went to the things we are talking about and tried to experience and register them as we state them to be. Our propositions would be disconfirmed. In such error, we do achieve distinct thinking, and we do articulate a categorial object, but the thinking and the object are false. We must have overcome vagueness and reached distinctness if we are to be incorrect.</p>

  <p>模糊介于无知和错误之间。这是不成熟的想法。这是一种思考的尝试，并没有完全到达那里，但它使用了通常表示思考的词，因此它掩饰了，无论多么无意。言辞炫耀，给人以思想的印象，但背后思想不足。</p><p>Vagueness comes between ignorance and error. It is inchoate thinking. It is an attempt to think that does not quite get there, but it uses the words that generally indicate thinking, and hence it dissimulates, however unintentionally. The words are paraded and give the impression of thought, but there is insufficient thought behind them.</p>

  <p>在某些情况下，一开始就含糊不清的说话者可能会仔细考虑他所说的话，并清楚地表达出他希望宣布的事态和判断。在这种情况下，说话者已经从模糊转为清晰。他成功地实现了他努力构成的绝对对象。他现在想得很清楚了。他现在提出事态或他早些时候试图提出的判断。</p><p>In some cases, it is possible for the speaker who begins with vagueness to think through the things he is saying and to articulate the states of affairs and judgments that he wishes to declare. In this case, the speaker has moved from vagueness to distinctness. He successfully achieves the categorial objects he was striving to constitute. He now thinks distinctly. He now presents the state of affairs or the judgment he was earlier trying to present.</p>

  <p>当说话者由模糊转为清晰时，他可能会发现他最终得到的判断确实是他之前模糊陈述的那个；判断在两种呈现方式中是相同的，模糊的和清晰的。但他也可能会发现明确的判断与模糊的判断不同；相反，他可能会发现模糊的判断本身就存在矛盾，既然已经明确了，矛盾就来了；他们之所以被隐藏，正是因为模糊。因此，逻辑矛盾或一致性的可能性要求我们使判断清晰明了，我们已经清楚地表达了它。直到一个判断变得清晰，我们才能真正说出它是真还是假，甚至与自身和其他判断一致或不一致，因为我们还不知道判断是什么。它还没有作为一种独特的含义存在，可以是真或假，一致或不一致。我们必须先知道某人在说什么，然后才能确定他说的是真是假。</p><p>When the speaker goes from vagueness to distinctness, he may find that the judgment he finally achieves is indeed the same one he had been vaguely stating; the judgment is the same in the two modes of presentation, the vague and the distinct. But he may also find that the distinct judgment is not the same as the vague one; rather, he may find that the vague judgment harbored contradictions within itself, and now that distinctness has been achieved, the contradictions come to the fore; they had been hidden, precisely because of the vagueness. Thus, the possibility of logical contradiction or consistency demands that we have brought the judgment to distinctness, that we have distinctly articulated it. Until a judgment is brought to distinctness, we cannot really say whether it is true or false, or even consistent or inconsistent with itself and other judgments, because we do not yet really know what the judgment is. It does not yet exist as a distinct meaning, one that could be true or false, consistent or inconsistent. We have to know what someone is saying before we can determine whether what he says is true or false.</p>

  <p>含糊不清可能导致不一致，但也可能导致<em>不连贯</em>。不一致是指我们所说的一部分在形式逻辑结构上与另一部分矛盾：我们既说“s is <em>p</em> ”又说“s is not <em>p”</em>“。另一方面，不连贯意味着我们判断的内容而不是形式没有正确组合。这意味着我们使用的内容词放在一起时毫无意义：我们可能，因为例如，从字面上说，国家是一个大家庭，或者政治宪法保证每个人都有工作，或者大脑知道谁进门（是人，而不是大脑，知道事情） . 矛盾涉及判断的形式，不连贯涉及判断的内容，两者都可能发生在模糊的迷雾中。单词意味着事物，但有可能以这样的方式将单词放在一起，即整体并不意味着一件事.整体的某些部分“反对”其他部分，或者某些部分没有与其他部分适当地混合（属于家庭的特征与国家混合，整个人的特征与人的有机部分之一混合）。</p><p>Vagueness can harbor inconsistency, but it can also harbor <em>incoherence</em>. Inconsistency means that one part of what we say contradicts another part in regard to formal logical structure: we say both "s is <em>p</em>" and "s is not <em>p</em>". Incoherence, on the other hand, means that the content, as opposed to the form, of our judgments is not properly assembled. It means that we are using content words that make no sense when they are put together: we might, for example, say that, literally, the nation is a big family, or that a political constitution guarantees a job for everyone, or that the brain knows who is coming through the door (it is the person, not the brain, that knows things). Contradiction deals with the form of judgments, incoherence deals with their content, and both can occur in the fog of vagueness. Words mean things, but it is possible to put the words together in such a way that the whole does not mean one thing. Some parts of the whole "speak against" other parts, or some parts are not blended properly with other parts (features that belong to families are blended with nations, features of the whole person are blended with one of the person's organic parts).</p>

  <p>每个人都有模糊的时候，这没什么好遗憾的。当我们进入一个新的思维领域时，我们必须从模糊开始。脑海中浮现的想法一开始几乎总是模糊不清的，然后要求清晰明了，然后过滤掉想法中的不一致和不连贯之处。初学数学的学生通常对他所表达的范畴对象非常模糊。如果他是个好学生，他就会走向卓越。有些人可以比其他人更容易、更快地获得独特性。有些人在某些领域永远无法摆脱模糊，而另一些人在任何领域都很难摆脱模糊。他们只是思维不清晰、思路不清晰，但他们使用的语言可能会让别人觉得他们的思维是正确的。话匣子就是含糊不清的活生生的例子。舆论充斥着模棱两可的问题，要求公众人物做一些自相矛盾的事情。“他们”说什么，“on dit”，什么“man sagt”，都是出了名的模糊，但它仍然是真实思考的起点。我们的思想，我们构成的范畴对象，并没有从一开始就完成和打磨。</p><p>Everyone is vague at some time, and there is nothing regrettable about that. We have to start with vagueness when we enter into a new domain of thinking. Ideas that come to mind are almost always vague at first and ask to be brought to distinctness, when the inconsistencies and incoherences in the idea will be filtered out. The student beginning mathematics is usually quite vague about the categorial objects he is articulating. If he is a good student, he will move on to distinctness. Some people can get to distinctness more easily and more quickly than others. Some people can never get out of vagueness in certain domains, while other people can hardly ever get out of vagueness in any domain. They just do not think clearly and distinctly, and yet they use language, which might make it seem to others that they are thinking properly. A chatterbox is a living example of vagueness. Public opinion is awash with vagueness, demanding contradictory things from public figures. What "they" say, what "on dit", what "man sagt", is notoriously vague, but it is still the starting point for authentic thinking. Our thoughts, the categorial objects we constitute, do not come finished and polished from the start.</p>

  <p>最后，我们对含糊的处理已经处理了它在言语和思想中的表现，但是含糊也会出现在行动中。长期说话不假思索的人很可能会以同样的方式行事，从一个半生不熟的举动中蹒跚而行，把事情搞得一团糟。在这种情况下，模糊带来的不一致和不连贯弥漫在深思熟虑和选择中。这种行为的景象，无论是在个人、机构还是政治事务中，都会引起观察者的怜悯或悲伤，这取决于他如何受到相关行为的影响。</p><p>Finally, our treatment of vagueness has dealt with its appearance in speech and thought, but vagueness also occurs in action. Someone who chronically speaks without thinking is likely to act in the same manner, lurching from one half-baked move to another and making a royal mess of things. In this case, it is deliberation and choice that are pervaded by the inconsistency and incoherence that vagueness brings. The spectacle of such conduct, whether in personal, institutional, or political affairs, arouses either pity or grief in the observer, depending on how he is affected by the action in question.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_7.xhtml.heading_id_9"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_7.xhtml.ch7_cohi"></a>分类对象和人类智能</h2><h2><a></a>CATEGORIAL OBJECTS AND HUMAN INTELLIGENCE</h2>

  <p>与其以人类思维的缺陷——模糊性为主题结束本章，不如让我们以更积极的方式结束本章，并考虑范畴对象领域的一些优点。</p><p>Instead of closing this chapter with the theme of vagueness, which is a deficiency in human thinking, let us end on a more positive note and consider some of the excellences of the domain of categorial objects.</p>

  <p>人类语言不同于动物的声音，因为它包含句法。人类语言包含声音，但它的声音是由音素模式和语法粒子、词形变化和位置构成的。正是语言的语法顺序使语言符号系统服从于人类控制，使其成为如此精致复杂和精致的系统，并使其成为运用真理的载体。语法将动物的声音提升为人类的话语。在现象学中，语言的句法元素被称为语言的<em>同范畴</em>部分，因为它们“伴随着”仅命名对象和特征的表达式，即言语的<em>范畴部分。</em></p><p>Human language differs from animal sounds because it contains syntax. Human language contains sound, but its sound is structured by phonemic patterns and by grammatical particles, inflections, and placements. It is the grammatical ordering of language that makes the linguistic sign system amenable to human control, that makes it a system of such exquisite complexity and refinement, and that lets it become the vehicle for the exercise of truth. Syntax elevates animal sounds into human discourse. In phenomenology, the syntactic elements of language have been called the <em>syncategorematic</em> parts of language, because they "come along with" the expressions that merely name objects and features, the <em>categorematic</em> parts of speech.</p>

  <p>语言的句法部分显然是用来连接单词的。它们是一种语言的语法。然而，这种语言学工作并不是他们所做的全部。它们也在意向性方面发挥作用：语言的句法与事物向我们展示自己的方式有关，与我们可以意图和表达它们的方式有关。语言的句法部分用于表达表示的组合，事物可以在各种部分-整体关系中呈现给我们的方式。现象学不像结构语言学那样只考虑语法的语言作用；它还将句法与诚实活动、证据联系起来。</p><p>The syntactic parts of language obviously serve to link words. They are the grammar of a language. This linguistic work, however, is not all that they do. They also function in intentionality: the syntax of language is related to the way things can present themselves to us, to the way we can intend and articulate them. Syntactic parts of language serve to express the combinatorics of presentation, the way things can be presented to us in various part-whole relationships. Phenomenology does not just consider the linguistic role of grammar, as structural linguistics does; it also relates syntax to the activity of being truthful, to evidencing.</p>

  <p>语言的非句法元素（如“树”和“绿色”等术语）只是简单地命名事物和特征，而句法元素表达事物和特征的显示方式。表达式的句法部分具有客观关联。在“The tree is green”这句话中，“tree”和“green”这两个词显然是指可以赋予感知的事物和特征，但是系词“is”也有客观的指代，因为这个陈述不仅仅呈现树与绿的颜色：表示树是绿的，或树是绿的状态。树的“有特色”对应于系词“是”。系词“是”不只是连接词“树”和“绿”，但也允许树的绿色是我们想要的，即使它不存在。再举个例子，如果我们把两个词连在一起，比如“pepper and salt”，语法助词“and”就对应着两个词的“being together”：这两个词不是单独呈现的，而是presented作为在一起，作为一个整体。</p><p>The nonsyntactic elements of language (terms such as "tree" and "green") simply name things and features, but the syntactic elements express the manner in which the things and features are displayed. The syntactic parts of expressions have objective correlates. In the statement, "The tree is green", the terms "tree" and "green" obviously name things and features that can be given to perception, but the copula "is" also has objective reference, because the statement does not just present the tree and the green color: it presents the tree's being green, or the state of affairs that the tree is green. The "being featured" of the tree corresponds to the copula "is". The copula "is" does not just link the words "tree" and "green", but also allows the tree's being green to be intended by us, even in its absence. To take another example, if we were to conjoin two terms, such as "pepper and salt", the grammatical particle "and" would correspond to the "being together" of the two items: the two are not just individually presented, but presented as being together, as taken as one.</p>

  <p>因此，对于我们来说，事物的表达方式、它们在存在或不存在时的意向方式、它们对我们来说“分崩离析”和“融为一体”的方式，都是通过语言的句法实现的，而每种语言的语法天才都提供了一种该语言独有的表达方式。现象学将句法与呈现模式联系起来。</p><p>Thus, the way things can be articulated for us, the way they can be intended in either presence or absence, the way they "fall apart" and "fall into wholes" for us, is made possible by the syntax of language, and the grammatical genius of each language provides a style of presentation that is distinctive to that language. Phenomenology relates syntax to the modes of presentation.</p>

  <p>当我们记录一个分类对象时，我们从感知的连续性转移到智能对象的更突然、不连续的存在，整体和部分被明确识别。我们呈现更高级别的分类对象，这些对象以离散数据包的形式出现。它们有很多，表达在我们所做的许多声明中，而且它们都是相互关联的。给予智力的对象形成了一个网络。我们在表达每个类别对象时记录它；我们将自己记录在案，我们准确地陈述了这个或那个。我们说一件事，然后说另一件事，然后再说另一件事，但是当我们继续进行其他陈述时，我们之前所做的那些仍然有效，我们随后所说的必须与我们之前所说的一致。所有这些分类对象之间的联系都是合乎逻辑的，而不仅仅是关联的。我们可以问这个范畴对象或意义是否与那个一致；我们可以要求说话者避免矛盾（即避免说出“反对”他之前所说的话）。我们也可以要求发言者解释他所表达的内容，给出理由和澄清。范畴域是原因的空间，现象学探索构成它的错综复杂的意向性。</p><p>When we register a categorial object, we move from the continuity of perception to the more abrupt, discontinuous presence of intellected objects, with wholes and parts being explicitly recognized. We present higher-level, categorial objects, and such objects come in discrete packets. There are many of them, expressed in the many statements we make, and they are all interrelated. The objects given to intellection form a network. We document each categorial object when we express it; we put ourselves on record, we state precisely this or that. We say one thing, then another, then yet another, but as we move on to other statements the ones we made earlier remain in force, and what we say subsequently has to be consistent with what we said before. The connections among all these categorial objects are logical and not just associative. We can ask whether this categorial object or sense is consistent with that one; we can call upon the speaker to avoid contradiction (that is, to avoid saying something "against" what he said before). We can also call upon the speaker to explain what he has articulated, to give reasons and clarifications for it. The categorial domain is the space of reasons, and phenomenology explores the intricate intentionalities that constitute it.</p>

  <p>当我们成功地将我们体验到的对象提升为范畴对象的精确度时，我们不会将它们分割成彼此断开的碎片。相反，我们提供了事物之间更深刻的连续性。我们得到的不是感知流，而是相互关联的事态，以及在它们背后的世界或宇宙的感觉。范畴域带来了一种新的、清晰的整体感；并非只有前范畴才是整体的。思维的精确和清晰不会使事物雾化，但会产生对整个画面的更敏锐的欣赏，使我们能够像理解树木一样理解森林。</p><p>When we succeed in lifting the objects we experience into the precision of categorial objects, we do not fragment them into pieces disconnected from one another. Rather, we make available a more profound continuity among things. Instead of a perceptual flow we are given interrelated states of affairs and, behind them, the sense of a world or a cosmos. The categorial domain brings a new, articulated sense of the whole; it is not the case that only the precategorial is holistic. Precision and distinctness in thinking do not atomize things, but yield a much keener appreciation of the whole picture, allowing us to apprehend the forest precisely because we apprehend trees.</p>

  <p>句法词类表达范畴形式，这样做有助于表达世界呈现给我们的方式，但它们也有另一个功能。它们还用于<em>指示</em>或者表明说话者正在执行构成范畴对象的思维行为。它们表明说话者正在说话并发表意见，而不仅仅是呻吟或打嗝。当我们听某人说话时，我们听到的不仅仅是声音；我们还听到声音的语法顺序。凭借这种编码，我们拥有向我们表达的世界和其中的事物，并且我们还赋予了我们一个说话者的存在，他负责以这种方式表达它们。语言和句法被用来揭示一个世界和其中的事物，但它们也以不同的方式揭示了此刻正在使用该语言和句法的说话者。它们揭示了一种先验的自我，一种负责任的意图和证据代理人。</p><p>Syntactic parts of speech express categorial forms, and in doing so they help express the way the world presents itself to us, but they also serve another function. They also serve to <em>indicate</em> or to signal that the speaker is carrying out the acts of thinking that constitute the categorial objects. They signal that the speaker is speaking and voicing an opinion, and not just groaning or burping. When we listen to someone speak, we hear more than sounds; we also hear the grammatical ordering of sounds. By virtue of this encoding we have the world and the things in it expressed to us, and we also have given to us the presence of a speaker who takes responsibility for their being expressed in this way. Language and syntax are used to reveal a world and the things in it, but they also, in a different way, reveal the speaker who is using the language and syntax at the moment. They reveal a transcendental ego, a responsible agent of intentionality and evidence.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>在本章中，我们考虑了范畴意向性，即伴随更基本的感知形式及其变体而来的意向形式。范畴意图是理性或逻各斯的领域。它建立了范畴对象，即语法遍及的对象，部分和整体都明确注册。范畴对象存在于事物的本体论方面（事态、事物、属性），也存在于无意义的方面（判断、命题、感觉、主语、谓语）。验证在这两个方面之间移动，在本体论和怀疑论之间移动。事态和判断在被证实或否定之前，甚至在它们被理解之前，都必须被区分出来（事实上，区分它们就是理解它们）。</p><p>In this chapter we have considered categorial intentionality, the form of intending that supervenes on the more basic forms of perception and its variants. Categorial intending is the domain of reason or logos. It establishes categorial objects, objects that are pervaded by syntax, with parts and wholes explicitly registered. Categorial objects are found on the ontological side of things (states of affairs, things, attributes) and also on the apophantic side (judgments, propositions, senses, subjects, predicates). Verification moves between these two sides, between the ontological and the apophantic. States of affairs and judgments have to be brought to distinctness before they can be confirmed or disconfirmed, and even before they can be understood (indeed, to bring them to distinctness is precisely to understand them). They are brought to distinctness out of the matrix of vagueness, which is a sort of basement and source for categoriality.</p>

  <p>我们的注意力一直集中在范畴对象上，但是，正如我们已经注意到的，范畴的领域还涉及负责任的说话者的出现。它需要一个超越由感知、记忆和想象构成的自我的自我。范畴对象涉及范畴活动，而范畴活动又需要执行它的真理代理人。我们现在转向这个自我，先验自我。</p><p>Our attention has been directed to categorial objects, but, as we have noted, the domain of the categorial also involves the emergence of a responsible speaker. It requires a self elevated beyond the self constituted in perception, memory, and imagination. Categorial objects involve categorial activity, which requires in turn an agent of truth who carries it out. It is to this self, the transcendental ego, that we now turn.</p>

  <p>我们所经历的事物在表象的多样性中呈现为身份。我们自己的自我，我们的“自我”，也在多种多样的表象中建立并呈现给我们自己作为一个身份，但我们呈现给自己的多样性与事物呈现的多样性不同。我们从不在世界上仅作为一件事出现；我们每个人都脱颖而出，作为我们有意生活的中心，作为我们有意生活的代理人，作为拥有世界和其中事物的人。我们揭示的力量，我们的存在是事物显现的与格，将我们引入理性的生活和人类的存在方式。</p><p>The things we experience present themselves as identities within manifolds of appearance. Our own self, our "ego", also establishes and presents itself to us as an identity in a manifold of appearances, but the manifold in which we are presented to ourselves is different from those in which things are presented. We never show up to ourselves in the world as just one more thing; we stand out, each of us, as central, as the agents of our intentional life, as the one who has the world and the things in it given to him. Our power of disclosure, our being the dative of manifestation for things that appear, introduces us into the life of reason and the human way of being.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_8.xhtml.heading_id_3"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_8.xhtml.ch8_ete"></a>经验的和先验的自我</h2><h2><a></a>THE EMPIRICAL AND THE TRANSCENDENTAL EGO</h2>

  <p>自我有一种奇妙的模糊性：一方面，它是世界的一个普通部分，是其中的许多事物之一。它占据空间，经久不衰，具有生理和心理特征，并与世界上的其他事物发生因果关系：如果它倒下，它会像其他任何物体一样倒下；如果它被推，它就会像其他任何东西一样倒下；如果用化学品处理，它会像任何生物体一样反应；如果光线照射到它的视觉器官，它就会产生电子、化学和心理反应。“我”是物质的、有机的、心理的东西。如果我们将自我简单地视为世界上的事物之一，我们就会将其视为可以称为<em>经验自我的</em>东西。</p><p>There is a marvelous ambiguity to the ego: on the one hand, it is an ordinary part of the world, one of the many things that inhabit it. It occupies space, endures through time, has physical and psychic features, and interacts causally with other things in the world: if it falls, it falls like any other body; if it is pushed, it topples over like any other thing; if it is treated with chemicals, it reacts like any living organism; if light rays hit its visual organs, it reacts electronically, chemically, and psychologically. "I" am a material, organic, and psychological thing. If we were to take the self simply as one of the things in the world, we would be treating it as what can be called the <em>empirical ego</em>.</p>

  <p>另一方面，同样的自我也可以与世界对抗：它是世界和其中的一切向其显现的揭示中心。它是真理的代理人，负责判断和验证的人，是世界感性和认知的“主人”。以这种方式考虑时，它不再仅仅是世界的一部分；这就是所谓的<em>先验自我</em>。</p><p>On the other hand, this very same self can also be played off against the world: it is the center of disclosure to whom the world and everything in it manifest themselves. It is the agent of truth, the one responsible for judgments and verifications, the perceptual and cognitive "owner" of the world. When considered in this manner, it is no longer simply a part of the world; it is what is called the <em>transcendental ego</em>.</p>

  <p>经验自我和先验自我不是两个实体。它们是同一个存在，但以两种方式考虑。此外，引入经验和先验之间区别的不仅仅是我们考虑自我的方式；在自我中建立二元性的不仅仅是我们采用经验的或先验的立场。相反，自我以这种双重方式存在。我们可以用这种双重方式来考虑它，只是因为它享有允许它被如此考虑的那种存在。我们不能将先验自我归因于一棵树或一只猫。</p><p>The empirical and the transcendental egos are not two entities; they are one and the same being, but considered in two ways. Moreover, it is not just our manner of considering the ego that introduces the distinction between the empirical and the transcendental; it is not just our adoption of an empirical or a transcendental stance that establishes the duality in the self. Rather, the ego exists in this double manner. We can consider it in this dual way only because it enjoys the kind of being that allows it to be so considered. We could not attribute a transcendental ego to a tree or a cat.</p>

  <p>自我的模糊性在于，作为世界一部分的某物可以站在世界的对立面，甚至“拥有”世界或与世界相关联。自我似乎既是世界的一部分又不是世界的一部分。这并不是说自我可以从世界中分离出来，也不是说可以在没有世界的情况下发现或什至想象它存在。即使是先验的，自我的意向性特征也要求它拥有与自身相关的事物和世界。自我和世界是彼此的瞬间。然而，当自我被认为拥有一个世界时，它就不再只是世界的一部分了。它与世界相关，作为世界被“给予”的与格。</p><p>The ambiguity of the ego consists in the fact that something that is a part of the world can stand over against the world, and even "possess" or be correlated with the world. The ego seems to be both a part and yet not a part of the world. This is not to say that the ego could be detached from the world, that it could be found or even imagined to exist without a world. Even as transcendental, the ego's intentional character requires that it have things and a world correlated with itself. The ego and the world are moments to one another. However, when the ego is considered as having a world, it is no longer just a part of it. It is correlated with the world as the dative to whom the world is "given".</p>

  <p>有一种强烈的趋势是将先验自我还原为经验自我。当我们处理人类认知时，我们倾向于将其仅视为世界上正在进行的因果交换中的一个项目，与仅从事机械、化学和生物因果关系的事物同等。因此，头脑中知识的产生通常被认为就像身体中化学变化的产生一样。我们认为我们可以通过描述当我们开始了解事物时大脑和神经系统中发生的事情来详尽地解释什么是知识。例如，认知科学领域的许多作家都试图将知识和其他理性成就简化为仅仅是身体的大脑状态。试图以这种方式处理知识可以称为生物学或生物还原论。</p><p>There is a strong tendency to reduce the transcendental ego to the empirical. When we deal with human cognition, we tend to want to treat it as merely one more item in the causal exchanges that go on in the world, on a par with things simply engaged in mechanical, chemical, and biological causation. Thus, the generation of knowledge in the mind is often taken to be just like the generation of chemical changes in the body. We think we can give an exhaustive explanation of what knowledge is by giving an account of what happens, say, in the brain and nervous system when we come to know things. Many writers in cognitive science, for example, try to reduce knowledge and other rational achievements to merely physical brain states. To try to handle knowledge in this way could be called biologism or biological reductionism.</p>

  <p>另一种还原论，一种更复杂的还原论，是心理上的；它被称为<em>心理主义</em>。从二十世纪初开始，现象学就开始攻击心理学对真理、理性和自我的解释；心理主义是现象学最初定义自己的陪衬。然而，自相矛盾的是，许多人错误地将现象学本身视为一种心理主义。</p><p>Another kind of reductionism, a more sophisticated kind, is the psychological; it is called <em>psychologism</em>. From its beginning in the early twentieth century, phenomenology attacked the psychologistic interpretation of truth, reason, and the ego; psychologism was the foil against which phenomenology originally defined itself. Nevertheless, paradoxically enough, many people mistakenly regard phenomenology itself as a form of psychologism.</p>

  <p>“心理主义”是什么意思？心理学主义声称诸如逻辑、真理、验证、证据和推理之类的东西只是我们心灵的经验活动。在心理主义中，理性和真理被自然化了。真理和逻辑法则被视为描述我们的思想如何运作的高级经验法则；它们不被视为构成真理和理性意义的组成部分。例如，在心理主义中，不矛盾原则将被简单地视为对我们的思想如何运作的陈述；它会说明我们是如何碰巧安排我们的想法的；它不会被视为支配事物如何展现自己。它会告诉我们我们思想的习惯，无论是天生的还是后天习得的，而不是关于事物必须如何以及它们必须如何揭示自己。还，人类语言需要语法这一事实将被简单地描述为关于人类及其心理发展的历史事实。心理学与生物学一样，将意义和真理视为经验事实的问题，而不是作为经验的基础并因此超越经验的维度，而不是属于事物存在的维度。</p><p>What is meant by "psychologism"? Psychologism is the claim that things like logic, truth, verification, evidence, and reasoning are simply empirical activities of our psyche. In psychologism, reason and truth are naturalized. Laws of truth and logic are taken to be high-level empirical laws that describe how our minds function; they are not seen as constituents of the very meaning of truth and reason. For example, in psychologism, the principle of noncontradiction would be taken simply as a statement of how our minds work; it would state how we happen to arrange our ideas; it would not be seen as governing how things have to reveal themselves. It would tell us about the habits, whether innate or acquired, of our mind, not about how things have to be and how they have to disclose themselves. Also, the fact that human languages require syntax would be presented as simply a historical fact about human beings and their psychological development. Psychologism, along with biologism, treats meaning and truth as a matter of empirical fact, not as a dimension that underlies and hence transcends the empirical, not as a dimension that belongs to the being of things.</p>

  <p>心理主义是最常见也是最阴险的还原论形式。生物学紧随其后。一旦我们将意义、真理和逻辑的规律还原为心理规律，我们将倾向于将它们进一步还原为构成我们心理基础的生物结构。因此，在生物学中，人类语言本质上涉及句法这一事实将被视为仅仅是由大脑的连接方式和进化方式引起的。它不会基于这样一个事实，即当事情被披露时必须清楚地表达出来。对句法的整个解释将基于大脑，而不考虑事物存在和呈现自身的方式。</p><p>Psychologism is the most common and the most insidious form of reductionism. Biologism follows closely behind it. Once we reduce laws of meaning, truth, and logic to psychological laws, we will be inclined to reduce them one step farther to the biological structures that underlie our psychology. Thus, in biologism the fact that human language essentially involves syntax would be taken as caused simply by the way the brain is wired and the way it has evolved. It would not be based on the fact that things must be articulated when they are disclosed. The entire explanation for syntax would be brain based, with no regard paid to the way things exist and present themselves.</p>

  <p>另一方面，现象学方法显然会同意大脑的线路是语言句法以及感知、范畴意图、知识和科学的原因之一，但它会声称人们必须还根据出现的事物提供另一种解释。除了关注大脑中的线路之外，我们还必须关注这样一个事实，即事物可以区分为整体和部分，它们可以被感知和描绘，当它们呈现给我们时可以区分它们的本质和偶然。显然，第二种解释不同于研究大脑线路和我们的心理倾向的那种解释；可能很难弄清楚第二种解释是什么，</p><p>A phenomenological approach, on the other hand, would obviously agree that the wiring of the brain is one of the causes for syntax in language, as well as for perception, categorial intentions, and knowledge and science, but it would then claim that one must also provide an explanation of another kind based on the things that appear. Besides looking to the wiring in the brain, we must also look to the fact that things can be distinguished into wholes and parts, that they can be perceived and pictured, that essentials and accidentals can be distinguished in them when they present themselves to us. This second kind of explanation is different, obviously, from the kind of explanation that studies the wiring in the brain and our psychic dispositions; it may be hard to get clear on what kind of explanation this second kind is, but it cannot be dispensed with.</p>

  <p>现象学从一开始就与心理主义进行了英勇的斗争。它试图表明，获得意义、真理和逻辑推理的活动不仅是我们心理或生物构造的一个特征，而且它进入了一个新的领域，一个理性的领域，一个超越心理的领域。做出这种区分并不容易。自我确实既是经验的又是先验的，一个人可以将一个人的考虑限制在事物的经验方面。意义和真理也有它们的经验维度，但它们不仅仅是经验的东西。将它们仅仅视为心理上的是遗漏了一些重要的东西。然而，要显示额外的东西是什么并不容易。</p><p>Phenomenology has waged a heroic struggle against psychologism from the beginning. It tries to show that the activity of achieving meaning, truth, and logical reasoning is not just a feature of our psychological or biological makeup, but that it enters into a new domain, a domain of rationality, a domain that goes beyond the psychological. It is not easy to make this distinction. The ego is indeed both empirical and transcendental, and one can limit one's consideration to the empirical side of things. Meaning and truth also have their empirical dimensions, but they are more than just empirical things. To treat them as simply psychological is to leave out something important. However, it is not easy to show what that extra something is.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_8.xhtml.heading_id_4"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_8.xhtml.ch8_te"></a>什么是先验自我？</h2><h2><a></a>WHAT IS THE TRANSCENDENTAL EGO?</h2>

  <p>我们现在需要考虑理性领域的性质，以及它与生物学和心理领域的区别，先验领域与经验领域的区别。我们可以通过检查人类知识和人类美德来做到这一点，这两者都发生在先验领域。要指出的要点是，当我们运用我们的理性时，当我们作为真理和意义的代理人行事时，我们就会卷入一些仅从经验的角度无法充分处理的活动。</p><p>We need now to consider the nature of the rational domain and how it differs from the biological and the psychological, how the transcendental domain differs from the empirical. We can do so by examining human knowledge and human virtue, both of which occur in the transcendental domain. The essential point to be made is that when we exercise our rationality, when we act as agents of truth and meaning, we become involved in activities that cannot be adequately treated from a merely empirical point of view.</p>

  <p>考虑自然科学。心理学会声称推理、论证、知识和科学仅仅是我们心理构成的问题。例如，物理学、生物学和数学科学被认为是我们的有机体适应环境的方式；他们没有被视为告诉我们任何事情的真相。在心理主义中，真理的观念本身就成了问题；我们做出的判断或提议最终只是有机或心理反应，与心脏跳动、胃部消化、情绪高涨或沮丧并无太大区别。即使在科学中，根据心理学，我们也不会透露实情；我们只是做出反应。</p><p>Consider the natural sciences. Psychologism would claim that reasoning, argument, knowledge, and science are merely a matter of our psychological makeup. The sciences of physics, biology, and mathematics, for example, are said to be ways in which our organism adapts to its environment; they are not seen as telling us the truth about anything. The very idea of truth becomes problematic in psychologism; the judgments or propositions we make are ultimately just organic or psychic responses, not really all that different from the beating of the heart, the digestion in the stomach, or a mood of elation or depression. Even in the sciences, according to psychologism, we do not disclose what is; we just react.</p>

  <p>相比之下，现象学会坚持认为，即使我们是生物和心理生物，即使我们的感知和判断需要大脑和神经系统以及主观反应，但当我们进行判断、验证和推理活动时，我们会形成意义和实现可以与我们的生物和心理存在方式区分开来的演示文稿。它们可以传达给其他人，他们的主观感受可能与我们的非常不同；它们可以被记录下来，可以作为论证的前提，可以被证实或被否定。他们有一种生存。与我们的主观性完全不同，它们本身可以被证明是对还是错。是意义本身是一致的还是矛盾的；真正或错误的是判断本身。意义和判断属于所谓的理由的“空间”，当我们进行范畴活动时，我们就进入了那个空间。因此，除了作为生物的、心理的和主观的存在之外，我们还作为主体进入理性的空间，我们进入理性的领域，当我们这样做时，我们“超越”，我们超越了我们的主观性；我们充当先验的自我。</p><p>In contrast, phenomenology would insist that even though we are biological and psychological creatures, even though our perceptions and judgments require a brain and nervous system and subjective reactions, when we get into the activity of judging, veritying, and reasoning, we formulate meanings and achieve presentations that can be distinguished from our biological and psychological way of being. They can be communicated to others, who may have subjective feelings that are very different from ours; they can be recorded, they can be used as premises in arguments, and they can be confirmed or disconfirmed. They have a kind of subsistence. They can be shown to be true or false in themselves, quite apart from our subjectivity. It is the meanings themselves that are consistent or contradictory; it is the judgments themselves that are true or false. Meanings and judgments belong to what can be called the "space" of reasons, and we enter into that space when we carry out categorial activities. Thus, besides being biological, psychological, and subjective beings, we also enter as agents into the space of reasons, we enter into the domain of the rational, and when we do so we "go beyond", we transcend our subjectivity; we act as transcendental egos.</p>

  <p>还要考虑正义的美德。当一个孩子成长为一个成熟的人时，他就成为一个理性的人。他达到了可以理解论点并根据其结论采取行动的阶段。他可以用想法工作，而不仅仅是用倾向和感觉。在生命的早期阶段，孩子在很大程度上是一堆倾向和冲动，只有不成熟的理性。随着时间的推移，孩子开始意识到他必须将自己视为众多人中的一员，他不能一直只喜欢自己的满足。他必须看到其他人在那里，并且他必须给予他们应得的。这样，孩子的正义感就产生了。这种感觉的早期阶段甚至在小孩子中也存在，他们很快就会判断这种或那种行为“不公平”。</p><p>Consider also the virtue of justice. As a child develops into a mature person, he becomes a rational being. He reaches a stage in which he can understand an argument and act according to its conclusions. He can work with ideas and not just with inclinations and feelings. In the early stages of life, the child is largely a bundle of tendencies and impulses, with only an inchoate rationality. As time goes by, the child begins to appreciate that he has to see himself as only one among many, that he cannot simply prefer his own satisfactions all the time. He has to see that others are there, and that he has to give them their due. In this way, a sense of justice arises in the child. Early stages of this sense are present even among small children, who are quick to judge that this or that action "is not fair".</p>

  <p>正义美德的发展需要两件事。这个人必须通过指导和反复的活动，成为道德上有德行的人，但除此之外，作为更深层次的可能性条件，这个人也必须成为一个理性的行动者。他一定是进入了理性空间，能够进行范畴活动。正义感的出现需要年轻人有理性。正是通过理性的力量，我们才能客观地看待一种情况，并判断真正应该归因于参与其中的每个人，包括我们自己。正义的美德是在实际事务中运用卓越的理性。其他美德也涉及理性的发展，但正义在更大程度上涉及，因为它需要确定平等的能力，</p><p>Two things are needed for the development of the virtue of justice. The person in question must, through guidance and repeated activity, become morally virtuous, but in addition, and as a deeper condition of possibility, the person must also have become a rational agent. He must have entered the space of reasons and become able to exercise categorial activities. The emergence of a sense of justice requires the presence of reason in the young person. It is through the power of reason that we can take an objective view of a situation and judge what is truly due to each person involved in it, ourselves included. The virtue of justice is the exercise of reason par excellence in practical matters. Other virtues also involve the development of reason, but justice does so to a greater degree, because it requires the ability to determine equalities, to say what is appropriately "the same" for myself and others.</p>

  <p>我们作为人类的整个道德和情感生活都是由于我们运用理性这一事实而成为可能的。一个成熟的人是一个能够倾听关于实际事物的争论，评估它们并据此采取行动的人。有些人无法做到这一点。他们融入情感或冲动；不能与他们争论。当这种情况发生时，无论是永久性的还是间歇性的状态，这些人的先验自我都会被模糊性冲淡。应该进入他们行为的绝对思维无法占上风。</p><p>Our entire moral and emotional life as human beings is made possible by the fact that we exercise rationality. A mature person is one who can listen to arguments about practical things, evaluate them, and act accordingly. Some people cannot do this. They dissolve into emotion or impulse; one cannot argue with them. When this occurs, whether it be a permanent or an intermittent state, the transcendental egos of such persons are diluted by vagueness. The categorial thinking that should enter into their conduct cannot prevail.</p>

  <p>因此，在理论和实践两方面，我们的先验自我是我们中理性和真理的代理人。先验自我是我们每个人都被视为真理的代理人，是一个可以负责任地宣布事实真相的人。除了是生物和心理有机体之外，我们还是属于康德所说的“目的王国”的理性存在；当我们如此认识自己时，我们就将自己视为先验的自我。现象学试图描述什么样的结构形式会成为先验自我。现象学是对所有意向形式的先验自我的探索，以及被发现作为这些意向性目标的意向相关物。既然我们的理性使我们成为人，那么现象学就是在我们的人性中探索我们自己。</p><p>In both theoretical and practical matters, therefore, our transcendental ego is that part of us that is the agent of reason and truth. The transcendental ego is each of us taken as an agent of truth, as one who can responsibly declare what is the case. Besides being biological and psychological organisms, we are rational beings who belong to what Kant called the "kingdom of ends"; when we recognize ourselves as such, we treat ourselves as transcendental egos. Phenomenology attempts to describe what structural forms go into being a transcendental ego. Phenomenology is the exploration of the transcendental ego in all its intentional forms, along with the noematic correlates that are found as the targets of these intentionalities. Since our rationality is what makes us human, phenomenology is the exploration of ourselves in our humanity.</p>

  <p>哲学家们对什么使我们理性的理解往往过于有限。他们认为我们的理性主要是从特定经验中抽象出普遍概念的能力，进行三段论推理的能力，以及洞察不言而喻的真理的能力。然而，我们的理性远不止于这些能力；它还涉及我们在存在和不存在时识别事物的意向性，我们在我们所经历的事物中引入句法和部分-整体组合的意向性，记忆、想象和预期的特定人类方式，以及形式我们可以进行的证据和验证。它还涉及我们被确立为负责任的道德主体的意图。所有这些以及更多形式的意向性对我们作为理性主体来说都是必不可少的，就像抽象共相的能力和三段论推理的能力一样重要。本书中描述的所有结构都是超验自我、真理和验证的负责任代理人的组成部分。现象学对我们作为表现形式的与格提供了更丰富的描述。</p><p>Philosophers have often had a too limited understanding of what makes us rational. They have taken our rationality as primarily the power to abstract universal concepts from particular experiences, the power to carry on syllogistic reasoning, and the power to have insight into self-evident truths. However, our rationality consists in far more than these abilities; it involves also the intentionalities by which we identity things in both their presence and their absence, the intentionalities by which we introduce syntax and part-whole compositions in what we experience, the specifically human ways of remembering, imagining, and anticipating, and the forms of evidence and verification that we can carry out. It also involves the intentionalities by which we are established as responsible moral agents. All these and many more forms of intentionality are as essential to us as rational agents as are the power to abstract universals and the power to reason syllogistically. All the structures described in this book are constituents of what it means to be a transcendental ego, a responsible agent of truth and verification. Phenomenology provides a much more ample description of what we are as datives of manifestation.</p>

  <p>事实上，理性的组成部分之一是说“我”的能力，即使用特定语言中的某种符号设计的能力，以明确地指代我们自己使用该语言并在我们使用该词时提出真理主张. 如果我说“我相信门是开着的”之类的话，我对“我”这个词的使用做了三件事：首先，它只是指我，它把我选为正在谈论的那个人；第二，它表示我是说英语句子的人；但第三，它表明我是以下特定声明的真实代理人。我表示自己是负责绝对表述的人，以及其中的真理主张，由句子表达。只有超然的自我才能这样说“我”。</p><p>Indeed, one of the constituents of rationality is the ability to say "I", the power to use a certain sign design in a particular language to refer to ourselves specifically as using the language and making a truth claim at the moment we use the word. If I say something like, "I believe that the door is open", my use of the term "I" does three things: first, it simply refers to me, it picks me out as the one being spoken about; second, it signifies me as the one speaking the English sentence; but third, it signifies me as the agent of truth for the particular declaration that follows. I signal myself as the one responsible for the categorial articulation, and the truth claim in it, expressed by the sentence. Only a transcendental ego can say "I" in this way. It can use a language to say that it is asserting something in that language.</p>

  <p>为了帮助我们理解经验自我和先验自我之间的区别，让我们在自我和国际象棋棋子之间进行类比。让我们考虑国际象棋游戏内外的棋手。从某种意义上说，棋子只是一种经验性的东西。如果我要把车扔到桌子上，我会把它当作世界上一件简单的事情，一个“经验车”。即使我将它从棋盘上的一个方格移到另一个方格，我可能仍将它视为一个普通物体：我可能将它视为一块有颜色的木头，它被移到离我十英寸远的地方。但是，如果我将棋子视为国际象棋游戏中的棋子，例如设置将死，我会将其视为“先验车”，而不仅仅是经验车。我会治疗它，这将是表演，作为国际象棋游戏中的玩家。类似地，当我的身体机体按照理性规则进行游戏并参与真理游戏时，它作为先验自我而活跃。当然，如果车在国际象棋游戏中以某种方式移动了自己（而不是被我移动），并且它可以宣称自己在移动，那么这个类比会更合适。先验自我可以做所有这些事情：它不仅在真理的游戏（这是生命的游戏）中主动行动，而且还表达自己这样做。如果车在国际象棋游戏中以某种方式移动了自己（而不是被我移动），并且它是否可以声明自己正在移动。先验自我可以做所有这些事情：它不仅在真理的游戏（这是生命的游戏）中主动行动，而且还表达自己这样做。如果车在国际象棋游戏中以某种方式移动了自己（而不是被我移动），并且它是否可以声明自己正在移动。先验自我可以做所有这些事情：它不仅在真理的游戏（这是生命的游戏）中主动行动，而且还表达自己这样做。</p><p>To help us understand the distinction between the empirical and the transcendental ego, let us develop an analogy between the ego and a chessman. Let us consider a chessman both outside and inside the game of chess. In one sense, a chess piece is a merely empirical thing. If I were to throw a rook on the table, I would be treating it as a simple thing in the world, an "empirical rook". Even if I were to move it from one square on the chessboard to another, I might still be treating it as an ordinary object: I might be taking it just as a colored piece of wood that is being moved ten inches away from me. However, if I were to take the piece as involved in the game of chess, as, say, setting up a checkmate, I would be treating it as a "transcendental rook", not merely as an empirical one. I would be treating it, and it would be acting, as a player in the game of chess. Analogously, my bodily organism is active as a transcendental ego when it plays according to the rules of reason and is engaged in the game of truth. The analogy would fit better, of course, if the rook somehow moved itself in the game of chess (instead of being moved by me), and if it could declare itself as moving. The transcendental ego can do all these things: it not only acts on its own initiative in the game of truth (which is the game of life), but also expresses itself as doing so.</p>

  <p>动物有意识，但它们没有先验的自我。他们可能接近语言和真理之类的东西，但他们没有完全进入理性的空间。如果我的狗做了一些“错误”的事情（他对我猛咬或弄脏了地毯），我可能会当场对他做些什么，但是一个月后去找他并试图提及那个“行为”是没有意义的”或他先前表达的“意见”。但是你抱怨我去年说的话或者我上个月做的事是有道理的，因为我的言行都是在理智范围内的；我在真理游戏中迈出了一步，我所说或所做的一切都被记录下来，并作为这样的一步继续存在，甚至超越了它发生的情况。我可以充当超然自我，但非人类动物不能。</p><p>Animals have consciousness, but they do not have transcendental egos. They may approach something like language and truth, but they do not enter fully into the space of reasons. If my dog does something "wrong" (he snaps at me or soils the carpet), I might do something to him there and then, but it would make no sense to come to him a month later and try to refer to that "action" or to an "opinion" he voiced earlier. But it does make sense for you to complain about what I said last year or what I did last month, because I spoke and acted within the space of reasons; I made a move in the game of truth, and what I said or did is documented and subsists as such a move even beyond the situation in which it occurred. I can act as a transcendental ego, but a nonhuman animal cannot.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_8.xhtml.heading_id_5"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_8.xhtml.ch8_pte"></a>先验自我的公开性</h2><h2><a></a>PUBLICNESS OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL EGO</h2>

  <p>理性的生活是公共的事情。它没有封闭在“意识领域”的孤独或隐私中。它表现在明显的行为和成就中，表现在人类四处走动、互相交谈、检查科学仪器、将激光束聚焦在目标上、在考古遗址挖沟、给朋友写信、尝试说服某人投票支持某项提案。它存在于文字、图片和旗帜中。理性的生活就像足球比赛中的射门得分或拳击比赛中的技术击倒一样公开。如果不涉及“工具”、“词语”、“陈述”、“原因”和“真相”等术语，就无法解释考古挖掘或政治争论，这些术语指的是公共行为，而不是私人的、内部的事件。进入理性生活的是理性动物，而不是孤独的意识，也不是广阔而空洞的意识领域。</p><p>The life of reason is a public thing. It is not enclosed in the solitude or privacy of a "sphere of consciousness". It is expressed in manifest conduct and achievements, in human beings who are walking around, talking to one another, examining scientific instruments, focusing a laser beam on a target, digging a trench at an archaeological site, writing a letter to a friend, trying to persuade someone to vote for a certain proposal. It is present in words, pictures, and flags. The life of reason is as public as a field goal in a football game or a technical knockout in a boxing match. An archaeological dig or a political argument cannot be explained without involving terms like "tools", "words", "statements", "reasons", and "truth", and such terms refer to public behavior and not to private, internal episodes. It is the rational animal, not the solitary awareness, not the large, hollow sphere of consciousness, that enters into rational life.</p>

  <p>理性的公共生活由先验自我所过，它也是一个公共实体。当我们谈论超然自我时，我们可能会忍不住想把它想象成寄居在我们体内的一缕缕东西，一个位于大脑皮层中央某处的斑点，过着秘密的生活。这样的解释是不正确的，为了反驳它，我想提供一个关于什么是先验自我的更具体的图画。</p><p>The public life of reason is lived by the transcendental ego, who is also a public entity. When we talk about the transcendental ego, we may be tempted to imagine it as a wispy sort of thing lodged within us, a speck located somewhere in the middle of our cortex, living a secret life. Such an interpretation would be incorrect, and to counter it I would like to provide a more concrete picture of what the transcendental ego is.</p>

  <p>当我写下这几页时，正是 11 月，人们正在回忆第一次世界大战的停战，它发生在 1918 年 11 月 11 日的 11 点钟。关于战争正在电视上播出。其中一张照片展示了三名参加战争但没有回来的年轻英国男子的照片。考虑其中一张照片，一张 21 岁男子的照片。他曾经活着，他被拍到穿着军装，他在战争中阵亡。一种悲伤的感觉围绕着这幅画，我们投射到那些我们知道死于战斗、在那场战争或其他战争中的人的图像上的那种感觉；图片中的眼睛似乎已经准备好闭上了。</p><p>As I write these pages, it is the month of November, and people are recalling the armistice, the end of the First World War, which occurred on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month of the year 1918. Stories about the war are being presented on television. In one of them, photographs were shown of three young British men who went to the war and did not return. Consider one of these pictures, an image of a twenty-one-year-old man. He was once alive, he was photographed in uniform, and he was killed in the war. A sense of sadness surrounds the picture, the kind we project onto images of those we know have died in combat, during that war or others; the eyes in the picture seem ready to be closed.</p>

  <p>那个年轻人死后失去了什么？不仅是生物生活，而且如果他填写了他的三分和十，就会在他和他的周围发生的理性生活。这种理性的生活不仅是他那些年可能做出的真假言论，而且是他可能进行的深思熟虑、选择和人际交往。作为一个负责任的真理代理人，他本来会做的事情随着他有机生命的灭绝而消失了。在那些眼睛和耳朵看来，世界似乎从未发生过。他的死不仅仅是化学元素的重新组合，或者是生物体的终结，而是人类生命的终结，在这种生命中，理性照亮了周围的事物，并允许道德干预。在照片中的面孔后面确定自己的自我，那个聚集了记忆和预期并在其中体验自己的自我，不再是事物在我们称之为世界的整体中出现的方式的与格。爱他的人所爱的，不只是一个愉快的伙伴，不只是复杂版的动物，而是一个可以进入动物无法进入的生活的人：一个对他所说的真实负责的人并且做到了，一个可以回报爱的人，因为他可以欣赏另一个值得被爱的人。</p><p>What was lost when that young man died? Not just a biological life, but the life of reason that would have taken place in him and in his surroundings had he filled out his three-score-and-ten. This life of reason would have been not only the true and false utterances he might have made during those years, but also the deliberations, choices, and human exchanges that he would have carried out. What he would have done as a responsible agent of truth vanished with the extinction of his organic life. The way the world would have seemed to those eyes and ears never came to pass. His death was not just the reshuffling of chemical elements, or the termination of a living organism, but the conclusion of a human life, a life in which reason illuminates the things around it and permits moral interventions. The self that identified itself behind the face in the picture, the one that had assembled memories and anticipations and experienced itself in them, ceased to be a dative for the way things appear in the whole we call the world. What was loved by those who loved him was not just a pleasant companion, not just a complicated version of an animal, but someone who could enter into a kind of life that a mere animal could not: someone responsible for the truth of what he said and did, someone who could love in return because he could appreciate another as worthy of being loved.</p>

  <p>那个年轻人的自我，他的先验自我，并不是一个与他截然不同的实体；正是这个人作为真理游戏的参与者，一个可以宣称和确认、引用和推断、欺骗和揭露、深思熟虑和决定的人。自我不是一个独立的东西，而是能够过一种理性生活的人。它是可以说“我”并为所说的话负责的实体。此外，先验自我不仅仅是科学的代理人；做出推论和构建假设的不仅仅是“智力”；它不仅仅是一个计算引擎。除了作为科学的代理人之外，先验自我也是人类行为中真理的代理人，在人类行为中，行动是自由和负责任的，因为它们是智能评估的结果。可以说的“我”，“</p><p>The ego in that young man, his transcendental ego, was not an entity distinct from him; it was that man as a player in the game of truth, one who could claim and confirm, quote and infer, deceive and unmask, deliberate and decide. The ego is not a separate thing, but the man as capable of living a rational kind of life. It is the entity that can say ''I'' and take responsibility for what is said. Furthermore, the transcendental ego is not just the agent of science; it is not just "intellect" making inferences and constructing hypotheses; it is not merely a calculating engine. Besides being the agent of science, the transcendental ego is also the agent of truth in human conduct, where actions are free and responsible because they are the outcome of intelligent assessments. The "I" that can say, "I think this or that", is the same one that can say, "I intend to do this or that", and the same one that others can call on for an explanation for what "you" did. The ability to say "I" and to intervene in the world through a responsible act depends on the organic life that underlies thinking, the organic life in which the life of thinking is embodied, but it is not just that organic life: it enters into the space of reasons and the kingdom of ends.</p>

  <p>如果一个人在他生前就死去的照片，由于没有未来，可以给我们一个印象，什么是负责的自我，一个尚未出生的人的照片，一个几乎都是未来的人，甚至有一个名字还在后面，可能起到同样的作用。我们看到过生命早期的照片，在胎儿发育期间，眼睛看起来像斑点，嘴巴无法说话，浸在羊水中。那个时候无声地开合的嘴巴和以后说“我”的嘴巴是一样的，在触觉、听觉和身体运动的联觉中正在建立的早期自我意识是一样的在婴儿出生后的几年里会有记忆和项目行动。先验的自我，显化的与格，已经存在，为其未来的分类活动和道德干预奠定基础。早期的自己已经是真理游戏的参与者了。</p><p>And if the picture of someone who died before his time may, by the very absence of a future, give us an impression of what the responsible ego is, the picture of someone not yet born, someone who is almost all future, with even a name still to come, may serve the same purpose. We have seen pictures of the early stages of life, during fetal development, when the eyes look like spots and the mouth is speechless and immersed in amniotic fluid. The mouth that opens and closes silently at that time is the same one that will be used to say "I" later on, and the early sense of self that is being established in the synesthesia of touch and hearing and bodily motion is the same that will have memories and project actions in the years after the baby is born. The transcendental ego, the dative of manifestation, is already there, establishing the basis for its future categorial activity and moral interventions. The early self is already something of a player in the game of truth.</p>

  <p>因此，思想和先验自我都是公开的，他们所过的生活也是公开的。真理代理人的行为，例如判决，原则上是公共行为。它可以比作敬礼，只能发生在两个或更多人之间。判断是真理游戏中的一步，原则上它涉及代理人、接受者和旁观者。它不仅仅发生在我们体内。甚至一个知觉也更像是一个敬礼，而不是胃痛；这也是真理游戏的第一步，促使我们提出主张，诋毁别人所说的话，或者在人类对话中采取其他步骤。先验自我的行为与参与这些行为的身体一样公开。它们是实际或潜在的干预措施，而不仅仅是私人想法。</p><p>Thus, both the mind and the transcendental ego are public, and the life they live is public. An act of the agent of truth, such as a judgment, is in principle a public act. It can be compared to a salute, which can only occur between two or more people. A judgment is a move in the game of truth, and it involves, in principle, an agent, receivers, and onlookers. It does not occur merely inside us. Even a perception is more like a salute than like a stomach ache; it too is an initial move in the game of truth, disposing us to make a claim, to discredit what someone else has said, or to take some other step in the human conversation. The acts of the transcendental ego are as public as the body that is involved in making them. They are actual or potential interventions, not just private thoughts.</p>

  <p>要带出超然自我的公开性，记住还有一个“超然的你”是有帮助的。也就是说，先验自我不仅可以被自己认识，也可以被他人认识，当他被这样认识时，他就被称为“你”。<em>但是，出于某种原因，与ego</em>对应的拉丁语<em>tu</em>在这里听起来并不合适。<em></em></p><p>To bring out the publicness of the transcendental ego, it is helpful to remember that there is also a "transcendental you". That is, the transcendental ego can be recognized not only by himself but also by others, and when he is so recognized he is called a "you". However, for some reason, the Latin <em>tu</em>, as a counterpart to <em>ego</em>, does not sound appropriate here.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_8.xhtml.heading_id_6"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_8.xhtml.ch8_epa"></a>现象学态度中的自我</h2><h2><a></a>THE EGO IN THE PHENOMENOLOGICAL ATTITUDE</h2>

  <p>我们注意到，我们一直在考虑的超然自我的所有活动都是在自然态度中完成的。它们是实现真理的练习，是负责任的理性运作。作为所有这些活动的代理人的自我是拥有世界并继续维持其潜在世界信念的自我。当我们进入现象学态度时，我们就脱离了自然态度，沉思和描述先验自我及其所有成就、所有意向性，我们还沉思构成先验自我的特殊流形。我们描述了自我如何作为表现的代理人建立和呈现自己，对自己和他人。</p><p>We note that all the activities of the transcendental ego we have been considering are done in the natural attitude. They are exercises in the achievement of truth, responsible operations of reason. The ego that is the agent for all these activities is the ego that has a world and continues to sustain his underlying world belief. When we enter into the phenomenological attitude, we disengage from the natural attitude and contemplate and describe the transcendental ego and all its achievements, all its intentionalities, and we also contemplate the special manifolds through which it is constituted as the transcendental ego. We describe how the ego establishes and presents itself, to itself and to others, as an agent of manifestation.</p>

  <p>这种向现象学反思的转变比它在自然态度中的活动更能“伸展”自我。当我们进入现象学反思时，我们以一种新的哲学方式成为真理的代理人。我们从一个新的视角提出真理主张，一个与自然态度中运作的所有视角截然不同的视角。我们可以从新的角度、新的意义说“我”。然而，观察自然自我的哲学自我不是另一个实体，不是其他人；它是同一个“我”，但现在延伸成了一种新的反思形式。</p><p>This move into phenomenological reflection "stretches" the ego even farther than do its activities in the natural attitude. When we enter into phenomenological reflection, we become agents of truth in a new, philosophical way. We make truth claims from a new perspective, one radically different from all the perspectives that function within the natural attitude. We can say "I" from a new angle, with a new sense. And yet, the philosophical self who views the natural ego is not another entity, not somebody else; it is the same "me", but now stretched into a new form of reflection.</p>

  <p>它<em>不是</em>此外，先验自我只在现象学态度中发挥作用。并非只有哲学反思的自我才是先验的自我。超然的自我已经活跃在自然的态度中。任何真理的成就，任何理性的运用，都是先验自我的工作。任何提出真理问题的绝对意图都是先验自我的作品。先验自我以自然的态度获得真理，但这种朴素的真理成就需要在哲学中完成，哲学将真理理论化。在自然态度中获得的真理是不完整的，因为它没有反思自己。以现象学态度开展的哲学，将前哲学生活中所取得的表现提升到一个新的水平。在自然的态度中，我们有一个世界，我们运用理性，我们在存在与不存在之间认同，我们确认与否定，我们也说谎、欺骗、误入歧途；但是在现象学的态度中，我们澄清了做所有这些事情是什么。</p><p>It is <em>not</em> the case, furthermore, that the transcendental ego comes into play only within the phenomenological attitude. It is not the case that only the philosophically reflective ego is the transcendental ego. The transcendental ego is already active in the natural attitude. Any achievement of truth, any exercise of rationality, is the work of the transcendental ego. Any categorial intentions that raise the issue of truth are the work of the transcendental ego. The transcendental ego achieves truth in the natural attitude, but this naive achievement of truth calls for a completion in philosophy, which theorizes truth. The truth achieved in the natural attitude is incomplete because it does not contemplate itself. Philosophy, carried out in the phenomenological attitude, brings to a new level the manifestations achieved in the prephilosophical life. In the natural attitude we have a world, we exercise rationality, we identify across presence and absence, we confirm and disconfirm, and we also lie, deceive, and fall into error; but in the phenomenological attitude we clarify what it is to do all these things.</p>

  <p>概述自我认同的三个阶段会很有帮助。</p><p>It would be helpful to outline three stages in the identification of the ego.</p>

  <p>(1) 在第一阶段，为有意识的知觉行为及其变体的主体实现身份：自我的身份发生在，比如说，生活在此时此地的情况下的自我和在记忆中流离失所的自我之间，想象和期待。例如，正如我们在第 5 章中所见，记忆的自我和记忆的自我是一回事。</p><p>(1) In the first stage, an identity is achieved for the agent of the intentional acts of perception and its variants: an identity of the ego occurs between, say, the ego living in a situation here and now and the ego displaced in remembering, imagining, and anticipating. For example, the remembering and the remembered ego, as we have seen in Chapter 5, are one and the same.</p>

  <p>(2) 在第二阶段，类别活动的代理人获得了更高的身份。用句法表达他所感知或记住的东西的人所做的不仅仅是感知和记忆；他带来了分类对象，以及它们所暗示的责任和验证的所有维度。在这个阶段实现自己的自我能够在它明确地对某些真理或表现形式采取立场并说“我知道 p”或“我怀疑 p”之类的话时能够<em>指</em>代<em>自己</em>”。这里出现的自我显然与记忆、想象和预期中出现的那个自我相同，但它现在以更大的责任和认知活力出现。它现在采取的立场和意见可以保证。显然，它可以如果它没有首先在第一层次上巩固它的身份，就不会成为这个层次的自我，较低层次的心理障碍会阻碍较高层次的活动。情绪障碍会破坏理性思维。</p><p>(2) In the second stage, a heightened identity is achieved for the agent of categorial activity. The person who syntactically articulates what he perceives or remembers does more than just perceive and remember; he brings about categorial objects, with all the dimensions of responsibility and verification that they imply. The ego that actualizes itself at this stage is able to refer to itself when it explicitly takes a position about some matter of truth or manifestation and says things like, "I know that <em>p</em>" or "I suspect that <em>p</em>". The ego that emerges here is obviously the same one that emerged in memory, imagining, and anticipation, but it now emerges with greater responsibility and epistemic vigor. It now takes positions and has opinions that it can vouch for. Obviously, it could not have come to be an ego on this level had it not first consolidated its identity on the first level, and psychological disruptions on the lower level can impede activities on the higher. Emotional disturbances can undermine rational thinking.</p>

  <p>(3) 在第三阶段，当自我不仅发展出越来越多的观点或科学真理，而且反思什么是拥有观点以及追求和验证科学主张时，进一步的同一性就实现了。现在，自我“盘旋”在第一和第二阶段的所有意向性之上，并分析它们。它还以一种新的方式占有了自己的自我；它获得了作为真理代理人的责任，这与它在第二阶段的责任不同。</p><p>(3) In the third stage, a further identity is achieved when the ego does not just develop more and more opinions or scientific truths, but reflects on what it is to have opinions and to pursue and verify scientific claims. Now the ego "hovers over" all the intentionalities in the first and second stages and analyzes them. It also takes possession of its own self in a new way; it acquires a responsibility as an agent of truth that is different from the responsibilities it had in the second stage.</p>

  <p>我们将在第 13 章考察现象学真理的特殊性质，以及与之相关的责任。目前，注意到自我或自我的感觉在这些不同阶段是如何发展的就足够了。</p><p>We will examine the special character of phenomenological truth, and the responsibility associated with it, in Chapter 13. At present, it is sufficient to have noted how the sense of the ego or the self develops in these various stages.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_8.xhtml.heading_id_7"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_8.xhtml.ch8_ec"></a>自我与物质性</h2><h2><a></a>THE EGO AND CORPOREALITY</h2>

  <p>即使是超然的，作为真理的代理人，自我也有形地存在。小我体验自己身体的方式不同于它体验世界上其他事物的方式，然而身体也是世界上的事物，并且呈现为事物本身。我们从内部和外部体验自己的身体。此外，我们控制自己身体的方式与我们控制世界上其他事物的方式截然不同。小我的肉体有哪些特征？</p><p>Even as transcendental, as an agent of truth, the ego exists corporeally. The way the ego experiences its own body is different from the way it experiences other things in the world, and yet the body is also a thing in the world and is presented as such. We experience our own bodies from the inside and from the outside. Furthermore, we hold sway over our own bodies in a manner radically different from the control we have over other things in the world. What are some of the features of the ego's corporeality?</p>

  <p>我们如何体验自己身体的特点尤其体现在触觉上。(1) 当我用我身体的一部分接触另一部分时（我用右手触摸我的左手肘），被触摸的部分就像我在世界上可能触摸的任何其他物体一样被对待。触摸的手是我的先验自我在其感知和范畴表达中活跃的地方，它的注意力指向我自己的另一部分，肘部（“我的肘部似乎肿了”）。(2) 然而，即使在这个阶段，被触摸的部分，即肘部，也能感觉到手的压力，所以我也从那个方向，有点被动地感知，因为我感觉到被摩擦肘部的感觉. (3) 但是，被触摸的部分可以变成主动触摸的部分：即使我的手触摸到肘部，我可以“反向”并开始注意手对肘部的感觉。无论多么难以置信，肘部都可以成为主动感知器官。然后我通过手肘接触手并开始移动手肘作为接触部分。这样，感动和感人的角色就可以互换了；先验自我可以在任何一个方向上工作。</p><p>The peculiarities of how we experience our own bodies are shown especially in the sense of touch. (1) When I touch one part of my body with another (I touch my left elbow with my right hand), the part being touched is being treated like any other object I might touch in the world. The touching hand is where my transcendental ego, in its perception and categorial articulation, is active at the moment, and its attention is directed toward another part of myself, the elbow ("My elbow seems to be getting swollen"). (2) Even at this stage, however, the touched part, the elbow, feels the pressure of the hand, so I am also perceiving, somewhat passively, from that direction as well, as I sense how it feels to have the elbow rubbed. (3) But then, the touched part can become the actively touching one: even as my hand touches the elbow, I can "reverse direction" and begin to notice how the hand feels to the elbow. However implausibly, the elbow can become the actively perceiving organ. I then touch the hand through the elbow and begin to move the elbow as the touching part. Thus, the touched and touching roles can be reversed; the transcendental ego can work in either direction.</p>

  <p>只有在我自己的身体里，并且只有在所有感官中最基本的触觉方面，这种逆转才有可能。另一个人的拥抱可能类似于此，也可能是试图接近我们与自己的统一（我们可以比喻说与我们拥抱的人成为一体），但它永远不会真正成为相同的。莎士比亚在<em>《特洛伊罗斯与克瑞西达》</em> (IV.S) 中让克瑞西达问：“在亲吻中，你是给予还是接受？”时，莎士比亚提醒我们触摸的这种模糊性。</p><p>Only in my own body, and only in regard to the sense of touch, which is the most basic of all the senses, is this reversal possible. An embrace of another person may be an analogue of this, and it may also be an attempt to approximate the unity we have with ourselves (we may be said metaphorically to become one body with those we embrace), but it could never really become the same. Shakespeare reminds us of this ambiguity of touch when in <em>Troilus and Cressida</em> (IV.S) he has Cressida ask, "In kissing, do you render or receive?"</p>

  <p>在触觉中发现的奇怪的可逆性表明，即使作为先验的自我，甚至作为真理的代理人，我们也被分割成一个身体。此外，还有其他体验身体的方式，都与触觉有关，有助于建立我们的身体：我们对自己在空间中的位置的感觉、我们四肢配置的体验、我们的平衡感和我们感受到重力的阻力，以及我们感受到来自椅子或地板的压力。我们感受到的肉体性建立了一个场所，先验自我在其中行使它所有的意向性，从知觉及其变体到范畴表达再到现象学反思。我们所有的视觉、听觉和味觉都发生在身体的空间内，我们的记忆也储存在那里。</p><p>The curious reversibility found in the sense of touch shows that even as transcendental egos, even as agents of truth, we are partitioned out into a body. Furthermore, there are other ways of experiencing the body, all related to the sense of touch, that help establish our corporeality: the sense we have of our position in space, the experience of the disposition of our limbs, our sense of balance and the resistance we feel to the pull of gravity, and the pressure we feel from the chair or the floor. Our felt corporeality sets up a place within which the transcendental ego exercises all its intentionalities, from perception and its variants to categorial articulations to phenomenological reflection. All our seeing, hearing, and tasting take place within the space of the body, and our memories are stored there as well. All the intentional activities, whether perceptual or categorial, occur within the space marked out by the top of the head and the soles of the feet, our front and back, and our right and left sides and arms.</p>

  <p>身体的空间性不仅是触觉的，而且是移动的。我们控制着身体的各个部分，可以直接移动它们；如果我们想移动其他东西，我们只能通过首先移动我们自己的部分来做到这一点（我们只通过举起我们的手和手臂来举起某物，但我们不必为了举起我们的手和手臂而移动任何其他东西）。身体的各个部分可以相互移动，而身体本身也在世界空间中移动。但是我们移动不仅仅是为了给其他物体引入运动；甚至我们的知觉，以及我们的思维，都涉及某种运动；我们四处走动，看看立方体的另一面，找到一个更好的地方听小提琴，更好地闻一闻烹饪的味道；我们用手指在砂纸上移动，看它是哪个等级，我们用舌头滚动食物以品尝它的味道。我们的视觉需要运动：即使是一只眼睛也可以将其焦点调整到近处和远处；两只眼睛在一起，稍微会聚，给出透视和立体视图；头部可以左右移动；整个身体的运动使眼睛可以遍及所看物体的各个方面。事实上，只有当我们能够在空间中四处移动时，客观空间中的点才为我们建立起来；如果我们是不动的，我们可以在视觉上体验到一些表面会遮挡其他表面，但我们无法获得事物可以围绕的固定点的感觉。给出透视图和立体图；头部可以左右移动；整个身体的运动使眼睛可以遍及所看物体的各个方面。事实上，只有当我们能够在空间中四处移动时，客观空间中的点才为我们建立起来；如果我们是不动的，我们可以在视觉上体验到一些表面会遮挡其他表面，但我们无法获得事物可以围绕的固定点的感觉。给出透视图和立体图；头部可以左右移动；整个身体的运动使眼睛可以遍及所看物体的各个方面。事实上，只有当我们能够在空间中四处移动时，客观空间中的点才为我们建立起来；如果我们是不动的，我们可以在视觉上体验到一些表面会遮挡其他表面，但我们无法获得事物可以围绕的固定点的感觉。</p><p>The spatiality of the body is not only tactile, but also mobile. We hold sway over the parts of our body and can move them directly; if we wish to move other things, we can do so only by first moving parts of ourselves (we lift something only by lifting our hands and arms, but we do not have to move anything else in order to raise our hands and arms). The parts of the body can move in relation to one another, and the body itself moves through the space of the world. But we do not move only to introduce motion into other objects; even our perceptions, and hence our thinking, involve motions of some sort or other; we move around to see the other side of the cube, to get to a better spot to hear the violin, to get a better whiff of what is cooking; we move our fingers over the sandpaper to see which grade it is, and we roll the food over our tongue to appreciate its taste. Our vision requires motion: even a single eye can adjust its focus to the near and the far; two eyes together, with their slight convergences, give perspective and stereoscopic views; the head can be moved from side to side; and the motion of the whole body allows the eyes to range over all sides of the object being seen. In fact, points in objective space are established for us only when we are able to move around in space; if we were immobile, we could visually experience some surfaces as occluding others, but we could not get the sense of a fixed point around which things can circle.</p>

  <p>因此，在人类的情感中有许多部分和整体，许多时刻，它们是在范畴行为中发生的部分和整体的表达的基础。几种感官通过联觉获得同一性，联觉是通过分布在我们自己身体中的各种感官对单个物体的识别。这些可感知部分的多样性，既有意向的也有意向的，作为流形，通过它们可以从越来越多的角度识别对象：树被看到、听到（在风中）、被触摸、被闻到；我们绕着它走，爬上去；我们修剪它的树枝，折断枯死的树皮；在所有这一切中，同一棵树的身份和许多特征都得到了注册。</p><p>Thus, there are many parts and wholes, many moments, in human sensibility, and they serve as a basis for the articulation of parts and wholes that occurs in categorial action. The several senses achieve identities through synesthesia, the recognition of a single object given through the various senses distributed throughout our own bodies. These varieties of sensible parts, both noetic and noematic, serve as manifolds through which objects become identified from more and more perspectives: the tree is seen, heard (in the wind), touched, smelled; we walk around it and climb it; we trim its branches and break off pieces of dead bark; and in all this, one and the same tree is registered in its identity and its many features.</p>

  <p>此外，这种对树的登记是由感知和表达树的先验自我完成的，在识别树木和世界上其他事物的同时，自我也随着时间的推移不断地将自己的身体识别为“其中”的特权客体。它过着它的生活，这个客体提供了自我永远无法逃离的不可避免的物质“这里”。对我来说，身体“在这里”的方式不同于任何世俗地方“在这里”的方式，即使是所有住所中最熟悉和最爱的地方。此外，自我在识别世界上的事物和自己的身体时，也不断地识别自己。正是这个自我记得二十五年前自己爬上那棵树，期待明年冬天在雪中看到同一棵树，</p><p>This registration of the tree, moreover, is accomplished by the transcendental ego that perceives and articulates the tree, and while identifying trees and other things in the world, the ego also continuously identifies its own body over time as the privileged object "in" which it is living its life, the object that provides the ineluctable corporeal "here" that the ego can never flee. The way the body is "here" for me is different from the way any worldly place can be "here", even the most familiar and the most loved of all domiciles. Furthermore, as the ego identifies the things in the world and its own body, it also continuously identifies itself. It is the same ego that remembers itself climbing that tree twenty-five years ago, that anticipates seeing the same tree in snow next winter, and that imagines what the tree would look like if certain other trees were to be planted next to it.</p>

  <p>我们身体最有趣的方面之一是我们的记忆存储在我们体内的方式。我们作为先验自我的身份是通过记忆中的位移和认同来建立的：此时此地的我与我记得在那里然后出现在脑海中的记忆中的那个人是同一个人。但是我生活中被记住的部分并不总是活跃的；它们大多潜伏并储存在我的神经系统中，储存在与周围环境不同的身体中。我经历过的一切都以某种方式存在，其中的一部分时不时地浮出水面。当它被储存时，它是纯粹的化学和有机物，但当它被激活时，它又成为我超然生活的一部分。先验自我和经验自我之间的歧义在记忆的潜伏期方面尤为突出。</p><p>One of the most interesting facets of our corporeality is the way our memories are stored in our body. Our identity as a transcendental ego is established through the displacements and identifications made in remembering: I here and now am the same one that I remember as being there and then in the memory that comes to mind. But the remembered parts of my life are not always active; they mostly remain latent and stored in my neural system, in the body that differentiates itself from my surroundings. Everything I have lived through is somehow there, and parts of it come to light now and then. While it remains stored it is purely chemical and organic, but when it is activated it becomes part of my transcendental life again. The ambiguity between the transcendental and the empirical ego is particularly prominent in regard to the latency of memories.</p>

  <p>现象学的任务之一是从先验的态度出发，详细研究我们的各种感官和机动性如何运作以建立我们自己的肉体。我只勾画了一些可以进行的描述。应该提到的是，将我们的身体呈现给我们自己的披露结构是同一认知生活的一部分，该认知生活涉及范畴思维、精确科学、形式逻辑和数学等事物。显化的一个与格在意向性的所有这些层面上都起作用。</p><p>One of the tasks of phenomenology is to work out in detail, from the transcendental attitude, how our various senses and mobilities work to establish our own corporeality. I have sketched only a few of the descriptions that could be made. It should be mentioned that the structures of disclosure that present our bodies to ourselves are part of the same cognitive life that reaches to things like categorial thinking, exact science, formal logic, and mathematics. The one dative of manifestation is at work on all these levels of intentionality.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_8.xhtml.heading_id_8"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_8.xhtml.ch8_ns"></a>不时的自我</h2><h2><a></a>THE NONPUNCTUAL SELF</h2>

  <p>有时对现象学的抱怨之一是它似乎使自我实体化，使自我成为一种逃避其自身历史的固定点，一种独立的、明确的、不受任何影响的“自我极”。它所遭受的和所做的。据说，自我比这更难以捉摸、更灵活、更投入。但是现象学并没有将自我标点化：它通过描述适合于自我的流形来识别自我的特殊身份。现象学中所承认的自我并不是站在其知觉、记忆、想象、选择和认知行为背后或之外的一个点；相反，它通过这些成就被构成为一种身份。它是通过延迟和差异来实现的。例如，它与记忆和记忆是一回事。它出现在其目前的感知和位移“之间”，而不是“落后于”。此外，自我分散在有生命的身体中，并活跃于其所有部分，而不是驻扎在身体后面。它在无意识甚至身体生活中是可以识别的。在身体和心理上逐渐变老的自我将自己标识为曾经是一个孩子和曾经年轻过的同一个人（一个人自己的婴儿照片有一些不可思议的地方）。即使通过在镜子中看到自己身体的倒影，自我也会以一种独特的方式被构成，当它看到自己就像别人看到的那样。它在无意识甚至身体生活中是可以识别的。在身体和心理上逐渐变老的自我将自己标识为曾经是一个孩子和曾经年轻过的同一个人（一个人自己的婴儿照片有一些不可思议的地方）。即使通过在镜子中看到自己身体的倒影，自我也会以一种独特的方式被构成，当它看到自己就像别人看到的那样。它在无意识甚至身体生活中是可以识别的。在身体和心理上逐渐变老的自我将自己标识为曾经是一个孩子和曾经年轻过的同一个人（一个人自己的婴儿照片有一些不可思议的地方）。即使通过在镜子中看到自己身体的倒影，自我也会以一种独特的方式被构成，当它看到自己就像别人看到的那样。</p><p>One of the complaints sometimes made concerning phenomenology is that it seems to substantialize the self, that it makes the ego into a kind of fixed point that escapes its own history, an "ego pole" that is self-contained, unambiguous, and unaffected by what it suffers and does. The self, it is said, is much more elusive, flexible, and engaged than this. But phenomenology does not punctualize the self: it recognizes the special identity of the self by describing the manifolds that are proper to it. The self recognized in phenomenology is not a point that stands behind or outside its perceptions, memories, imaginations, choices, and cognitive acts; rather, it is constituted as an identity through such achievements. It is actualized through delays and differences. It is, for example, one and the same as remembering and remembered. It comes "between" and not "behind" its present perceptions and its displacements. Also, the self is scattered through the lived body and is active in all its parts, not stationed behind it. It is identifiable in its unconscious and even its bodily life. The ego that is getting old in body and psyche identifies itself as the same that was once a child and once young (one's own baby pictures have something uncanny about them). The self is constituted in a distinct way even by seeing its own bodily reflections in a mirror, when it gets a view of itself as it is seen by others.</p>

  <p>感知、想象和记忆的同一个自我，潜伏在它体内存储的记忆中，也是说“我”并执行范畴动作的那个自我。这个自我，这个自我，也表达了情境（通过它的深思熟虑），因此提出了实践和道德行为的可能性。它富有想象力地将自己置身于未来完成时，估计如果它执行这个或那个动作会怎样。在更理论化的问题上，自我对事物的现状持有自己的看法，并将这些观点与其他可能有不同看法的自我的观点相对立。它倾听争论并可能承认它是错误的，当它这样做时，它会将自己与现在的自己区分开来，因为它持有其早期的信念。</p><p>The same self that perceives, imagines, and remembers, and that is latent in the memories stored in its body, is also the one that says "I" and executes categorial actions. This self, this ego, also articulates situations (through its deliberation) and hence lays out possibilities of practical and moral conduct. It imaginatively displaces itself into the future perfect, estimating how it will be if it performs this or that action. In more theoretic matters, the self holds opinions about the way things are, and it maintains those opinions over against the views of other selves who may think otherwise. It listens to argument and may concede that it has been wrong, and when it does so it differentiates itself as it is now from itself as holding its earlier belief.</p>

  <p>自我得以建立的最令人印象深刻的流形之一是在引用现象中发现的，当自我用自己的声音来表达别人的思想时，将范畴对象构成为属于另一个人而不是自己的：我此时此地，随着世界呈现在我面前的样子，我可以通过我自己的话来展现世界的一部分，就像它呈现在别人面前一样。一种头脑的复制发生了，随之而来的是说“我”的那个人的复制。在所有这些差异和活动中显现出来的自我不是一个准时的东西，也不是一个总是完整的身份，而是一个只存在于丰富多样的表象和行为中的自我。有自我的同一性，但这恰恰是通过去中心化来实现的。</p><p>One of the most impressive manifolds through which the self is established is found in the phenomenon of quotation, when the ego uses its own voice to express the mind of someone else, to constitute categorial objects not as its own but as belonging to another: I here and now, with the world appearing to me as it does, can manifest through my own words a part of the world as it has appeared to someone else. A kind of duplication of the mind occurs, and along with it a duplication of the one who says "I". The self that comes to light in all these differences and activities is not a punctual thing, not an always completed identity, but one that is there only within a rich manifold of appearances and conduct. There is an identity of the self, but it is achieved precisely through decentering.</p>

  <p>尽管如此，自我在某些时刻确实会被打断：如果我在一群持有与我截然不同的立场的人中，我会脱颖而出，成为坚持这种或那种情况确实如此的“那个人”。我需要自我力量来坚持。如果我周围出现了严重的情况，并且很明显如果我不采取行动就没有人会采取行动，那么我就会被实际要求打断。所有的线条都集中在我身上，集中在我身上，而不是其他人身上。我以这种方式被强调正是因为我是范畴活动的主要代理人、证据的代理人和真理主张的拥有者，无论是在理论上还是在实践中。我是这样的代理人，不是因为我是一个生理或心理实体，而是因为我是一个会说“我”的人。然而，即使是这些强烈的自我认同也不是绝对的：</p><p>Still, the self does get punctuated at certain moments: if I am among a group of people who hold positions strongly different from mine, I stand out as "the one" who insists that this or that is indeed the case. I need ego strength to hold fast. If a serious situation builds up around me and it becomes evident that no one will act if I do not, then I am punctuated by the practical demand. All the lines converge on me, on me and on none other. I am highlighted in this way precisely because I am the prominent agent of the categorial activity, the agent of evidence and the owner of a claim of truth, whether in the theoretic or the practical order. I am such an agent not because I am a physical or psychological entity, but because I am someone who can say "I". Even these strong identifications of the self, however, are not absolute: even while my self is in the spotlight, I am still the same one who can remember and anticipate other situations, the one who holds sway within the body that is for the moment at the center of things, the one whose emotions may well up and overcome the decision I am trying to make.</p>

  <p>适合自我的流形在岩石、树木或非人类动物中无法实现。它们特定于显化的与格，其自我既灵活又在其有意识的生命周期中始终如一。现象学承认行为者的复杂性和神秘性，其声音不仅讲述事物的本来面目，而且在说“我”时准确地表达了自己在谈论事物。</p><p>The manifolds that are proper to the self are not realized in rocks, trees, or nonhuman animals. They are specific to the dative of manifestation, whose self is both flexible and yet continuously the same throughout its conscious lifetime. Phenomenology acknowledges the complexity and the mystery of the agent whose voice not only speaks about the way things are, but registers itself, when it says "I", precisely as speaking about them.</p>

  时间性</h1><h1><span class="small">9</span><br><br>
  Temporality</h1>

  <p>现象学发展了一种高度清晰的时间和时间经验理论。它描述的时间性在个人身份的建立中起着重要作用。此外，正是在时间性领域中，现象学才接近所谓的它所检验事物的第一原则。时间遍及现象学所讨论的所有事物，包括意向的和意向的，并且对时间的现象学“起源”的描述达到了一种哲学中心。</p><p>Phenomenology has developed a highly articulated theory of time and temporal experience. The temporality that it describes plays an important role in the establishment of personal identity. Furthermore, it is in the domain of temporality that phenomenology approaches what could be called the first principles of the things that it examines. Time pervades all the things, both noematic and noetic, that are discussed in phenomenology, and the description of the phenomenological "origin" of time gets to a kind of philosophical center.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_9.xhtml.heading_id_3"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_9.xhtml.ch9_lt"></a>暂时性的水平</h2><h2><a></a>LEVELS OF TEMPORALITY</h2>

  <p>可以区分三个层次的时间结构。</p><p>Three levels of temporal structure can be distinguished.</p>

  <p>1. 首先是<em>世界时间</em>，时钟和日历的时间。它也可以称为<em>超验</em>时间或<em>客观时间</em>。这是属于世俗过程和事件的时间。当我们说晚餐持续了两个小时，或者玛丽比多丽丝早两天回来，或者序曲先于歌剧时，我们都是在世界时间安排这些事情和事件。这样的时间可以与世界的空间性、事物所具有的几何延伸以及它们彼此之间的局部相关性进行比较。和这样的空间一样，客观时间是公开的、可验证的；我们可以使用时钟来精确测量一个过程需要多长时间，并且我们都会就测量结果达成一致。被测量的时间位于世界上，位于我们所有人居住的公共空间中。</p><p>1. The first is <em>world time</em>, the time of clocks and calendars. It can also be called <em>transcendent</em> or <em>objective time</em>. This is the time that belongs to worldly processes and events. When we say that a dinner lasted two hours, or that Mary returned two days before Doris, or that the overture precedes the opera, we arrange such things and events in world time. Such time can be compared to the spatiality of the world, the geometric extension that things possess and the local relatedness that they have with one another. Like such space, objective time is public and verifiable; we can use a clock to measure exactly how long a process takes, and we will all agree on the measurement. The time being measured is located in the world, in the common space we all inhabit.</p>

  <p>2. 第二层是<em>内部时间</em>。也可以称为<em>内在</em>时间或<em>主观时间</em>. 这种时间属于心理活动和体验的持续时间和顺序，属于有意识的生活事件。有意的行为和经历相继发生，我们也可以通过记忆唤起某些先前的经历。如果我记得昨晚看过这出戏，我现在会重现我当时的看法。我的意图和感受在时间上排序的方式，无论是关于彼此还是关于我目前的经历，都发生在内部时间中。这种内在的时间性可以比作我们“从内部”体验到的身体空间性。内部时间存在序列，因为一项活动或体验可以在另一项活动或体验之前、之后或同时发生，但此类序列和持续时间不以世界时间衡量，只不过是感觉到的内部“距离” 在我的手肘和我的手腕之间，或者我的胸部和我的胃之间，可以用一根尺子来测量。我确实体验到一个有意识的事件是在另一个事件之前或之后发生的，但我无法像为某人赛跑计时那样“计时”这个序列。内部时间不是公开的，而是私有的。</p><p>2. The second level is <em>internal time</em>. It can also be called <em>immanent</em> or <em>subjective time</em>. This kind of time belongs to the duration and sequence of mental acts and experiences, the events of conscious life. Intentional acts and experiences follow one another, and we can also call back certain prior experiences through memory. If I remember seeing the play last night, I now reenact the perceptions I had then. The way my intentions and feelings are temporally ordered, both in regard to one another and in regard to my present experiences, takes place in internal time. Such immanent temporality can be compared to the bodily spatiality that we experience "from the inside". There are sequences in internal time, since one activity or experience can be before, after, or concurrent with another, but such sequences and durations are not measured by world time, no more than the felt internal "distance" between my elbow and my wrist, or between my chest and my stomach, can be measured by a yardstick. I do experience one conscious event as following or preceding another, but I could not "time" the sequence the way I time someone running a race. Internal time is not public, but private.</p>

  <p>3. 有人可能会认为我们区分的两个时间层次会穷尽时间的可能形式。人们可能认为区分客观时间和主观时间就足够了。然而，必须在这两个层次上加上第三个层次，即<em>内部时间意识</em>。这是超越第二层次的一步。第二个层次是内在时间性，但这第三个层次是<em>意识</em>或<em>意识</em>这种内部时间性。换句话说，仅仅第二层不足以说明它的自我意识；我们必须引入第三个层次来解释我们在第二个层次上的体验。这第三层享有一种特殊的“流动”，不同于超然时间和内在时间。然而，这第三个层次并不需要在其自身之外引入另一个层次。</p><p>3. One might think that the two levels of time we have distinguished would exhaust the possible forms of time. One might think that it is enough to distinguish between objective time and subjective time. However, a third level must be added to these two, that of the <em>consciousness of internal time</em>. This is a step beyond the second level. The second level is inner temporality, but this third level is the <em>awareness of</em> or the <em>consciousness of</em> such internal temporality. In other words, the second level alone is not enough to account for its own self-awareness; we must introduce a third level to account for what we experience on the second. This third level enjoys a special kind of "flow", one different from those in transcendent and internal time. This third level, however, does not require the introduction of yet another level beyond itself.</p>

  <p>第三层因此达到了一种封闭性和完整性。不需要在它之外设置更多级别。在现象学中，这个第三层次，以及其中发生的特殊流动，是绝对的。它是达到作为现象的事物的第一个开始的领域。它不指向任何更基本的东西。它是最终的背景，最终的地平线，底线。它为现象学中分析的所有其他更具体的事物和事件提供了背景，并且它不反过来预设任何更终极的背景。它建立其他一切，但不建立在任何事物之上。在现象学中，内部时间意识的领域是最深刻的区别和同一性的起源，这些区别和同一性是我们经验中发生的所有其他事物所预设的。显然，这也是 一个很难谈论的领域，因为它需要转换首先与世俗对象相关的词汇。然而，如果我们利用部分与整体、同一性与流形、存在与不存在的形式，我们或许能够更清楚地表达这个领域中出现的问题。</p><p>The third level thus achieves a kind of closure and completeness. No further levels need to be posited beyond it. In phenomenology, this third level, with the special flow that occurs in it, is an absolute. It is the domain in which the first beginning of things as phenomena is reached. It does not point beyond itself to anything more basic. It is the ultimate context, the final horizon, the bottom line. It provides the setting for all the other more particular things and events that are analyzed in phenomenology, and it does not in turn presuppose any more ultimate context. It founds everything else but is not founded upon anything. The domain of internal time consciousness is, in phenomenology, the origin of the deepest distinctions and identities, those that are presupposed by all the others that occur in our experience. It is also, obviously, a domain about which it is very difficult to speak, because it requires a transformation of the vocabulary that is geared first and foremost to worldly objects. However, if we make use of the forms of parts and wholes, identity and manifolds, and presence and absence, we may be able to express more clearly the issues that arise in this domain.</p>

  <p>然而，在探讨内在时间意识的棘手问题之前，让我们先谈谈超越时间与内在时间之间的相互作用，以及我们在本章开头区分的第一层与第二层时间性之间的相互作用。我们可能会认为客观时间是最基本的，因为即使我们以主观性不复存在，世俗的持续时间也会继续。然而，作为一种现象，客观时间依赖于内在时间：第一级依赖于第二级。世间事物可以用时钟和日历来衡量，并且可以被体验为持久的，只是因为我们在我们的内心经历了一系列的心理活动。主观生活。如果我们没有预期和记忆，我们就无法将世界上发生的过程组织成时间模式。当我们试图对世界时间进行现象学分析时，我们必须提到内在时间的结构作为这种时间的条件。客观时间的显示出现在我们身上只是因为我们拥有主观的、内在的时间。因此，世界时间的意向结构取决于内部时间的意向结构。因此，当我们站在现象学的立场上看不起意向性时，我们将世界时间视为与内部时间相关。超越时间作为一种现象建立在内在时间之上。因此，当我们站在现象学的立场上看不起意向性时，我们将世界时间视为与内部时间相关。超越时间作为一种现象建立在内在时间之上。因此，当我们站在现象学的立场上看不起意向性时，我们将世界时间视为与内部时间相关。超越时间作为一种现象建立在内在时间之上。</p><p>Before approaching the vexing issues of internal time consciousness, however, let us say a word about the interaction between transcendent and immanent time, between the first and second levels of temporality that we distinguished at the beginning of this chapter. We might think that objective time is the most basic, because worldly duration would go on even if we, with our subjectivity, ceased to exist. As a phenomenon, however, objective time is dependent on immanent time: level 1 is dependent on level 2. Worldly things can be measured by clocks and calendars, and can be experienced as enduring, only because we experience a succession of mental activities in our subjective life. Ifwe did not anticipate and remember, we could not organize the processes that occur in the world into temporal patterns. When we try to give a phenomenological analysis of world time, we must mention the structures of immanent time as a condition for such time. The display of objective time occurs to us only because we possess subjective, immanent time. The noematic structure of world time thus depends on the noetic structures of internal time. As we look down on intentionality from our perch in the phenomenological attitude, therefore, we see world time as correlated with internal time. Transcendent time is founded, as a phenomenon, on immanent time.</p>

  <p>当然，作为生物体，我们处于客观时间之中。在阳光下晒了三个小时后，你被晒伤了；在一个闷热的房间里待了一个下午，我无法清晰地思考；她约会迟到了。像所有物体一样，我们受到世界上运作的因果影响的影响。但我们不仅仅是世界上的事物；我们也是显化或先验自我的与格，因此我们站在世界的对面，让世界向我们显现，而我们意识体验的时间流是世界和其中事物显现的条件。自我既是世界的一部分又是拥有世界的人的矛盾关系在时间性方面再次突出：意识的内在流动嵌套在世界上发生的过程中，但它也站在世界的对立面，提供让世界出现的意识结构。我们发现自己同时生活在客观时间和主观时间中。表现的与格，先验自我，不是一个单一的静态点；它涉及一个在时间上继续进行的过程，但在它自己的内部时间性中，而不是在时钟和日历的客观时间性中。</p><p>Of course, as living organisms we are caught up in objective time. You became sunburned after staying three hours in the sun; I could not think clearly after staying all afternoon in a stuffy room; she is late for an appointment. Like all objects, we are subject to the causal effects that operate in the world. But we are not just things in the world; we also are datives of manifestation or transcendental egos, and as such we stand over against the world and have it appearing to us, and the temporal flow of our conscious experiences is a condition for the appearing of the world and the things in it. The paradoxical relationship of the self as both a part of the world and the one who has a world comes to the fore again in regard to temporality: the internal flow of consciousness is nested within the processes going on in the world, but it also stands over against the world and provides the noetic structures that allow the world to appear. We find ourselves living in both objective and subjective time. The dative of manifestation, the transcendental ego, is not a single and static point; it involves a process that goes on in time, but in its own internal temporality, not in the objective temporality of clock and calendar.</p>

  <p>现在，如果内部时间是客观时间出现的条件，那么时间性的第三个层次，即内部时间意识，又是内部时间出现的条件。</p><p>Now, if internal time is a condition for the appearance of objective time, the third level of temporality, the consciousness of internal time, is in its turn a condition for the appearance of internal time.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_9.xhtml.heading_id_4"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_9.xhtml.ch9_pitc"></a>内部时间意识的问题</h2><h2><a></a>THE PROBLEM OF INTERNAL TIME CONSCIOUSNESS</h2>

  <p>让我们探讨内在时间意识的问题。与世界时间相对应的内部时间性，正如我们所说的，不是最后一种时间；这不是最终的上下文。我们并没有只剩下客观的时间流和与之相关的主观流。相反，内在时间流需要一些更基本的东西来建立它。这个更基本的东西是内部时间意识的领域。这三个级别可以图解化，如图 1 所示。</p><p>Let us explore the issue of internal time consciousness. The internal temporality that is played off against world time is, as we have said, not the final kind of time; it is not the final context. We are not left with just the objective stream of time and the subjective stream correlated with it. Rather, the stream of immanent time calls for something more basic upon which it is founded. This more basic something is the domain of internal time consciousness. The three levels can be schematized as shown in Figure 1.</p>

  <p class="center">图1</p><p class="center">Figure 1</p>

  <p>可以说，内部时间意识比内在时间“更内在”。它构成了我们有意识生活中发生的活动的时间性，例如我们拥有的知觉、想象、记忆和感性体验：它允许这些内在对象表现为时间上的扩展和有序。然而，这些意图本身只是它们所针对的事物的呈现：它们是对世界上的对象和过程的感知、想象和范畴意图。因此，内在时间意识的作用延伸到这些超越的对象及其超越的时间。内在时间意识不仅构成了我们意识生活的内在时间性，而且构成了世俗事件的客观时间性。</p><p>Internal time consciousness is, so to speak, "more immanent" than immanent time. It constitutes the temporality of the activities that occur in our conscious life, such as the perceptions, imaginations, rememberings, and sensible experiences that we have: it allows such inner objects to appear as temporally extended and ordered. However, these intentions themselves are just the presentation of the things that they target: they are the perceptions, imaginings, and categorial intendings of the objects and processes in the world. Consequently, the effect of internal time consciousness extends to such transcendent objects and to their transcendent time as well. Internal time consciousness constitutes not only the internal temporality of our conscious life, but the objective temporality of worldly events. Internal time consciousness is the core for the temporality of all other forms of intentional constitution.</p>

  <p>所有这些说法似乎都有些夸张。它们可能看起来有些不可思议和做作。它们似乎暗示内在时间意识就像新柏拉图式的存在之源，主观体验和世界上的事物都从中发散。内部时间意识似乎被赋予了一种超越其他一切的形而上学优先权。赋予它这样的权力，岂不是过于投机和奢侈？世界上如此隐蔽的部分，如此微小、如此内在以至于比我们的有意行为更内在的东西，怎么会对事物的存在产生如此强大的影响？当现象学进入这个领域时，它似乎进入了人工建构；它似乎并没有忠实地描述我们所看到的。</p><p>All these claims may seem rather bombastic. They may well seem somewhat improbable and contrived. They seem to imply that internal time consciousness is like a Neoplatonic source of being from which both subjective experience and the things in the world emanate. Internal time consciousness seems to be given a kind of metaphysical priority over everything else. Is it not rather speculative and extravagant to endow it with such powers? How can such a hidden section of the world, something so tiny and so internal that it is even more immanent than our intentional acts, have such a powerful effect on the being of things? Phenomenology seems to go off into artificial constructions when it enters into this domain; it does not seem to be faithfully describing what appears to us.</p>

  <p>对内部时间意识的现象学描述确实是一个不同寻常的学说。它的一些术语似乎过于内化；它似乎在说，在我们存在的核心，我们被锁在一种孤独的禁闭中，这种禁闭甚至比通过先验还原所达到的主观性还要私密。这个暂时性问题的修辞和词汇乍一看确实令人不安。然而，在我们放弃这个学说之前，我们应该检查一下它对我们的时间体验有什么看法。这里可能有更多的东西，而不是随便一瞥。</p><p>The phenomenological description of internal time consciousness is indeed an unusual doctrine. Some of its terminology seems to be excessively internal; it seems to say that at the core of our being we are locked into a kind of solitary confinement that is even more private than the subjectivity reached through the transcendental reduction. The rhetoric and vocabulary of this issue of temporality do seem disturbing at first. However, before we dismiss the doctrine, we should examine what it has to say about our experience of time. There may be more here than meets the casual glance.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_9.xhtml.heading_id_5"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_9.xhtml.ch9_slp"></a>活着的现在的结构</h2><h2><a></a>THE STRUCTURE OF THE LIVING PRESENT</h2>

  <p>当我们试图解释我们如何体验时间对象时，我们通常很想说我们有一系列的“现在”呈现在我们面前，一个接一个。我们倾向于说，时间体验非常像正在放映的电影，一次曝光（一种存在）紧随其后。物体的一种状态接连不断地影响着我们。但是我们对时间持续时间的体验不可能是这样的；如果是这样，我们将永远不会感觉到持续时间，不会感觉到持续的时间过程，因为在任何给定时刻我们所拥有的只是电影中那个时刻给定的画面。此外，不仅放映的电影，而且我们对序列的体验也将是离散和断断续续的；我们自己会从一种体验跳到另一种体验，我们永远不会感觉到我们看到的东西超出了当下给出的框架。我们也不会感觉到我们的经历，甚至我们自己会随着时间的推移而持久。连续流动的感觉永远不会出现。因此，对象、我们的经验和我们自己都不会有任何时间上的连续性。我们和我们所经历的不过是瞬间的闪光、瞬间的存在、瞬间的曝光。</p><p>When we try to explain how we experience temporal objects, we are usually tempted to say that we have a series of "nows" presented to us, one after the other. We tend to say that temporal experience is very much like a film being run, with one exposure (one presence) quickly following another. One state of the object impacts us after another. But our experience of temporal duration could not be like this; if it were, we would never get the sense of a duration, of a continual temporal process, because all we would have at any given moment would be the frame in the film that is given at that moment. Furthermore, not only the film being shown, but our experience of the sequence would be discrete and staccato as well; we ourselves would be jumping from one experience to the next, and we would never have a sense that we are seeing something that goes beyond the frame that is being given at the instant. We would also not have a sense of our experience or even of ourselves as enduring through time. The sense of a continuous flow would never arise for us. Thus, neither the object nor our experience nor we ourselves would have any temporal continuity. We and what we experience would be nothing but momentary flashes, momentary presences, momentary exposures.</p>

  <p>我们可能会尝试将连续性和顺序引入到我们对体验的描述中，方法如下：的确，我们在任何时刻都只有一个给定的框架，但是当我们给定那个框架时，我们会记住之前的一些框架；我们将它们作为较早的框架与现在给出的框架联系起来。我们至少会记住当前帧之前的几帧。早期框架的复制品出现在我们面前。正是通过这种伴随着我们的感知的记忆，一种连续感才会出现。</p><p>We might try to introduce continuity and sequence into our description of our experience by saying the following: it is true that we have only one frame given at any moment, but while we have that one given, we remember some of the frames that preceded; we relate them as earlier frames to the one being given now. We would remember at least the few frames that just preceded the present one. Replicas of earlier frames arise for us. It would be through such memory, which accompanies our perception, that a sense of continuity would arise.</p>

  <p>然而，这种解释还不够深入。如果我们说我们<em>记得</em>一个更早的框架，我们就预设了一个事实，即我们已经对过去有了感觉；但是我们怎么会产生这种对过去的感觉呢？如果我们只有一个框架，然后是另一个框架，然后是另一个框架，那么我们所经历的一切都将是现在的框架，即使我们召回一个较早的框架，它也会作为另一个现在的框架提供给我们。我们所拥有的只是纯粹的存在。过去的感觉永远不会向我们透露，即使是在早期框架的复制品中也是如此。过去的维度本身永远不会与现在区分开来。</p><p>This explanation, however, does not cut deeply enough. If we say we <em>remember</em> an earlier frame, we presuppose the fact that we already have a sense of the past; but how could such a sense of the past ever have dawned on us? If we just have one frame and then another frame and then another, all we have ever experienced would be present frames, and even if we called back an earlier frame, it would be given to us as yet another present one. All we would have would be sheer presence. No sense of pastness could ever have been disclosed to us, even in the replicas of earlier frames. The very dimension of being past would never have differentiated itself from the present.</p>

  <p>我们还应该补充说，除了必须对过去的框架进行记忆之外，我们还必须对即将到来的框架进行预期，因为我们的经验延伸到未来和过去。我们的感知必须伴随着直接记忆的行为和直接的预期行为。但是再一次，如果没有从一开始就赋予未来感，我们怎么能理解这些预期将我们引向未来呢？我们怎么知道预期的框架是未来的，而不仅仅是现在的？未来和过去都不会与现在不同。</p><p>We should also add that besides having to posit remembrances of the past frames, we would also have to posit anticipations of the coming frames, because our experience extends into the future as well as the past. Our perception would have to be accompanied by acts of immediate memory and acts of proximate anticipation. But once again, how would we ever appreciate the anticipations as directing us toward the future if the sense of the future had not been given from the beginning? How would we know that the anticipated frames are future and not just more of the present? Neither the future nor the past would be different from the present.</p>

  <p>此外，声称我们对过去和未来有如此基本的感觉，不仅仅是我们被论证所引导的假设；这不是假设或推论。相反，它符合我们体验事物的方式：无论我们体验到什么，无论是世界上的事物和过程，还是主观的行为和感受，我们都会体验到“正在发生的事情”，即它们存在时的过去。正因为它们现在渐行渐远，我们才能在以后记住它们，认出它们是过去，也只有因为它们现在出现，我们才能在更远的地方预见它们。当我们反思我们的经历时，我们发现它是对最近的过去和未来的一种暴露。过去性和未来性最初的缺失存在于我们所有的经验中。</p><p>Furthermore, claiming that we have such a rudimentary sense of past and future is not just a postulation that we are led to by argument; it is not a hypothesis or an inference. Rather, it fits the way we experience things: whatever we experience, whether things and processes in the world or subjective acts and feelings, we experience as "goings-on", as passing as they exist. Only because they trail off now can we remember them later and recognize them as past, and only because they come into view now can we anticipate them at a greater distance. When we reflect on our experience, we find it to be an exposure into the immediate past and future. The initial absences of pastness and futurity are present in all our experience.</p>

  <p>现象学中引入了几个技术术语来帮助描述时间的直接体验。<em>活生生的现在</em>这个词表示我们在任何时刻都拥有的对暂时性的完整直接体验。活生生的现在是任何时刻的时间整体。这个活生生的当下，作为一个整体，由三个瞬间组成：<em>原始印象、保留</em>和<em>预示</em>。这三个抽象部分，这三个时刻，是密不可分的。我们永远不可能单独拥有保留，也不可能单独拥有原始印象或预想。活着的现在是由这三部分组成的一个整体。活生生的礼物的结构如图2所示。</p><p>There are several technical terms that have been introduced in phenomenology to help describe the immediate experience of time. The term <em>the living present</em> signifies the full immediate experience of temporality that we have at any instant. The living present is the temporal whole at any instant. This living present, as the whole, is composed of three moments: <em>primal impression, retention</em>, and <em>protention</em>. These three abstract parts, these three moments, are inseparable. We could never have a retention just by itself, nor could we have a primal impression or a protention just by itself. The living present is a whole made up of these three parts as moments. The structure of the living present can be diagrammed as shown in Figure 2.</p>

  <p>顾名思义，保留指向过去。它“保留”了一些东西。它保留了什么？它保留了刚刚过去的活生生的现在。这一点既微妙又重要。保留不会立即保留正在体验的时间对象的早期阶段或框架，例如旋律或愤怒的感觉。它保留了逝去的活生生的当下，逝去的暂时性体验。</p><p>Retention, as the word suggests, points to the past. It "retains" something. What does it retain? It retains the living present that has just elapsed. This point is both subtle and important. The retention does not immediately retain an earlier phase or frame of the temporal object that is being experienced, such as the melody or the feeling of anger. It retains the elapsed living present, the elapsed experience of temporality.</p>

  <p>现在，这个逝去的活生生的现在本身是由原始印象、预示和保留组成的。因此，在保留逝去的活生生的现在时，当前的人也保留了其中已经逝去的保留。这种保留反过来又保留了之前的活现在，所以我们有一系列已经过去的活现在，通过先前活现在的中介，通过先前保留的中介而保留下来。在活生生的当下，我们有保留的保留。我们从来没有一个活生生的原子存在。由于活生生的当下的持留时刻，活生生的当下总是有一条彗星尾巴，由流逝的活生生的当下和它们的持留相伴。</p><p>Now, this elapsed living present was itself made up of a primal impression, protention, and retention. Thus, in retaining the elapsed living present, the current one also retains the retention that had elapsed within it. This retention in turn retained the living present that preceded it, so we have a whole series of elapsed living presents that are retained through the mediation of prior living presents, through the mediation of prior retentions. In the living present we have a retention of retentions of retentions. We never have an atomic living present all by itself; because of the retentional moment of the living present, the living present always has a comet's tail of elapsed living presents, with their retentions, accompanying it.</p>

  <p>我们应该强调一个事实，即活生生的现在所包含的保留不是一种普通的记忆行为；它比记忆要简单得多。在时间持续时间的初始建立内保留功能。它先于记忆。它保留的东西还没有落入遗忘的缺席，所以熟悉意义上的记忆还不能发挥作用。同样，预留是保留的面向未来的对应物，与我们想象自己处于新情况的全面预期或投射不同。预示更基本也更直接；它给了我们直接在我们现在拥有的东西上“即将到来”的第一个和原始感觉。前瞻打开了未来的维度，从而使全面的预期成为可能。</p><p>We should emphasize the fact that the retention included in the living present is not an ordinary act of remembering; it is much more elementary than memory. Retention functions within the initial establishment of temporal duration. It precedes remembering. What it retains has not yet fallen into the absence of oblivion, and so memory in the familiar sense cannot yet come into play. Likewise, protention, the future-directed counterpart of retention, is not the same as full-scale anticipation or projection, in which we imagine ourselves into a new situation. Protention is more basic and more immediate; it gives us the first and original sense of "something coming" directly upon what we have now. Protention opens the very dimension of the future and thus makes full-fledged anticipation possible.</p>

  <p>保留和保留，连同第一印象，是我们通向未来和过去的经验的最初开端。我们突破当下进入未来和过去的方式被海德格尔有点戏剧化地称为我们经验的<em>狂喜</em>特征，而三种开放形式被称为时间的<em>狂喜。</em>这些术语来自希腊语介词<em>ek</em>，“out”和名词<em>stasis</em>，它来自动词<em>histēmi</em>，“站立”，暗示在我们最基本的时间体验中，我们并没有被锁在一个孤独的存在中，而是站立进入未来和过去。</p><p>Protention and retention, along with the primary impression, are the original opening of our experience into the future and the past. The way we break out of the immediate present into the future and past has been called by Heidegger, somewhat dramatically, the <em>ecstatic</em> character of our experience, and the three forms of opening have been called the <em>ecstases</em> of time. The terms are drawn from the Greek preposition <em>ek</em>, "out", and the noun <em>stasis</em>, which comes from the verb <em>histēmi</em>, "to stand", implying that in our most basic temporal experience we are not locked into a solitary presence, but stand out into the future and the past.</p>

  <p>这种对时间直接经验结构的解释，以及它对原始印象、保留和预想的诉求，几乎具有数学的味道。这有点像试图通过描述点来生成一条连续的线，这样任何点都暗示它的直接相邻点（向右和向左），这反过来又暗示它们的下一个邻居，等等。任何点都只能通过其较近邻居的中介与它较远的邻居相关。在这种理解下，一个点将不是一个离散的单元，而是指向，可以说，指向下一个点，并通过它指向线上的所有其他点。把这个类比得更深一点，就好像这条线上的每个点都可以<em>是</em>一个点，并且可以向外“向世界”暴露，只是同时也暗示它的近邻，并通过它们暗示更远的邻居。</p><p>This explanation of the structure of the immediate experience of time, with its appeal to primary impression, retention, and protention, has an almost mathematical flavor to it. It is something like an attempt to generate a continuous line by describing points in such a way that any point implies its immediate neighboring points (to the right and left), which in turn imply their next neighbors, and so on. Any point would be related to its more distant neighbors only through the mediation of its closer neighbors. In this understanding, a point would not be a discrete unit, but would point on, so to speak, to the next point, and through it to all the other points on the line. To draw out the analogy a bit farther, it would be as if each point on the line could <em>be</em> a point, and could be exposed outward "toward the world", only while also implying its immediate neighbors, and through them its more distant neighbors.</p>

  <p>数学家是否愿意以这种方式重新定义一个点不是我们可以决定的，但在我们对时间的体验中，最终极的单位，活生生的现在（“点”），必须以这样的方式描述以某种方式包括对之前和之后的生活礼物的引用和包含。如果我们正在处理时间，我们就不能将瞬间点定义为简单的原子，简单的现在而不涉及作为基本过去和基本未来的特殊类型的缺席。</p><p>Whether mathematicians would want to redefine a point in this manner is not for us to decide, but in the experience we have of time, the most ultimate unit, the living present (the "point"), must be described in such a way as to include, somehow, a reference to and a containment of the prior and succeeding living presents. If we are dealing with time, we cannot define the momentary point as simply atomic, simply present without any involvement of the special kind of absence that is the rudimentary past and the rudimentary future.</p>

  <p>到目前为止，我们只考虑了活生生的现在的结构，即时间性的存在。这个活生生的礼物不只是自由漂浮；它是有意的，它意图或表现出暂时的对象，例如旋律或疼痛感。在我们的现象学分析中，我们还必须描述这些物体的时间方面，它们与活生生的当下相对立。</p><p>So far we have considered simply the structure of the living present, the presence of temporality. This living present does not just float free; it is intentional, and it intends or manifests temporal objects, such as a melody or a feeling of pain. In our phenomenological analysis, we must also describe the temporal aspects of such objects, which stand over against the living present.</p>

  <p>与实际存在相关的对象的方面是它的现在阶段。对象的方面与过去但保留的生活现在相关是一个较早的现在阶段。简而言之，每个保留的活生生的礼物都有一个与之相关的对象的现在阶段：</p><p>The aspect of the object correlated with an actual living present is its now phase. The aspect of the object correlated with an elapsed but retained living present is an earlier now phase. To put this schematically, each retained living present has a now phase of the object correlated with it:</p>

  <p class="center">生活现在<sub>0</sub> → 现在阶段<sub>0</sub></p><p class="center">Living present<sub>0</sub> → Now phase<sub>0</sub></p>

  <p>当前的活生生的现在保留了刚刚过去的那个，而后者又保留了之前的那个，等等，在客观方面（“意向”方面），对象的时间阶段按顺序保持在适当的位置他们在其中取得了成功。因此，旋律（或感觉）的阶段在最初记录时就按时间排序。它们被标记为时间地点，并在内部按顺序排列。当旋律被记住时，相同的顺序又回来了，因为记忆重新激活了主观和客观方面的时间流。</p><p>The current living present retains the just elapsed one, which in turn retains the one prior to it, and so on, and on the objective side (the "noematic" side), the temporal phases of the object are held in place in the order in which they succeeded one another. Thus, the phases of a melody (or a feeling) are temporally ordered as soon as they are originally registered. They are stamped with a place in time and internally ordered in their succession. When the melody is remembered, the same ordering returns, because the memory reactivates the temporal flow on both the subjective and the objective sides.</p>

  <p>活生生的当下，意识生命最深处的每一部分，都有双重意向性。一方面，它保留了自己先前的活着的现在，从而建立了一种初期的自我认同。另一方面，通过这些相同的保留，随着对象随时间展开，它建立了所体验对象的连续性。内部时间的意识因此行使我们所谓的<em>垂直</em>意向性，建立它自己的连续身份，以及<em>横向</em>意向性，使它的对象随着时间的推移而被赋予。</p><p>The living present, each segment of the deepest life of consciousness, has a double intentionality. On the one hand, it retains its own preceding living presents and thus builds up a kind of incipient self-identification. On the other hand, through these same retentions, it builds up the continuity of the experienced object as the object unfolds through time. The consciousness of internal time thus exercises what we could call a <em>vertical</em> intentionality, building up its own continuous identity, and a <em>transverse</em> intentionality, making its objects given over time.</p>

  <p>然而，一个活生生的礼物的保留范围只能追溯到很久以前。它不会不间断地延伸到我们有意识的生活的最开始。在某些时候，持存逐渐消失，相应的现在阶段也被遗忘。这是包围我们所有有意识时刻的短暂黑暗。意识之光倒退了几个阶段，但随后对象和我们对它的体验就不再被记录。他们进入了一种更明确的缺席状态。然而，我们可以通过记忆恢复它们，在记忆中我们重温早期的时间流，包括内在的和超越的，就像它们最初所忍受的那样。我们将它们带回生活，如所代表的那样。我们不记得在活生生的存在的保留范围内仍在发生的事情；经验和它的对象必须进入一个被遗忘的阶段才能被回忆起来。因此，记忆是一种离散的新开始，再次回到意识之外的事物。</p><p>The retentional reach of a living present goes only so far back, however; it does not extend uninterruptedly to the very beginning of our conscious life. At some point the retentions fade off, and the corresponding now phases fall into oblivion. This is the temporal darkness that surrounds all our conscious moments. The light of consciousness goes back a few phases, but then the object and our experience of it cease to be registered. They enter into a more definitive absence. However, we can recover them through memory, in which we relive the earlier temporal flows, both immanent and transcendent, as they were originally endured. We bring them back to life, as represented. We could not remember something that was still going on within the retentional reach of a living presence; the experience and its object have to fall into a forgotten stage before they can be recalled. Remembering is thus a kind of discrete new beginning, going back again to something that had fallen out of consciousness.</p>

  <p>事实上，我们在第 5 章中检查的所有意识流离失所都是对当前时间意识流的一种中断，并在其中引入了一种新的、第二流：记忆、想象或预期的我们自己的流。我们当前体验的流程可以嵌套在其中的平行流程中。这种位移的有意练习类似于将范畴活动引入知觉。记忆、想象和投射中的位移使自我认同感以及对物体的身份认同感得到增强，这超越了发生在现存层面上的更原始但更基本的身份认同。</p><p>In fact, all the displacements of consciousness that we examined in Chapter 5 are a kind of interruption of the present temporal flow of consciousness and the introduction of a new, second flow within it: the flow of ourselves as remembered, imagined, or anticipated. The flow of our current experience can have a parallel flow nested within it. The deliberate exercise of such displacements is analogous to the introduction of categorial activity into perception. The displacements in memory, imagination, and projection allow a heightened sense of self-identity, as well as a heightened sense of the identity of objects, that go beyond the more primitive but more basic identities that occur on the level of the living present.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_9.xhtml.heading_id_6"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_9.xhtml.ch9_dpitc"></a>内部时间意识的细节和困惑</h2><h2><a></a>DETAILS AND PERPLEXITIES IN INTERNAL TIME CONSCIOUSNESS</h2>

  <p>内部时间意识领域既是内部时间的主观流动，也是世界时间、超越时间的客观流动的基础。它允许这两种流动表现出来，并且在现象学上比它们更基本。但是，这个域不能单独存在。它的全部意义是在主观和客观的两条时间流中显化暂时的对象。我们无法孤立内部时间意识并单独“拥有”它。试图这样做将是典型的哲学错误，即把一个瞬间变成一个片段，把一个抽象的部分变成一个整体。内在时间意识依附于内在时间及其对象，并通过它们依附于世俗时间及其对象。虽然这比他们更根本，但这对他们来说是一个时刻。</p><p>The domain of internal time consciousness underlies both the subjective flow of internal time and the objective flow of world time, transcendent time. It allows both of these flows to manifest themselves, and it is phenomenologically more basic than they are. However, this domain could not exist by itself. Its whole sense is to manifest the temporal objects in the two streams of time, subjective and objective. We could not isolate internal time consciousness and "have" it by itself alone. To try to do so would be the typical philosophical mistake of making a moment into a piece, an abstract part into a whole. Internal time consciousness adheres to internal time and its objects and, through them, to worldly time and its objects. Although it is more fundamental than they are, it is a moment to them.</p>

  <p>此外，时间意识的分析仅仅提供了时间的形式结构。时机不是一切；它只是时间的一种形式。通过提供对时间“起源”的分析，我们没有解释树木、猫、官僚机构、旗帜、旋律、太阳系、疼痛感、知觉和分类活动的起源。我们只是澄清了这些事物存在和显现的时间层次。时间的形式结构需要充满各种对象和活动，这需要对它们进行特定类型的分析，因为它们都具有不同于时间性的呈现形式。然而，由于时间无处不在，时间结构确实适用于所有事物，包括主观的和客观的。</p><p>Furthermore, the analysis of time consciousness only provides the formal structures of time. Timing is not everything; it is only a form for what is temporal. By providing an analysis of the "origin" of time, we do not explain the origin of trees, cats, bureaucracies, flags, melodies, solar systems, feelings of pain, perceptions, and categorial activities. We have only provided a clarification of the levels of time within which such things exist and manifest themselves. The formal structures of time need to be filled with objects and activities of various kinds, which call for their own specific kind of analysis, since they all have forms of presentation that are distinct from those of temporality. However, because time is so pervasive, temporal structures do apply to all things, both subjective and objective.</p>

  <p>当用我们应用于普通物体和过程的标准来衡量时，内部时间的意识是自相矛盾的。正如我们在图 1 中看到的，这种意识的范围甚至比我们的主观时间过程更内在；它甚至比感情的流动和有意的行为更深刻。因为它是如此之深，所以使用“内部”或“内在”来描述它会产生疑问。它超越了内部和外部。我们开始看到它在太空中并不是真正可定位的。它逃避了通常意义上的空间和时间，甚至比我们正常的意向活动更彻底。</p><p>The consciousness of internal time is paradoxical when measured by the standards we apply to ordinary objects and processes. As we have seen in Figure 1, the domain of this consciousness is beyond or more immanent than even our subjective temporal processes; it is deeper even than the flow of feelings and intentional acts. Because it is so deep, it calls into question the very use of the terms "internal" or "immanent" to describe it. It moves beyond inside and outside. We come to see that it is not really locatable in space. It evades space as well as time in their ordinary senses, even more radically than does our normal intentional activity.</p>

  <p>内在时间意识由活生生的当下组成，因为它成功了。这种继承是一个过程吗？它是否以感觉和有意行为的方式流动？不; 它的变化方式必须不同于感觉和行为、旋律和种族。然而内部时间意识必须“改变”；它必须有自己的流程。一个活生生的礼物确实继承了另一个。尽管如此，这里使用的术语“连续性”与用于旋律或感觉时好时坏时的含义不同。我们所能做的就是阐明这种继承的特点，这些特点通过保留和保留在其中发挥作用的方式来表达。Living present <sub>-2</sub> “先于” living present <sub>-1</sub>，<sub>0</sub>，这是目前唯一重要的一个，因为它是唯一一个实际的。</p><p>Internal time consciousness is made up of the living present as it succeeds itself. Is this succession a process? Does it flow along in the way that feelings and intentional acts do? No; its way of changing has to be different from that of feelings and acts, and melodies and races. And yet internal time consciousness has to "change"; it has to have its own kind of flow. One living present does succeed another. Still, the term "succession" when used here cannot mean the same as it does when it is used in regard to a melody or a feeling that waxes and wanes. All we can do is to spell out the peculiarities of such succession, which are expressed by the way retention and protention function in it. Living present<sub>-2</sub> "preceded" living present<sub>-1</sub> , and both are retained in living present<sub>0</sub>, which is the only one that counts at the moment, since it is the only one that is actual.</p>

  <p>活生生的当下形式因此自动而持续地向前推进，既不快也不慢，始终是时间体验的现实。它是临时性核心的小引擎。因为它是时间的起源，它在某种程度上处于时间（以及空间）之外，但它确实享受着一种适合于它自己的分化和继承。它既是站立的又是流动的，正如胡塞尔所说的<em>stehend-strömende Gegenwart 。</em>它分离和聚集、流动和逮捕、展开和封闭，就像火焰和玫瑰合而为一（TS Eliot，<em>Little Gidding</em>，广告罚款）。它是最基本的部分和整体、在场和缺席以及流形中的同一性的场所，这些都是在经验中构成的所有更复杂形式所预设的。这个活生生的现在也是我们作为真理和行动的有意识代理人的自我认同的起源，但因为它是我们的起源，所以它是前个人的。它匿名运行。我们无法改变它或让它减速或加速。这不在我们的能力范围内。我们无法控制我们的起源。它只是继续按照自己的方式飘动。然而我们可以认同它；它是"我们的"，是我们的起源和基地。</p><p>The form of the living present thus chugs along automatically and constantly, neither faster nor slower, always the actuality of temporal experience. It is the little engine at the core of temporality. Because it is the origin of time, it is somehow outside of time (as well as space), and yet it does enjoy differentiation and succession, of a kind proper to itself. It is both standing and flowing, the <em>stehend-strömende Gegenwart</em>, as Husserl calls it. It others and gathers, flows and arrests, unfolds and encloses, like the fire and the rose that are one (T.S. Eliot, <em>Little Gidding</em>, ad finem). It is the site of the most basic parts and wholes, presences and absences, and identities in manifolds, those that are presupposed by all the more complex forms constituted higher up in experience. This living present is also at the origin of our own self-identity as conscious agents of both truth and action, but because it is at our origin it is prepersonal. It functions anonymously. We could not do anything about it to change it or make it slow down or accelerate. It is not within our power. We do not control our origins. It just keeps on fluttering on its own terms. And yet we are identifiable with it; it is "ours", as our origin and base.</p>

  <p>让我们花点时间看看发生在活生生的当下的一些微观或“亚原子”身份综合。当一个真实的活生生的现在逝去并被保留为活生生的现在时，它自己不在了，但它并没有陷入遗忘；它呈现为刚刚消失；因此，它立即缺席给了我们。在这里，我们有一些自相矛盾的东西，缺席的原始给定性，“过去”的原始存在。活生生的现在的修改引入了一种缺席（与它消逝之前所享受的现实形成对比），但缺席是呈现的：活生生的现在被赋予与刚刚从中心地位逝去的相同，因此它是可以识别的，但这种可识别性取决于无情地进入缺席状态。原始的缺席发生在保留中，但这种缺席是给定或呈现的。在活生生的现在到留存状态的简单过渡中，我们有缺席补充存在，我们有部分进入活生生的存在的整体，我们有一个多方面的存在，因为保留的彗星尾巴被建立起来，并且在所有这些事物中，我们有生命存在的同一性综合以及它们预期的“对象”的时间阶段（感觉或旋律的阶段）。</p><p>Let us look for a moment at some of the microscopic or "subatomic" identity syntheses that take place within the living present. When an actual living present elapses and becomes retained as living present, it absents itself, but it does not fall into oblivion; it becomes presented as just gone; its immediate absence is therefore given to us. Here we have something paradoxical, the original givenness of an absence, the original presence of a "past". The modification of the living present introduces an absence (in contrast with the actuality enjoyed before it elapsed), but the absence is presented: the living present is given as the same one that just elapsed from centrality, and so it is identifiable as such, but such identifiability depends on the relentless passage into absence. An original absencing takes place within retention, but this absencing is given or presented. In that simple transition of the living present into a retained state, we have absence complementing presence, we have parts coming to be within the whole of the living presence, we have a manifold being generated as the comet's tail of retentions is built up, and in all these things we have identity synthesis of living presences as well as of the temporal phases of their intended "objects" (the phases of the feeling or of the melody).</p>

  <p>我们已经专注于内部时间意识的持存方面，但我们不应该忽视持存方面。预示是对即将到来之事的开放。是对即将到来之事的原始等待。它是正式的，只等待没有任何特定内容的“某事”，即使特定体验总是具有某种内容并因此被指定（更多的悲伤感，来自拐角处的东西，更多沙拉，更多谈话） . 因此，当一个过程的一个阶段在最初的印象中出现时，它已经被有意地“预期”了，至少就它的时间形式而言，因此它被认为是被等待过的。微观或亚原子身份合成不仅在保留方面发生，而且在预留方面也发生。</p><p>We have concentrated on the retentional aspect of internal time consciousness, but we should not neglect the protentional side. Protention is the opening to what is coming. It is the original awaiting of something to come. It is formal, awaiting only "something" without any specific content, even though a particular experience always has a content of some sort and hence is specified (more of the feeling of sadness, something from around the corner, more salad, more conversation). Thus, when a phase of a process registers itself in a primary impression, it had already been protentionally "anticipated", at least as regards its temporal form, and hence it is given as having been awaited. A microscopic or subatomic identity synthesis occurs not only in regard to retention, but also in regard to protention.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_9.xhtml.heading_id_7"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_9.xhtml.ch9_frat"></a>关于时间难题的最后评论</h2><h2><a></a>FINAL REMARKS ON THE APORIAE OF TIME</h2>

  <p>您一直在阅读的有关内部时间意识的内容可能看起来过于推测而且几乎是荒诞不经。它们似乎超出了我们对其他形式的意向性给出的更易于理解的描述。例如，现象学对感知和想象的分析，或对范畴活动和图片的分析，似乎更符合现实；它们似乎立足于我们的实际体验。诸如记忆和知觉之间的区别似乎是读者可以通过思考他的有意识生活来验证或证伪的那种。但是关于内部时间意识的推测对于普通经验来说似乎是完全陌生的。他们似乎飘进了神秘和封闭的世界。它们仍然是现象学的一部分吗？它们是描述，还是人工构造？</p><p>The things you have been reading about internal time consciousness may seem excessively speculative and almost fantastic. They may seem to go beyond the more accessible descriptions we have been giving of other forms of intentionality. For example, the analyses phenomenology provides for perception and imagination, or for categorial activity and pictures, seem more realistic; they seem to have a foothold in what we actually experience. Distinctions such as those between memory and perception seem to be the kind that the reader could verify or falsify by thinking about his conscious life. But the speculations about internal time consciousness may seem to be utterly foreign to ordinary experience. They seem to drift into the mystical and the hermetic. Are they still part of phenomenology? Are they descriptions, or are they artificial constructions?</p>

  <p>人们可能会以下列方式表述这一反对意见：我们承认时间经验不是原子的，不是刀刃而是马鞍背；我们承认它具有诸如保留和保留之类的东西以及它的直接印象。将最近的过去和未来纳入现在似乎是合理的。但是，为什么不把这个结构定位在我们的感受和意向行为的流动中，在时间的第二个层次中呢？为什么不把它当作心理上的东西呢？为什么将它定位为比主观意识流更深刻、更内在的东西？为什么要将它投射到活生生的当下及其奇特的消逝模式中？为什么要将其他人和聚会作为原始事件的“珍贵”语言呢？这是时间性第三层的假设，</p><p>One might formulate this objection in the following way: we will grant that temporal experience is not atomic, not a knife edge but a saddle back; we grant that it has something like protention and retention along with its immediate impression. The inclusion of an immediate past and future into the present seems reasonable enough. But why not locate this structure right inside the flow of our feelings and intentional acts, in the second level of temporality? Why not leave it as something psychological? Why posit it as something deeper and more immanent than the subjective stream of consciousness? Why project it into the domain of the living present and its curious mode of elapsing? Why go off into the "precious" language of othering and gathering as a primal event? It is the postulation of the third level of temporality, one deeper and "below" the flow of subjective experience, that seems to be philosophically excessive.</p>

  <p>针对这一反对意见，可以说意向性和表象分析不能仅仅停留在世界时间域和主观时间域。在这两个层面上发生的在场和不在场的来回必须得到一种开放和清理的支持，一种区分的来源，这不仅仅是一个世俗的过程或一个心理事件。事物和经验随时间展开并持续存在的事实不仅仅是机械的、有机的或心理的事实；它源于更深层次。这个层次是所有形式结构的源泉，例如逻辑、数学、句法和各种表达方式中的结构。此外，当我们识别和了解世间事物时，当我们体验到自己的感觉、知觉、记忆和智力活动时，</p><p>In response to the objection, one can say that the analysis of intentionality and presentation cannot rest with just the domain of world time and the domain of subjective time. The back and forth of presence and absence that occurs on these two levels has to be supported by a kind of opening and clearing, a source for distinction, that is not just a worldly process or a psychological event. The fact that things and experiences unfold and persist in time is not just a mechanical or an organic or a psychological fact; it originates from a deeper level. This level is the spring for all formal structures, such as those found in logic, mathematics, syntax, and the various modes of presentation. Furthermore, when we identify and know worldly things, and when we experience our own sensations, perceptions, memories, and intellectual activities, we are always also unreflectively bringing ourselves to light as the identifiable source and receiver of such achievements, without there being any need for another dative that accounts for this manifestation.</p>

  <p><em>胡塞尔在他关于内部时间意识的学说中接近了这一来源，而海德格尔则通过他对Lichtung</em>和<em>Ereignis</em>的隐晦评论专注于此，这些评论指的是事物可以被给予并且我们可以成为它们的与格的空间的“稀疏化”。古典哲学在其关于“一”（普罗提诺）的差异的散发、“一”与不确定的二元体（柏拉图）的相互作用，甚至可能是“不动的推动者”（亚里士多德）的作用的评论中触及了这些问题。如果我们要讨论事物的呈现和不存在，就需要一种存在和不存在的推拉的起源，它不能是在世界上或在我们的主观体验流中出现的事物之一.</p><p>Husserl approaches this source in his doctrine on internal time consciousness, while Heidegger focuses on it with his cryptic remarks about <em>Lichtung</em> and <em>Ereignis</em>, which refer to the "thinning out" of a space where things can be given and we can become their datives. Classical philosophy touches on these matters in its remarks on the emanation of differences from the One (Plotinus), on the interplay of the One and the Indeterminate Dyad (Plato), and even perhaps on the role of the Unmoved Mover (Aristotle). If we are to discuss the presentation and absenting of things, a kind of origin for this push and pull of presence and absence is called for, and it cannot be one of the things that shows up in the world or in our flow of subjective experiences.</p>

  <p>一个感觉更自在地处理神经元和计算过程的人可能会因恐惧和排斥而远离这些陈述。他可能会说，如果现象学导致这种神秘化，他不想参与其中。相反，他将通过测量神经元活动和定位大脑皮层上感知、记忆和其他心理事件发生的位置来解释意识和知识以及时间体验。这些是我们可以得到的东西，他相信这样的科学工作将展示真正的意识活动是什么。但这样一个人的保留代价将是他永远无法解释诸如“呈现”、“表示”、“记忆”甚至“计算”等他必须使用但不能证明其合理性的术语。他将无法解决过去、未来和身份的感觉。他将描述机械和有机过程，但无法以多种形式合理地谈论意识，也永远不会提出时间是什么的问题。</p><p>A person who feels more comfortable dealing with neurons and computational processes may turn away from such statements in horror and repulsion. He may say that if phenomenology leads to such mystification, he wants no part of it. Instead, he will explain consciousness and knowledge and the experience of time by measuring neuronal activity and locating sites on the cerebral cortex where perceptions and memories and other mental events occur. These are things that we can get our hands on, and such scientific work, he believes, will show what conscious activities really are. But the price of such a person's reserve will be the fact that he will never be able to account for terms like "presentation", "representation", "remembering", and even "computation", terms that he must use but cannot justity. He will be unable to address the sense of pastness, futurity, and identity. He will describe mechanical and organic processes but will not be able to speak legitimately about consciousness in its many forms and will never get to the question of what time is.</p>

  <p>谈论内部时间意识所使用的词汇和语法有其自身的准确性和严谨性。他们必须使用隐喻和其他比喻，但这并不奇怪，因为语言最初不可能发展到谈论这个领域；我们必须调整通常用于命名世界上事物和过程的术语。需要修改世俗术语，以便了解事物呈现及其命名能力的基础。“现在存在”和“在这里（或那里）”，作为表现的与格和事物出现的空地，必须与关于我们自己的物理和心理事实区分开来，就像逻辑和证据必须与物理和物理区分开来一样。心理过程。</p><p>The vocabulary and grammar used in speaking about internal time consciousness have their own exactness and rigor. They must use metaphor and other tropes, but this is not surprising, since language could not have originally developed to speak about this domain; we must adjust the terms that are normally used to name things and processes in the world. Worldly terms need to be modified in order to get at what underlies the presentation of things and their very ability to be named. "Being now" and "being here (or there) ", being a dative of manifestation and a clearing for things to appear, must be distinguished from physical and psychological facts about ourselves, just as logic and evidence have to be distinguished from physical and psychological processes. The issues of internal time consciousness underlie the issues of truth and disclosure, and they are related to the classical study of being as being, the inquiry into how things manifest themselves.</p>

  The Life World and Intersubjectivity</h1>

  <p>在第 9 章讨论了非常正式的问题之后，我们现在转向更具体的主题。在本章中，我们将考虑<em>Lebenswelt</em>，生活世界，我们生活的世界，我们还将考虑主体间性，即在我们对他人的体验中发挥作用的那种意向性。生活世界的熟悉特征和主体间性的公共特征将从前一章的严肃分析中带来令人欣慰的解脱。</p><p>After the extremely formal issues discussed in Chapter 9, we now move on to more concrete topics. In this chapter we will consider the <em>Lebenswelt</em>, the life world, the world in which we live, and we will also consider intersubjectivity, the kind of intentionality that functions in our experience of other persons. The familiar character of the lived world and the public character of intersubjectivity will bring a welcome relief from the austere analyses of the preceding chapter.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_10.xhtml.heading_id_3"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_10.xhtml.ch10_lwp"></a>作为问题的生活世界</h2><h2><a></a>THE LIFE WORLD AS A PROBLEM</h2>

  <p>与现代科学相比，生活世界是作为一个哲学问题出现的。伽利略、笛卡尔和牛顿引入的科学的高度数学形式使人们认为我们生活的世界，颜色、声音、树木、河流和岩石的世界，这个世界后来被称为“次要品质”，不是现实世界；相反，精确科学所描述的世界被认为是真实的世界，它与我们直接体验的世界截然不同。看起来像桌子的东西实际上是原子、力场和空白空间的集合体。原子和分子，以及科学所描述的力、场和规律，据说是事物的真实存在。我们生活的世界和直接感知的世界只是我们的思想对我们感官的输入作出反应而构建的，感官对从物体传来的物理刺激做出生物学反应。我们所生活的世界在我们的体验中最终是不真实的，但数学科学所触及的世界，这个仅仅是表象世界的世界，却是真实的。</p><p>The life world arises as a philosophical issue in contrast with modern science. The highly mathematical form of science that was introduced by Galileo, Descartes, and Newton led people to think that the world in which we live, the world of colors, sounds, trees, rivers, and rocks, the world of what came to be called "secondary qualities", was not the real world; instead, the world described by the exact sciences was said to be the true one, and it was quite different from the world we directly experience. What looks like a table is really a conglomeration of atoms, fields of force, and empty spaces. Atoms and molecules, and the forces, fields, and laws described by science, are said to be the true reality of things. The world we live in and directly perceive is only a construct made by our minds responding to the input from our senses, and the senses react biologically to physical stimuli that are transmitted from objects. The world we live in is ultimately unreal as we experience it, but the world reached by mathematical science, the world that causes this merely apparent world, is real.</p>

  <p>科学在我们的文化中具有巨大的权威，因为人们认为它告诉我们事物的真相。据说，甚至像意识、语言和推理这样的人类事物最终也将用脑科学来解释，而脑科学反过来，如果不是事实上，原则上也可以还原为物理学和化学的物理科学。那么我们有两个世界，一个是我们生活的世界，一个是数学科学所描述的世界，一般认为生活世界只是一种现象，完全是主观的，而数学科学的世界才是真正的客观世界.</p><p>Science has great authority in our culture because people think that it tells us the truth of things. Even human things like consciousness, language, and reasoning will, it is said, be ultimately explained in terms of the brain sciences, which in turn will be reducible, in principle if not in fact, to the physical sciences of physics and chemistry. We have two worlds, then, the world in which we live and the world described by the mathematical sciences, and it is generally thought that the life world is a mere phenomenon, totally subjective, while the world of mathematical science is the truly objective world.</p>

  <p>生活世界的问题不是在现代科学出现之前就出现的；在那之前，人们只是简单地认为我们生活的世界是唯一的世界。前现代科学只是阐明了我们熟悉的世界。它没有声称要找到它的替代品。前现代科学只是试图为我们直接遇到的事物开发精确的术语、定义和描述，比如生物体、情感、修辞论证和政治社会。我们应该如何解释我们生活的世界——我们应该将其视为有效和值得信赖的，还是纯粹主观的和不科学的——这个问题在对现代科学的回应中脱颖而出。</p><p>The issue of the life world did not arise before the advent of modern science; before then, people simply thought that the world we live in was the only world there was. Premodern science just articulated our familiar world. It did not claim to find a substitute for it. Premodern science tried simply to develop exact terms, definitions, and descriptions of the things we directly encounter, things like living organisms, emotions, rhetorical arguments, and political societies. The problem of how we should interpret the world in which we live — whether we should take it as valid and trustworthy, or purely subjective and unscientific — comes to the fore in response to modern science.</p>

  <p>现象学如何处理客观科学世界与主观生活世界之间的差异问题？它试图表明精确的数学科学起源于生活世界。它们建立在生活世界之上。精确科学是我们对世界上事物的直接经验的转变；他们将这种体验推向更高层次的认同，并相应地将我们体验的对象转化为理想化的数学对象。精密科学似乎正在发现一个新的和不同的世界，但根据现象学，它们真正在做的是使普通世界服从于一种新的方法。通过这种方法，精确科学只会增加我们对我们生活的世界的了解；它们为我们处理事物提供了更高的精确度，但它们从不放弃或抛弃作为它们基础的世界。这些科学嵌套在生活世界中；他们不与之竞争。</p><p>How does phenomenology deal with the problem of the difference between the objective, scientific world and the subjective, lived world? It attempts to show that the exact, mathematical sciences take their origin from the lived world. They are founded on the life world. The exact sciences are a transformation of the experience we directly have of things in the world; they push this experience to a much higher level of identification, and correlatively they transform the objects we experience into idealized, mathematical objects. It may seem that the exact sciences are discovering a new and different world, but what they are really doing, according to phenomenology, is subjecting the ordinary world to a new method. Through this method, the exact sciences merely increase the knowledge we have of the world in which we live; they provide a greater precision in our dealings with things, but they never abandon or discard the world that is their basis. Such sciences are nested within the life world; they do not enter into competition with it.</p>

  <p>此外，现象学不仅仅断言精确的科学是建立在生活世界之上的；它还试图描述构成此类科学的特殊类型的意向性。它试图准确地阐明生活世界是如何转变为几何和原子现实世界的。然后，现象学声称精确科学必须在生活世界中占据一席之地。它们是其中的既定机构之一，但它们永远不会用另一个机构取代生活世界。我们无法生活在科学预测的世界中；我们只能生活在生活世界中，而这个基本世界有自己的真理和验证形式，这些形式并没有被现代科学引入的真理和验证所取代，而是得到了补充。</p><p>Moreover, phenomenology does not just assert that the exact sciences are founded on the lived world; it also tries to describe the special kinds of intentionalities that constitute such sciences. It tries to spell out precisely how the life world is transformed into the world of geometric and atomic realities. Then, phenomenology claims that the exact sciences must take their place within the life world. They are one of the established institutions within it, but they never replace the life world by another one. We could not live in the world projected by science; we can only live in the life world, and this basic world has its own forms of truth and verification that are not displaced but only complemented by the truth and verification introduced by modern science.</p>

  <p>那么，现象学的举措是表明精确的科学是从生活的世界和其中的事物衍生出来的。现象学承认现代数学科学的价值和独特性，但并没有高估它们；它提醒我们，这种科学是建立在以前科学的方式提供给我们的事物之上的，它还提醒我们，即使是科学也是由某人“拥有”或实现的。科学必须由科学家、由进行适合科学的特殊思考和意图的人类来断言。科学涉及各种意向性、各种存在和不存在以及身份综合。它预设了它与其他智力活动共有的某些形式的意向性，并且它还发展了自己的某些形式，</p><p>The move made by phenomenology, then, is to show that the exact sciences are derivative upon the lived world and the things in it. Phenomenology recognizes the value and distinctness of modern mathematical science, but it does not overvalue them; it reminds us that such science is built upon things that are given to us in a pre scientific way, and it also reminds us that even science is "owned" or achieved by somebody. Science has to be asserted by scientists, by human beings who carry out the special kind of thinking and intending proper to it. Science involves various kinds of intentionality, various kinds of presence and absence and identity synthesis. It presupposes some forms of intentionality that it has in common with other intellectual endeavors, and it also develops some forms of its own, but it does not float free from the persons, the transcendental egos, who achieve the science.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_10.xhtml.heading_id_4"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_10.xhtml.ch10_hmsc"></a>数学科学是如何构成的</h2><h2><a></a>HOW THE MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES ARE CONSTITUTED</h2>

  <p>现代科学处理的是理想化的事物：无摩擦的表面、光线、理想气体、不可压缩的流体、完全灵活的弦、理想效率的引擎、理想电压源以及对它们移动的场没有任何影响的测试粒子。然而，这样的理想形式并不是凭空捏造出来的。相反，它们是植根于我们直接体验的事物的投射。</p><p>Modern sciences deal with idealized things: with frictionless surfaces, rays of light, ideal gases, incompressible fluids, perfectly flexible strings, ideally efficient engines, ideal voltage sources, and test particles that do not have any effect on the field in which they move. However, such ideal forms are not fabricated out of thin air. Rather, they are projections that have their roots in the things that we directly experience.</p>

  <p>例如，考虑一下我们是如何想到几何曲面的。我们从一个普通的表面开始，比如桌面。我们对表面进行打磨和抛光，使其越来越光滑。然而，在某一点上，我们可以从实际的打磨和抛光转变为富有想象力的预测。我们想象用砂纸打磨表面，直到它不能再平滑为止；我们想象它已经达到平滑的极限。事实上我们无法将表面打磨到这种程度，但我们可以从精炼它的物理步骤中“起飞”，并简单地想象它达到了这个不可逾越的极限。这个极限是纯粹的几何曲面，是在实际经验的基础上达到的。这是我们实际体验到的表面的转变。</p><p>For example, consider how we come to the idea of a geometric surface. We begin with an ordinary surface, such as a tabletop. We sand and polish the surface and make it smoother and smoother. At a certain point, however, we can shift from actual sanding and polishing to an imaginative projection. We imagine sanding the surface until it could not be smoothed out any further; we imagine it as having reached the limit of smoothness. In actual fact we cannot polish the surface to this degree, but we can "take off" from the physical steps of refining it and simply imagine it reaching this unsurpassable limit. This limit is the pure geometric surface, and it is reached from a basis in actual experience. It is a transformation of surfaces that we actually experience.</p>

  <p>另一个例子可以在光学中找到。我们从手电筒发出的一束光开始。然后我们覆盖部分光源并将光束切成两半。然后我们覆盖剩余部分的一半。我们这样做了几次，但随后我们改变了方式；我们从实际阻挡光的一部分转变为想象我们阻挡了它，然后我们继续想象我们已经将光切割成一束非常窄的光束，一束如此之窄以至于我们无法在不熄灭它的情况下打断它的任何部分完全光束。这种最小的光束，这种不可切割的或原子的光束，变成了光的“射线”，正如牛顿在他的<em>光学</em>中所定义的那样。事实上，我们可能永远也达不到这样的光线，但我们可以想象或认为它是一个极限。</p><p>Another example can be found in optics. We start with a beam of light coming from a flashlight. Then we cover part of the light source and cut the beam, say, in half. Then we cover half of the remaining part. We do this a few times, but then we change gears; we shift from actually blocking part of the light to imagining that we block it, and we go on to imagine that we have cut the light down to a very narrow beam, one so narrow that we could not interrupt any part of it without extinguishing the beam entirely. This tiniest of beams, this uncuttable or atomic beam, becomes a "ray" of light, as it was defined by Newton in his <em>Optics</em>. We could in actual fact never arrive at such a ray of light, but we can imagine or think about it as a limit.</p>

  <p>完美光滑的表面和光线都是<em>理想化的物体</em>。这样的对象在我们的生活世界中是永远无法体验的；我们通过一种特殊的意向性建立或构成它们，这种意向性混合了感知和想象。这种意向性始于生活世界的某些东西，但它产生了一些似乎不再属于那个世界的东西。然而，一旦我们有了这些理想化的对象，我们就可以开始将它们与我们体验到的具体对象联系起来。理想化的对象成为我们所经历的完美版本；它们似乎比我们感知到的事物“更真实”，因为它们更精确。我们所感知的事物似乎只是完美标准的不精确复制品。</p><p>Both the perfectly smooth surface and the ray of light are <em>idealized objects</em>. Such objects could never be experienced in our life world; we establish or constitute them by a special kind of intentionality, one that mixes both perception and imagination. This intentionality starts with something from the life world, but it generates something that seems not to belong to that world any longer. Once we have these idealized objects, however, we may begin to relate them to the concrete objects that we experience. The idealized objects become the perfect versions of what we experience; they seem to be "more real" than the things we perceive because they are more exact. The things we perceive seem to be only imprecise copies of the perfect standard.</p>

  <p>然后，如果我们带来许多这样的物体，我们可能会认为我们已经发现了一个比我们感知的世界更好、更准确的世界。当伽利略、笛卡尔和牛顿引入的科学在我们的文化中占据主导地位时，就会发生这种情况。人们忘记了科学中所指的理想事物是通过一种思维方式产生的；他们相信这些事情比我们直接体验到的更真实，因此他们相信了解这些事情的科学具有巨大的权威。他们将方法的结果视为发现了一种新的现实。科学专家，这个新领域的大师，被认为比我们其他人对事物的本质有更完美的把握，因为我们“仅仅”与非科学世界打交道，而他们与世界打交道，因为它“真实地”是完美的。此外，这种理想化不仅体现在几何学和物理学中，而且还体现在社会科学中：经济学、政治学和心理学。例如，博弈论中的模型已被用于计算战争和外交政策中的策略。</p><p>Then, if we bring about many such objects, we may think that we have discovered a whole world of things that is far better and more exact than the world of our perception. This is what happens when the kind of science introduced by Galileo, Descartes, and Newton becomes dominant in our culture. People forget that the ideal things referred to in the science have been brought about by a way of thinking; they believe that these things are more real than what we directly experience, and so they credit the sciences that know them with great authority. They take what is the result of a method as being a discovery of a new kind of reality. The scientific experts, the masters in this new domain, are thought to have a much more perfect grasp of the nature of things than the rest of us do, since we deal "merely" with the unscientific world, while they deal with the world as it "truly" is in its perfect exactness. Such idealizations, furthermore, have been projected not only in geometry and physics, but also in the social sciences: in economics, politics, and psychology. Models in game theory, for example, have been used to calculate strategies in warfare and foreign policy.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_10.xhtml.heading_id_5"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_10.xhtml.ch10_faso"></a>科学对象的其他方面</h2><h2><a></a>FURTHER ASPECTS OF SCIENTIFIC OBJECTS</h2>

  <p>让我们更详细地考察达到理想化对象的过程。我们开始的对象是我们可以识别其中可能存在波动的特征的对象，例如表面的光滑度或光束的大小。这两个特征可以有变化：两者可以或多或少、或多或少地实现。然后变化​​变得越来越小，并且出现了一种情况，在这种情况下无法想象进一步的变化：它们减少到零。表面变得非常平坦，光束实际上变成了一条线。我们已经“几何化”了一个曾经是世界上可感知事物的对象。</p><p>Let us examine in greater detail the procedure by which idealized objects are reached. The object we start with is one in which we can identify a feature in which fluctuations are possible, such as the smoothness of the surface or the size of the beam. There can be variations in these two features: both can be realized in greater or lesser degree, in more or less. The variations are then made smaller and smaller, and the idea arises of a condition in which no further variations are thinkable: they are reduced to zero. The surface becomes perfectly flat, the beam becomes practically a line. We have "geometrized" an object that was once a perceived thing in the world.</p>

  <p>重要的是要注意，当我们达到这种理想状态时，我们会保留我们开始时的某些内容或质量。我们不会把一切都变成纯数学。理想的表面仍然是空间的东西，射线仍然是一束光。表面不同于光线，两者都不同于完全灵活的弦或理想电压源，而这些又是从其他世俗物体开始的理想化。</p><p>It is important to note that when we reach this ideal condition, we retain something of the content or the quality of the thing with which we began. We do not turn everything into pure mathematics. The ideal surface is still a spatial thing, and the ray is still a ray of light. The surface is different from the ray of light, and both are different from, say, the perfectly flexible string or the ideal voltage source, which in their turn are idealizations that began from other worldly objects.</p>

  <p>正是理想化对象极其精确的身份使它们在智力上如此令人满意。它们是完美的：与我们实际遇到的可变表面和光束相比，它们无论在哪里都完全相同。在本书的前几章中，我们考虑了其他背景下的身份主题。感知到的事物（立方体）被描述为侧面、方面和轮廓流中的身份；据说心理行为是我们对它的各种记忆中给出的身份；甚至自我也被呈现为我们各种精神成就背后的身份。然而，所有这些身份都包含许多变数；它们是可以称为<em>形态</em>事物或本质的东西。相比之下，数学科学达到的理想事物，<em>准确的</em>本质，不容忍任何歧义或变化。他们积极地排斥他们。</p><p>It is the excruciatingly exact identity of the idealized objects that makes them so satisfying intellectually. They are perfect: they are exactly the same wherever they are found, in contrast with the variable surfaces and beams of light that we actually encounter. In earlier chapters of this book, we considered the theme of identity in other contexts; a perceived thing (the cube) was described as an identity in a flow of sides, aspects, and profiles; a mental act was said to be an identity given in the various remembrances we have of it; and even the self was presented as an identity behind our various mental achievements. However, all these identities enclose many variabilities; they are what can be called <em>morphological</em> things or essences. In contrast, the ideal things that mathematical science reaches, the <em>exact</em> essences, do not tolerate any ambiguity or variation. They positively exclude them.</p>

  <p>并非所有事物都可以被投射到一个极限并被构造为精确的本质；例如，知觉或记忆总是保留着一些模糊性和可变性。尝试将类似的事物投射到理想的极限是没有意义的；它们仍然是“形态学的”，而不是确切的事物。因此，对某些人来说，这些事情似乎是模糊的和主观的，并且试图引入一门精确的科学，一种数学心理学或认知科学，用更精确的概念取代这些概念。试图将人类认知解释为神经元计算的一种形式就是一个例子。</p><p>Not all things can be projected toward a limit and constituted as exact essences; a perception or a memory, for example, always retains some vagueness and variability. It would make no sense to try to project things like them toward an ideal limit; they remain "morphological" and not exact kinds of things. Consequently, such things seem, to some people, to be vague and subjective, and attempts are made to introduce an exact science, a kind of mathematical psychology or cognitive science, that will replace such concepts with more exact ones. The attempt to explain human cognition as a form of neuronal computation is an example.</p>

  <p>现象学声称自然界的精确数学科学无法解释它们自身的存在。他们没有术语和概念来处理感知、记忆、其他思想的经验等。现象学声称它可以提供概念和分析，这些概念和分析将阐明精确科学本身是如何从前科学起源中产生的。现象学本身就是一门科学。它的行为不像自然科学的数学科学，但它有自己的精确形式，这与自然科学的数学、理想化的精确不同。除其他外，它是一门关于科学本身的科学。它也是一门生活世界的科学，它试图展示生活世界如何作为数学科学的基础和语境。</p><p>Phenomenology claims that the exact, mathematical sciences of nature cannot account for their own existence. They do not have the terms and concepts to handle such things as perception, remembering, the experience of other minds, and the like. Phenomenology claims that it can provide the concepts and analyses that will clarify how the exact sciences themselves arise from pre scientific origins. Phenomenology presents itself as a science in its own right; it does not behave like the mathematical sciences of nature, but it has its own form of precision, which is unlike the mathematical, idealized precision of natural science. It is, among other things, a science about science itself. It is also a science of the life world, and it tries to show how the life world serves as a foundation and a context for mathematical sciences.</p>

  <p>本世纪物理学和数学的发展对自然科学的准确性提出了质疑。量子论、相对论、数学中的不完备性定理、非线性系统、混沌理论和模糊逻辑中的测量不确定性和观察者相关性等发现，对牛顿物理学和现代科学中对世界的相当清晰的理解提出了质疑。现象学早期盛行的科学和数学。然而，这些发展并不影响生活世界和科学的问题。所有这些发展都发生在科学世界观的范围内，即使有了它们，科学世界观仍然与我们自发体验的世界不一致。较新的科学版本可能容忍不精确，但他们所描述的与我们生活的世界仍然不同，将他们融入那个世界的问题还没有解决。对其决议的一个重要贡献在于仔细分析在建立科学知识过程中起作用的各种意向性。</p><p>Developments in physics and mathematics in this century have raised questions about the exactness of the natural sciences. Such discoveries as indeterminacy of measurement and observer relatedness in quantum theory, relativity theory, the incompleteness theorem in mathematics, nonlinear systems, chaos theory, and fuzzy logic have cast doubt on the rather tidy understanding of the world that was present in Newtonian physics and the science and mathematics that prevailed during the early years of phenomenology. However, these developments do not affect the problem of the life world and science. All these developments have occurred within the scientific view of the world, which even with them still remains at odds with the world of our spontaneous experience. The newer versions of science may tolerate imprecision, but what they describe is still different from the world in which we live, and the problem of integrating them into that world has not been dissolved. An important contribution to its resolution would lie in the careful analysis of the kinds of intentionalities at work in establishing scientific knowledge.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_10.xhtml.heading_id_6"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_10.xhtml.ch10_iwhc"></a>主体间性：一个共同的世界</h2><h2><a></a>INTERSUBJECTIVITY: A WORLD HELD IN COMMON</h2>

  <p>现象学的许多词汇和论证可能给人这样的印象，即它是一种转向唯我论的哲学形式。通过谈论先验自我、意识的时间流和还原，现象学似乎忽略了其他人和社区的存在和在场。一些现象学的批评者抱怨说，它将其他人简化为纯粹的现象，并使孤独的自我成为唯一的现实。这种抱怨是没有根据的。现象学对人类社区有很多话要说，它提供了对我们对其他思想的体验的广泛描述。</p><p>Much of the vocabulary and argument of phenomenology may give the impression that it is a form of philosophy that veers toward solipsism. With its talk about the transcendental ego, the temporal stream of consciousness, and the reduction, phenomenology may seem to neglect the existence and the presence of other persons and communities. Some critics of phenomenology complain that it reduces other persons to mere phenomena and makes the solitary ego the only reality. Such complaints are unfounded. Phenomenology has a lot to say about human community, and it provides an extensive description of our experience of other minds.</p>

  <p>有两种方法来描述我们对他人的体验。首先，我们可以简单地描述我们如何直接体验其他人，我们如何将其他身体视为我们自己的思想和自我的体现。其次，我们可能会采取更间接的方式，将我们如何体验世界和其中的事物描述为其他思想和其他自我也在体验。在第二种方法中，我们不看自己与他人之间的直接关系，而是看我们自己或我们所有人与世界和我们共有的事物之间的关系。让我们从第二种方法开始。</p><p>There are two approaches to the description of our experience of others. First, we might simply describe how we directly experience other persons, how we recognize other bodies as the embodiment of minds and selves like our own. Secondly, we might take a more indirect route and describe how we experience the world and things in it as being also experienced by other minds and other selves. In this second approach, we do not look at the direct relation between ourselves and others, but at the relation both of us, or all of us, have to the world and the things we possess in common. Let us begin with the second approach.</p>

  <p>当我体验到一个物体时，比如一个立方体，我会在多个方面、方面和轮廓中将其识别为一个身份。流形是动态的；无论我在任何时候对立方体有什么看法，我都可以移动自己或立方体，并产生新的侧面、方面和轮廓流。看到的变成看不见的，看不见的变成看到的，立方体自始至终保持原样。在任何时候，我都会预测并回忆我的未来和过去对事物的看法。这些其他观点都是硬币，因为我喜欢现在给我的观点。我的经验是实际和潜在的混合体：每当给出某些方面或方面时，我都会倾向于那些不存在但如果我改变我的立场、观点、感知能力等就可以给出的方面。</p><p>When I experience a bodily object, such as a cube, I recognize it as an identity in a manifold of sides, aspects, and profiles. The manifold is dynamic; whatever perspective I may have on the cube at any moment, I can move myself or the cube and generate a new flow of sides, aspects, and profiles. What was seen becomes unseen, what was unseen becomes seen, and the cube remains itself throughout. At any moment I anticipate and recall my future and my past views of the thing. These other views are coin tended as I enjoy the view that is given to me now. My experience is a mixture of the actual and potential: whenever certain sides or aspects are given, I coin tend those that are not but that could be given if I were to change my position, perspective, ability to perceive, and the like.</p>

  <p>当其他感知者发挥作用时，实际和潜在的混合会得到加强。如果有其他人在场，那么我就会意识到，当我从这一边看这个物​​体​​时，其他人实际上是从另一个角度看的，如果我走到他们所在的地方，我就会拥有这个角度。对我来说有潜力的东西对他们来说是实际的。对象因此对我具有更大的超越性：它不仅是我所看到的和能够看到的，而且是他们此时此刻所看到的。此外，我欣赏这个对象如此超越我自己的观点：我看到它恰恰是别人看到的，而不仅仅是我看到的。它的那个级别的身份是给我的。客体是或可以是主体间的，并且它是这样呈现给我的。</p><p>The mixture of actual and potential is heightened when other perceivers come into play. If others are present, then I realize that when I see the object from this side, the others do actually see it from some other angle, an angle that I would possess if I were to move to where they are. What is potential for me is actual for them. The object therefore takes on a greater transcendence to me: it is not only what I see and could see, but also what they see at this moment. Furthermore, I appreciate the object as so transcending my own viewpoint: I see it precisely as being seen by others and not just by me. That level of its identity is given to me. The object is or can be given intersubjectively, and it is presented to me as such.</p>

  <p>物体在感官层面上被许多观众、听众、品尝者、嗅觉者和触觉者感知的能力，但物体也可以被许多人明确表达，而不仅仅是我自己。它可以在许多伪装下被理解和思考。我可能知道琼斯先生是邮局职员，但琼斯夫人知道他是她的丈夫，而且我知道邮局职员也被其他人以其他形式描述和熟人所熟知。我无法表述一个对象可以被知道的所有方式：我所拥有的任何熟人都必然是有限的。尽管如此，我知道对象是可知的，即使是以我无法知道的形式。我认识到它对我的这种超越程度，它对我的​​缺席程度。无论是在感性层面还是智力层面，世界和其中的事物被赋予了许多自我，许多表现形式，尽管我总是以最杰出的人，中心的人和对我来说是问题的人的身份出现，而不是其他人或其他人可能是，无论他们多么亲近。我对自己的突出是先验逻辑的必然，而不是道德自我中心的问题。有些人可能离我更近，而另一些人可能更远，但是接近的维度并不是因为我被给予自己的方式而产生的。不是道德上以自我为中心的问题。有些人可能离我更近，而另一些人可能更远，但是接近的维度并不是因为我被给予自己的方式而产生的。不是道德上以自我为中心的问题。有些人可能离我更近，而另一些人可能更远，但是接近的维度并不是因为我被给予自己的方式而产生的。</p><p>The ability of the object to be given perceptually to many viewers, hearers, tasters, smellers, and touchers takes place on a sensory level, but the object can also be categorially articulated by many people and not just by myself. It can be understood and thought about under many guises. I may know Mr. Jones as the post office clerk, but Mrs. Jones knows him as her husband, and I know the post office clerk as also known by others under other forms of description and acquaintance. I am not able to formulate all the ways an object can be known: any acquaintance I have is bound to be limited. Still, I know the object as knowable even in forms I cannot know. I recognize this level of its transcendence to me, this level of the absence that it has to me. Both on the perceptual and the intellectual level, the world and things in it are given to many selves, many datives of manifestation, even though I will always show up for myself as the preeminent one, the one at the center and the one who is an issue for me in a way that no other or others could be, however dear and close they might be. My prominence to myself is a necessity in transcendental logic, not a matter of moral self-centeredness. Some people may be personally closer to me and others may be farther, but the very dimension of proximity does not arise for the way I am given to myself.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_10.xhtml.heading_id_7"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_10.xhtml.ch10_iko"></a>交互主观性：认识对方</h2><h2><a></a>INTERSUBJECTIVITY: KNOWING THE OTHER</h2>

  <p>到目前为止，我们对主体间性的讨论都集中在我们认为被他人和我们自己体验的客体上。现在让我们对我们将他人作为其他思想、其他意识体现的直接体验做一些评论。我们不仅欣赏给予他人的世界；我们也可以转向这些其他人，并像我们自己一样体验他们，作为披露的参与者，他们可以回报我们的认可，并将我们视为他们自己。</p><p>So far, our discussion of intersubjectivity has focused on objects that we see as being experienced by others as well as ourselves. Let us now make some comments about our direct experience of others as other minds, other embodiments of consciousness. We not only appreciate the world as given to others; we can also turn toward these others and experience them as like ourselves, as datives of disclosure, who can reciprocate our recognition and see us as like themselves.</p>

  <p>另一个自我的体验是基于另一个身体的体验，就像我们自己的身体一样。我们不仅仅知道另一个人的想法；我们首先得到身体，但身体是作为另一个人的意识占据主导地位的地方而给予的。正如我可以移动和体验自己的身体一样，我认为与我相似的另一个人也可以移动和体验他的身体。此外，那个身体不仅为其他意识提供了一个地方，也为其他观点提供了一个位置。它还表达了对方的想法。口头语言、有意的手势和不经意的肢体语言都不仅仅是肢体动作；它们表示有意的行为，也表达了思想的内容。他们向我表达了世界和其中的事物对于拥有它的人来说是怎样的。</p><p>The experience of another self is based on the experience of another body as like our own. We do not know just the mind of another; we have the body given first, but the body is given as a place in which the consciousness of the other holds sway. Just as I can move and experience my own body, so can the other, whom I recognize as being like me, move and experience his. That body, furthermore, does not just provide a place for the other consciousness and a location for the other point of view. It also expresses the mind of the other. The spoken language, the intentional gestures, and the indeliberate body language all are more than just bodily motions; they signal intentional acts, and they also express a content of thought. They express to me how the world and the things in it seem to be to the one whose body it is. If the other person utters certain sounds or makes certain grimaces, I can be told that "Trouble is coming" or "Don't give up now".</p>

  <p>因此，某些身体在世界上脱颖而出，表达了意义（手臂的运动不仅仅是一个机械过程，而是一种敬礼，挥手是一种解雇，而不仅仅是一个动作）。这些身体也能够向我传达世界是怎样的：它们提供了关于事物本来面目的其他观点。他们体现了其他先验的自我。我将它们视为像我自己一样的自我身体，但在这样做的过程中，我恰恰将它们视为包围和表达一种我永远缺席的有意识的生活，一种与我自己的时间流不可简化地不同的时间流。其他自我的独特缺席呈现在我面前。这是一种不同于立方体另一面的缺失或我还无法破译的文本含义的缺失。</p><p>Thus, certain bodies stand out in the world as expressive of meaning (a movement of an arm is not just a mechanical process but a salute, a wave of the hand is a dismissal and not just a motion). These bodies are also capable of conveying to me how the world is: they provide other viewpoints on the way things are. They embody other transcendental egos. I perceive them as the bodies of selves like myself, but in doing so I perceive them precisely as enclosing and expressing a conscious life that will always remain absent to me, a stream of temporality irreducibly different from my own. The distinctive absence of other selves is presented to me. It is a kind of absence different from the absences of the other side of the cube or the meaning of a text that I cannot yet decipher.</p>

  <p>现象学中比较有争议的教义之一是，我们有可能在原则上“考虑”主体间性维度，并在我们自己的经验中降到一个先于主体间性或处于主体间性之下的水平。这就是所谓的&nbsp;<em>属于自己的领域</em>. 减少到这个领域与想象一个实际的孤独是不同的；这不像想象我独自一人在某个地方，甚至所有其他人都从地球上消失而我是唯一剩下的人。这样的想象场景，依然会保留着他人的维度；事实上，他们只会消灭其他人。归约到所有权的领域试图消除其他人的维度。它试图达到一种体验水平，在这种水平上，我和他人之间的对比不会出现。</p><p>One of the more controversial teachings in phenomenology is that it is possible for us to "think away" the intersubjective dimension in principle, and to get down to a level in our own experience that precedes or underlies the intersubjective. This is the so-called&nbsp;<em>sphere of ownness</em>. The reduction to this sphere is not the same as imagining a factual solitude; it is not like imagining that I am alone somewhere or even that all other human beings have vanished from the earth and I am the only one left. Such imaginary scenarios would still retain the dimension of other people; they would simply eliminate the others as a matter of fact. The reduction to the sphere of ownness attempts to eliminate the very dimension of other persons. It attempts to reach a level of experiencing in which the very contrast between myself and others does not arise.</p>

  <p>评论家们经常批评胡塞尔引入了所有权领域的概念；他们声称这样一个领域是不可想象的，因为我们所拥有的任何经验原则上都必须具有基本的公共性。然而，我们不应该很快就否定这个学说。当然，我们几乎所有的体验都涉及其他思想的维度，一种可以与他人分享的意义，并且通过与他人的对比来定义。但我们不应该排除这样一种观念，即我们意识的某些方面具有一种极端的隐私，在这种隐私中，其他人的感觉不会发挥作用。可能存在某种程度的体验，原则上无法向他人表达或与他人分享，这是一个其他人的感觉不会侵入的领域。清楚地，如此强烈的隐私不可能是我们体验的全部，也不可能是其中的主要部分，但我们意识中的终极秘密可能会有一丝触动。为什么要完全否定这样的维度呢？如果存在这样一个领域，那么就值得探索，以表明在其中可能存在什么样的同一性与差异性、存在与不存在以及多种多样的统一性。</p><p>Commentators have often criticized Husserl for introducing the concept of the sphere of ownness; they claim that such a domain is unthinkable, because any experience we have must in principle have a rudimentary publicness. However, we should not be too quick to dismiss this doctrine. Certainly, almost all our experiencing involves a dimension of other minds, a meaning that could be shared with others and that is defined by being in contrast with others. But we should not rule out of court the notion that some aspect of our consciousness has a kind of extreme privacy in which the very sense of others does not come into play. There may be a level of experiencing that is, in principle, not capable of being expressed to or shared with others, a domain in which the very sense of others does not intrude. Clearly, such an intense privacy could not be the whole of our experience, nor could it be a major part of it, but there may be a slight touch of the ultimately secret in our awareness. Why should such a dimension be wholly denied? And if there is such a domain, it would deserve exploration to show what sort of identities and differences, presences and absences, and unities in manifold are possible within it.</p>

  <p>然而，我们应该强调的是，这种向自有领域的还原不同于先验还原，即从自然态度到现象学反思的转变。这是哲学态度中的一个举动，揭示了先验自我所经历的不同层次的体验。</p><p>We should emphasize, however, that this reduction to the sphere of ownness is not the same as the transcendental reduction, the move from the natural attitude to phenomenological reflection. It is a move within the philosophical attitude, uncovering various levels of experience undergone by the transcendental ego.</p>

  <p>先验自我是真理的代理人。它在许多情况下行使这个机构：演讲、想象、回忆、实际行为、政治修辞、巧妙的欺骗和战略演习。一种行使真实力量的特殊方式出现在科学中，无论科学是经验性的还是理论性的，也无论它关注的是存在的一个区域还是另一个区域。在科学中，我们只是希望找到事物的真相；科学事业只是试图展示事物的本来面目，而不是它们可以如何使用或我们希望它们成为什么样的样子。科学上的成功并不意味着战胜其他人或满足我们的各种欲望；它纯粹而简单地意味着客观性的胜利，即揭示事物的本来面目。</p><p>The transcendental ego is the agent of truth. It exercises this agency in many contexts: in speech, picturing, reminiscence, practical conduct, political rhetoric, clever deception, and strategic maneuvers. A special way of exercising the power to be truthful occurs in science, whether the science is empirical or theoretic, and whether it is focused on one region of being or another. In science, we wish simply to find the truth of things; the scientific enterprise is an attempt just to show the way things are, apart from how they can be used or how we might wish them to be. Success in science does not mean victory over other people or the gratification of our various desires; it means purely and simply the triumph of objectivity, the disclosure of how things are.</p>

  <p>哲学是一种科学努力，但它不同于数学以及自然科学和社会科学。它关注的不是存在的特定区域，而是真实性本身：人类的谈话，人类试图揭示事物本来面目的尝试，以及人类根据事物的本质行事的能力；最终，它关注的是它向我们展示的存在。在科学和哲学中，我们为了真理本身而寻求真理，而不考虑它可能带来的任何其他好处。在这两种努力中，我们都试图达到适合手头问题的最高精确度；我们不满足于仅仅足以完成一项特定工作。</p><p>Philosophy is a scientific effort, but it is different from mathematics and the natural and social sciences; it is concerned not with a particular region of being, but with truthfulness as such: with the human conversation, the human attempt to disclose the way things are, and the human ability to act in accordance with the nature of things; ultimately, it is concerned with being as it manifests itself to us. In science and philosophy we seek truth for its own sake, apart from any other benefit it might bring. In both endeavors we try to reach the highest degree of exactness appropriate to the matter at hand; we are not satisfied by what is just enough to get a particular job done.</p>

  <p>在本书中，我们已经检验了真实的许多要素。我们已经研究了流形中的同一性、范畴表达以及感知和记忆等事物之间的差异。我们已经探讨了存在的真实性和披露代理人的真实性（以及随之而来的可能的谎言和混乱）。在本章中，我们将巩固和完成这些探索。我们将研究理性现象学，理性思维分析。</p><p>We have, in this book, examined many ingredients of truthfulness. We have examined identity in manifolds, categorial articulation, and differences between things like perceiving and remembering. We have explored both the truthfulness of being and the veracity of the agent of disclosure (along with the possible mendacity and confusion that come in their train). In the present chapter, we will consolidate and complete these explorations. We will investigate the phenomenology of reason, the analysis of rational thinking.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_11.xhtml.heading_id_3"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_11.xhtml.ch11_lrim"></a>理性的生活和意义的同一性</h2><h2><a></a>THE LIFE OF REASON AND THE IDENTITY OF MEANING</h2>

  <p>当我们进行推理时，我们将自己提升到生理和心理生活之外。我们过着思考的生活。这意味着我们，这些特殊的生物，我们这些动物，能够对事物的真实性提出主张。我们可以证实或证伪这样的主张，我们可以交换意义，我们可以赞美或指责彼此是更好或更差的真理代理人。当我们彼此交谈并追求理性生活时，我们变得能够掌握多种类型的缺席，并以极其复杂的方式表达存在。</p><p>When we enter into reasoning, we lift ourselves beyond our biological and psychological life. We live the life of thinking. This means that we, these particular beings, these animals that we are, become able to make claims about the truth of things. We can verify or falsify such claims, we can exchange meanings, and we can praise or blame one another for having been better or worse agents of truth. As we speak with one another and pursue the rational life, we become able to master absences of many kinds and articulate presences in extremely complex ways.</p>

  <p>这种生活的要求之一是我们在自己之间交流并在我们自己的精神生活中反复返回的意义的相同性。一个单一的命题一遍又一遍地返回相同的相同：我们将它告诉其他人，引用它作为别人已经说过的，将它用作前提，在我们的经验中证实或否定它，将它置于系统的阐述中一个科学领域，或者把它写下来，这样即使我们不再在那里谈论它也可以阅读。甚至在人们可能给出意义的不同解释中，以及在不同的头脑中可能对命题的模糊性和清晰性的差异中，意义的相同性也会发生。除非是同一个陈述，否则我们根本无法将这种差异视为差异；<em>如果命题</em>本身是不同的，那么解释就不同了，除非意义的核心在其模糊状态和不同状态之间保持相同，否则我们不能说具有模糊的意义。的确，有时候，当我们更仔细地思考一个意义或命题时，它可能会分裂成两种或多种意义，或者它可能会崩溃，变得不连贯，完全没有意义，但意义领域的这种分裂只有在与在其身份中持续和确认的意义形成对比。</p><p>One of the requirements for this kind of life is the sameness of a meaning that we communicate among ourselves and come back to repeatedly in our own mental life. A single proposition returns as identically the same over and over again: we tell it to other people, quote it as having been stated by someone else, use it as a premise, confirm or disconfirm it in our experience, place it within a systematic exposition of a scientific field, or write it down so that it can be read even when we are no longer there to speak it. The sameness of a meaning occurs even across the different interpretations people might give the meaning, and across the differences in vagueness and distinctness the proposition might enjoy in various minds. Unless it were one and the same statement, we could not see such differences as being differences at all; we could not have many <em>interpretations</em> if the propositions were themselves different, and we could not speak of a vague possession of a meaning unless a core of sense remained the same between its vague and its distinct states. Sometimes, it is true, a meaning or proposition may fall apart into two or more senses when we think it through more carefully, or it may crumble into incoherence, into no sense at all, but such disintegrations in the realm of meaning are possible only in contrast with meanings that are sustained and confirmed in their identity.</p>

  <p>含义特别是用文字来表达。通过语言，我们有可能表达事物的本来面目，并在其他地方和其他时间将这种表达方式传达给其他人和我们自己。我们交换的词语捕捉到了事物在我们看来的方式，如果我们在披露方面具有权威性，它们就捕捉到了事物的本来面目。同时，这些文字带有我们披露相关事物的风格，因此它们也向读者或听众表明了一些关于我们自己的事情。</p><p>Meanings are presented especially in words. Through language it becomes possible for us to express the way things are and to convey this mode of presentation to other people and to ourselves at other places and other times. The words we exchange capture the way things have appeared to us, and if we are authoritative in our disclosures they capture the way things are. At the same time, the words are flavored by the style with which we have disclosed the things in question, so they indicate to the reader or listener something about ourselves as well.</p>

  <p>物理学家和数学家并不担心一个命题可以一次又一次地返回相同的事实，即使如果不发生这种重复，物理学和数学就不可能存在。然而，哲学家们不能让这种认同溜走。他们认为这是我们过理性生活的能力的组成部分。</p><p>Physicists and mathematicians do not worry about the fact that a proposition can return over and over again as identically the same, even though physics and mathematics would not be possible if such recurrence did not take place. Philosophers, however, cannot let such identification slip past them; it is the kind of thing they think about as an ingredient in our ability to live the life of reason.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_11.xhtml.heading_id_4"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_11.xhtml.ch11_tkt"></a>两种真理</h2><h2><a></a>TWO KINDS OF TRUTH</h2>

  <p>意义的同一性使真理成为可能。在我们的理性生活中有两种真理：正确的真理和揭露的真理。</p><p>The identity of meaning makes truth possible. There are two kinds of truth that occur in our rational life: the truth of correctness and the truth of disclosure.</p>

  <p>1.<em>正确的真理</em>，我们从发表声明或提出建议开始。然后我们继续验证该说法是否属实。我们进行任何需要的体验，作为对陈述的确认或否定。如果有人说下雨天阳台屋顶漏水，我们等下雨再看屋顶漏不漏水。如果有人提出有关某种化学反应或医学治疗的建议，我们会进行适当的实验以确认或否定该主张。如果结果证实了断言，我们可以说该陈述是正确的，因为它确实表达了事物的本来面目。这是正确的说法。与正确性真理相关的虚假感是显而易见的：它是与事物的本来面目背道而驰的主张的虚假性，</p><p>1. In the <em>truth of correctness</em>, we begin with a statement being made or a proposition being held. We then go on to verify whether the claim is true. We carry out whatever kind of experiencing is needed as a confirmation or a disconfirmation of the statement. If someone says that the porch roof leaks when it rains, we wait until it rains and then see whether or not the roof leaks. If someone makes a proposal dealing with a certain chemical reaction or medical treatment, we carry out the appropriate experiments to confirm or disconfirm the claim. If the results confirm the assertion, we can say that the statement is true because it does express the way things are. It is a correct statement. The sense of falsity that is correlated with the truth of correctness is obvious: it is the falsity of claims that run counter to the way things are, claims that are resisted by the manifestation of things.</p>

  <p>2. 有一种更基本的真理形式甚至可以在断言的确认之外出现。这第二种真实感，<em>揭露真相</em>，简直就是一种状态的展示。它是一个可理解对象对我们的简单呈现，是真实或实际事物的表现。在我们的正常体验和感知过程中，这种存在可能会立即发生：我们走向汽车，惊讶地发现轮胎没气了。我们不必一直预料轮胎会漏气；我们对它的经验，如理性、真理和证据，并不是要证实或否定我们一直在接受的命题。我们处理的不是正确性的真相，而是简单披露的更基本的真相。一个可理解的对象，一种事态，呈现给我们，对象或情况只是展开。我们对一种新的数学关系感到惊讶，我们突然意识到约翰在骗詹姆斯，我们明白为什么塞尚会按照他在这幅画中的方式安排颜色和线条。此类演示不是确认，而是直接显示。与这种真实相关的虚假是当表象误导时发生的那种虚假，当事物似乎是它们不是的东西时：傻瓜的黄金、伪装、伪造、不真实的虚假、与真实相反的虚假未能说出真相。</p><p>2. There is a more elementary form of truth that can occur even apart from the confirmation of a claim. This second sense of truth, the <em>truth of disclosure</em>, is simply the display of a state of affairs. It is the simple presencing to us of an intelligible object, the manifestation of what is real or actual. Such a presence could occur immediately during our normal experience and perception: we walk up to the car and are surprised to see that the tire is flat. We need not have been anticipating the tire as flat; our experience of it as such Reason, Truth, and Evidence is not an attempt to confirm or disconfirm a proposition that we have been entertaining. We are dealing not with the truth of correctness, but with the more elementary truth of simple disclosure. An intelligible object, a state of affairs, is presented to us, the object or the situation simply unfolds. We are surprised by a new mathematical relationship, we suddenly realize that John is lying to James, we see why Cézanne arranged the colors and lines the way he did in this particular painting. Such presentations are not confirmations but direct displays. The falsity correlated with this kind of truth is the kind that occurs when appearances mislead, when things seem to be something that they are not: fool's gold, camouflage, the counterfeit, the falsity of the inauthentic, the failure to be genuine as opposed to the failure to tell the truth.</p>

  <p>正确的真相取决于披露的真相；后者可以作为确认或否定一个主张的可理解性。真命题“匹配”、融合或衡量的不是惰性实体，而是被揭示的事物。命题声明被取消引用以支持直接显示，这被认为可以与正在调查其真实性的声明相鉴别。正如我们在第 7 章中所见，我们的经验始于对事态、可理解的范畴对象的直接展示。此显示涉及披露的真相。当我们变得足够成熟以将某些事态视为仅由某人提出时，命题域就会发挥作用；它们变成了“提议的事态”，它们变成了命题、主张、或判断，它们变成了感觉或意义。正是这些命题，这些被提议的事态，成为正确性真理的候选者，当它们被视为与所给定的东西融合时，它们就获得了这样的真理，再一次，在揭示的真理中。因此，披露的真相与正确性的真相相辅相成。它来之前和之后。</p><p>The truth of correctness depends on the truth of disclosure; the latter can serve as the intelligibility that confirms or disconfirms a claim. What the true proposition "matches" or blends with or is measured by is not an inert entity, but a thing being disclosed. The propositional claim is disquoted in favor of a direct display, which is recognized as being identifiable with the claim whose truth was being investigated. As we have seen in Chapter 7, our experience begins with the direct display of states of affairs, of intelligible, categorial objects. This display involves the truth of disclosure. The domain of the propositional comes into play when we become sophisticated enough to take some states of affairs as being merely proposed by someone; they become "states of affairs as proposed", they become propositions, claims, or judgments, they become senses or meanings. It is these propositions, these states of affairs as proposed, that become candidates for the truth of correctness, and they acquire such truth when they are seen to blend with what is given, once again, in the truth of disclosure. The truth of disclosure, therefore, flanks the truth of correctness. It comes before and after.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_11.xhtml.heading_id_5"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_11.xhtml.ch11_tke"></a>两种证据</h2><h2><a></a>TWO KINDS OF EVIDENCE</h2>

  <p>在我们已经区分的两种真理中，谓词“真”要么适用于命题，要么适用于显示的实体或事态。我们必须引入另一个术语，即<em>证据</em>一词，以命名产生真理的主观活动。现象学使用术语“证据”来命名主观成就，即真理的主观拥有，无论是对应还是披露。作为 noesis 的证据与作为 noema 的真理相关联。</p><p>In the two kinds of truth that we have distinguished, the predicate "true" applies either to a proposition or to a displayed entity or state of affairs. We must introduce another term, the word <em>evidence</em>, to name the subjective activities that bring truth about. Phenomenology uses the term "evidence" to name the subjective achievement, the subjective having of truth, whether in correspondence or disclosure. Evidence as noesis is correlated with truth as noema.</p>

  <p>“证据”一词的这种用法在英语中并不常见。（在德语和法语中没那么奇怪。） 通常，英语中的“证据”并不表示主观成就；相反，它的意思是用于证明主张的事实或数据。证据可能是脚印、带血的手套、证人的证词或文件，但在所有情况下，它都是客观的，某种东西，用于证明其他事物。在正常的英语用法中，证据就像建立结论的前提，而不像揭示对象的意向性。当这个词被用作形容词时，它几乎总是谓语出现的对象，然后说它生动而清晰地出现：明显的胜利，明显的计划，明显的欺骗。</p><p>This usage of the word "evidence" is unusual in English. (It is less strange in German and French.) Normally, "evidence" in English does not mean a subjective achievement; it means, rather, a fact or a datum that serves to prove a claim. Evidence might be a footprint, a bloody glove, a testimony given by a witness, or a document, but in every case it is something objective, a thing of some sort, that is used to prove something else. In normal English usage, a piece of evidence is like a premise that establishes a conclusion, not like an intentionality that discloses an object. When the term is used as an adjective, it is almost always predicated of the object that appears, which then is said to appear vividly and clearly: an evident victory, an evident scheme, an evident deception.</p>

  <p>然而，在现象学中，“证据”具有动词形式“证据”的含义。它是真理的产生，是临在的产生。这是一种表现，也是一种成就。证据是在多种情况下呈现身份的活动、事态的表述或命题的验证。这是真理的实现。</p><p>In phenomenology, however, "evidence" takes on the sense of the verbal form, "evidencing". It is the bringing about of truth, the bringing forth of a presence. It is a performance and an achievement. Evidence is the activity of presenting an identity in a manifold, the articulation of a state of affairs, or the verification of a proposition. It is the achieving of truth.</p>

  <p>“证据”在字典中有一些含义接近于现象学赋予该词的含义。牛津<em>英语词典</em>说“证据”可以作名词，有“证人”的意思：几个人可以说是一个案件中的“证据”，可以说出事情经过的人。可以说，某人已经“翻国家的证据”，即他已经决定对某一事件进行见证。甚至还有一个过时的英文名词“evidencer”，意为见证人：“An evidence of the deed”。此外，该词还可以用作及物动词，意思是“使某事明显或清楚，清楚地表明，表明某事”。因此，我们可能会说，“他证明了该计划是徒劳的”，或者“她的话证明了他们所处的情况”。这些含义，虽然古老而稀有，但更像是“证据”的意思 在现象学中，但即使是它们也没有为我们提供哲学用法的明显先例。我们必须通过使用这个词的方式来表达它应该命名的现象，从而使含义清晰。</p><p>There are some dictionary meanings of "evidence" that come close to the meaning that phenomenology gives to the word. The <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em> says that "evidence" can be used as a noun with the sense of a "witness": several persons could be said to be "evidences" in a case, people who can disclose what happened. We can say that someone has "turned state's evidence", that is, he has decided to bear witness to an event. There is even an obsolete English noun "evidencer", which signifies someone who bears witness: "An evidencer of the deed". Also, the word can be used as a transitive verb, and then it means "to make something evident or clear, to show clearly, to manifest something". Thus, we might say, "He evidenced the futility of the plan", or "Her words evidenced the situation they were in". These meanings, though old and rare, are a little more like the sense of "evidence" in phenomenology, but even they do not give us an obvious precedent for the philosophical usage. We will have to make the meaning clear by using the word in ways that will bring out the phenomenon it is supposed to name.</p>

  <p>证据是对可理解对象的成功呈现，是对某些事物的成功呈现，其真实性在证据本身中变得显而易见。这样的介绍是理性生活中的一个值得注意的事件。这是某物进入理性空间、可理解性世界的时刻。这样的事件不仅仅是实现它的主体的完美；它不仅仅让明白要点或看到正在发生的事情的人变得完美。它也是对象的完美；对象被显化和被知道，它揭示了自己。它的真理被实现了。这是有据可查的。当海德格尔用一个相当诗意的比喻称人或<em>此在时</em>，“存在的牧羊人”，他的意思是我们是可以向其揭示事物真实性的人，并且我们在事物的计划中占有特权地位，因为我们是表现的与格。我们证明事情。我们让他们出现。</p><p>Evidence is the successful presentation of an intelligible object, the successful presentation of something whose truth becomes manifest in the evidencing itself. Such presentation is a notable event in the life of reason. It is the moment when something enters into the space of reasons, the world of intelligibilities. Such an event is not just a perfection of the subject who achieves it; it does not perfect only the person who gets the point or sees what is going on. It is also a perfection in the object; the object is manifested and known, it discloses itself. Its truth is actualized. It is evidenced. When Heidegger uses a rather poetic trope and calls man, or <em>Dasein</em>, the "shepherd of being", he means that we are the ones to whom things can be disclosed in their truthfulness, and that we hold a privileged place in the scheme of things because we are datives of manifestation. We evidence things. We let them appear.</p>

  <p>我们必须这样做的力量不是我们制定的某些计划的结果，也不是政府资助项目的结果，也不是我们可能试图培养的人才；它甚至在我们开始做出选择或考虑我们应该做什么之前就来自于我们的本来面目。它来自我们的存在方式。它允许我们深思熟虑和选择。我们的谈话不只是我们之间的喋喋不休；如果我们摆脱含糊不清的迷雾，事情也会在我们所说的话中暴露出来。我们提供一盏灯，事物可以在其中展现自己，提供一片可以收集和回忆事物的空地。尽管我们在事物的发展过程中只占据了很小的空间和时间，即使在遥远的未来某一天，爆炸的太阳可能会吞噬所有行星，包括我们自己的行星，但在我们的理性生活中，一些美好而重要的事情发生了。这种活动是我们作为先验自我的成就，而不仅仅是我们作为动物的行为或我们作为嵌入物质原因网络的身体的反应。理性之光打开了理性的空间，目的的王国。我们作为显现的与格是真实的，我们这样做是为了证明事物的真实性。</p><p>The power we have to do so is not the outcome of some plan we contrive, or the result of a government-funded project, or a talent we might try to develop; it comes from what we are even before we begin to make choices or deliberate about what we should do. It comes from our way of being. It allows us to deliberate and choose. Our speech is not just chatter among ourselves; it is also, if we escape the mist of vagueness, the disclosure of things, which come to light in what we say. We provide a light within which things can manifest themselves, a clearing where they can be collected and recollected. Something good and important happens in our life of reason, even though we occupy only a small space and time in the development of things, and even though the exploding sun may, some day in the remote future, consume all the planets including our own. This activity is our achievement as transcendental egos, not simply our behavior as animals or our reaction as bodies embedded in a network of material causes. The light of reason opens up the space of reasons, the kingdom of ends. We are real as datives of manifestation, and what we do as such is to evidence the truth of things.</p>

  <p>为什么我们要用“证据”一词来命名这一成就？为什么不用别的词呢？一个原因是该术语在现象学中具有技术意义，在德语和法语中，这种含义更为自然。此外，这个词确实抓住了一个现象：它表达了这样一个事实，即当事物出现时我们是活跃的。当可理解的对象呈现给我们时，我们<em>就会做某事；</em>我们不仅仅是接受者。我们不仅是与格，还是披露的主格（<em>ego</em>，而不仅仅是<em>mihi</em>). 诸如“直觉”、“感知”或“记录”之类的其他词似乎让我们过于被动地接受出现的事物。“证据”更清楚地表明，如果要给予事物，我们必须作为先验的自我来行动。这种行为在范畴活动的情况下最为明显，但即使在知觉中也需要它，在其理解的初始阶段，并且在想象、记忆和深思熟虑中显然需要它。英语术语“insight”是一个很好的等价词，尽管它不能用作动词，但它似乎仅限于范畴表述；“证据”的范围更广。不仅演讲者和科学家，而且画家和戏剧家及其听众都可以证明事物的本来面目。此外，“洞察力”</p><p>Why should we strain to adapt the term "evidence" to name this achievement? Why not use some other word? One reason is that the term has a technical sense in phenomenology, in both German and French, where this meaning is more natural. In addition, the word does capture a phenomenon: it expresses the fact that we are active when things present themselves. We <em>do</em> something when intelligible objects present themselves to us; we are not mere recipients. We are not only datives, but also nominatives of disclosure (<em>ego</em>, and not just <em>mihi</em>). Other words like "intuit", "perceive", or "register" seem to make us too passive in accepting what appears. "Evidencing" makes it more clear that we must act as transcendental egos if things are to be given. Such action is most obvious in the case of categorial activity, but it is needed even in perception, with its initial stages of intelligibility, and it is obviously required in picturing, reminiscence, and deliberation. The English term "insight" is a good equivalent, even though it cannot be used as a verb, but it does seem limited to categorial presentation; "evidencing" ranges more widely. Not only speakers and scientists, but also painters and dramatists and their audiences can evidence the way things are. Furthermore, "insight" connotes an action that is accomplished once and for all, while "evidencing" has the sense of continuing and reinforcing itself beyond the initial moment.</p>

  <p>那么，我们以两种方式证明：正确性的真实性和披露的真实性。我们通过观察事物的情况并反引用我们开始验证的断言来证明命题的正确性。然而，更根本的是，当我们实现揭示的真相时，我们通过在其直接存在下阐明它来证明一个可理解的对象。我们看到偶数的平方是偶数，奇数的平方是奇数；我们看到嫉妒与嫉妒不同；我们看到三维空间中只有五个规则的固体。这些都是事实、可理解的对象，我们将它们记录为真实：我们在它们的可理解性中展示它们。他们是理解。我们可能想进一步解释它们并寻找它们为真的原因，但是寻求进一步的理解并不会取消原始证据中给出的初步理解。证据将事物纳入原因空间。</p><p>We evidence, then, in two ways: in the truth of correctness and in the truth of disclosure. We evidence the correctness of a proposition by seeing how the things are and disquoting the assertion we set out to verify. More fundamentally, however, we evidence an intelligible object by articulating it in its direct presence, when we achieve the truth of disclosure. We see that the squares of even numbers are even, and those of odd numbers are odd; we see that envy is not the same as jealousy; we see that there are only five regular solids in three-dimensional space. These are all facts, intelligible objects, and we register them as true: we display them in their intelligibility. They are understandings. We may want to explain them further and look for the reasons why they are true, but the search for further understanding does not disqualify the initial understanding that is given in the original evidence. Evidence enrolls things into the space of reasons.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_11.xhtml.heading_id_6"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_11.xhtml.ch11_twtee"></a>试图逃避证据的两种方式</h2><h2><a></a>TWO WAYS OF TRYING TO ESCAPE EVIDENCE</h2>

  <p>在哲学和普通头脑中，我们可以通过两种方式来否认证据作为事物的直接展示的存在。首先，我们将证据简化为仅仅是心理上的东西。在第二种情况下，我们声称，在我们能够通过从前提或公理推导出它来证明我们所知道的之前，我们永远不会真正拥有证据。</p><p>There are two ways in which we may try, in philosophy and in the common mind, to deny the existence of evidence as the direct display of things. In the first, we reduce evidence to something merely psychological. In the second, we claim that we never really have evidence until we can prove what we know by deriving it from premises or axioms.</p>

  <p>1. 因为证据必须由我们来完成，我们可能很容易陷入这样的信念，即它“只是”一个主观事件，比如情绪、痛苦或确定感。证据可以被视为一种纯粹的认知状态，一种我们心理的暂时状态，而这反过来又可以被简化为大脑和神经系统的一种暂时状态。在这种观点下，事物就是它们的本来面目，它们“在那里”，认知状态，包括证据，在我们“在这里”。比如说，信念的认知状态是我们所处的一种状态，一种我们可以在自我意识中意识到的状态，但它只告诉我们关于我们自己的情况，而不是关于世界上任何事物的信息。</p><p>1. Because evidencing has to be done by us, we may easily slip into the belief that it is "just" a subjective event, like a mood or a pain or a feeling of certainty. Evidence may be taken as a mere cognitive state, a temporary condition of our psyche, which in turn may be reduced to a temporary condition of the brain and nervous system. In this view, things are what they are, they are "out there", and cognitive states, evidencing included, are in us, "in here". The cognitive state, say, of belief is a condition we are in, one that we could be aware of in our self-consciousness, but it tells us only about ourselves, not about anything out there in the world.</p>

  <p><em>在德语中， Evidenz</em>一词的哲学含义之一是“被说服的意识”（<em>Überzeugungsbewusstsein</em>）。这个意义也很容易被心理学化。我们可能认为它意味着我们有意识地坚信某件事，但我们意识的目标只是我们的主观状态，坚定信念的状态。它就像大卫·休谟和约翰·斯图尔特·密尔把“信念”作为我们内心感知的目标一样。</p><p>In German, one of the philosophical meanings of the word <em>Evidenz</em> is "consciousness of being convinced of something" (<em>Überzeugungsbewusstsein</em>). This meaning too can easily be psychologized. We may take it to mean that we are conscious of firmly believing something, but then the target of our consciousness is just our subjective state, the state of firm conviction. It is like the "belief" that David Hume and John Stuart Mill take to be the target of our inner perception.</p>

  <p>这种对证据的解释是不正确的。当我们意识到证据时，我们主观上意识到的不是一种精神、心理状态，而是一种展示。我们意识到一种智力成就，一种表现形式的成功，而不是一种内在的数据。如果我们觉察到展示，那么本质上，我们也意识到展示的是什么：展示不是一种内在的东西，它位于被展示的事物之上和对立面。显化的成功是在我们的智力生活中实现的，而不仅仅是在我们的心理生活中。我们的智力成就可能有心理方面的影响，但这些方面并不是行动的实质。举证行为是理性空间中的事件，而不仅仅是心理插曲。</p><p>Such an interpretation of evidence would be incorrect. What we are subjectively aware of when we are aware of evidencing is not a mental, psychological state, but a display. We are aware of an intellectual achievement, a success in manifestation, not an inner datum. If we are aware of a display, we are also, essentially, aware of what is displayed: the display is not an inner thing over and against the thing displayed. The success in manifestation is reached in our intellectual life, not in our merely psychological life. There may be psychological aspects to our intellectual achievement, but these aspects are not the substance of the action. The act of evidence is an event in the space of reasons, not a mere psychological episode.</p>

  <p>证据行为更像是逻辑上的一个动作，而不是一种感觉或一种痛苦。证据行为是先验逻辑中的一个动作。它调整了我们的命题和意义的网络。这可能是一个插曲，但这并不能使它成为心理上的；这是揭露真相的一段插曲，是理性生活中的一步，是超越自我的成就。事实上，这是理性生活中的原始举动。它让我们开始了那种生活：直到事情被直接证据揭示，直到我们进入可理解的对象的存在，我们才不会积极地在真理的游戏中占据一席之地。在那之前，我们只是在为人类对话进行排练，还没有成为其中的成熟玩家。此外，任何举证行为都预设了整个真相游戏、人类对话、已经在进行；它必须在那里，我们才能进入它。我们被提升到那种生活中，不仅是因为我们是什么，而且是因为我们被排练到的理性传统：我们出生的地方传统和整个人类对话。这种对话和知识生活可能“只是”人类，但关键是，做人就是要从事真理，能够揭示事物的本来面目，让客观性在我们心中获胜。当我们陷入那种活动时，我们最像人类自己。这种对话和知识生活可能“只是”人类，但关键是，做人就是要从事真理，能够揭示事物的本来面目，让客观性在我们心中获胜。当我们陷入那种活动时，我们最像人类自己。这种对话和知识生活可能“只是”人类，但关键是，做人就是要从事真理，能够揭示事物的本来面目，让客观性在我们心中获胜。当我们陷入那种活动时，我们最像人类自己。</p><p>An act of evidence is more like a move in logic than like a feeling or a pain. An act of evidence is a move in transcendental logic. It adjusts the network of our propositions and meanings. It may be an episode, but that does not make it psychological; it is an episode of disclosure and truth, a move in the life of reason, an accomplishment of the transcendental ego. In fact, it is the original move in the life of reason. It gets us started in that life: until things have been disclosed by direct evidence and until we enter into the presence of intelligible objects, we do not actively take a position in the game of truth. Until then, we are only rehearsing for the human conversation and have not yet become full-fledged players in it. Any act of evidencing, furthermore, presupposes that the entire game of truth, the human conversation, is already going on; it has to be there for us to enter into it. We are lifted into that life not only by what we are, but also by the rational tradition into which we are rehearsed: both the local tradition into which we are born and the human conversation as a whole. This conversation and intellectual life may be "only" human, but the point is that to be human is to be engaged in truth, to be able to disclose the way things are and to let objectivity triumph in us. We are most ourselves as human beings when we are caught up in that activity.</p>

  <p>2. 第二种试图回避证据的方法是声称陈述本身不足以证明真相。我们可能认为演示文稿只给了我们一个表象或一个意见。然后我们将不得不继续证明所呈现的内容的真实性，我们将通过给出理由来证明这一点。我们必须解释它；也就是说，我们必须从其他更确定的前提，甚至从公理中推导出它，以说明为什么它必须是这样的。经过这样的证明，我们就可以肯定这个现象了。按照这种观点，在我们证明之前我们什么都不知道；我们要求证明一切。因此，仅凭证据并不能呈现真相。换句话说，没有证据之类的东西。真理的唯一来源是证据。</p><p>2. The second way of trying to evade evidence is to claim that the presentation itself is not enough to establish truth. We might think that a presentation gives us only an appearance or an opinion. We would then have to go on to prove the truth of what has been presented, and we would do so by giving reasons for it. We have to explain it; that is, we have to derive it from other, more certain premises, even from axioms, to show why it has to be the way it is. After such proof, we will be sure of the phenomenon. In this view, we do not know anything until we have proved it; we demand a proof for everything. Evidencing alone, therefore, does not present truth. To put it another way, there is no such thing as evidencing. The only source for truth is proof.</p>

  <p>这一主张反映了这样一种信念，即通过有条不紊的程序可以达到真理。没有什么是直接呈现给我们的，但我们可以通过推理来获得真理。笛卡尔在现代性之初就诉诸于这种方法，他认为这种方法可以代替洞察力。他说，即使是中等智力的人，也可以遵循证明的每一个简单步骤，从而得出可靠的结论，其确定性与最聪明的人所能达到的一样大。他认为，即使是感知也需要证明，因为它涉及从我们拥有的想法到我们“外部”的推定原因的推论，这些原因一定是导致这些想法的原因。这种对方法的信心是现代理性主义的一部分。它是我们对大型研究项目的信任背后的原因，这些项目有望发现我们需要的真相，让生活更轻松、更美好。聪明人或聪明人的权威被政府、工业界或学术界赞助的方法驱动的项目所取代。</p><p>This claim reflects the belief that truth is reached by means of methodic procedures. Nothing is directly presented to us, but we can reach truths by reasoning to them. Descartes appealed to such method at the beginning of modernity, and he thought that method could replace insight. Even people of moderate intellectual ability, he said, could follow each simple step of a proof and thus come to a sure possession of the conclusion, with a certainty as great as can be reached by the most intelligent person. Even perception requires proof, he thought, because it involves an inference from the ideas we have to the putative causes "outside" us that must have brought the ideas about. This confidence in method is part of the rationalism of modernity. It lies behind the trust we have in large-scale research projects that promise to discover the truths we need to make life easier and better. The authority of the wise or intelligent person is replaced by the method-driven project sponsored by government, industry, or the academy.</p>

  <p>这种对方法和证据的信任是一种掌握真理的尝试。这是一种控制披露并使其服从我们意志的尝试。如果我们能找到正确的方法，如果我们有条不紊的程序可以得到计算机的帮助，我们将能够解决许多重要的问题。我们将掌握事物的真相，强迫我们自己和他人同意。我们对方法的信心背后的哲学原则是，我们通过证明来了解事物，而不是通过提供证据来认识事物。</p><p>Such trust in method and proof is an attempt to master truth. It is an attempt to get disclosure under control and to subject it to our wills. If we can get the right method in place, and if our methodical procedures can be helped by computers, we will be able to solve many important problems. We will get a hammerlock on the truth of things, coercing consent in ourselves and in others. The philosophical principle behind our confidence in method is the idea that we know things by proving them, not by bringing about evidence.</p>

  <p>与方法似乎赋予我们的对真相的控制相反，证据似乎是不可预测和无法掌握的。似乎太过依赖于有能力实现的人。它似乎取决于外表，取决于事情如何发生在我们面前。依靠证据而不是有条不紊的程序似乎过于被动，不够积极。理性主义者可能会发现证据的偶然性令人不安，并可能对我们无法掌握真理这一事实感到遗憾，但事实确实如此。真理的出现确实要等对的人、对的时候，更要靠惯的心，而不是靠方法。在证据方面，并非每个人都是平等的。我们必须为此做好准备，甚至在做好准备之前，我们必须具备实现它的原始原生能力。</p><p>In contrast with the control over truth that method seems to give us, evidence seems to be unpredictable and unmasterable. It seems to depend too much on people who have the ability to achieve it. It seems to depend on appearances, on how things happen to show up for us. Relying on evidence as opposed to methodical procedures may seem too passive, not energetic enough. The rationalist may find the contingency of evidence unsettling and may regret the fact that we cannot master truth, but such is indeed the case. We do have to wait for the right person and the right moment for the truth to appear, and we must depend on the habituated mind more than on method. Not everyone is equal when it comes to evidence; we must be prepared for it, and even prior to being prepared, we must have the raw native ability to achieve it. We are not equal when it comes to bringing out the truth of things.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_11.xhtml.heading_id_7"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_11.xhtml.ch11_ht"></a>隐藏与真相</h2><h2><a></a>HIDDENNESS AND TRUTH</h2>

  <p>证据使事情大白于天下，但每一个证据都是从不存在和模糊中出现的，而对一个对象的一个​​方面的关注通常意味着其他方面变得模糊不清。理性的生命不是一个简单的证据，一个启发，一个接着一个的问题。相反，理性的生活是存在与不存在、清晰与模糊之间的推拉。</p><p>Evidence brings things to light, but every evidence emerges out of absence and vagueness, and the focus on one aspect of an object usually means that other aspects lapse into obscurity. The life of reason is not a matter of one simple evidence, one illumination, following another. Rather, the life of reason is a push and pull between presence and absence, and between clarity and obscurity.</p>

  <p>我们通常认为在场是好的，但并不意味着缺席和隐藏就是坏的。事情进入蚀相可能是必要的，也是好的。隐藏不仅仅是损失；它还可以保存和保护。事情需要在合适的时间才能看到。事实上，乔尔乔内的画作<em>《暴风雨》</em>几十年来无人问津，或者我们仍然不确定其中的数字意味着什么，或者 200 年来没有人对维瓦尔第知之甚少，或者我们可能并不真正知道莎士比亚是谁，或者经院哲学遭受了十八、十九世纪的笛卡尔叠加未必是悲剧。即使我们认为我们对某事了解很多，我们也可能遗漏了一些核心的东西：关于一幅画、一篇文章或一个事件的大量历史数据，关于一种疾病或天体现象的大量信息，并不能保证我们能查出事情的真相。事情可能正在等待合适的时机被理解。正如诠释学告诉我们的，<em>Bergung</em>也是<em>Verbergung</em>，隐蔽也是保全。</p><p>We generally consider presencing to be good, but it does not follow that the absent and the hidden are bad. It may be necessary and good that things go into eclipse. Hiddenness is not just loss; it can also be preservation and protection. Things need their right time to be seen. The fact that Giorgione's painting <em>The Tempest</em> was stored unseen for many decades, or that we still are not sure what the figures in it signify, or that no one knew much about Vivaldi for two hundred years, or that we may not really know who Shakespeare was, or that scholasticism suffered a Cartesian overlay in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is not necessarily a tragedy. Even when we think we know a lot about something, we may be missing something central: an abundance of historical data about a painting or a text or an event, a mass of information about an illness or a celestial phenomenon, does not guarantee that we can bring out the truth of the things in question. The things may be waiting for the right moment to be understood. As hermeneutics has taught us, <em>Bergung</em> is also <em>Verbergung</em>, concealment is also preservation.</p>

  <p>遮蔽可以以两种形式出现，或者是不存在，或者是模糊，而后者，模糊，才是更重要的。模糊首先出现为对象的模糊存在，对象可以从中清晰地显现出来。然而，一旦一个对象被证实，它就有可能，甚至不可避免地再次退回到模糊状态。发生这种滑移是因为我们必须将获得的证据视为理所当然，因为我们要继续研究基于它的进一步证据。原始证据<em>沉淀</em>，正如现象学隐喻所说的那样。它成为一个隐藏的预设，使更高的事物得以曝光，但当我们专注于更高、更新的证据时，更低、更原始的证据就会退入黑暗。它不再被真实地表达出来。例如，伽利略和牛顿发生的自然界的几何变换就是一个证据；它带来了某种分类结构。随着时间的推移，人们只是理所当然地认为世界在形式上是数学的，现在需要努力重新激活或重建处于现代科学核心的证据。</p><p>Concealment can occur in two forms, either as absence or as vagueness, and it is the latter, vagueness, that is the more important. Vagueness occurs first as the hazy presence of an object, the matrix out of which the object can distinctly come to light. Once an object has been evidenced, however, it is possible, and even inevitable, for it to move back again into vagueness. This slippage occurs because we have to take the acquired evidence for granted as we move on to further evidences that are based upon it. The original evidence becomes <em>sedimented</em>, as the phenomenological metaphor puts it. It becomes a hidden presupposition that enables something higher to come to light, but when we focus on that higher, newer evidence, the lower, more original one recedes into darkness. It ceases to be authentically articulated. For example, the geometric transformation of nature that took place in Galileo and Newton was an evidencing; it brought a certain categorial structure to presence. As time went on, men simply took it for granted that the world was mathematical in form, and it now requires an effort to reactivate or reconstitute the evidence that is at the heart of modern science.</p>

  <p>我们所有的文化机构都是这样。剧场是什么的意识也陷入了沉淀状态；它被认为是理所当然的，即使它最初是作为一种特定的描述和分类表达而产生的。写作甚至人类语言及其句法结构也是如此。计数活动本身以及在该活动中构成的数字可能会失去其原始意义和方向。而且，这些隐藏的原件，这些沉淀下来的文化和范畴形式，可能是潜伏的、被忽视的，但它们是有效的；它们产生了一种文化力场。它们就像埋在地下的强力磁铁。它们决定了我们所做的事情的范围，并作为我们许多人类活动的未被认可的前提。那些依赖方法的人可能希望假装真正的证据永远不会变得晦涩难懂，当新事物成为焦点时，任何事情都不会偏离焦点，因为通过新的程序应用程序总是可以获得对象。然而，这种对纯粹存在的期望注定要失望。隐藏的和迷失的与清楚的和分明的一样真实。</p><p>All our cultural institutions are like this. The sense of what the theater is has also fallen into a sedimented state; it is taken for granted, even though it was originally generated as a specific kind of depiction and categorial articulation. The same could be said of writing or even of human language, with its syntactic structure. The very activity of counting, and the numbers that are constituted in that activity, can lose their original sense and direction. Furthermore, these hidden originals, these sedimented cultural and categorial forms, may be latent and overlooked, but they are effective; they generate a cultural field of force. They are like strong magnets buried in the ground. They determine the scope of what we do and serve as unrecognized premises for much of our human activity. Those who rely on method may wish to pretend that true evidence never lapses into obscurity, that nothing ever goes out of focus when something new comes into focus, because the object is always available through a new application of the procedure. This expectation of sheer presence, however, is doomed to disappointment. The hidden and the lost are as real as the clear and the distinct.</p>

  <p>哲学试图通过一种考古学来恢复事物的原始意义，一种接受我们世界中存在的文化和范畴事物并试图挖掘其范畴沉淀的地层的思维方式。它试图追溯我们思想史上层层叠叠的证据；它试图回到原始分化发生时的那个点，它建立了我们现在给我们的东西。它努力通过位于我们继承的范畴构造中的遗传构成向后移动。获得事物的本质也意味着获得古老的和原始的。</p><p>Philosophy attempts to recover the original sense of things by a kind of archaeology, a form of thinking that accepts the cultural and categorial things present in our world and tries to dig through the strata of their categorial sedimentation. It tries to trace back the evidences that were layered one upon the other in our intellectual history; it tries to get back to the point when the primitive differentiations took place that established what we now have given to us. It strives to move backward through the genetic constitutions that lie within the categorial formations we inherit. Getting to the essentials of things also means getting to the archaic and the original.</p>

  <p>而且，这种哲学考古学不是一种经验历史的形式，它的主要来源不是古代文本，尽管它必须利用历史和文本。它的主要来源是我们直接遇到的范畴和文化事物，它试图做的是挖掘它们站在我们面前的样子，将它们分解成它们的基本范畴，甚至是它们的前范畴预期。它试图“取消构建”它们。我们以语言为例，回过头来研究语言从其他类型的符号中产生的差异；我们采用几何学并研究建立几何学本身的各种意向性，因为它与其他空间现象不同。较早的文本和原始形式对于获得这些开端是不可或缺的，</p><p>This philosophical archaeology, moreover, is not a form of empirical history, and it does not find its primary sources in ancient texts, even though it has to make use of history and texts. Its primary sources are the categorial and cultural things that we directly encounter, and what it attempts to do is to dig into them as they stand before us, unpacking them down to their elementary categories and even to their precategorial anticipations. It attempts to "unbuild" them. We take language, for example, and work back to the differentiations through which language emerges from other kinds of signs; we take geometry and work back to the kinds of intentionalities that establish the geometric as such, as it is differentiated from other spatial phenomena. Older texts and primitive forms are indispensable in getting to these beginnings, but such texts and forms do not give us the explanations that we are looking for in our probe into the origins of things, to the primitive differentiations that are more a matter of philosophical than of historical or empirical understanding.</p>

  <p>那么，哲学取决于这样一个事实，即我们以自然的态度获得真理，但不是全部真理。如果我们根本没有获得真理，如果我们没有正确的见解和科学，就不会有哲学。哲学反思这种理性的成就意味着什么。但是，如果我们无所不知，如果没有隐蔽、模糊、晦涩、错误和无知，就不会有哲学，也不会有对智慧的追求。黑暗的现象决定了光明的可能性，也决定了哲学的可能性，哲学反映出什么是光明，什么是黑暗。在哲学中，黑暗本身会尽可能多地暴露出来，但哲学必须具有让黑暗存在的良好判断力。如果它试图消除黑暗，</p><p>Philosophy depends, then, on the fact that we attain truth but not the whole truth in the natural attitude. There would be no philosophy if we attained no truth at all, if we did not have some right opinion and science. Philosophy reflects on what such a rational attainment means. But there would also be no philosophy, no search for wisdom, if we knew everything, if there were no hiddenness, no vagueness, obscurity, error, and ignorance. The phenomenon of darkness conditions the possibility of light, and it also conditions the possibility of philosophy, which reflects on what light and darkness are. Darkness itself comes to light, as much as it can, in philosophy, but philosophy must have the good sense to let the darkness be. If it were to try to eliminate the darkness, it would become rationalism and would be an attempt to replace the natural attitude instead of contemplating it.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_11.xhtml.heading_id_8"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_11.xhtml.ch11_tlsm"></a>意义的三层结构</h2><h2><a></a>THREE LEVELS OF STRUCTURE IN MEANING</h2>

  <p>让我们回到正确性真理，即当我们从陈述或命题开始并试图验证它们是真还是假时出现的那种。在处理这样的真理时，重要的是要区分命题中的三个结构层次。对这些级别的讨论将把我们带回到我们在第 7 章中在模糊性标题下研究的主题。</p><p>Let us return to the truth of correctness, the kind that occurs when we begin with statements or propositions and attempt to verify whether they are true or false. In dealing with such truth, it is important to distinguish three levels of structure that can be found in propositions. Discussion of these levels will lead us back to themes we examined in Chapter 7 under the heading of vagueness.</p>

  <p>然而，在我们计算出这三个层次之前，我们必须区分命题的句法和内容。语法<em>_</em>是命题的逻辑文法；它用“和”、“但是”、“有”和“是”等术语来表达。句法是判断的结缔组织。它用于加入陈述的内容条款，并且作为判断中的“肌肉”，它承担着繁重的工作；它推动、拉动、升高和降低我们用来命名事物的词语。有时语法是用特定的术语来表达的，比如刚才提到的那些词，但也可以用词形变化（比如名词的各种情况）和单词在句子中的位置来表达：in the sentence, 'John hit the car”，我们可以通过查看它们在句子中出现的位置来判断哪个名词是主语，哪个名词是宾语；“The car hit John”说的是完全不同的东西。<em></em>判断的一部分（现象学借用了中世纪逻辑的术语）。这些部分被称为 syncategorematic，因为它们本身并不作为意义单位出现；它们必须依附于其他词，它们组合的词；他们需要与其他词“一起”出现。</p><p>Before we work out these three levels, however, we must differentiate between the syntax and the content of a proposition. The <em>syntax</em> is the logical grammar of the proposition; it is expressed in terms like "and", "but", "with", and "is". Syntax is the connective tissue of judgments. It serves to join the content terms of statements and, as the "muscle" in judgments, it does the heavy lifting; it pushes, pulls, raises, and lowers the words we use to name things. Sometimes the syntax is expressed in specific terms, such as those words just mentioned, but it can also be expressed by inflections (such as the various cases of nouns) and by the position of words in the sentence: in the sentence, 'John hit the car", we can tell which noun is the subject and which the object by seeing where they appear in the sentence; "The car hit John" says something quite different. Syntactic terms are also called the <em>syncategorematic</em> parts of judgments (phenomenology borrows the term from medieval logic ). These parts are called syncategorematic because they do not appear by themselves as units of meaning; they must be attached to other words, the words that they combine; they need to occur "with" other words.</p>

  <p>相比之下，陈述的内容不是用来链接其他词，而是用来表达正在谈论的事物或方面<em>。</em>为了理解内容的概念，让我们把“John hit the car”这句话想象成被抽空了所有句法结构。如果我们要删除所有语法，我们将只剩下纯粹内容的残余：“hit, John, car”。我们必须将其投射到一个理想的极端，甚至想象“John”和“car”这两个词不再是名词，“hit”这个词不再是动词。我们还必须假设单词的相对位置没有任何意义。如果我们可以这样净化句子，我们将只有内容而没有任何结构。我们只会有绝对<em>明确的</em>术语，简单地命名事物但没有任何顺序或发音的词。我们将拥有没有任何语法的纯语义。</p><p>The <em>content</em> of a statement, in contrast, serves not to link other words, but to express the things or aspects that are being talked about. To get at the notion of content, let us imagine the sentence, "John hit the car", as being drained of all syntactic structure. If we were to remove all the syntax, we would be left with a residue of sheer contents: "hit, John, car". We have to project this to an ideal extreme and even imagine that the words "John" and "car" are no longer nouns and the word "hit" is no longer a verb. We would also have to imagine that the relative position of the words does not have any significance. If we could purify the sentence this way, we would have just the contents without any structure. We would have only sheer <em>categorematic</em> terms, words that simply name things but without any ordering or articulation. We would have pure semantics without any syntax.</p>

  <p>当然，这种将纯粹的句法和纯粹的语义投射到彼此完全分离的纯属想象。事实上，我们使用的每个词都有一些句法，而且几乎所有的词都带有一些语义；这两个特征是彼此的瞬间，而不是可以分离的部分。尽管如此，将句法和内容区分为命题和词的两个维度是合理的。此外，这种区别对我们的理性现象学非常有帮助，它将使我们能够分析我们在本节开头着手研究的结构的三个层次。</p><p>Such a projection into sheer syntax and sheer semantics as totally separated from one another is purely imaginary, of course. In fact, every word that we use has some syntax, and almost all words have some semantics attached to them; the two features are moments to one another, not pieces that can be detached. Still, it is legitimate to distinguish between the syntax and the content as two dimensions of propositions and words. The distinction, furthermore, is very helpful in our phenomenology of reason, and it will allow us to analyze the three levels of structure we set out to examine at the beginning of this section.</p>

  <p><em>1. 第一层处理产生有意义的</em>句法组合的种类<em></em>命题。如果我们要组合一串术语，例如“因此，是，并且，X（任何对象的名称），与”，我们将不会有一个有意义的整体。另一方面，像“Therefore, X came with Y'这样的组合是有意义的，可以在适当的情况下使用。第一个字符串是一个大杂烩，没有统一的意义，不足之处在于字符串的语法。这术语序列不能作为一个整体的意义来呈现。显然，这样的字符串不能成为正确的真理，因为它甚至不是真或假的候选者。它根本没有意义。严格来说，什么都不是being sayed, 即使有人在说话。人们说话时，有时确实会出现这种乱码。当演讲者情绪紧张时，或者当演讲者或作者对他们试图讨论的内容极度困惑时，它们可能会发生。人们确实陷入喋喋不休。这样的演讲者没有提出作为真理候选人的陈述，他们失败的原因在于他们所说的句法不充分，而不是他们演讲的虚假性。他们所说的甚至不能是假的，因为它不能满足真假兼备的前提条件。他们失败的原因在于他们所说的句法不当，而不是他们讲话的错误。他们所说的甚至不能是假的，因为它不能满足真假兼备的前提条件。他们失败的原因在于他们所说的句法不当，而不是他们讲话的错误。他们所说的甚至不能是假的，因为它不能满足真假兼备的前提条件。</p><p>1. The first level deals with the kinds of syntactic combinations that yield <em>meaningful</em> propositions. If we were to combine a string of terms such as "therefore, is, and, X (the name of any object), with", we would not have a meaningful whole. On the other hand, a combination like "Therefore, X came with Y' is meaningful and could be used in an appropriate situation. The first string is a hodgepodge without a unitary sense, and the deficiency lies in the syntax of the string. This sequence of terms could not be presented as one whole of meaning. Obviously, such a string could not be brought to the truth of correctness, because it is not even a candidate for truth or falsity. It is simply meaningless. Strictly speaking, nothing is being said, even though someone is talking. Furthermore, such a syntactic hodgepodge is not a merely philosophical construct; such garbled strings of words do occur sometimes when people are speaking. They may occur when the speakers are under emotional strain, or when the speakers or writers are extremely confused about what they are trying to discuss. People do fall into babbling. Such speakers do not present a statement that is a candidate for truth, and the reason why they fail lies in the syntactic inadequacy of what they are saying, not in the falsity of their speech. What they say is not even capable of being false, because it fails to satisfy the preconditions of both truth and falsity.</p>

  <p><em>2. 然而，一旦我们达到了句法上有意义的命题，就会出现与一致性</em>相关的第二层结构<em></em>的命题。两个语句在句法上可能有意义但又相互矛盾：“他在五点钟回家；他在五点钟不在家”。即使是一个单一的陈述，如果足够复杂，也可能自相矛盾或前后矛盾：“他进入了棕色的白色建筑”。这样的陈述在语法上是可以接受的，但它们“反对”，自相矛盾。在矛盾中，我们断言一件事，然后我们“不断言”它或说它的否定。我们确实有一个有意义的陈述，一个在句法上可以接受的陈述，因为如果我们不这样做，我们甚至不知道发生了矛盾；我们的演讲符合句法标准。但是，我们仍然没有说“一件事”：我们假借一说的名义说了两件事，两者势不两立。我们不能同时断言它们。我们在说些什么，但我们也在隐瞒。有一个意思，但它一闪一闪，而在乱码语法中根本没有意义；在那里，“意义”崩溃了。不一致的陈述虽然有意义，但不能成为正确性真理的候选者。我们先验地知道，试图验证或伪造不一致是没有意义的。</p><p>2. Once we have reached syntactically meaningful propositions, however, a second level of structure arises that is related to the <em>consistency</em> of propositions. Two statements can be syntactically meaningful and yet contradict one another: "He came home at five o'clock; he was not home at five o'clock". Even a single statement, if it is complex enough, can be self-contradictory or inconsistent: "He entered the white building that was brown". Such statements are acceptable grammatically, but they "speak against", they contradict themselves. In a contradiction we assert one thing, and then we "unassert" it or say its negation. We do have a meaningful statement, one that is acceptable syntactically, because if we did not, we would not even know that a contradiction has occurred; our speech has satisfied the criteria concerning syntax. However, we still have not said "one thing": we have said two things under the guise of saying one, and the two are irreconcilable. We cannot assert both of them. We are saying something, but we are also unsaying it. There is a meaning, but it flashes on and off, whereas in garbled syntax there is no meaning at all; there, the "meaning" crumbles. An inconsistent statement, although meaningful, cannot be a candidate for the truth of correctness. We know a priori that there is no point in trying to verify or falsify an inconsistency.</p>

  <p>不一致是一种不同于句法乱码的失败，但它仍然更多地与语法有关，而不是与我们语句的内容有关；它与命题的组合有关，与它们如何组合在一起有关。句法处理术语构成命题的方式，而一致性处理命题可以组合成复杂命题或更大整体的方式。</p><p>Inconsistency is a failure that is different from syntactic garbling, but it is still related more to the syntax than to the content of our statements; it has to do with the combinatorics of propositions, with how they are put together. Syntax deals with the manner in which terms are composed to make up a proposition, and consistency deals with the manner in which propositions can be composed into complex propositions or larger wholes.</p>

  <p>3. 然而，第三层结构涉及我们所说的内容。它处理<em>连贯性</em>我们所做的陈述。我们可能会成功地做出语法正确且一致的陈述，但会失败，因为它们的内容彼此之间没有任何关系。例如，像“我的叔叔们难以辨认”这样的陈述是不可接受的，不是因为句法或自相矛盾，而是因为不连贯：“叔叔”和“难以辨认”这两个词不相容。它们属于不同的范畴或不同的语言游戏，属于不同的话语和存在领域。该语句是“无意义的”，但无意义的方式不同于语法上有缺陷的语句。这个命题的语法没有问题，但是它的内容被错误地强加在一起。这种不连贯陈述的其他例子是“这本书很高”；“</p><p>3. The third level of structure, however, deals with the content of what we say. It deals with the <em>coherence</em> of the statements we make. We may succeed in making statements that are both syntactically correct and consistent but fail because their contents do not have anything to do with one another. For example, a statement like "My uncles are illegible" is unacceptable, not because of syntax or self-contradiction, but because of incoherence: the terms "uncles" and "illegible" do not consort with one another. They belong to different categories or different language games, different regions of discourse and being. The statement is "nonsensical", but nonsensical in a way different from statements that are deficient in syntax. There is nothing wrong with the syntax of this proposition, but its contents are wrongly forced together. Other examples of such incoherent statements are "This book is tall"; "My cat is a filibuster"; "That tree is a monoglot"; and "The Tenth Amendment has been broiled".</p>

  <p>顺便说一句，所有这些陈述如果被隐喻地理解，都可以被赋予意义，但我们假设它们是按字面意思陈述的。事实上，隐喻的本质是将不同领域的术语汇集在一起​​，以阐明我们所谈论事物的新方面。隐喻炫耀其不连贯性以表明观点。</p><p>All such statements, incidentally, could be given a meaning if they were to be taken metaphorically, but we are presuming that they are being stated literally. Indeed, the nature of metaphor is to bring together terms from different regions of discourse in order to articulate new aspects in the things we are talking about. A metaphor flaunts its incoherence in order to make a point.</p>

  <p>有人可能会反对说没有人会犯这样愚蠢的错误；没有人会说他的叔叔难以辨认，或者一棵树是单一语言。诚然，刚才为简单起见而选择的例子牵强附会，但在生活中有很多地方人们确实说话不连贯。言语不连贯并非罕见现象。例如，很多关于政治事务的陈述都以这种方式失败，许多关于宗教、艺术、教育、道德、人类情感和哲学的陈述也是如此。任何考过政治理论或哲学等级考试的老师都会知道，作文薄弱的主要困难不在于其中的陈述是错误的，而是它们不连贯：它们将不属于一起的单词混在一起。很难对这些文章进行评论，因为那里没有可以改进或更正的明确命题。没有什么具体的回应可以说。更一般地说，在学术考试领域之外，很难纠正人们对艺术、政治或宗教的误解，不是因为人们说的只是错误的，而是因为它不连贯。</p><p>One might object that no one would make silly mistakes like these; no one would say that his uncles are illegible or that a tree is a monoglot. It is true that the examples just given, which were chosen for the sake of simplicity, are far-fetched, but there are many areas in life in which people do speak incoherently. Incoherence in speech is not a rare phenomenon. Very many statements about political matters, for example, fail in this way, and so do many of the things said about religion, art, education, morality, the human emotions, and philosophy. Any teacher who has graded examinations in political theory or philosophy will know that the major difficulty with weak compositions is not that the statements made in them are false, but that they are incoherent: they blend words that do not belong together. It is very difficult to comment on such essays, because there are no distinct propositions there that can be improved upon or corrected. Nothing specific can be said in response. And more generally, outside the domain of academic examinations, it is very difficult to correct misconceptions that people have in regard to art, politics, or religion, not because what people say is simply erroneous, but because it is incoherent.</p>

  <p>我们区分的命题结构的三个层次——句法形式、一致性和连贯性——帮助我们提出关于人类推理的几个重要观点。例如，通过这些区别，我们可以展示形式逻辑如何在寻求真理时发挥作用。形式逻辑提供了第二个层次的规则，即一致性。它不向我们保证命题的真实性，但它阐明了命题有效性的条件，如果命题要成为真理的候选者，就必须满足这些条件。形式逻辑展示了如何将命题有效地组合成更大的整体，组合成论证，而不会陷入矛盾。如果一组命题不一致，我们知道我们无法通过证明它们所表达的事物来证实它们；这种证据被先验排除。</p><p>The three levels of propositional structure that we have distinguished — syntactic form, consistency, and coherence — help us to make several important points regarding human reasoning. With these distinctions we can, for example, show how formal logic works in the quest for truth. Formal logic provides the rules for the second level, that of consistency. It does not assure us of the truth of propositions, but it spells out conditions for their validity, conditions that the propositions must fulfill if they are even to be candidates for truth. Formal logic shows how propositions can be validly combined into larger wholes, into arguments, without collapsing into contradiction. If a set of propositions is inconsistent, we know we could not confirm them by evidencing the things they express; such evidence is excluded a priori.</p>

  <p>检测不一致是批评论点的一种方式，但另一种方式是检测句法缺陷，这种缺陷表明说话者首先没有正式地组织一个命题。带有乱码语法的话语甚至没有资格进行一致性测试。但不连贯也使声明无法通过一致性测试。一个不连贯的陈述，例如“我的猫是个阻挠议事者”，超越了矛盾或非矛盾。说猫既是阻挠者又不是阻挠者并不是说任何自相矛盾的事情，因为没有有效的命题意义可以自相矛盾。内容不连贯，就像语法混乱一样，违反了一致性的先决条件。</p><p>Detecting an inconsistency is one way of criticizing an argument, but another is detecting a syntactic flaw, one that shows that the speaker failed formally in assembling a proposition in the first place. An utterance with garbled syntax does not even qualify to be tested for consistency. But incoherence also disqualifies a statement from being tested for consistency. An incoherent statement, such as "My cat is a filibuster", transcends contradiction or noncontradiction. To say the cat both is and is not a filibuster is not to say anything contradictory, because there is no valid propositional meaning there to be contradicted. Incoherence of content, like confusion in syntax, violates the preconditions for consistency.</p>

  <p>思维中的这三种缺陷——语法错误、矛盾、不连贯——实际上可能发生在我们的思维被模糊所笼罩的时候，而正如我们在第 7 章中看到的那样，模糊在人类话语中并不少见。这是我们所有人在某些时候和我们中的一些人在我们说话的大部分时间里的情况。思维模糊、混乱是所有三种混乱的根源，但尤其是第三种混乱的根源，即不连贯。我们很少在句法上犯错；如果我们跌到这一步，我们只会喋喋不休而不是说话。但语无伦次是很常见的，尤其是当人们开始谈论超出简单明显事实的事情并进入更多反思性问题时。</p><p>These three deficiencies in thinking — failed syntax, contradiction, incoherence — can actually occur when our thinking is pervaded by vagueness, and vagueness, as we have seen in Chapter 7, is not rare in human discourse. It is what all of us are in some of the time and some of us are in most of the time when we speak. Indistinct thinking, confusion, is the source for all three muddles, but especially for the third, for incoherence. It is rare that we are syntactically delinquent; if we fell this far, we would be babbling rather than speaking. But incoherence is very common, especially when people begin to speak about things that go beyond simple and obvious facts and get into more reflective issues.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_11.xhtml.heading_id_9"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_11.xhtml.ch11_eibe"></a>个人经验作为基本证据</h2><h2><a></a>EXPERIENCE OF INDIVIDUALS AS THE BASIC EVIDENCE</h2>

  <p>因此，命题内容的连贯性是命题前后一致和真实的前提。这种连贯性从何而来？我们如何获得告诉我们哪些内容可以与其他内容混合的规则？</p><p>Coherence of the contents of propositions, therefore, is a precondition for the consistency and the truth of the propositions. Where does such coherence come from? How do we get the rules that tell us what contents can be blended with others?</p>

  <p>我们并不是简单地设计相关规则告诉我们“叔叔”这个词与“男性、高或矮、有胡子或没有胡子、慷慨或吝啬”等等相混合，并且这个词不与“难以辨认，天文，猫科动物，分子”等。连贯性不仅仅来自支配我们词汇的语言规则。相反，命题内容的连贯性来自于我们对对象的体验，特别是来自于我们对单个对象的体验。它来自这样一个事实，即在我们遇到特定事物时，我们会发现某些内容或类别属于一起；我们将事物表述为具有这样的特征。当我们将对象从预测性证据带到预测性证据时，这些特征就会出现。我们制定的所有命题最终都来自我们自己或我们语言社区中的其他人对所讨论事物的体验。对于像“我的叔叔是秃头”这样的命题是可验证的，内容“秃头叔叔”的混合必须是可能的，并且它的可能性之所以出现是因为原则上可以从预测经验中阐明这种特定的混合。我们可以发现这两种内容混合在一起。</p><p>It is not the case that we simply devise rules of relevance that tell us that the term "uncles" blends with "male, tall or short, bearded or not, generous or stingy", etc., and that the term does not blend with "illegible, astronomical, feline, molecular", etc. It is not the case that coherence comes just from linguistic rules that govern our vocabulary. Rather, the coherence of the contents of propositions comes from our experience of objects, and specifically from our experience of individual objects. It comes from the fact that in our encounter with particular things we find certain contents or categories belonging together; we articulate the things as having such features. The features emerge as we bring the objects from prepredicative to predicative evidencing. All the propositions we formulate derive ultimately from the experience we ourselves, or other people in our linguistic community, have had of the things in question. For a proposition like "My uncles are bald" to be verifiable, the blend of contents "uncles–bald" must be possible, and its possibility arises because that particular blend can in principle be articulated out of prepredicative experience. We can find those two contents blended together.</p>

  <p>在正确性真理中，我们从命题出发，将其回归到前提经验的证据。命题最初是从预测的、个体的证据中产生的，现在它回到同一个源头，当它被确认时就融化成预测的经验。如果命题被证伪，我们会发现我们的证据与我们试图在其中实现的意图相抵触。我们不能仅通过检查陈述本身来发现命题的真实性；这些陈述在目的论上旨在通过事物本身，通过我们在各种感知模式中遇到的对象来确认或否定。在证据的等级中，本质上第一和最后的证据是事物的直接经验。我们所有的意义，连同它们的句法和语义结构，</p><p>In the truth of correctness, we start with the proposition and return it to the evidence of prepredicative experience. The proposition originally arose from prepredicative, individual evidencing, and now it returns to the same source and is melted down into prepredicative experiencing when it is confirmed. If the proposition is falsified, we find that our evidencing resists the intention we try to fulfill in it. We do not find the truth of propositions just by examining the statements themselves; the statements are geared teleologically to confirmation or disconfirmation by the things themselves, by the objects we encounter in our various modes of perception. In the hierarchy of evidences, the intrinsically first and last ones are those of the direct experience of things. All our meanings, with their syntactic and semantic structures, arise from experience and are geared toward experience and the beings disclosed in it.</p>

  <p>因此，人类的语言是针对事物的可理解性，而人类的理性则被命令以真理为目的和完善。形式结构本身并不是目的，而是揭示事物的工具。语言结构可能形成极其复杂的整体，有时我们可能会被它们迷住，以至于我们认为除了能指和句法的游戏之外别无其他，它们本身就足够了。结构主义者和解构主义者都相信这一点，认为在意义的游戏之外没有“中心”。但是现象学认为语言的形式模式被赋予了更大的尊严和美感：它们不仅相互影响，而且有助于揭示事物的存在方式和可能存在的方式。</p><p>Human speech, therefore, is directed toward things in their intelligibility, and human reason is ordered toward truth as its end and perfection. Formal structures are not ends in themselves, but instruments in the disclosure of things. Linguistic structures may form wholes of exquisite complexity, and we may at times be so enthralled by them that we think that there is nothing but the play of signifiers and syntax, that they are sufficient unto themselves. Both structuralists and deconstructionists believe this, thinking that there is no "center" beyond the play of significations. But phenomenology sees the formal patterns of language as endowed with an even greater dignity and beauty: they not only interact with one another, but serve to disclose the way things are and the way things can be. The mind that constitutes meaning and its formal structures does so ultimately to evidence the truth of things.</p>

  <p>此外，我们体验的事物不仅仅是通过我们的五种感官感知到的物质对象。的确，我们看到苹果是红色的，房子是白色的，但我们也看到了欺骗、慷慨、工具和运动的例子，在阐明这些例子时，我们充实了这些东西所具有的特征。说我们所经历的唯一个体只是石头和树木之类的物质事物，这是不正确的。</p><p>The things we experience, moreover, are not just the material objects perceived through our five senses. It is true that we see that the apple is red and the house is white, but we also see instances of deception, generosity, tools, and sport, and in articulating those instances we flesh out the features that such things have. It is not true that the only individuals we experience are simply material things like stones and trees.</p>

  <p>最后，一致性和连贯性不仅仅存在于理论问题中。实践思维也受它们支配。我们可能批评公共项目或个人项目不一致或不连贯；其手段可能相互矛盾或相互矛盾或与它们所要服务的目的相矛盾；可能会同时寻求几个不相容的目标（我们的目的是交叉的）；在我们的计划中，手段和目的的意义可能完全混乱。有时，由于对项目施加了不可避免的压力，可能会出现行动不一致的情况；我们知道这个程序有问题，但必须要做一些事情，这是我们能做的最好的，我们会设法蒙混过关。然而，在其他时候，不一致和不连贯只是暴露了代理人的无能。</p><p>Finally, consistency and coherence are not found only in theoretical matters. Practical thinking is also governed by them. We may criticize a public program or a personal project for being inconsistent or incoherent; its means may contradict one another or the purposes they are meant to serve; several incompatible goals may be sought at the same time (we are acting at cross-purposes); the very sense of the means and the ends may be completely garbled in our planning. Sometimes an inconsistency in action may arise because of unavoidable pressures that are put on the project; we know that the program has problems, but something has to be done, this is the best we can do, and we will try to muddle through. At other times, however, the inconsistencies and incoherences simply reveal the incompetence of the agent.</p>

  <p>我们所证明的事情不仅仅是闲置信息的来源。我们不只是拾起树高和阳光明媚的事实。相反，事情除了真实之外，也是美好的、令人钦佩的。我们知道的东西是有价值的。我们之所以持续感知事物，之所以我们转动立方体以查看它的其他方面或走进建筑物以查看我们从外部看不到的部分，是因为有一些重要的东西需要我们去发现。事物引起我们的兴趣并激起我们的表达：它们这样做是因为发现它们满足了我们的各种需求和兴趣（苹果成熟到可以吃，树可以爬），但也因为事物本身是美丽的和奖励我们的好奇心。我们所知道的事情不仅仅是冷漠信息的枯燥列表，但奇妙外表的来源。我们不断地惊讶地看到一个事物是什么，它还能是什么，它能为我们提供什么“其他方面”。一个球迷不管看过多少场足球比赛，还是很好奇这一场到底会怎样，这一次的比赛会呈现出怎样的面貌。无论我们多少次听到<em>Goldberg Variations</em>，我们渴望听到这种解释，看看这首曲子还能是什么。无论两个朋友在一起度过了多少时间，他们总是期待着再次见面，享受即将曝光的更多面貌。我们不厌其烦地听到关于人类在不断变化的情况下的行为（英雄主义或怯懦、慷慨或贪婪）。一切——一座花园或一棵树，一件珠宝或一次最喜欢的散步——都有它的<em>卡隆</em>，并且按照它自己的时尚是美丽的或令人钦佩的。</p><p>The things we evidence are not just sources of idle information. We do not just pick up the facts that the tree is tall and the sun is shining. Rather, things, besides being true, are also good and admirable. The things we know are valuable. The reason why we continue to perceive things, the reason why we turn the cube around to see its other aspects or walk into the building to see the parts we cannot see from the outside is that there is something important for us to find out. Things solicit our interest and provoke our articulation: they do so because finding out about them satisfies various needs and interests that we have (the apple is ripe enough to eat, the tree can be climbed), but also because the things themselves are beautiful and reward our curiosity. The things we know are not just dull lists of indifferent information, but sources of marvelous appearances. We are continually astonished to see what a thing is and also what else it can be, what "other sides" it can offer us. No matter how many football games a fan has seen, he is still curious to see how this one will turn out and what face the game will present this time. No matter how often we have heard the <em>Goldberg Variations</em>, we are eager to hear this interpretation to see what else the piece can be. No matter how much time two friends have spent together, they will always look forward to another meeting to enjoy the further appearances that will come to light. We do not tire of hearing about human action (heroism or cowardice, generosity or greed) in evernew situations. Everything — a garden or a tree, a piece of jewelry or a favorite walk — has its <em>kalon</em> and is beautiful or admirable after its own fashion.</p>

  <p>说一个事物是流形中的一个身份，并不是说它只是推出越来越多的数据，就像同一份报纸的这么多份一样。相反，这个东西就像一个放射源，不断发射不同种类的能量，即使它仍然存在并被识别为同一个物体。表现不只是给我们事实；它揭示了所讨论事物所特有的美。即使我们变得粗鲁和严重功利主义并且对事物本身的优雅视而不见，如果我们对事物的兴趣只是出于事物可以以某种方式为我们服务的事实，即使那样，我们在我们的市侩的实用主义仍然会认识到事物的一种优点，一种实用性的优点。即便如此，这东西也不仅仅是一个信息源。</p><p>To say that a thing is an identity in manifolds is not to say that it just rolls out more and more data, like so many copies of one and the same newspaper. Rather, the thing is like a radioactive source that keeps emitting different kinds of energy, even while remaining and being identified as one and the same object. Manifestation does not just give us facts; it reveals the beauty peculiar to the thing in question. And even if we were to be rudely and grossly utilitarian and became blind to the elegance of the thing itself, if our interest in the thing were motivated only by the fact that the thing can serve us in some way, even then, we in our Philistine pragmatism would still be recognizing a kind of good in the thing, a good of utility. Even then, the thing would not be merely a source of information.</p>

  <p>放射性元素都有半衰期；随着时间的推移，它们会逐渐耗尽，尽管它们可能会继续释放能量数千年。作为表象来源的事物，作为流形中的同一性，没有半衰期。它会产生新的外观，以越来越强的强度而不是减弱的强度来欣赏它们。它取之不尽，用之不竭，蕴藏着令人惊讶的信息。我们永远不知道关于一个对象可以说的一切。作为身份的事物具有深度；无论它呈现给我们的是什么外观，还有其他保留的外观，它们都属于同一个东西：当我们晚上从布鲁克林高地的长廊上看到帝国大厦时，它会是什么样子？艾森豪威尔将如何担任总统？哈姆雷特将如何通过肯尼思布拉纳出现？藏红花对这道菜有什么作用？此外，一些已经浮出水面的现象可能会重新隐藏起来，只有在以后的时间才能以其他视角再次出现，出现在说其他语言的人面前，出现在可能还记得我们忘记的事情的社区中。所有这些现象都属于同一事物。我们获得的任何真理总是被缺席和隐藏所包围，被神秘所包围，因为我们知道的事情总是比我们能知道的多，参考总是比意义多。可能会重新隐藏起来，只是在稍后的时间以其他视角再次出现，对于说其他语言的人，对于一个可能记得我们忘记的事情的社区。所有这些现象都属于同一事物。我们获得的任何真理总是被缺席和隐藏所包围，被神秘所包围，因为我们知道的事情总是比我们能知道的多，参考总是比意义多。可能会重新隐藏起来，只是在稍后的时间以其他视角再次出现，对于说其他语言的人，对于一个可能记得我们忘记的事情的社区。所有这些现象都属于同一事物。我们获得的任何真理总是被缺席和隐藏所包围，被神秘所包围，因为我们知道的事情总是比我们能知道的多，参考总是比意义多。</p><p>Radioactive elements all have a half-life; they become depleted over time, even though they may continue emitting energy for thousands of years. A thing as a source of appearance, as an identity in manifolds, does not have a half-life. It generates new appearances, to a dative that will appreciate them, with greater and greater intensity, not with diminishing strength. It is inexhaustible, an endless reservoir of surprising disclosures. We never know everything that can be said about an object. The thing as an identity has depth; whatever appearances it may have presented to us, there are still others being held in reserve, and all of them belong to one and the same thing: How will the Empire State Building look when we see it at evening from the promenade on Brooklyn Heights? How will Eisenhower perform as president? How will Hamlet appear through Kenneth Branagh? What will saffron do for this dish? Some of the appearances that have already surfaced, moreover, may go back into hiding and be seen again only at a later time and in other perspectives, to speakers of other languages, to a community that may remember things we have forgotten. All these appearances will belong to the same thing in question. Any truth that we achieve is always surrounded by absence and hiddenness, by mystery, since the thing we know is always more than we can know, the reference is always more than the sense.</p>

  <p>理性的生命范围，然后，通过形式逻辑的复杂结构，句法的组合，命题内容的凝聚力，以及存在、不存在和模糊的相互作用。它包括直接披露和正确性。它在沉降和复兴之间移动。这是一种由先验自我主导的生活，并被命令去证明事物的本来面目。</p><p>The life of reason ranges, then, through the intricate structures of formal logic, the combinatorics of syntax, the cohesion of propositional contents, and the interplay of presence, absence, and vagueness. It covers both direct disclosure and correctness. It moves between sedimentation and revival. It is a life led by the transcendental ego and is ordered toward evidencing the way things are.</p>

  本质直觉</h1><h1><span class="small">12</span><br><br>
  Eidetic Intuition</h1>

  <p>根据我们的经验，我们处理的不仅仅是个人和团体。我们也洞察事物的本质。例如，我们不仅可以看到我们遇到的所有人类都能够说话，而且使用语言的能力必然而且普遍地是人类的一部分。它是人的本质的一部分；没有它，我们就无法成为人类。我们不仅可以看到物质对象与其周围环境的因果相互作用，而且它们必须这样做；没有这种相互作用的可能性，物质对象就不会是现在的样子。同样，一个被感知的对象在多个侧面、方面和轮廓中成为一个身份是普遍和必要的，我们可以看到它确实如此。本质向我们证明。</p><p>In our experience, we deal with more than individuals and groups. We also have insight into the essence of things. For example, we can see not only that all the human beings we have encountered are capable of speech, but that the ability to use language is necessarily and universally a part of being human. It is part of the essence of man; we could not be human without it. We can see not only that material objects interact causally with their surroundings, but that they must do so; without the possibility of such interaction, a material object would not be what it is. Likewise, a perceived object's being an identity in a manifold of sides, aspects, and profiles is universal and necessary, and we can see that it is so. Essences are evidenced to us.</p>

  <p>洞察本质被称为<em>本质直觉</em>，因为它是对现象或形式的把握。我们不仅可以直觉或呈现给我们自己的个人及其特征，还可以感知事物所具有的本质。本质直觉是一种特殊的意向性，具有自己的结构。现象学提供了对这种意向性的分析；它描述了我们如何直觉本质。</p><p>Insight into an essence is called <em>eidetic intuition</em>, because it is the grasp of an eidos or a form. We can intuit, or make present to ourselves, not only individuals with their features, but also the essences that things have. Eidetic intuition is a special kind of intentionality with a structure of its own. Phenomenology offers an analysis of this intentionality; it describes how we can intuit an essence.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_12.xhtml.heading_id_3"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_12.xhtml.ch12_aei"></a>直觉分析</h2><h2><a></a>ANALYSIS OF EIDETIC INTUITION</h2>

  <p>像所有意向性一样，本质直觉是一种身份综合。通过它，我们认识到表象流形中的同一性，但同一性和流形不同于我们直觉个体事物时出现的那种。为了展示本质直觉如何使本质呈现在​​我们面前，我们必须通过意向发展的三个层次来追溯它。</p><p>Like all intentionalities, eidetic intuition is an identity synthesis. Through it we recognize an identity within manifolds of appearance, but the identity and the manifolds are different from the kind that occur when we intuit individual things. To show how eidetic intuition makes essences present to us, we must trace it through three levels of intentional development.</p>

  <p>1. 在第一个层次上，我们经历了很多事情并找到了它们之间的相似之处。例如，我们可能会发现这块木头会漂浮，另一块木头会漂浮，第三块木头也会漂浮。在这个阶段，我们发现了一种相当弱的身份，称为<em>典型性</em>。该级别可以用以下系列表示：A 是<em>p </em><sub>1</sub>，B 是<em>p </em><sub>2</sub>，C 是<em>p </em><sub>3</sub>. 严格来说，本系列中的谓词并不相同；他们只是彼此相似。我们已经实现了一种仅基于关联的身份合成，因为一个特征的存在使我们相当被动地期望与其相关的其他特征跟随其后。漂浮对我们来说是和木头联系在一起的，或者咬人是和狗联系在一起的，所以我们期望下一块木头漂浮或下一条狗咬我们，但我们还没有明确判断木头漂浮或狗咬。我们的经验是程式化或典型化的，但它并没有被提升为独特的思维。</p><p>1. On the first level, we experience a number of things and find similarities among them. We might find, for example, that this piece of wood floats, and that this other piece of wood floats, and that this third one does so as well. At this stage we discover the rather weak kind of identity that is called <em>typicality</em>. This level could be symbolized by the following series: A is <em>p</em><sub>1</sub>, B is <em>p</em><sub>2</sub>, C is <em>p</em><sub>3</sub>. The predicates in this series are not, strictly speaking, the same; they are only similar to one another. We have achieved an identity synthesis based simply on association, as the presence of one feature makes us rather passively expect other features associated with it to follow in its train. Floating has, for us, been associated with wood, or biting has been associated with dogs, so we expect the next piece of wood to float or the next dog to bite us, but we have not made an explicit judgment about wood floating or dogs biting. Our experience is stylized or typified, but it has not been elevated into distinct thinking.</p>

  <p>2. 在第二层，我们可以看出三块木头不仅具有相似的谓词，而且具有完全相同的谓词。该级别可以用以下系列表示：A 是<em>p</em>，B 是<em>p</em>，C 是<em>p</em>。现在出现了一种身份综合，在这种情况下，我们不仅认识到相似之处，而且认识到相同的事物，即“许多人中的一个”。因此，仅仅使用词作为谓词，例如“floats”这个词，本身并不能表明这个词是用来命名相似的还是完全相同的。一个词的使用掩盖了两种不同的意向性，两种不同的身份认同。当我们确实用这个词来表示完全相同的特征时，我们就达到了一个<em>经验普遍的</em>，因为我们找到谓词的所有实例都是我们实际经历过的事情。到目前为止，我们遇到的所有木头案例都会漂浮，并且根据经验，我们以普遍的方式表达这一发现，如“木头漂浮”，但我们的证据仅限于我们的经验。我们的主张可以通过进一步的经验来证伪；可以想象，我们可能会遇到不会漂浮的木块。黑天鹅的发现能够证伪“所有天鹅都是白色”的普遍主张，因为该主张是基于经验普遍的。</p><p>2. On the second level, we come to see that the three individual pieces of wood can be said to have not just similar predicates, but the very same predicate. This level could be symbolized by the following series: A is <em>p</em>, B is <em>p</em>, C is <em>p</em>. A kind of identity synthesis now occurs in which we recognize not just similars, but the very same, a "one in many." It follows that the mere use of the word for the predicate, such as the word "floats", does not by itself indicate whether the word is being used to name similars or the very same. The use of one word masks two different kinds of intentionality, two different identifications. When we do take the word to mean the very same feature, we reach an <em>empirical universal</em>, because all the instances in which we have found the predicate are things we have actually experienced. So far, all the cases of wood we have encountered do float, and empirically we express this finding in a universal manner, as "Wood floats", but our evidence only goes so far as our experience has gone. Our claim is falsifiable by further experience; it is conceivable that we might encounter pieces of wood that do not float. The discovery of black swans was able to falsify the universal claim, "All swans are white", because the claim was based on an empirical universal.</p>

  <p>3. 在我们的第三个也是最后一个阶段，我们努力达到一个特征，即没有这个东西是不可思议的。我们试图超越经验性的普遍性，超越必然性而不仅仅是规律性。为了做到这一点，我们从感知进入想象领域。我们从实际经验到扶手椅哲学思考。如果我们成功了，我们将获得一种本质的直觉。</p><p>3. In our third and final stage, we strive to reach a feature that it would be inconceivable for the thing to be without. We try to move beyond empirical to eidetic universals, to necessities and not just regularities. In order to do so, we move from perception into the realm of imagination. We go from actual experience to armchair philosophizing. If we are successful, we will have achieved an eidetic intuition.</p>

  <p>我们按以下方式进行。我们专注于我们已经达到的普遍性。我们假设了一个普遍类型的例子。然后，我们尝试想象对象的变化，这个过程称为<em>想象变化</em>. 我们让我们的想象力自由发挥，我们看到我们可以在它“粉碎”或“爆炸”之前从事物中去除哪些元素。我们试图突破界限，扩大所讨论事物的范围。如果我们可以丢弃一些特征并仍然保留对象，我们就知道这些特征不属于事物的特征。然而，如果我们遇到无法在不破坏事物的情况下移除的特征，我们就会意识到这些特征对于它来说是必不可少的。例如，如果我们试图想象一个感知到的物体，它不会随着我们靠近它而变大，而随着我们远离它而变小，我们会说我们不再感知到一个物质的、空间的物体：作为接近和撤退的函数的空间扩张和收缩是空间事物感知的基本特征。如果我试图想象别人的经历出现在我的记忆中，我会发现这样的事情是不可能的：只有我自己的经历才能被我记住。如果我们试图想象没有连续性的时间，或者没有修辞方面的言语，我们就会发现这样的事情是不可能的。当我们遇到这样的不可能时，我们就成功地获得了一种本质的直觉。我们证明了一个本质。我们获得了一种比在经验普遍性中获得的那种“更必要”的认同。我们知道，与木头漂浮和天鹅是白色的事实相比，这些事情“必须是”更强烈。当我们达到本质的直觉时，我们看到，如果所讨论的事情不是这样，那将是不可想象的。进入想象给了我们比经验归纳更深刻的洞察力。</p><p>We proceed in the following manner. We focus on a universal that we have reached. We posit an instance of that universal kind. We then attempt to imagine changes in the object, in a process called <em>imaginative variation</em>. We let our imagination run free, and we see what elements we could remove from the thing before it "shatters" or "explodes" as the kind of thing that it is. We try to push the boundaries, to expand the envelope of the thing in question. If we can discard some features and still preserve the object, we know that those features do not belong to the eidos of the thing. However, if we run into features that we cannot remove without destroying the thing, we realize that these features are eidetically necessary to it. If, for example, we tried to imagine a perceived object that did not get larger as we came closer and smaller as we went farther from it, we would say we are no longer perceiving a material, spatial object: spatial expansion and contraction as a function of approach and withdrawal are essential features in the perception of spatial things. If I tried to imagine someone else's experiences arising within my memories, I would see that such a thing is not possible: only my own experiences can be remembered by me. If we tried to imagine time without succession, or speech without a rhetorical aspect, we would see that such things could not be. When we bump up against such impossibilities, we have succeeded in reaching an eidetic intuition. We evidence an essence. We achieve an identification that is "more necessary" than the kind achieved in empirical universals. We know that such things "must be" in a stronger way than things like the facts that wood floats and swans are white. When we reach an eidetic intuition, we see that it would be inconceivable for the thing in question to be otherwise. The move into imagination gives us a deeper insight than does empirical induction.</p>

  <p>逼真的直觉并不容易。它需要强大的想象力。为了能够尝试想象不可能的事情，并看到它是不可能的，因此不能被思考，这要求我们能够超越我们习以为常的事物，我们经常经历的事物。我们大多数人都生活在经验普遍性中；我们理所当然地认为事情将是我们一直经历的样子，但我们没有通过试图想象它们不是这样来检验它们的必要性。为了能够在习惯和经验中找出本质，需要创造性的想象力。例如，当牛顿引入绝对时空作为宇宙的一种永恒容器时发生的时空变换，以及发生在相对论中的空间和时间的进一步转变，都是基于牛顿和爱因斯坦能够执行的富有想象力的变化，对本质直觉的尝试。那些人有想象力来预测这种新的可能性。他们将空间和时间推向了习惯和接受的范围之外。显然，不是每个人都能做这样的事情。</p><p>Eidetic intuition is not easy. It calls for great strength of imagination. To be able to try to imagine the impossible, and to see that it is impossible and therefore cannot be thought, demands that we be able to go beyond the things we are accustomed to, the things we have regularly experienced. Most of us live in empirical universals; we take it for granted that things will be the way we have always experienced them to be, but we have not tested their necessity by trying to imagine their being otherwise. To be able to ferret out the eidetic within the customary and the empirical requires creative imagination. For example, the transformation of space and time that occurred when Newton introduced absolute space and time as a kind of eternal container for the universe, and the further transformation of space and time that occurred in the theory of relativity, were attempts at eidetic intuitions, based on imaginative variations that Newton and Einstein were able to perform. Those men had the imagination to project this new possibility. They pushed space and time beyond the customary and the received. Obviously, not everyone can do this sort of thing.</p>

  <p>虚构的变化发生在小说中，其中想象的情况与普通情况不同，但有助于提出必要性。他们展示了事情必须如何。并不是人们只是想象奇怪的设置。纯粹幻想的投射很容易，但如果要有洞察力，必须发生的事情是在想象的环境中必须揭示一种必然性。为此，必须巧妙地设计出富有想象力的变化；我们必须有才能知道什么样的富有想象力的演讲才能奏效。想象力让我们瞥见了必然性。<em>希腊人称之为nous</em>的洞察力是我们通过富有想象力的努力而获得的回报。</p><p>Imaginative variations occur in fiction, where circumstances are imagined that depart from the ordinary but serve to bring out a necessity. They show how things have to be. It is not the case that one just imagines bizarre settings. The purely fantastic projection is easy enough, but what must happen if there is to be insight is that within the imaginative circumstance a necessity has to be brought to light. For this to occur, the imaginative variation has to be cleverly contrived; we must have the talent to know what imaginative presentation will do the trick. Imagination gives us a glimpse of necessity. That insight, which the Greeks called <em>nous</em>, is the reward we get for our imaginative effort.</p>

  <p>因此，必须做两件事：超越可能的想象力投射，以及我们所投射的不可能的洞察力。在我们试图想象的不可能的情况下，一种必然性浮出水面。这些要求甚至在科幻小说中也能找到。最奇特的情况是想象出来的，但在这些情况下，基本的人类交流似乎都在反复出现：诚实与欺骗、谨慎与愚蠢、勇敢与怯懦。只要描述了理性主体，这些行为似乎就不可避免，而且当发现它们甚至在遥远未来或宇宙空间的奇异环境中持续存在时，它们的必要性就会暴露出来。我们可以想象人类生活在宇宙飞船而不是地球上，但是我们无法想象他们没有相互交流的可能性，或者没有勇气、鲁莽或懦弱的能力。科幻小说值得注意的地方不在于它的场景和技术与我们有多么不同，而在于主人公与我们有多么相似。</p><p>Two things must be done, therefore: the imaginative projection beyond what is possible, and the insight that what we have projected cannot be. A necessity comes to light in the impossibility of what we tried to imagine. These requirements are found even in science fiction. The most outlandish circumstances are imagined, but within them the basic human exchanges all seem to recur: honesty and deceit, prudence and foolishness, courage and cowardice. Such actions seem to be inevitable so long as rational agents are being depicted, and their necessity comes to light when they are found to persist even in the exotic settings of the remote future or cosmic space. We can imagine human beings living in spaceships instead of on earth, but we could not imagine them without the possibility of communicating with one another or without the ability to be courageous, rash, or cowardly. What is noteworthy about science fiction is not how different its locale and technology are from ours, but how much like us the protagonists are.</p>

  <p>哲学中到处都在使用想象的变化和本质的洞察力。因为它们涉及幻想，所以它们给人的印象是哲学处理的是不真实的情况。然而，哲学想像的目的不是编造奇异的场景，而是利用这些预测来揭示某些事物的必然性：例如，表明人类在公民生活中找到了道德的完美，或者物质的事物涉及因果网络，或者空间和时间涉及彼此之外的部分，或者人类行为和人类创造之间存在差异，<em>实践</em>和<em>poiēsis之间存在差异</em>. 这些本质上的必然性比经验真理更深刻、更强大。事实上，它们是如此深刻和强大，以至于人们普遍认为它们是理所当然的，没有理由坚持它们。当这样的真理被哲学家表述出来时，它们可能会激起另一种对哲学的普遍抱怨，即它处理的是最明显的琐事。为什么需要说明如此明显的事情？到底有谁会质疑他们？</p><p>Imaginative variation and eidetic insight are used everywhere in philosophy. Because they involve fantasy, they give the impression that philosophy deals with unreal situations. The point of philosophical imagination, however, is not to concoct fantastic scenarios, but to use these projections to bring out the inexorable necessity of certain things: to show that, say, human beings find their moral perfection in civic life, or that material things involve networks of causation, or that space and time involve parts that are outside one another, or that there is a difference between human action and human making, between <em>praxis</em> and <em>poiēsis</em>. These eidetic necessities are deeper and stronger than empirical truths. In fact, they are so deep and strong that people generally take them for granted and see no reason to assert them. When such truths become formulated by philosophers, they may provoke another common complaint against philosophy, that it deals with the most patent trivialities. Why do such obvious things need to be stated? Who on earth would ever question them?</p>

  <p>出于两个原因需要说明它们。首先，尽管它们很明显，但有些人确实否认它们。例如，有人说，人的成就是在经济生活中实现的，而不是在道德和政治生活中实现的，或者说没有感知，或者说时间是虚幻的，或者说没有真理和证据这样的东西。智者派在哲学刚刚开始的时候就提出了其中一些主张，他们或他们的等价物总是存在于人类生活中。哲学总​​是不得不回忆那些显而易见的事情，因为人们实际上确实忽略甚至否认了它们。哲学必须捍卫自然态度的真实意见。</p><p>They need to be stated for two reasons. First, despite their obviousness, some people do deny them. There are people who say, for example, that human fulfillment is achieved in the economic life rather than the moral and political, or that there are no perceptions, or that time is illusory, or that there are no such things as truth and evidence. The Sophists made some of these claims when philosophy was just beginning, and they or their equivalent are always around in human life. Philosophy always has to recall things that are obvious because people do in fact overlook or even deny them. Philosophy has to defend the true opinions of the natural attitude.</p>

  <p>但是除了这个保护任务之外，哲学出于第二个更积极的原因陈述了它的“琐碎”。意识到本质上的必需品是人类的满足感。我们很高兴去思考它们。他们很高兴知道。如果一些作家可以运用他们的想象力来洞察必须发生的事情，他们就会帮助我们看到永恒的事物。不是每个人都想看到这些东西，但我们中的许多人都想看到这些东西，对那些能够享受它的人来说，洞察本质的必需品本身就是一种理由。</p><p>But besides this protective task, philosophy states its "trivialities" for a second, more positive reason. It is humanly gratifying to become aware of eidetic necessities. It gives us pleasure to contemplate them. They are good to know. If some writers can use their imaginations to generate insight into what has to be, they help us see the eternal things. Not everyone wants to see these things, but many of us do, and insight into eidetic necessities is its own justification for those who are able to enjoy it.</p>

  <p>因此，哲学被错误地指责为处理奇异的事情或处理琐碎的事情。提出这些指责是因为哲学利用了本质的直觉，这种直觉运用想象力来揭示事物的本来面目。</p><p>Philosophy is falsely accused, then, of dealing either with the fantastic or with the trivial. These reproaches are made because philosophy makes use of eidetic intuition, which employs imagination to bring out the way things have to be.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_12.xhtml.heading_id_4"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_12.xhtml.ch12_fcei"></a>对本质直觉的进一步评论</h2><h2><a></a>FURTHER COMMENTS ON EIDETIC INTUITION</h2>

  <p>这个讨论给出了本质直觉是什么的一般概念。关于这种直觉和导致它的三个阶段，可以提出许多进一步的细节。让我们花点时间浏览一下这种意向性形式。</p><p>This discussion has given a general idea of what eidetic intuition is. There are many further details that can be brought out concerning such intuition and the three stages that lead to it. Let us spend a few moments browsing through this form of intentionality.</p>

  <p>我们区分了第一阶段和第二阶段，在第一阶段我们仅体验相似的事物，在第二阶段我们体验经验性的普遍性。只有在第二个层面上，个体的完整意义才会为我们升起。只有当我们获得真正普遍性的意义时，例如“红色”或“浮动”或“正方形”，在许多情况下都是相同的，我们才能获得在该普遍性下的个体或特殊性的对比意义。在第一个层面上，我们体验到个人，但我们还没有将他们视为个人。他们的个体感还没有为我们建构起来，因为我们需要普遍性的衬托才能做到这一点。</p><p>We distinguished a first stage, in which we experience merely similar things, and a second, in which we experience empirical universals. Only on the second level does the full sense of an individual arise for us. Only when we reach the sense of a true universal, such as "red" or "floats" or "square", as identically the same in many instances, do we attain the contrasting sense of an individual or a particular under that universal. On the first level we experience individuals, but we do not yet see them as individuals. Their sense of being individual has not yet been constituted for us, because we need the foil of the universal for this to happen.</p>

  <p>在第一个层次上，我们只体验到相似之处，我们可能会在很多情况下使用同一个词，但这个词是被类似地使用的。一个孩子可能会称所有男人为“爸爸”或“叔叔”，或者在各种情况下都使用“去”这个词，但在这样做时他并没有使用这个词来表达任何单一或具体的意思。在此阶段，心中充斥着相似性，还未生出普遍与单一的区别。这种意向性水平被淹没在联想中，并没有达到准确的识别。此外，联想水平作为我们更高意向性的一种基础，与我们同在。即使在我们成熟的思维中，我们有时也会退回到这些原始阶段，当我们陷入含糊不清或为新情况寻找正确的词或正确的比喻时。本质的直觉将我们带入柏拉图形式的领域；它把我们带到了第 5 本书中描述的分界线的最高部分<em>共和国</em>；但是联想层面，也就是单纯的相似性领域，将我们置于那条线的最低部分，我们生活在虚无缥缈的图像之中。但是，无论我们多么喜欢生活在形式之中，我们都不会放弃较低层次的表象，只有通过它们我们才能达到更高的可理解性。</p><p>On the first level, where we experience only similars, we may use the same word for many instances, but the word is being used analogously. A child may call all men "daddy" or "uncle", or use the word "go" for all sorts of situations, but in doing so he does not use the term to express anything univocal or specific. At this stage, the mind is awash in similarities, and the distinction between universal and singular has not yet arisen. This level of intentionality is submerged in association and does not reach exact identifications. The associative level, furthermore, remains with us as a kind of foundation for our higher intentionalities. Even in our mature thinking, we sometimes fall back into these primitive stages, when we lapse into vagueness or when we search for the right word or the right metaphor for a new situation. Eidetic intuition moves us into the domain of the Platonic forms; it takes us into the highest section of the Divided Line described in book 5 of the <em>Republic</em>; but the associative level, the domain of mere similarities, places us in the lowest section of that line, where we live among insubstantial images. But no matter how much we may enjoy living among the forms, we never abandon the appearances on the lower levels, and only through them can we come to the higher intelligibilities.</p>

  <p>我们的本质直觉并不总是成功。当我们没有时，我们可能认为我们有。我们的尝试可能会失败。我们可能会过头。我们可能会想象一些新的东西，并认为我们已经揭示了所讨论事物的一些必要的东西，但我们可能错了：我们可能已经陷入了没有本质的纯粹幻想。苏格拉底想象一个城市，妇女、儿童和财产将在其中共享。他认为他已经发现了关于人类家庭和财产的真相，但亚里士多德批评他将纯粹的幻想误认为是真实的（<em>政治</em>2.6). 牛顿关于绝对时间和空间的假设可能会被批评为过度，夸大了可能的情况。霍布斯将人想象成一种纯自然状态，然后想象一种契约，这种契约建立了一个统治完全平等的臣民的主权；他认为他正在发现人和社会的真实本质，但他很可能在没有洞察力的情况下陷入了幻想。苏格拉底的城邦、霍布斯的君主、马克思主义的乌托邦、笛卡尔的意识和数学上的理想自然都因想象力过剩而受苦。它们是错位的直觉，幻想的项目，而不是我们真实生活的世界的表达。</p><p>We do not always succeed in our eidetic intuitions. We may think we have one when we do not. Our attempt may misfire. We may overshoot. We may imagine something new and think we have revealed something necessary about the thing in question, but we may be mistaken: we may have slipped into sheer fantasy without essentials. Socrates imagines a city in which women, children, and property will be held in common. He thinks he has discovered a truth about human families and possessions, but Aristotle criticizes him for mistaking pure fantasy for what could be real (<em>Politics</em> 2.6). Newton's postulation of absolute time and space may be criticized as an excess, as an overstatement of what could possibly be. Hobbes imagines man into a state of pure nature and then imagines a contract that establishes a sovereign who rules over perfectly equal subjects; he thinks he is discovering the true nature of man and society, but he may well have drifted off into fantasy without insight. Socrates' city, the Hobbesian sovereign, Marxist utopias, Cartesian consciousness, and mathematically ideal nature all suffer from an excess of imagination. They are misplaced intuitions, projects of fantasy and not expressions of the world in which we truly live.</p>

  <p>当我们在本质论上犯了错误，当我们把只是一种幻想的投射视为必然真实时，我们恰恰在本质上的必然性方面犯了错误。我们在简单事实或经验普遍性方面没有犯错。我们犯了一个“哲学上”的错误，而不是事实判断错误、错觉或记忆失误。并非所有的想象变化都是成功的，当它们失败时，它们也不会变成另一种意向性。它们仍然是一种对本质直觉的尝试，但失败了。因为真实的直觉与想象力一起工作，所以它会玩火：很容易让我们的想象力失控。</p><p>When we err in regard to eidetics, when we take as necessarily true what is only a fantastic projection, we have made a mistake precisely in regard to an eidetic necessity. We have not erred in regard to simple facts or empirical universals. We have made a "philosophical" mistake, not an error in factual judgment, a misperception, or a failure in memory. Not all imaginative variations are successful, and when they fail they do not turn into another kind of intentionality. They remain an attempt at an eidetic intuition, but a failed one. Because eidetic intuition works with imagination, it plays with fire: it is easy to let our imagination run out of control.</p>

  <p>我们如何纠正本质直觉中的错误？通过与他人谈论它们，通过想象反例，最重要的是通过观察我们的本质建议如何符合我们在达到本质之前已经确定的经验普遍性。经验共相是在我们区分的三个层次中的第二个层次上构成的，它们是本质共相的基础。Eidetic universals 超越了经验，但它们依赖于它们，不应该摧毁它们。我们在本质直觉中发现的东西应该证实经验真理而不是颠覆它。经验普遍性可以控制我们的想象力。当我们说我们的哲学应该符合“常识”时，我们所诉求的是作为我们标准经验的果实的经验普遍性。</p><p>How do we correct mistakes in eidetic intuition? By talking with others about them, by imagining counterexamples, and most of all by seeing how our eidetic proposals conform to the empirical universals we had identified before we reached the eidetic. Empirical universals are constituted on the second of the three levels we have distinguished, and they serve as a foundation for eidetic universals. Eidetic universals go beyond the empirical, but they rest on them and should not destroy them. What we find in an eidetic intuition should confirm the empirical truth and not subvert it. The empirical universals serve as a control on our imaginations. When we say our philosophy should conform to "common sense", what we are appealing to are the empirical universals that are the fruit of our standard experience. Empirical universals give us a foothold in the real world, and our eidetics would fly off into unreality if it disregarded them.</p>

  <p>关于本质直觉的另一点涉及不可能的作用，消极必然性的作用。我们没有积极地看到事物和我们正在测试它的特征之间的必要联系。相反，我们通过从消极洞察力中反弹来看到必要性：我们看到事物没有特征是不可能存在的，所以我们知道特征是必不可少的；我们无法想象被剥夺的东西。消极的不可能性使本质的必然性暴露无遗。我们必须尝试不可能的事情，这一事​​实迫使我们诉诸本质直觉中的想象力；想象力可以尝试描绘不可能的事物，从而带出必要的事物，但是感知怎么可能这样做呢？</p><p>Another point to be made concerning eidetic intuition concerns the role of impossibility, of negative necessity. We do not see positively the necessary link between the thing and the feature we are testing it for. Instead, we see the necessity by a rebound from the negative insight: we see the impossibility of the thing's being without the feature, so we know the feature is essential; we could not imagine the thing being deprived of it. The negative impossibility brings the eidetic necessity to light. The fact that we must make a foray into the impossible is what forces us to appeal to the imagination in eidetic intuition; the imagination could attempt to portray the impossible and thus bring out the necessary, but how could perception ever do so?</p>

  <p>想象的变化和本质的洞察力可以在自然的态度中进行。这种<em>本质上的减少</em>关注事物的本质形式。然而，本质还原不同于先验还原，后者将我们从自然态度转向现象学态度。现象学本身利用了先验的和本质的两种还原。凭借先验还原，它沉思意向性及其客观相关物，但它也带出了这种 noes 和 noemas 的本质结构，因此进行了本质还原。它不关心我碰巧拥有的经验和对象，而是关心这些经验和对象的本质上必要的结构，因为它们对任何意识都适用。现象学旨在发现事物和思想必须如何才能发生披露。</p><p>Imaginative variation and eidetic insight can be carried out within the natural attitude. This <em>eidetic reduction</em> focuses on the essential form of things. The eidetic reduction, however, is different from the transcendental, which turns us from the natural attitude to the phenomenological. Phenomenology itself makes use of both reductions, the transcendental and the eidetic. By virtue of the transcendental reduction, it contemplates intentionality and its objective correlates, but it also brings out the eidetic structures of such noeses and noemas, and hence engages the eidetic reduction. It is concerned not with the experiences and objects that I happen to have, but with the eidetically necessary structures of such experiences and objects, as they would hold for any consciousness whatever. Phenomenology aims at discovering how things and the mind have to be for disclosure to take place.</p>

  现象学定义</h1><h1><span class="small">13</span><br><br>
  Phenomenology Defined</h1>

  <p>我们在第 11 章中对证据的检验将理性解释为被命令朝向事物的真相。理性是事物是什么的揭示和确认。即使在自然的态度中，心也会在真理中找到它的圆满。现象学，从先验的观点出发，也是一种理性的运用，也属于思维的目的论。它也被命令走向显化，但以一种不同于自然态度中出现的科学和经验的方式。我们称为“世俗”的语言用于揭示真相；“transcendentalese”也这样做，但方式不同。</p><p>Our exmination of evidence in Chapter 11 interpreted reason as being ordered toward the truth of things. Reason is the disclosure and the confirmation of what things are. Even in the natural attitude, the mind finds its completion in truth. Phenomenology, working from the transcendental viewpoint, is also an exercise of reason and shares in the teleology of thinking. It too is ordered toward manifestation, but in a way different from the science and experience that occur in the natural attitude. The language we have called "mundanese" serves to disclose truth; "transcendentalese" does so as well, but in a different way.</p>

  <p>在证据的自然成就中，在我们的日常经验和科学中，我们让事物出现在我们自己和我们交谈的社区中。我们让植物和动物、星星和原子、英雄和恶棍现身。然而，在现象学反思中，我们将注意力转向这些披露本身，转向我们已经完成的证据，并且我们思考什么是显化的与格以及什么是存在者的显化。现象学是研究真理的科学。它从我们对事物的理性参与中退后一步，惊叹于存在披露、事物确实出现、世界可以被理解以及我们在我们的思维生活中充当事物显现的与格这一事实。哲学是证明证据的艺术和科学。</p><p>In our natural achievements of evidence, in our ordinary experience and in science, we let things appear to ourselves and to the community within which we converse. We let plants and animals, stars and atoms, heroes and villains manifest themselves. In phenomenological reflection, however, we turn our focus toward these disclosures themselves, toward the evidences that we have accomplished, and we think about what it is to be datives of manifestation and what it is for beings to be manifest. Phenomenology is the science that studies truth. It stands back from our rational involvement with things and marvels at the fact that there is disclosure, that things do appear, that the world can be understood, and that we in our life of thinking serve as datives for the manifestation of things. Philosophy is the art and science of evidencing evidence.</p>

  <p>现象学还考察了真理的局限性：阻止事物被完全揭示的不可避免的“另一面”，伴随证据的错误和模糊，以及使我们有必要总是再次记住我们已经知道的事物的沉淀。现象学承认这些对真理的干扰，但它不会让它们把它逼向绝望。它只将它们视为干扰，而不是我们存在的实质。它坚持认为，伴随着这些阴影，真相和证据得以实现，而理性在让事情显露出来的过程中找到了它的完美。理性不会在错误、混乱和健忘中完善自己。</p><p>Phenomenology also examines the limitations of truth: the inescapable "other sides" that keep things from ever being fully disclosed, the errors and vagueness that accompany evidence, and the sedimentation that makes it necessary for us always to remember again the things we already know. Phenomenology acknowledges these disturbances of truth, but it does not let them drive it to despair. It sees them just as disturbances and not as the substance of our being. It insists that along with these shadows, truth and evidence are achieved, and that reason finds its perfection in letting things come to light. Reason does not perfect itself in error, confusion, and forgetfulness.</p>

  <p>当我们对我们的自然态度及其所有参与采取新的立场时，哲学就开始了。当我们从事哲学时，我们会退后一步，思考什么是真实和获得证据。我们思索自然的态度，因此我们采取一种外在于它的观点。这种后退的举动是通过先验还原来完成的。我们不是简单地关注对象及其特征，而是考虑被揭示的事物与它们被显化的对象之间的相关性。在先验还原中，我们还进行本质还原并表达结构，这些结构不仅适用于我们自己，也适用于参与证据和真理的每一个主体性。</p><p>Philosophy begins when we take up a new stance toward our natural attitude and all its involvements. When we engage in philosophy, we stand back and contemplate what it is to be truthful and to achieve evidence. We contemplate the natural attitude, and hence we take up a viewpoint outside it. This move of standing back is done through the transcendental reduction. Instead of being simply concerned with objects and their features, we think about the correlation between the things being disclosed and the dative to whom they are manifested. Within the transcendental reduction, we also carry out an eidetic reduction and express structures that hold not just for ourselves, but for every subjectivity that is engaged in evidencing and truth.</p>

  <p>我们在第 4 章考察了哲学思想，在那里我们详细探讨了先验还原。我们现在可以从一个稍微不同的角度来审视哲学的本质：我们将利用在第 7 章中发展的一些思想，在这些思想中我们看到命题和概念不需要被设定为心理事物或中介概念实体。我们在那一章注意到，一个命题是响应一种特殊类型的反思而产生的，我们称之为“命题”或“断言”反思。当我们把一种事态看作是由某人提出的时候，这种事态就变成了一个命题或一种感觉。我们改变它的状态；它不仅会变成事物的本来面目，还会变成某人表达和呈现事物的方式。这些由命题反思构成的命题，然后成为正确真理的候选人。当它们可以被取消引用并与事物本身的直接证据混合时，它们被说成是真实的判断。</p><p>We examined philosophical thinking in Chapter 4, where we explored the transcendental reduction at length. We can now examine the nature of philosophy from a slightly different angle: we will make use of some thoughts developed in Chapter 7, where we saw that propositions and concepts need not be posited as mental things or mediating conceptual entities. We noted in that chapter that a proposition arises in response to a special kind of reflection, one that we called "propositional" or "apophantic" reflection. A state of affairs is turned into a proposition or a sense when we take that state of affairs as being proposed by someone. We change its status; it becomes not just the way things are, but the way someone has articulated and presented them. Such propositions, constituted by propositional reflection, then become candidates for the truth of correctness. They are said to be true judgments when they can be disquoted and blended with the direct evidence of things themselves.</p>

  <p>我们在本章要做的是通过将哲学反思与命题反思进行对比，更准确地发现什么是哲学反思。两种形式的反思，即命题的和哲学的，经常相互混淆。由于这种混淆，哲学思维的特殊性经常被误解。我们将指出哲学反思和命题反思之间的区别，这些区别将帮助我们更清楚地确定现象学探究的本质。</p><p>What we will do in the present chapter is to discover more precisely what philosophical reflection is by contrasting it with propositional reflection. The two forms of reflection, the propositional and the philosophical, are often confused with one another. Because of this confusion, the special character of philosophical thinking is frequently misunderstood. We will bring out the differences between philosophical and propositional reflection, and these distinctions will help us pin down more clearly the nature of phenomenological inquiry.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_13.xhtml.heading_id_3"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_13.xhtml.ch13_ds"></a>范围差异</h2><h2><a></a>DIFFERENCES IN SCOPE</h2>

  <p>我们生活在这个世界上并表达事物，无论是在理论上还是在实践中。假设你和我正在谈论一所房子。在许多其他陈述中，您说这所房子已有 50 年历史。我一直在听你说话，不假思索地附和你所说的一切，我一直在你的指导下阐明这个世界，但现在这个断言让我停下来。好像不太对。我打断了我天真地接受你所说的一切；我切换到命题模式：我认为这座房子已有 50 年历史，而不仅仅是事情的本来面目，而只是你所呈现的样子。我换挡；我进入命题反思。我在房子有五十年的历史前后加上了引号。我不把这种事态当做一个明显的事实，而是当做你的命题，你的意思，你的话的意义。我把事情的状态看作是被提议的，被你提出来的。原本的事态变成了命题。</p><p>We live in the world and articulate things, whether in theoretic or in practical contexts. Suppose you and I are conversing about a house. Among many other statements, you say that the house is fifty years old. I have been listening to you and unreflectively going along with everything you said, and I have been articulating the world under your guidance, but now this assertion makes me pause. It does not seem quite right. I interrupt my naive acceptance of everything you say; I switch into the propositional mode: I take the house as being fifty years old not simply as the way things are, but only as you are presenting them. I shift gears; I move into a propositional reflection. I put quotation marks around the house's being fifty years old. I treat that state of affairs not as an evident fact but as your proposition, your meaning, the sense of your words. I treat the state of affairs as merely being proposed, as being presented by you. The original state of affairs has become a proposition.</p>

  <p>假设我的进一步体验使我同意这所房子已有五十年的历史。然后我取消引用我放在引号中的内容。我放弃命题反思。我意识到这个命题是正确的，它符合实际情况，符合可以直接提供的证据。命题（所提议的事态）与事实相融合，被认为是真实的。另一方面，假设我进一步的体验和询问使我得出结论，这所房子不是五十年，而是只有二十年。然后我会在房子五十年的历史上加上引号；我会看到这个命题，你的命题，是假的，它不能被反引并再次成为一个简单的事实，它不能享有正确的真理。它作为真理的候选者被丢弃。这只是一个提议，只是提议的事态，只是你的意见，不可能是其他任何东西。在这种情况下，我不能再放松我的命题反思，把你说的当成事情的本来面目。</p><p>Suppose that my further experiencing leads me to agree that the house is fifty years old. Then I disquote what I had put into quotation marks. I abandon the propositional reflection. I realize that the proposition is correct, that it identifies with what is the case, with what can be given in straightforward evidence. The proposition (the state of affairs taken as proposed) blends with the fact and is seen to be true. On the other hand, suppose that my further experiencing and inquiry lead me to conclude that the house is not fifty years old but only twenty. Then I would rivet the quotation marks to the house's being fifty years old; I would see that the proposition, your proposition, is false, that it cannot be disquoted and made into a simple fact again, that it cannot enjoy the truth of correctness. It is discarded as a candidate for truth. It is only a proposition, only a state of affairs as proposed, only your opinion, and it could not be anything else. I can no longer relax my propositional reflection in this instance and take what you say as simply the way things are.</p>

  <p>这种在事态和命题之间来回移动，在作为简单的事态和作为仅仅提议的事态之间来回移动，是一项高度复杂的人类成就。它是人类理性的重要组成部分。我们无法想象没有这种能力的理性动物；一个失去这种能力的实体将不具备理性。非人类动物无法命题化事态，除非以最基本的方式；他们不能进行命题式的反思，也不能将一种情况仅仅看作是某人提出的或证实某人所说的话。这种在真实、看似、所说和证实之间的曲折运动铭刻在人类语言的语法中，如“我声称<em>p</em> ”、“你说<em>q</em>"、"你说的是真 [或假]"，以及许多其他语法维度。</p><p>This movement back and forth between the state of affairs and the proposition, between the state of affairs as simply taken and as taken as merely proposed, is a highly sophisticated human achievement. It is an essential part of human reason. We could not imagine a rational animal that failed to have this power; an entity bereft of this ability would not possess reason. Nonhuman animals cannot propositionalize a state of affairs except perhaps in the most rudimentary way; they cannot reflect propositionally and see a situation as merely being presented by someone or as confirming what someone has said. This zig-zag motion between what is, what seems, what is said, and what confirms is inscribed in the grammar of human languages, in phrases such as "I claim that <em>p</em>", "You say that <em>q</em>", "What you said is true [or false]", and in many other dimensions of syntax.</p>

  <p>我们转移到命题反思的能力使我们能够与我们所涉及的任何问题保持距离。当我们陷入关于某事的谈话中时，甚至当我们自己在思考一个问题时，我们可以转移到命题模式，并把正在呈现的东西<em>仅仅</em>当作呈现，当作一个命题或一种意义，而不是事物本来的样子。转变为命题模式，然后确认或否定所说内容的能力，使我们成为负责任的演讲者，可以说“我”并将自己标识为这种或那种主张真理的代理人。</p><p>Our ability to shift into propositional reflection allows us to take a distance toward any issue we are involved in. When we are caught up in a conversation about something, and even when we are thinking about an issue by ourselves, we can shift into the propositional mode and take what is being presented as <em>merely</em> presented, as just a proposition or a sense and not the way things simply are. The ability to shift into the propositional mode, and then to confirm or disconfirm what has been said, establishes us as responsible speakers who can say "I" and identity ourselves as the agents of this or that claim to truth.</p>

  <p>然而，这种转向命题反思并运用它使之成为可能的真理的能力，尽管它作为我们理性本性的象征可能是光荣的，但与转向哲学反思的能力并不相同。我们必须区分命题和哲学反思。如果我们成功做到这一点，我们将对命题和哲学领域有更好的理解。</p><p>However, this ability to shift into propositional reflection and to exercise the kind of truth that it makes possible, glorious as it may be as an emblem of our rational nature, is not the same as the ability to move into philosophical reflection. We must distinguish propositional from philosophical reflection. If we succeed in doing so, we will gain a much better understanding of both the propositional and the philosophical domain.</p>

  <p>当我进行命题反思时，当我把房子的五十年仅仅作为你的命题时，我<em>只反思</em>关于这一种情况：房子已经五十年了。其他一切都留在原地，没有反映出来：你在那里作为我的对话者，我在这里作为你的对话者，我们发出的声音，树木，草坪，天空，天气，房子本身是白色的，木制的，殖民风格。我也原地不动，不加思索，不加思索地保留我所有更具体的信念背后的世界信念。当我提出命题时，我与一个特定的显着事态保持距离，甚至与其中的一组事态保持距离，但我的反思性批判却完全没有触及无限量的事态、事物和背景。他们的 doxic 质量保持不变。它们都作为一种地板保留在原地，我在上面找到了我需要的杠杆来反思我变成一个命题的简单事态。</p><p>When I engage in a propositional reflection, when I take the house's being fifty years old as merely your proposition, I reflect <em>only</em> on this one state of affairs: on the house's being fifty years old. Everything else is left in place and not reflected upon: your being there as my interlocutor, my being here as yours, the sounds we make, the trees, the lawn, the sky, the weather, the house itself as white, wooden, and colonial in style. I also leave in place, undisturbed and without reflection, the world belief that underlies all my more particular convictions. When I propositionalize, I take a distance to a particular salient state of affairs, or even to a group of them, but my reflective critique leaves an unlimited array of states of affairs, things, and contexts totally untouched. Their doxic quality stays intact. They all remain in place as a kind of floor on which I find the leverage I need to reflect on the simple state of affairs I turn into a proposition.</p>

  <p>另一方面，当我进行哲学反思时，当我进行现象学还原时，我以自然的态度与绝对的一切保持距离：不仅仅是房子已经五十年了，而是整个房子、树木、草坪，你我作为健谈者，天气，地球，天空，星星，太阳和月亮，甚至是所有这些事物背后的世界和与之相关的世界信仰。这是报复性的反省；这是全面的反思。没有遗漏任何东西。我们与一切事物保持距离，甚至与世界本身以及拥有世界的我们自己保持距离。我们不会坚持多种信念作为赋予我们影响力的基础；我们没有立足之地。我们不会让任何信念保持不变。所有这些，即使是最基本的，被暂停和反思。这种包罗万象的反思是哲学的；更受限制的反思是命题。</p><p>On the other hand, when I engage in philosophical reflection, when I exercise the phenomenological reduction, I take a distance toward absolutely everything in the natural attitude: not just the house's being fifty years old, but the whole house, the trees, the lawn, you and me as conversationalists, the weather, the earth, the sky, the stars, the sun and moon, and even the world that underlies all these things and the world belief that is its correlate. This is reflection with a vengeance; it is wholesale reflection. Nothing is left out. We take a distance toward everything, even to the world as such and ourselves as having a world. We do not hold on to several beliefs as a base to give us leverage; we do not retain a floor to stand on. We do not leave any convictions untouched. All of them, even the most basic, are suspended and reflected upon. This all-encompassing reflection is philosophical; the more restricted reflection is propositional.</p>

  <p>那么，哲学反思和命题反思之间的最初区别是范围之一：哲学反思是普遍的，命题反思是有限的，并且只针对这种或那种事态。</p><p>The initial difference between philosophical and propositional reflection, then, is one of scope: philosophical reflection is universal, propositional reflection is limited and targeted just toward this or that state of affairs.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_13.xhtml.heading_id_4"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_13.xhtml.ch13_dk"></a>实物差异</h2><h2><a></a>DIFFERENCES IN KIND</h2>

  <p>“那么好吧”，你可能会问，“命题反思和哲学反思的区别仅仅是前者是有限的而后者是全面的吗？命题反思是否只处理这种或那种事态，而哲学反思则处理与绝对一切？哲学只是命题反思扩大到涵盖我们所拥有的任何和所有信念吗？它们都是同一种反思吗？它们只是在范围上有所不同吗？</p><p>"All right then", you might ask, "is the difference between propositional and philosophical reflection just the fact that the former is limited and the latter is comprehensive? Does propositional reflection deal only with this or that state of affairs, while philosophical reflection deals with absolutely everything? Is philosophy just the propositional reflection enlarged to cover any and all convictions that we have? Are they both the same kind of reflection, and do they differ only in their range?"</p>

  <p>这个问题的答案是否定的。命题和哲学反思的区别不仅仅在于它们的外延。它们是不同类型的反射，它们在以下方面有所不同。</p><p>The answer to this question is negative. Propositional and philosophical reflection do not differ only in their extension. They are different kinds of reflection, and they differ in the following way.</p>

  <p>命题反思是为了检验由此产生的命题的真实性。它的执行是为了让我们能够验证已成为问题的提案。命题反思有一些务实的东西。我们执行它是为了更准确地找出是什么情况。如果我们发现这个命题是真的，我们会再次接受它，并通过确认带来的新的、更有力的证据，但如果我们发现它是假的，我们就会拒绝它。它变成了一个被丢弃的、错误的判断。命题反思是为了真理的利益，为了验证的利益而进行的。当我们转向命题模式时，我们对真理的总体兴趣永远不会被抵消。</p><p>A propositional reflection is carried out in order to test the truth of the proposition that emerges from it. It is carried out so that we can verify a proposal that has become questionable. There is something pragmatic about propositional reflection. We execute it in order to find out more accurately what is the case. If we find out that the proposition is true, we accept it again, with the new, stronger evidence that the confirmation brings, but if we find out that it is false, we reject it. It becomes a discarded, erroneous judgment. Propositional reflection is carried on in the interest of truth, in the interest of verification. Our overall truth interest is never neutralized when we shift into the propositional mode.</p>

  <p>另一方面，哲学反思并不是出于这种务实的原因而进行的。这样做不是为了验证或伪造索赔。它更纯粹地沉思，更纯粹地超然。当我们在哲学上与我们所有的信念（包括我们的世界信念）以及赋予我们意向性的一切（包括世界）保持距离时，我们并没有将所有这些信念和事物放在引号中，直到我们能够验证它们是否真实. 他们并没有像我们暂停命题那样被暂停。它们被中和了，但只能被考虑，而不是被验证。</p><p>Philosophical reflection, on the other hand, is not carried out for such pragmatic reasons. It is not done in order to verify or falsify a claim. It is more purely contemplative, more purely detached. When we take a distance philosophically toward all our convictions, including our world belief, and toward everything given to our intentionality, including the world, we are not putting all these convictions and things into quotation marks until we can verify whether or not they are true. They are not being suspended in the way we suspend propositions. They are neutralized, but only to be contemplated, not to be verified.</p>

  <p>当我们命题化事态时，当我们进入<em>命题</em>反思时，我们质疑事态。我们不再断言。我们改变了它的形式：它是一种信念，但现在我们让它变得可疑或至少是值得怀疑的。当我们进入<em>哲学</em>反思，我们不会改变我们在自然态度中所拥有的信念的形式。我们与它们保持距离，因此我们会沉思，此刻不会分享它们，但我们不会让它们怀疑或质疑。我们不会尝试验证或伪造它们。我们只是想一想它们，并试图梳理出它们的意图结构和目的论。当我们进入哲学时，我们让一切保持原样。我们不试图改变我们的前哲学观点或验证或证据。我们必须让一切保持原样，否则我们会改变我们想要检查的东西。</p><p>When we propositionalize a state of affairs, when we enter into <em>propositional</em> reflection, we question the state of affairs. We do not assert it any longer. We change its modality: it was a conviction, but now we make it doubtful or at least questionable. When we enter into <em>philosophical</em> reflection, we do not change the modality of the convictions we have in the natural attitude. We take a distance to them, and hence we contemplate and do not, at the moment, share in them, but we do not make them doubtful or questionable. We do not try to verify or falsify them. We merely think about them and try to tease out their intentional structure and teleology. We leave everything as it was when we enter into philosophy. We do not try to transform our prephilosophical opinions or verifications or evidences. We must leave everything as it was, for otherwise we would change the very thing we wish to examine.</p>

  <p>以一种不应被误解的方式，哲学对自然态度中发现的真理或谬误漠不关心。哲学思考真理，但它也承认作为自然态度的一部分的虚假、模糊、空洞的意图和错误，它并不试图抹去这些伴随真理而来的阴影。它承认他们在追求真理的过程中是不可避免的。它不会接管并试图摆脱它们。它不试图用自己的冷静超然和更清醒的观点来取代自然态度的观点。它不会成为帝国主义，也不会声称它的真理模式是唯一存在的模式。</p><p>In a manner that should not be taken amiss, philosophy is indifferent to the truth or falsity found in the natural attitude. Philosophy contemplates the truthful, but it also recognizes the falsity, vagueness, empty intentions, and error that are part of the natural attitude, and it does not try to erase these shadows that accompany truth. It acknowledges their inevitability in the quest for truth. It does not take over and try to get rid of them. It does not try to substitute its own perspective, with its calm detachment and greater lucidity, for the perspectives of the natural attitude. It does not become imperialistic and does not claim that its mode of truth is the only one there is.</p>

  <p>如果把哲学反思等同于命题反思，那么哲学的确是帝王化了。它会试图挤进我们前哲学的探究和行动中。它会试图接管。它会尝试纠正一切。它会试图清理自然态度中的混乱，包括所有的片面观点、模糊和欺骗，并试图让我们生活在纯净的光中。它会打断人类的谈话，它的声音会淹没人类的所有其他声音。如果哲学要忠于自己的命运，它就必须比这更谦虚。它是人类理性的王冠，但它必须将自己限制在自己的真理中，限制在自己纯粹沉思的目的论中；它必须避免试图取代自然态度的技能和专业知识。如果哲学家试图取代政治家、律师、科学家和工匠，他会显得很愚蠢。当然，如果专家和政治家认为他们所做的是人类理性的巅峰之作，他们也会显得很愚蠢。</p><p>If philosophical reflection were to be taken as the same as propositional reflection, then philosophy would indeed become imperial. It would try to elbow its way into our prephilosophical inquiries and actions. It would try to take over. It would try to correct everything. It would try to clean up the mess in the natural attitude, with all the partial perspectives, vagueness, and deceptions, and would try to make us live in pure light. It would intrude on the human conversation, and its voice would drown out all the other voices in the human condition. If philosophy is to be faithful to its own destiny, it has to be more modest than this. It is the crown of human rationality, but it has to restrict itself to its own kind of truth, to its own purely contemplative teleology; it must refrain from trying to substitute for the skills and expertise of the natural attitude. The philosopher would look silly if he were to try to replace statesmen, lawyers, scientists, and craftsmen. It is also true, of course, that the experts and the statesmen look silly in turn if they think that what they do is the summit of human reason.</p>

  <p>到目前为止，我们已经看到哲学反思在两个方面不同于命题反思：在范围上（前者是普遍的，而后者是有限的）和在种类上（前者仅仅是沉思而不是试图求真；后者是针对来确定陈述的正确性）。还有两个必须进一步考虑的区别。</p><p>So far, we have seen that philosophical reflection differs from propositional reflection in two ways: in scope (the former is universal while the latter is limited) and in kind (the former is merely contemplative and not an attempt to verity; the latter is geared to determining the correctness of statements). There remain two further differences that must be considered.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_13.xhtml.heading_id_5"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_13.xhtml.ch13_dbnsbq"></a>NOEMA 和 SENSE、括号和引用之间的差异</h2><h2><a></a>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NOEMA AND SENSE, BRACKETING AND QUOTING</h2>

  <p>在两种类型的反思中，哲学的和命题的，我们修改了我们的意图的客观关联被赋予我们的方式。</p><p>In both kinds of reflection, the philosophical and the propositional, we modify the way the objective correlates of our intentions are given to us.</p>

  <p>当我们转向哲学反思时，当我们进行先验还原时，我们不仅仅关心我们的意向性；我们还考虑了这种意向性的目标，即赋予我们各种意向模式（感知、记忆、想象、预期、判断等）的事物。然而，从我们的哲学观点来看，我们并没有直接和天真地关注这些对象；相反，我们准确地关注它们，因为它们是由我们以自然态度的意向性所意图或呈现的。我们不仅将它们视为事物，而且将其视为“有意的事物”。也就是说，我们将它们视为 noemas。我们以意向论的方式考虑它们。例如，从哲学的角度来看，被感知的对象恰恰被认为是被感知的，作为知觉的客观相关物，是知觉的意向项。从哲学的观点来看，被断言的事态恰如其分地被断言，作为断言的客观相关物，是断言的意向标。现象学的任务是探索意向与其对应的意向之间的相关性，即构成意向的意向活动，并让被揭示的事物呈现给我们。</p><p>When we shift into philosophical reflection, when we execute the transcendental reduction, we do not concern ourselves only with our intentionality; we also consider the targets of that intentionality, the things that are given to our various modes of intending (perception, memory, imagination, anticipation, judgment, and the rest). From our philosophical vantage point, however, we do not directly and naively focus on these objects; rather, we focus on them precisely as being intended by, or presented to, our intentionalities in the natural attitude. We consider them not simply as things, but as "things being intended". That is, we consider them as noemas. We consider them noematically. For example, the perceived object looked at from the philosophical viewpoint and considered precisely as perceived, as the objective correlate of perception, is the noema of perception. The asserted state of affairs, looked at from the philosophical viewpoint and considered precisely as asserted, as the objective correlate of assertion, is the noema of assertion. The task of phenomenology is to explore the correlations between noemas and their corresponding noeses, the intentional activities that constitute the noemas and allow the things disclosed to be presented to us.</p>

  <p>现象学还原将对象变成意向对象。相比之下，命题反思将对象转化为感官。当我开始质疑一种事态，并把它当成是你提出来的，我就把这种事态变成了一种感觉或命题。我看这和你的意思一样。然后我可以测试它的正确性。然而，作为一种感觉并不等同于作为一种意向基因。意义或命题是验证的候选对象，是正确性的真理，但意向只是哲学分析的目标。当我们进入现象学反思时，世界及其中的一切都变成了意向，但不可能将世界及其中的一切变成一种意义或命题，变成需要验证的东西。</p><p>The phenomenological reduction turns objects into noemas. Propositional reflection, in contrast, turns objects into senses. When I begin to question a state of affairs and take it as merely being proposed by you, I turn the state of affairs into a sense or a proposition. I see it just as your meaning. I can then test it for correctness. Being a sense, however, is not the same as being a noema. A sense or a proposition is a candidate for verification, for the truth of correctness, but a noema is merely the target of philosophical analysis. The world, along with everything in it, is turned into a noema when we enter into phenomenological reflection, but it would be impossible to turn the world and everything in it into a sense or a proposition, into something that needs to be verified.</p>

  <p>正如我们在第 7 章中看到的，当我们进行命题反思时，可以说我们在我们所质疑的事态周围加上了引号。你告诉我房子有五十年了，我犹豫着同意你的看法，把房子有五十年变成你的看法，“房子有五十年了”。类似于这种引用的事情也发生在现象学反思中；现象学中有一种引用，类似于以自然态度所做的引用，但必须与它们区分开来。</p><p>As we have seen in Chapter 7, when we carry out a propositional reflection, we can be said to have put quotation marks around the state of affairs we are questioning. You tell me that the house is fifty years old, and I, in my hesitation to agree with you, transform the house's being fifty years old into your opinion, "The house is fifty years old". Something analogous to this kind of citation also happens in phenomenological reflection; there is a kind of citation in phenomenology that resembles the quotations done in the natural attitude, but it must be distinguished from them.</p>

  <p>在现象学的态度中，我们不仅仅关注对象；我们恰恰将它们作为自然态度的目标，恰如其分地赋予我们自然态度中的意向性。因此，我们在哲学上说话时，在某种程度上“引用”了自然态度。当我们以自然的态度打算事物时，我们“引用”自己。但是，让我们在这里避免使用“引用”一词，以免使我们混淆。让我们遵循公认的现象学术语并说我们将<em>括号括起来</em>当我们进行哲学反思时，世界和其中的一切。我们把世界和其中的一切都放在括号或圆括号中。括号是哲学的引号。它们表达了我们在从事哲学时对事物所采取的那种距离（我们看到它们呈现给哲学前的证据），就像引号表示我们在从事哲学时对事态所采取的那种距离一样命题反思。括号表示我们将括号中的内容视为意向项，而引号表示我们将引用的内容视为意义。</p><p>In the phenomenological attitude, we do not merely focus on objects; we focus on them precisely as the targets of the natural attitude, precisely as given to our intentionalities in the natural attitude. Therefore, we in a way "quote" the natural attitude when we speak philosophically. We "quote" ourselves as we intend things in the natural attitude. But let us avoid the word "quotation" here, lest it lead us into confusion. Let us follow the accepted phenomenological terminology and say that we <em>bracket</em> the world and everything in it when we carry out philosophical reflection. We put the world and everything in it into brackets or into parentheses. Brackets are the quotation marks for philosophy. They express the kind of distance we take to things when we are engaged in philosophy (we see them as they are presented to prephilosophical evidences), just as quotation marks express the kind of distance we take to a state of affairs when we are engaged in propositional reflection. Brackets mean we are taking what is bracketed as a noema, while quotation marks mean we are taking what is quoted as a sense.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_13.xhtml.heading_id_6"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_13.xhtml.ch13_dp"></a>观点的差异</h2><h2><a></a>DIFFERENCES IN PERSPECTIVE</h2>

  <p>我们必须检查哲学反思和命题反思之间的另一个区别。我们记得命题反思是在自然态度中进行的。命题反思悬置了对一种意向性及其对象的信念，但它并不像现象学反思那样悬置我们的世界信念。如果你告诉我这房子有五十年了，如果我对那个事态进行命题反思，我仍然保持自然的态度。事情的状态（房子已经五十年了）已经变成了一个命题或一种感觉，但它本身也仍然被包裹在自然的态度中。</p><p>There is one more difference between philosophical and propositional reflection that we must examine. We recall that propositional reflection is carried out in the natural attitude. Propositional reflection suspends belief in one intentionality and its object, but it does not suspend our world belief, as phenomenological reflection does. If you tell me that the house is fifty years old, and if I exercise a propositional reflection toward that state of affairs, I still remain in the natural attitude. The state of affairs (the house's being fifty years old) has been turned into a proposition or a sense, but as such it too is still encased within the natural attitude.</p>

  <p>意义或命题本身就是一种特殊意向性的客观相关物。它是命题反映的相关物，正如被感知的对象是知觉的相关物，而被表达的对象是断言的表达的相关物。</p><p>A sense or a proposition is itself, as such, the objective correlate of a special kind of intentionality. It is the correlate of a propositional reflection, just as the perceived object is the correlate of a perception and an articulated object is the correlate of an assertive articulation.</p>

  <p>现在，当我们转向现象学态度时，我们将命题或意义视为命题反思的客观相关物。我们专注于命题或意义。命题或意义是意向项，就像任何其他意向性的任何其他客观相关物一样。事实上，我们一直在发展的关于命题域、意义域的建立的整个描述，都是从哲学反思中完成的。作为现象学家，我们指出命题或意义是响应命题反思而产生的。</p><p>Now, when we shift into the phenomenological attitude, we contemplate the proposition or sense as the objective correlate of a propositional reflection. We focus noematically upon the proposition or sense. The proposition or sense is a noema, just like any other objective correlate of any other intentionality. In fact, the entire description we have been developing of the establishment of the propositional domain, the domain of sense, was done from within philosophical reflection. It was as phenomenologists that we pointed out that a proposition or a sense arises in response to a propositional reflection.</p>

  <p>因此，现象学的反思不仅比命题的反思更激进，因为它一直切入世界信念；它也更具包容性，特别是它专注于命题反思并描述它所取得的成就。现象学反思位于命题反思之上，并解释了它的作用：它解释了命题反思如何构成命题。然而，命题反思并不能解释向现象学的转变。向现象学的转变不在命题反思的雷达屏幕上。</p><p>Thus, the phenomenological reflection is not just more radical than the propositional, in the sense that it cuts all the way down to world belief; it is also more encompassing, in the special sense that it focuses on propositional reflection and describes what it accomplishes. Phenomenological reflection comes on top of propositional reflection and explains what it does: it explains how propositional reflection constitutes propositions. Propositional reflection, however, does not explain the turn into phenomenology. The turn into phenomenology is off the radar screen of propositional reflection.</p>

  <p>我们在第 4 章中指出，意向目标不应等同于意义。现在我们可以说为什么不应该识别这两者了。把意义和意向等同起来就是等同于命题和现象学的反思。它将哲学简单地视为对我们的意义或感觉的批判性反思；它将哲学等同于语言分析。我们从中进行哲学思考的特殊立场，哲学分析的独特性质，不会暴露出来。哲学将被同化为自然态度中的一种活动。意义或意义不同于 noema，因为命题反思不同于哲学反思。</p><p>We noted in Chapter 4 that the noema should not be equated with sense. Now we can say why the two should not be identified. To equate sense and noema would be to equate propositional and phenomenological reflection. It would be to take philosophy simply as the critical reflection on our meanings or senses; it would equate philosophy with linguistic analysis. The special stance from which we think philosophically, the distinctive nature of philosophical analysis, would not come to light. Philosophy would be assimilated to one of the activities within the natural attitude. Sense or meaning differs from the noema because propositional reflection is different from philosophical reflection.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_13.xhtml.heading_id_7"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_13.xhtml.ch13_gitr"></a>两个反射的图形说明</h2><h2><a></a>A GRAPHIC ILLUSTRATION OF THE TWO REFLECTIONS</h2>

  <p>我想尝试通过打个比方来阐明哲学反思和命题反思之间的相互作用。我想用连环画来揭示我们在从事哲学时所采取的观点与我们在简单地命题和检验一个陈述的正确性时所具有的观点之间的区别。</p><p>I would like to try to clarify the interplay between philosophical and propositional reflection by drawing an analogy. I wish to use comic strips to bring out the difference between the perspective we take on when we are engaged in philosophy and the perspective we have when we simply propositionalize and test a statement for the truth of correctness.</p>

  <p>假设我们有一幅连环画，其中一位说话者 Alpha 正在与另一位说话者 Beta 交谈。Alpha 对 Beta 说了一些关于树的事情。Alpha 所说的内容包含在漫画中用来表示讲话的气球中。假设附在 Alpha 身上的气球上写着“这些树下次刮大风时会倒塌”。连环画中的 Beta 通常会按字面意思理解 Alpha 的话，并且会在听到 Alpha 说的话时想到树木。但是假设 Beta 开始怀疑了。他想知道 Alpha 是否正确。他将阿尔法所阐明的事态提出命题。当 Beta 这样做的时候，就好像他把注意力从树上转移到 Alpha 身上的气球的“概念内容”上，而“概念内容”</p><p>Suppose we have a comic strip in which one speaker, Alpha, is talking to another, Beta. Alpha says something to Beta about trees. What Alpha says is enclosed in the balloons that are used in comic strips to designate speech. Suppose the balloon attached to Alpha contains the words, "These trees will fall over the next time there is a strong wind". Beta, within the comic strip, would normally be taking Alpha's words at face value and would be thinking about the trees as he hears what Alpha says. But suppose Beta gets suspicious. He wonders if Alpha is right. He propositionalizes the state of affairs that Alpha has articulated. When Beta does so, it is as though he turned his focus from the trees to the "conceptual content" of the balloon attached to Alpha, and the "conceptual content" of that balloon is the trees' being ready to topple (taken as proposed).</p>

  <p>然而，当贝塔执行这一命题动作时，他完全处于连环画的框架内。他保持自然的态度。</p><p>When Beta carries out this propositional maneuver, however, he remains entirely within the frame of the comic strip. He remains within the natural attitude.</p>

  <p>在这种情况下将如何说明哲学反思？连环画中无法描绘这位哲学家。哲学家有点像正在阅读连环画的人，而不是连环画中的人物之一。他站在自然态度的框架“之外”，站在连环漫画之外。哲学家（停留或悬浮在现象学态度中）思考漫画中发生的事情（自然态度的交流）。漫画人物阿尔法和贝塔执行各种有意的行为（感知、想象、回忆），他们构成范畴对象，并且他们彼此交谈。他们还参与命题反思，因为他们将事态转化为命题或意义并检验其真实性。</p><p>How would philosophical reflection be illustrated in this setting? The philosopher could not be depicted inside the comic strip. The philosopher is something like the person who is reading the comic strip, not like one of the personalities within it. He stands "outside" the frame of the natural attitude, outside the comic-strip cartoons. The philosopher (perched or suspended in the phenomenological attitude) contemplates the goings-on in the comic strip (the exchanges in the natural attitude). The comic-strip characters, Alpha and Beta, carry out all sorts of intentional acts (perceptions, imaginations, recollections), they constitute categorial objects, and they converse with one another. They also engage in propositional reflection, as they turn a state of affairs into a proposition or a sense and test it for truth.</p>

  <p>连环画人物不能做的一件事就是从卡通画框里爬出来阅读连环画。这种表现在逻辑上和形而上学上都是不可能的。他们无法避免出现在有趣的报纸上。打个比方，他们不能做的一件事就是采取现象学的视角。同样，连环画的读者不能做的一件事就是爬进连环画中，替换其中人物的意图和证据。打个比方，哲学家无法干预自然态度。然而，实际上，哲学对自然态度的这种干预是笛卡尔在我们的感性经验方面试图做的事情，也是霍布斯在我们的政治生活方面试图做的事情。他们试图用哲学来代替我们自然的生活。</p><p>The one thing the comic-strip characters cannot do is to crawl out of the cartoon frames and read the comic strip. That performance is logically and metaphysically impossible. They cannot escape being in the funny papers. To draw out the analogy, the one thing they cannot do is to take on a phenomenological perspective. Likewise, the one thing the reader of the comic strip cannot do is to crawl into the comic strip and replace the intentions and evidences of the characters therein. The philosopher, to draw out the analogy, cannot intervene in the natural attitude. In effect, however, such intervention by philosophy in the natural attitude is what Descartes tries to do in regard to our perceptual experience and what Hobbes tries to do in regard to our political life. They try to use philosophy as a replacement for our natural lives. Rather than save human life, however, the rationalism that they introduce threatens to ruin it, as we will presently see in the final chapter.</p>

  <p>但在结束与连环画的类比之前，我们必须限定它并使它更复杂。像所有类比一样，它有点跛行。诚然，哲学家不能简单地描绘在连环画中，他也不能作为普通人物之一介入连环画的故事。然而，他并没有完全脱离那个故事及其人物，这也是事实。他是同一个人，也以自然的态度生活；当他进入现象学态度时，他并没有走出世界，就像漫画读者的形象所暗示的那样。在这方面，读者和正在阅读的论文之间的空间差异在转化为哲学与自然态度之间的关系时可能会误导我们。这样的哲学家确实超越了世界，但他这样做的同时仍然是其中的一部分。现象学为我们提供了一种超越的内在方式。哲学并没有作为自然界的标准“职业”之一出现，但它确实有某种形式的公共存在，这常常让那些不是哲学家的人感到困惑。</p><p>But before leaving this analogy with the comic strip, we must qualify it and make it more complex. Like all analogies, it limps a little. It is true that the philosopher cannot be simply depicted inside the comic strip, and that he cannot intervene in the comic-strip story as one of its normal characters. However, it is also true that he is not totally detached from that story and its characters. He is the same person who also lives in the natural attitude; when he enters into the phenomenological attitude he does not step out of the world, as the image of the reader of the comic strip might suggest. In this respect, the spatial difference between the reader and the papers being read might mislead us when it is translated into the relationship between philosophy and the natural attitude. The philosopher as such does transcend the world, but he does so while remaining a part of it. Phenomenology gives us an immanent way to be transcendent. Philosophy does not show up as one of the standard "careers" within the natural world, but it does have a public presence of some sort, one that often perplexes those who are not philosophical.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_13.xhtml.heading_id_8"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_13.xhtml.ch13_itr"></a>两个反思的重要性</h2><h2><a></a>IMPORTANCE OF THE TWO REFLECTIONS</h2>

  <p>我们在本章中探讨的现象学与命题反思之间的区别对于揭示哲学思维的本质尤为重要。如果我们忽略了对这种区别的处理，而只谈论自然态度和现象学态度之间的对比，那么我们的探索就不会面对关于现象学本质的最常见的混淆之一。哲学往往没有得到足够彻底的理解；它被认为只是对意义的反思和澄清；也就是说，它被认为是从命题反思的角度所做的事情。</p><p>The distinction between phenomenology and propositional reflection, which we have explored in this chapter, is particularly important in bringing out the nature of philosophical thinking. If we had omitted the treatment of this distinction, and had spoken only about the contrast between the natural and the phenomenological attitude, our exploration would not have faced up to one of the most common confusions regarding the nature of phenomenology. Philosophy is often not understood radically enough; it is taken to be a mere reflection on and clarification of meaning; that is, it is taken to be what is done from the perspective of propositional reflection.</p>

  <p>只有在命题反思发生之后，哲学才能产生。这是超越这种反思的理性步骤。在自然的态度中，我们在走向真理的过程中经历了三个层次：首先，我们只是感知和意图事物；其次，我们明确地表达事物，将句法引入我们的经验中；第三，我们对我们所阐明的事物进行命题式的反思，从而对它们采取批判的态度。这三个层次都属于自然态度。只有经过了这三个阶段，具体来说只有做到了命题反思之后，我们才能进入哲学思考。命题反思中涉及的批判性思维，确定命题正确性的努力，如果我们要继续进行我们称之为哲学的更超然的思考，那肯定已经发生了。哲学表达的“我”预设了“我认为是这样”或“我知道这是真的”等短语表达的“我”。</p><p>Philosophy can arise only after propositional reflection has taken place. It is a rational step beyond such reflection. In the natural attitude, we go through three levels in the movement toward truth: first, we simply perceive and intend things; second, we articulate things categorially, introducing syntax into our experience; and third, we reflect propositionally on the things we have articulated and thus take up a critical attitude toward them. All three levels belong to the natural attitude. Only after we have passed through these three stages, and specifically only after we have achieved propositional reflection, can we enter into philosophical thinking. The critical thinking involved in propositional reflection, the effort to determine the correctness of propositions, must have already occurred if we are to move on to the more detached thinking we call philosophy. The "I" expressed in philosophy presupposes the "I" expressed in phrases like "I think this is the case", or "I know that this is true".</p>

  <p>哲学反思不仅仅是对命题反思的反思——它涵盖所有意向性及其客观关联——但它只有在命题反思发生后才能被触发，并具有它所允许的那种真理。批判性的命题推理是哲学推理的可能性条件。</p><p>Philosophical reflection is more than just reflection on propositional reflection — it ranges over all intentionalities and their objective correlates — but it can be triggered only after propositional reflection, with the kind of truth that it permits, has taken place. Critical, propositional reasoning is a condition of possibility for philosophical reasoning.</p>

  <p>因为命题反思必须先于现象学，所以我们发现很难将两者区分开来也就不足为奇了。我们发现很难深入到哲学带来的新维度。我们倾向于认为对意义的反思是反思分析的最高形式。出于这个原因，如果我们要加深对作为真理科学的哲学是什么的理解，我们就必须明确区分命题和现象学反思，区分意义和意向。</p><p>Because propositional reflection has to precede the phenomenological, it is not surprising that we find it difficult to distinguish the one from the other. We find it hard to stretch far enough into the new dimension that philosophy brings. We tend to think that reflection on meaning is the highest form of reflective analysis. For this reason, it is essential for us explicitly to draw the distinction between propositional and phenomenological reflection, and to distinguish between sense and noema, if we are to sharpen our understanding of what philosophy, as the science of truth, is.</p>

  当前历史背景下的现象学</h1><h1><span class="small">14</span><br><br>
  Phenomenology in the Present Historical Context</h1>

  <p>我们现在将通过观察现象学如何适应当前的哲学场景来获得对现象学的最终看法。在第 13 章的末尾，我们注意到笛卡尔和霍布斯都试图用哲学的态度来取代自然的态度。他们认为哲学不仅可以澄清而且可以替代前哲学思维所特有的知识。这种对哲学理性力量的信仰，以及对其他形式经验的怀疑，是现代性的典型特征。现象学对哲学的理解非常不同。它认为前哲学的智慧应该保持原样，它有自己的优点和真理，哲学思考前哲学而不是取代它。因此，虽然现象学起源于现代哲学，但它也与其保持距离。</p><p>We will now gain a final perspective on phenomenology by looking at how it fits into the present philosophical scene. Toward the end of Chapter 13, we noted that both Descartes and Hobbes try to replace the natural attitude by the philosophical. They think that philosophy can not only clarify but also replace the knowledge proper to prephilosophical thinking. This belief in the power of philosophical reason, along with this suspicion about other forms of experience, is typical of modernity. Phenomenology understands philosophy very differently. It believes that prephilosophical intelligence ought to be left intact, that it has its own excellence and truth, and that philosophy contemplates the prephilosophical without replacing it. Thus, while phenomenology originates within modern philosophy, it also takes a distance from it. To show how it does so, let us begin with an interpretation of modernity.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_14.xhtml.heading_id_3"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_14.xhtml.ch14_mp"></a>现代性和后现代性</h2><h2><a></a>MODERNITY AND POSTMODERNITY</h2>

  <p>现代哲学有两个主要组成部分：政治哲学和认识论。在这两个组成部分中，现代哲学在其起源中将自己定义为一场反对古代和中世纪思想的革命。十六世纪初的马基雅维利以在政治生活中开创了新的模式和秩序而自豪，而弗朗西斯培根和笛卡​​尔在十七世纪初宣称他们正在引入思考自然和人类思想的新方法，这些方法要求我们放弃我们继承的和常识性的信念，并采用一种新的方法来指导我们的思想寻求知识。</p><p>Modern philosophy has two major components: political philosophy and epistemology. In both these components, modern philosophy defined itself, in its origins, as a revolution against ancient and medieval thought. Machiavelli, at the beginning of the sixteenth century, prided himself on initiating new modes and orders in political life, and Francis Bacon and Descartes, in the early seventeenth century, declared that they were introducing new ways of thinking about nature and the human mind, ways which require that we abandon our inherited and common sense convictions and take up a new method of directing our minds in the search for knowledge.</p>

  <p>由马基雅维利开创并由霍布斯系统化的新政治不仅仅是一种理论创新。它有一个实际的结果，即现代国家的建立。现代国家是当前历史背景下的现象学，不同于以往的政治统治形式。在所有前现代形式中，社会的一部分——无论是一个人、少数富人、许多穷人、中等群体还是上层人士——统治着整体。统治者可能会为了公共利益或自己的利益而行使统治权，但无论如何，政治共同体都涉及某些人对其他人的统治。即使在据说法治的共和政体中，机构仍然由男性组成，因为必须有足够多的公民具备政治美德和智慧才能让法治。</p><p>The new politics begun by Machiavelli and systematized by Hobbes was not just a theoretic innovation. It had a practical outcome, the establishment of the modern state. The modern state is Phenomenology in the Present Historical Context different from previous forms of political rule. In all premodern forms, one part of the society — whether one man, the wealthy few, the many poor, the middle group, or the better people — rules over the whole. The rulers might exercise their rule for the common good or for their own benefit, but in any case the political community involves some human beings ruling over others. Even in a republic, in which the laws are said to rule, men still form the establishment, because there have to be enough citizens endowed with the political virtue and intelligence to allow the laws to rule.</p>

  <p>现代国家与此大不相同。在现代国家中，创建了一个新实体，即主权国家。主权者不是政体中的一群人。主权是一种建构，而不是自发的人类发展或人类协会的自然形式。这是哲学家的发明。它被提议作为人类政治问题的永久解决方案。主权的引入是为了结束个人和团体为统治而进行的无休止的人类斗争。主权概念旨在使人类政治生活合理化。它建立了一种非个人化的结构，与古代和中世纪城市中的个性化统治形式形成鲜明对比。据承诺，主权的引入将带来公民和平。主权者提出的唯一要求是所有臣民（因为他们现在是臣民，而不是公民）放弃对公共行动和言论的任何要求。他们将受到君主的保护，免受彼此的侵略，并被允许追求自己的私人舒适和喜好，但所有公共决策和言论都必须由君主单独决定。</p><p>The modern state is very different from this. In the modern state, a new entity is created, the sovereign. The sovereign is not one group of people in the body politic. The sovereign is a construct, not a spontaneous human development or a natural form of human association. It is an invention of philosophers. It is proposed as a permanent solution to the human political problem. The introduction of the sovereign is to put an end to the interminable human struggle, carried on by individuals and by groups, to rule. The concept of sovereignty is meant to rationalize human political life. It puts in place a structure that is impersonal, in contrast with the personalized forms of rule found in the ancient and medieval city. The introduction of the sovereign, it is promised, will bring about civic peace. The only requirement the sovereign makes is that all the subjects (for they are subjects now, not citizens) renounce any claim to public action and speech. They will be protected by the sovereign from one another's aggression and will be allowed to pursue their own private comforts and preferences, but all public decisions and speech must be left to the sovereign alone.</p>

  <p>由主权理念塑造的现代国家在过去 500 年的政治和思想史上发挥了作用。它首先体现在十七、十八世纪的专制君主身上。然后它抛弃了这些君主，在法国大革命中更加鲜明地露面了。在革命后的 19 世纪法国萌芽，在德国俾斯麦的工作中萌芽，在美国在内战及其后果中萌芽后，现代国家再次生动地出现在俄国革命和苏维埃国家中跟着。主权的概念仍然存在于我们当代的政治社会中，存在于将所有权力集中在一个单一的非个人权力来源的趋势中，</p><p>The modern state, shaped by the idea of sovereignty, worked its way through the political and intellectual history of the past five hundred years. It was first embodied in the absolute monarchs of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It then discarded these monarchs and showed its face more clearly in the French Revolution. After germinating in nineteenth-century France in the aftermath of the Revolution, in Germany in the work of Bismarck, and in the United States in the Civil War and its consequences, the modern state appeared again vividly in the Russian Revolution and the Soviet state that followed. The idea of sovereignty remains in our contemporary political societies, in the tendencies that still exist to centralize all authority in a single impersonal source of power, an omnicompetent government that dissolves all other forms of social authority.</p>

  <p>除了以这些不同的方式体现之外，现代国家还经历了马基雅维利和霍布斯之后的理论完善。它在黑格尔那里找到了它的最终陈述，黑格尔的表述被卡尔·马克思改编。自黑格尔以来，我们所经历的是主权支持者和现代国家与政治思想家之间的知识僵局，后者回忆起主权的替代方案，即古代和中世纪理论所描述的政治形式。有像亚历克西斯·德·托克维尔（Alexis de Toqueville）这样的作家，他让我们想起了早期的政治形式；Leo Strauss，古今对立；迈克尔·奥克肖特试图在古代和现代的政治观念之间进行调整，目的是获得优势，同时排除各自的劣势。不过可以说，现代政治哲学已经完成了它的工作。它在现代国家的概念和政治建立中得出了结论，现代国家现在被普遍认为是唯一合法的政府形式：现代国家不需要被证明是正当的，而且每个人都同意现代国家的形式state 应该安装在任何地方。</p><p>Besides being embodied in these diverse ways, the modern state went through theoretical refinements after Machiavelli and Hobbes. It found its final statement in Hegel, whose formulation was adapted by Karl Marx. Since Hegel, what we have had is an intellectual standoff between proponents of sovereignty and the modern state and political thinkers who recall the alternative to sovereignty, the political forms described by ancient and medieval theory. There are writers like Alexis de Toqueville, who reminds us of earlier political forms; Leo Strauss, who plays the ancients and the moderns off against each other; and Michael Oakeshott, who tries to work out adjustments between ancient and modern political concepts, with the goal of garnering the advantages while excluding the disadvantages of each. It can be said, however, that modern political philosophy has finished its work. It has reached its conclusion in the concept and the political establishment of the modern state, which is now generally considered to be the only legitimate form of government: the modern state does not need to be justified, and everyone agrees that the form of a modern state ought to be installed everywhere.</p>

  <p>现象学与现代性的政治维度没有任何直接关系。萨特和梅洛-庞蒂的一些著作与政治有关，但它们只不过是对社会主义理论的次要贡献。阿尔弗雷德·舒茨 (Alfred Schutz) 的著作更关注社会而非政治哲学。令人震惊的是，现象学在政治哲学中是多么的缺乏。然而，它对现代性的另一个组成部分、认识论和方法有很多话要说。</p><p>Phenomenology has nothing directly to say about the political dimension of modernity. Some of the writings of Sartre and Merleau-Ponty are related to politics, but they are little more than minor contributions to socialist theory. The work of Alfred Schutz is concerned more with social than with political philosophy. It is striking how completely devoid phenomenology is of anything in political philosophy. It has much to say, however, about the other component of modernity, epistemology and method.</p>

  <p>现代性不仅涉及一种新的政治生活观念，而且涉及一种新的思想观念。在现代哲学的经典著作中，我们被告知人类理性必须掌握自己。理性无法接受它从过去或他人那里继承下来的东西。别人给它的意见，甚至感官呈现给它的表面真理，都是误导性的。理性必须学会根据新程序、新方法行事，以保证确定性和真实性。所有的科学都必须重新建立在新的更好的基础上。理性甚至必须发展出一种方法，使其能够检验我们的感官知觉，并使我们能够区分对我们的感性产生的真实印象和错误印象。</p><p>Modernity involved not only a new conception of political life, but also a new conception of the mind. In the classical writings of modern philosophy, we are told that human reason must take possession of itself. Reason cannot accept what it inherits from the past or from others. The opinions that are given to it by others, and even the apparent truths that the senses present to it, are misleading. Reason must learn to conduct itself according to new procedures, new methods that will guarantee certainty and truth. All the sciences must be built up again on new and better foundations. Reason must even develop a method that will allow it to test our sense perceptions and make it possible for us to distinguish between the true and the false impressions made on our sensibility.</p>

  <p>与政治的一样，现代性的认识论成分也有它的历史：它经历了笛卡尔、斯宾诺莎和莱布尼茨的理性主义，经历了洛克、贝克莱和休谟的经验主义，经历了康德及其追随者的批判哲学，经历了费希特、谢林和黑格尔的唯心主义，以及 19 世纪和 20 世纪思想的实证主义和实用主义。然而，不同之处在于，认识论并没有像政治哲学那样走向终结。尽管现代科学取得了巨大的成功，尽管人工智能和认知科学等运动做出了艰苦的努力，但在该领域没有与现代国家无可争议的认识论等价物。作为一种知识和方法的理论，现代性还没有完成，</p><p>Like the political, the epistemological component of modernity has also had its history: it moved through the rationalism of Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz, through the empiricism of Locke, Berkeley, and Hume, through the critical philosophy of Kant and his followers, through the idealism of Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, and through the positivism and pragmatism of nineteenth- and twentieth-century thought. There is a difference, however, in that epistemology has not come to closure as political philosophy has. Despite the great success of the modern sciences, and despite the strenuous efforts of movements like artificial intelligence and cognitive science, there is no epistemological equivalent of the modern state in uncontested possession of the field. As a theory of knowledge and method, modernity is still unfinished, and it is to this branch of modern thought that phenomenology makes its contribution.</p>

  <p>然而，在我们考虑现象学之前，我们必须再考察一点关于现代性的两个组成部分，政治的和认识论的。现代政治哲学和现代认识论的共同点是，它们都坚持认为思想应被理解为统治的力量。在政治哲学中，马基雅维利和霍布斯的思想产生了一个新的实体，即主权国家，它不存在于历史上出现的更自发的人类协会形式中。从现在开始，人类争夺规则的不确定性和紧张局势将被哲学洞察力带来的建构所取代。一些新的、超人的东西，利维坦，取代了旧的相互冲突的权威，而这个新事物就是理性，表达自己对人类的统治。</p><p>Before we consider phenomenology, however, we must examine one more point about both components of modernity, the political and the epistemological. What is common to modern political philosophy and modern epistemology is that they both insist that the mind is to be understood as the power to rule. In political philosophy, the mind, in the persons of Machiavelli and Hobbes, generates a new entity, the sovereign state, which is not present among the more spontaneous forms of human association that have arisen in history. From now on the uncertainties and tensions of human competition for rule are to be replaced by a construct brought about by philosophical insight. Something new, something transhuman, the Leviathan, replaces the old conflicting authorities, and this new thing is reason expressing itself as ruling over men.</p>

  <p>此外，就人类知识而言，理性通过产生探究方法和对自身力量进行批判来掌握自身并支配自身的经验。头脑将自己确立为理性。头脑支配着它自己和它知道的力量。头脑不被认为是为了事物的真相而被安排的，而是支配着它自己的活动并通过自己的努力产生真相。头脑不是接受性的，而是创造性的。它不接受自己是为了真理而在目的论上被安排的，而是通过批判的方法论发明自己并建构它的真理。因此，在这两种情况下，在政治和科学中，理性或思想都被理解为统治和自治。这是现代哲学与古代和中世纪哲学的主要区别，其中理性被理解为在事物的表现中、在客观性的胜利和真理的获得中找到它的完美。在前现代哲学中，即使是政治上的卓越也从属于呈现给理论生活的存在真理。规则服从于真理。</p><p>Also, in regard to human knowledge, reason takes possession of itself and rules over its own experiences by generating methods of inquiry and carrying out a critique of its own powers. The mind establishes itself as reason. The mind rules over itself and its power to know. The mind is not conceived as ordered toward the truth of things, but as governing its own activities and generating the truth through its own efforts. The mind is not receptive, but creative. It does not accept itself as teleologically ordered toward truth, but invents itself and constructs its truths by means of critical methodologies. In both cases, therefore, in both politics and science, reason or the mind is understood as ruling and as autonomous. This is the major difference between the philosophy of modernity and ancient and medieval philosophy, in which reason is understood as finding its perfection in the manifestation of things, in the triumph of objectivity and the attainment of truth. In premodern philosophy, even political excellence is subordinated to the truth of being that is presented to the theoretic life. Rule is subordinated to truth.</p>

  <p>在其影响的最初几个世纪，现代性表现为理性主义。这一时期的历史和这种思维方式被称为启蒙运动。现代性承诺了一个纯粹理性的政治社会和人类知识的安全、科学的发展。但最近，在尼采最初的声明之后，越来越清楚的是，现代计划的核心不是为知识服务的理性运用，而是意志的运用，统治的意志，权力意志。随着这种洞察力变得越来越明显，现代性逐渐消失，后现代性接管了一切。后现代性不是对现代性的拒绝，而是其中最深层冲动的绽放。在我们学术和文化生活的这一刻，</p><p>During the first centuries of its influence, modernity expressed itself as rationalism. The name given to this period of its history and this style of thinking was the Enlightenment. Modernity promised a purely rational political society and a secure, scientific development of human knowledge. But more recently, after the initial proclamations made by Nietzsche, it has become more and more clear that the heart of the modern project is not the exercise of reason in the service of knowledge, but the exercise of a will, the will to rule, the will to power. As this insight becomes more and more evident, modernity fades away and postmodernity takes over. Postmodernity is not a rejection of modernity, but the flowering of the deepest impulse in it. At this moment in our academic and cultural life, the natural sciences are still serving the project of classical modernity, but the humanities have been given over quite entirely to postmodernity.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_14.xhtml.heading_id_4"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_14.xhtml.ch14_rp"></a>现象学的回应</h2><h2><a></a>THE RESPONSE OF PHENOMENOLOGY</h2>

  <p>现象学如何适应现代哲学的发展？它是现代理性主义张力的延续吗？在胡塞尔那里发现的一些希望和论点似乎是这样说的。或者它是对后现代性的贡献，正如海德格尔的某些段落以及德里达的一切似乎表明的那样？</p><p>How does phenomenology fit into this development of modern philosophy? Is it a continuation of the rationalist strain in modernity? Some of the hopes and arguments found in Husserl would seem to say so. Or is it a contribution to postmodernity, as some passages in Heidegger, and everything in Derrida, would seem to indicate?</p>

  <p>我会声称现象学打破了现代性，并允许恢复激发古代和中世纪哲学的信念。与前现代哲学一样，现象学将理性理解为趋向于真理。它认为人类的思想倾向于证据，倾向于表现事物的本来面目。此外，它通过令人信服的细节描述了思维获得真理的活动，以及伴随这种成就的局限性和模糊性，从而验证了这种理性和思维的观点。由于对理性和真理的理解，现象学使我们能够重新利用古代和中世纪的哲学。</p><p>I would claim that phenomenology breaks out of modernity and permits a restoration of the convictions that animated ancient and medieval philosophy. Like premodern philosophy, phenomenology understands reason as ordered toward truth. It sees the human mind as geared toward evidence, toward manifesting the way things are. Furthermore, it validates this vision of reason and the mind by describing, in convincing detail, the activities by which the mind achieves truth, along with the limitations and obscurities that accompany such achievement. Because of its understanding of reason and truth, phenomenology allows us to reappropriate the philosophy of antiquity and the Middle Ages.</p>

  <p>这是否意味着现象学简单地恢复了古代对哲学的理解而放弃了现代方案？或者它只是把古人和现代人当作两种基本的思维选择？不; 它做得更多。它积极回应现代性中出现的问题。通过借鉴现代哲学并恢复古代对理性的理解，现象学超越了古今。例如，它处理现代认识论问题和数学科学在人类生活中的地位。它表明感知不应被理解为我们与事物之间的障碍，以及如何从不同的角度给出事物并仍然保持其身份；它考察了我们所有经历中存在与不存在的相互作用；</p><p>Does this mean that phenomenology simply restores the ancient understanding of philosophy and abandons the modern project? Or that it merely plays off the ancients and the moderns as two basic alternatives for thinking? No; it does more. It responds positively to issues that have arisen in modernity. By drawing on modern philosophy and also restoring the ancient understanding of reason, phenomenology goes beyond ancients and moderns. For example, it deals with the modern epistemological problem and the place of mathematical science in human life. It shows how perception should not be understood as a barrier between ourselves and things, and how things can be given in various perspectives and still maintain their identity; it examines the interplay of presence and absence in all our experiences; and it unravels the intentionalities by which the sciences are constituted out of the lived world.</p>

  <p>但是，在解决现代性的认识论问题的同时，现象学也改进了古代对科学的理解。它揭示了自我的作用，表明人类的知识不是独立于人类的智能代理人的工作，而是能够说“我”并能为自己所说的话负责的人的成就和拥有。因为它承认先验自我是人类的一个维度，现象学能够将历史和解释学维度引入人类知识。然而，它这样做并没有将真理淹没在主观性和历史环境中。在不得不处理现代怀疑论之后，现象学比古代哲学对经验和意向性进行了更透彻的分析，以及对哲学和前哲学之间的区别的更明确的处理。现象学既不是对古代和中世纪的反叛，也不是对现代性的排斥，而是以适合我们哲学处境的方式恢复真正的哲学生活。</p><p>But while addressing the epistemological concerns of modernity, phenomenology also improves on the ancient understanding of science. It brings out the role of the ego, showing that human knowledge is not the work of an agent intellect separate from human beings, but the achievement and possession of someone who can say "I" and who can take responsibility for what he says. Because it recognizes the transcendental ego as a dimension in human beings, phenomenology is able to introduce a historical and hermeneutical dimension to human knowledge. It does so, however, without submerging truth into subjectivity and historical circumstances. Having had to deal with modern skepticism, phenomenology gives a more thorough analysis of experience and of intentionality than ancient philosophy did, as well as a more explicit treatment of the difference between philosophy and the prephilosophical. Phenomenology is neither a rebellion against antiquity and the Middle Ages nor a rejection of modernity, but a recovery of the true philosophical life, in a manner appropriate to our philosophical situation.</p>

  <p>现象学并没有发展出一种政治哲学，但由于它认为人类理性是朝着真理的方向发展的，所以它可以对政治哲学做出重要贡献。如果人的思想在事物的证据中找到它的终点，那么政治统治就不可能是人类的最高利益。政治要服从事物的真相，即政治统治要符合人性。纯粹的统治并不能提供最大的满足。统治必须根据人类的卓越来行使，它也必须承认有一种生命高于它自己。在马基雅维利开创的政治思想中，这些真理已经从视野中消失了。</p><p>Phenomenology has not developed a political philosophy, but because it sees human reason as ordered toward truth, it can make an important contribution to political philosophy. If the human mind finds its end in the evidence of things, then political rule cannot be the highest good for man. Politics has to be subordinated to the truth of things, that is, political rule has to be exercised in accord with human nature. Sheer ruling does not provide the utmost satisfaction. Rule must be exercised according to human excellence, and it must also recognize that there is a life higher than its own. These truths have been lost from view in the political thinking inaugurated by Machiavelli.</p>

  <p>如果人类被认为是真理的代理人，那么他们的政治联盟就必须反映他们存在的这个维度。一个非个人的主权体系不能取代负责任的人类统治者和公民。不能忽视担任公职人员的公民美德和知识美德；裁决不仅仅是自动程序和选举过程的问题。近年来出现的公民教育、家庭安定、社会治安等紧迫问题，显示古代政治哲学的教义在我们这个时代并没有落伍。如果人们不想成为专制国家的奴隶，公民和政治家的教育就迫切需要更好地理解人类责任，这种理解基于对真理的理性理解。</p><p>If human beings are recognized as agents of truth, their political association must reflect this dimension of their being. An impersonal system of sovereignty cannot replace responsible human rulers and citizens. The civic and intellectual virtues of those who hold public office cannot be disregarded; ruling is not simply a matter of automatic procedures and electoral processes. The urgent problems of civic education, family stability, and social order that have arisen in recent years show that the teachings of ancient political philosophy are not out of date in our times. A better understanding of human responsibility, based on an understanding of reason as ordered toward truth, is sorely needed in the education of citizens and statesmen, if men are not to become slaves of a despotic state.</p>

  <p>现代国家不同于共和国，即法律统治的政治社会。主权是由理性故意捏造出来的，而法律是社区继承下来的习俗，其中一些被编纂成明确的法规；它们是普通法，是人民的生活方式。当然，比法规更基本的是政治社会的宪法，它决定了职位和有资格担任这些职位的人；也就是说，它决定了谁将成为公民。共和国假设人们出生并受教育进入前政治社会、家庭和部落，并且他们拥有前政治的协会（友谊）。主权受到的限制要少得多。它声称要取代它监管的所有其他当局和协会。它声称能够使男人成为人类。它本质上是极权主义的。</p><p>The modern state is not the same as a republic, the political society in which the laws rule. The sovereign is a construct deliberately fabricated by reason, whereas the laws are the inherited customs of a community, some of which become codified into explicit statutes; they are the common laws, the way of life of a people. More basic than statutes, of course, is the constitution of the political society, which determines the offices and the people who will be eligible to hold them; that is, it determines who shall be citizens. The republic assumes that men have been born and educated into pre political societies, into families and tribes, and that they have associations (friendships) that are pre political. Sovereignty is much less restrained. It claims to supersede all other authorities and associations, which it regulates. It claims to be able to make men human. It is essentially totalitarian.</p>

  <p>共和国和君主之间的另一个区别是，共和国吸收了许多其他政府形式的元素：它由民主、寡头、贵族和王室组成，这种多样性赋予它巨大的抗拉强度。相反，主权者是单义的。只有一个或一组被称为代表所有主题的单一规则。因为它是单义的，所以主权是不随机应变的。这就是所谓的普遍和同质的国家，一种预期随处可见的统治形式。它纯粹是“理性的”，但在现代性赋予该术语的意义上是理性的：一种计算的、有条不紊的理性的表达，而不是证明事物本来面目的理性。</p><p>Another difference between the republic and the sovereign is that the republic draws on elements from many other forms of government: it is made up of democratic, oligarchic, aristocratic, and royal components, and this variety gives it great tensile strength. The sovereign, in contrast, is univocal. There is just the single rule of the one or the group who are said to represent all the subjects. Because it is univocal, sovereignty is not adaptable to circumstances. It is what has been called the universal and homogeneous state, the one form of rule that is expected to be found everywhere. It is purely "rational," but rational in the sense modernity gives to the term: an expression of calculative, methodic reason, not the reason that evidences the way things are. The moral and social ruin left behind by the collapse of soviet states shows how effectively the sovereign can destroy the social authorities that try to rival its power.</p>

  <p>现代世界中最好的政治社会，例如最初的美国宪法所形成的社会，都是共和政体。它们是一种法治，由许多不同形式的政府组成：民主的、寡头的、贵族的和王室的。它们与在现代世界中发展起来的集权化力量背道而驰。就他们仍然是共和国而言，他们将人民视为公民而不是臣民，并认为将人民作为公民而不是臣民进行教育至关重要。作为公民接受教育就是能够作为负责任的真理代理人进入人类对话。现象学可以加强或恢复这种公民的自我理解；这就是它对当代政治哲学和实践的贡献。</p><p>The best political societies in the modern world, such as that formed by the original American Constitution, have been republics. They are a rule of laws and are composed of elements from many different forms of government: democratic, oligarchic, aristocratic, and royal. They run counter to the centralizing forces that have also developed in the modern world. To the extent that they remain republics, they treat their people as citizens, not as subjects, and consider it essential to educate their people as citizens, not as subjects. To be educated as a citizen is to be capable of entering into the human conversation as a responsible agent of truth. Phenomenology can strengthen or restore this civic self-understanding; such is the donation it can make to contemporary political philosophy and practice.</p>

  <p>因为研究人类意识和思维具有超越认识论的价值。当我们从哲学上描述人的理性时，我们提供了一种人的自我理解，而这种理解与政治哲学不无关系。<em>托马斯·霍布斯在《利维坦》</em>中给出了主权国家最系统的图景<em></em>，一部以知识的机械理论开始的作品。政治与认识论的结合并非偶然。如果人类要成为君主的卑贱臣民，他们就必须以某种方式了解自己。由于不允许他们在公共领域行动（只有主权者才能执行公共行动），他们必须将自己视为既不是道德代理人也不是真理代理人。他们必须将他们的智力理解为一种机械的、非个人的过程，而不是一种披露的力量。他们无法将自己理解为显化的与格。主权国家和现代主观主义齐头并进。“以自我为中心的困境”和将思想简化为大脑，取消公共真理以支持私人相对主义，不仅是认识论理论，但也有政治倾向。如果我们确信我们不参与真理的游戏，我们就会将自己视为孤独的玩家，只能在我们的内心生活中行动。没有公共游戏，只有私人幻想，没有足球或棒球，只有心理井字游戏。对人类理性的理解，即为主权国家服务的理解，在我们的文化中很普遍，但尚未普及。正如后现代主义所表明的那样，它具有违反直觉和逻辑自我消解的弱点。用柏拉图的话来说，需要的是一种新的“音乐比喻”，它能让我们更清楚地意识到自己是什么，而哲学的政治作用就是帮助使这种音乐成为可能。我们将把自己视为孤独的参与者，只能在我们的内心生活中行动。没有公共游戏，只有私人幻想，没有足球或棒球，只有心理井字游戏。对人类理性的理解，即为主权国家服务的理解，在我们的文化中很普遍，但尚未普及。正如后现代主义所表明的那样，它具有违反直觉和逻辑自我消解的弱点。用柏拉图的话来说，需要的是一种新的“音乐比喻”，它能让我们更清楚地意识到自己是什么，而哲学的政治作用就是帮助使这种音乐成为可能。我们将把自己视为孤独的参与者，只能在我们的内心生活中行动。没有公共游戏，只有私人幻想，没有足球或棒球，只有心理井字游戏。对人类理性的理解，即为主权国家服务的理解，在我们的文化中很普遍，但尚未普及。正如后现代主义所表明的那样，它具有违反直觉和逻辑自我消解的弱点。用柏拉图的话来说，需要的是一种新的“音乐比喻”，它能让我们更清楚地意识到自己是什么，而哲学的政治作用就是帮助使这种音乐成为可能。对人类理性的理解，即为主权国家服务的理解，在我们的文化中很普遍，但尚未普及。正如后现代主义所表明的那样，它具有违反直觉和逻辑自我消解的弱点。用柏拉图的话来说，需要的是一种新的“音乐比喻”，它能让我们更清楚地意识到自己是什么，而哲学的政治作用就是帮助使这种音乐成为可能。对人类理性的理解，即为主权国家服务的理解，在我们的文化中很普遍，但尚未普及。正如后现代主义所表明的那样，它具有违反直觉和逻辑自我消解的弱点。用柏拉图的话来说，需要的是一种新的“音乐比喻”，它能让我们更清楚地意识到自己是什么，而哲学的政治作用就是帮助使这种音乐成为可能。</p><p>For the study of human consciousness and thinking has a value that goes beyond epistemology. When we describe human reason philosophically, we provide a human self-understanding, and such an understanding is not unrelated to political philosophy. The most systematic picture of the sovereign state is given by Thomas Hobbes in <em>Leviathan</em>, a work that begins with a mechanistic theory of knowledge. The conjunction between politics and epistemology is not accidental. If human beings are to be made abject subjects of a sovereign, they have to understand themselves in a certain way. Since they will not be permitted to act in the public domain (only the sovereign can carry out public actions), they must take themselves as neither moral agents nor agents of truth. They have to understand their intellect as a mechanical, impersonal process, not a power of disclosure. They cannot understand themselves as datives of manifestation. The sovereign state and modern subjectivism go hand in hand. The "egocentric predicament" and the reduction of mind to brain, the cancellation of public truth in favor of private relativism, are not just epistemological theories, but also political predispositions. If we become persuaded that we do not enter into the game of truth, we will see ourselves as solitary players who can act only within our internal life. There is no public game but only private fantasy, no football or baseball but only a mental tic-tac-toe. The understanding of human reason as boxed into the brain, the understanding that serves the sovereign state, is widespread in our culture, but it is not yet universal. It has the weakness of being counterintuitive and logically self-dissolving, as postmodernism has shown. In Platonic terms, what is needed is a new "musical trope" that makes us more clearly aware of what we are, and the political role of philosophy is to help make such music possible.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_14.xhtml.heading_id_5"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_14.xhtml.ch14_ptp"></a>现象学和思维哲学</h2><h2><a></a>PHENOMENOLOGY AND THOMISTIC PHILOSOPHY</h2>

  <p>由于我们试图通过展示现象学如何适应现代哲学情境来定义现象学，因此将其与经院哲学进行比较，更具体地说，与经院哲学最突出的代表托马斯主义进行比较会很有帮助。托马斯主义就像现象学一样，提供了现代性和后现代性的替代方案，但这两种替代方案不同。托马斯主义是一种前现代或非现代的思维形式。它的根源在于古代和中世纪。从历史上看，它与现代思想的早期发展平行，当时它的代表是 16 和 17 世纪的作家，如 Cajetan（1468-1534 年）、Suarez（1548-1617 年）和圣托马斯的约翰（1589-1589 年）。 1644). 托马斯主义在接下来的两个世纪中有所消退，但在教皇利奥十三世及其通谕的推动下复兴<em>Aeterni Patris</em> (1879)，它成为 19 世纪和 20 世纪思想的显着存在，主要但不限于罗马天主教教育和知识界。许多学者和评论家代表了它，但也有雅克·马里坦（1882-1973）、艾蒂安·吉尔森（1884-1978）和伊夫·R·西蒙（1903-1961）等独立思想家。在第二次梵蒂冈会议之后，它的存在大大减少了。此外，弗朗茨布伦塔诺的新经院哲学对胡塞尔产生了重大影响，因此托马斯主义思想与现象学的早期阶段之间存在某种连续性。</p><p>Since we are trying to define phenomenology by showing how it fits in the modern philosophical situation, it would be helpful to compare it with scholastic philosophy, and more specifically with the most prominent representation of scholasticism, Thomism. Thomism is like phenomenology in providing an alternative to modernity and postmodernity, but the two alternatives differ. Thomism is a premodern or nonmodern form of thinking. Its roots lie in antiquity and in the Middle Ages. Historically, it ran parallel to the early development of modern thinking, when it was represented by such sixteenth- and seventeenth-century writers as Cajetan (1468–1534), Suarez (1548–1617), and John of St. Thomas (1589–1644). Thomism receded somewhat during the next two centuries, but after the revival prompted by Pope Leo XIII, with his encyclical <em>Aeterni Patris</em> (1879), it became a conspicuous presence in nineteenth- and twentieth-century thought, primarily but not exclusively in Roman Catholic educational and intellectual circles. It was represented by many scholars and commentators, but also by such independent thinkers as Jacques Maritain (1882–1973), Etienne Gilson (1884–1978), and Yves R. Simon (1903-1961). Its presence was much diminished in the aftermath of the Second Vatican Council. Furthermore, the neoscholastic philosophy of Franz Brentano exercised a significant influence on Husserl, so there was some continuity between Thomistic thought and the early stages of phenomenology.</p>

  <p>托马斯主义与现象学都坚信人类理性是为了真理，但这两种传统之间存在重要差异。托马斯主义在基督教信仰和启示的背景下发展其哲学。它在圣安瑟伦开辟的知识维度内运作，圣安瑟伦提供了一种哲学可能性的“神学演绎”，类似于康德对我们认知能力的“先验演绎”。中世纪哲学必须迈出的第一步是表明理性有它自己的领域，它自己的运作范围，并且它不被信仰所吸收。圣安瑟伦和经院哲学家在信仰中为理性“腾出空间”。他们知道哲学是因为他们在古人中发现了它，但他们自己对它的使用必须从启示开始。经院哲学的伟大成就之一是区分了信仰与理性以及恩典与自然。中世纪的思想家，尤其是圣托马斯·阿奎那 (Saint Thomas Aquinas) 教导说，自然证据有其自身的完整性，并且理性可以通过其自身的力量实现真理。然而，这种教导必须从圣经信仰中得到证明。</p><p>Thomism shares with phenomenology the conviction that human reason is ordered toward truth, but there is an important difference between the two traditions. Thomism develops its philosophy within the context of Christian faith and revelation. It works within the intellectual dimensions opened by Saint Anselm, who provides a kind of "theological deduction" of the possibility of philosophy, analogous to Kant's "transcendental deduction" of our cognitive powers. The first step that had to be made in medieval philosophy was to show that reason has its own domain, its own sphere of operation, and that it is not absorbed by faith. Saint Anselm and the scholastics "made room" for reason within faith. They knew about philosophy because they found it among the ancients, but their own appropriation of it had to begin within revelation. Among the great achievements of scholasticism were the distinctions between faith and reason and between grace and nature. Medieval thinkers, and Saint Thomas Aquinas in particular, taught that natural evidences have their own integrity, and that reason can achieve truth through its own powers. This teaching, however, has to be justified from within biblical faith.</p>

  <p>在古代哲学中，不需要这样的神学证明，因为哲学不必在神圣的启示中找到自己的位置。它在希腊城市的继承意见中定义了自己。在那里，哲学将自己理解为人类思维的自然结晶。人们对事物的本来面目有看法，他们能够获得一些科学知识，他们对正确和公正的事情有看法，他们对神明发表了言论；除了这样的思维练习，他们开始思考整体，并开始思考自己是展示整体和其中的部分。无论是在前苏格拉底对自然的研究中，还是在苏格拉底对人与政治秩序的研究中，他们都开始运用哲学思想。</p><p>In ancient philosophy, no such theological justification was needed, because philosophy did not have to find its place within divine revelation. It defined itself within the inherited opinions of the Greek cities. There, philosophy understood itself as the natural culmination of human thinking. Men had opinions about the way things are, they were able to acquire some scientific knowledge, they had viewpoints on the right and the just thing to do, they made statements about the gods; beyond such exercises of the mind, they began to think about the whole and about themselves as displaying the whole and the parts in it. Whether in the Pre socratic study of nature or in the Socratic investigation of man and the political order, they began to exercise philosophical thought.</p>

  <p>现象学正是为我们提供了将哲学作为人类自然成就的这种理解。现象学并不试图从宗教信仰中推导出哲学。相反，它将哲学简单地视为一种自然的人类卓越，一种完成前哲学推理练习的哲学。因此，现象学以一种不同于托马斯主义的方式开始哲学，但以一种补充而不是与托马斯主义方法相矛盾的方式。托马斯主义提供了进入哲学的合法途径，但这不是唯一的途径。从信仰中获得哲学并没有改变哲学，但它确实赋予了它独特的外观和感觉，一种独特的表现形式。另一种进入哲学的方式，即较古老的方式，是从自然态度开始并将哲学与其区分开来。的确，采取现象学提供的途径可能对托马斯主义有益：可以表明托马斯主义假设的语境本身如何与我们称为世界的自然整体区分开来。现象学可以帮助托马斯主义哲学和神学了解它们自己的起源。</p><p>Phenomenology offers us just this kind of understanding of philosophy as a natural human achievement. Phenomenology does not try to derive philosophy from within religious faith. Rather, it takes philosophy simply as a natural human excellence, one that completes the prephilosophical exercises of reason. Phenomenology thus begins philosophy in a manner different from the way Thomism begins it, but in a way that complements and does not contradict the Thomistic approach. Thomism offers a legitimate way of entering into philosophy, but it is not the only way. Taking possession of philosophy from within faith does not deform philosophy, but it does give it a distinctive look and feel, a distinctive presentation. Another way of entering philosophy, the older way, is to begin within the natural attitude and to distinguish the philosophical from it. Indeed, taking the route offered by phenomenology can be of benefit to Thomism: it becomes possible to show how the context assumed by Thomism is itself distinguished from the natural whole we call the world. Phenomenology can help Thomistic philosophy and theology understand their own origins.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_14.xhtml.heading_id_6"><a id="OEBPS/Text/chapter_14.xhtml.ch14_phe"></a>现象学和人类经验</h2><h2><a></a>PHENOMENOLOGY AND HUMAN EXPERIENCE</h2>

  <p>现象学避免了后现代的唯意志论，因为它避免了现代性的表面理性主义。它比这种理性主义更为温和。它承认前哲学经验和思想的有效性，并不试图取而代之。不过，正如我之前所说，说现象学对自然态度中的真假无关紧要似乎有些过分。现象学对它之前的经验没有任何作用吗？它是否只是为了自己的利益而退缩？</p><p>Phenomenology escapes the voluntarism of postmodernity because it avoids the apparent rationalism of modernity. It is more moderate than such rationalism. It recognizes the validity of prephilosophical experience and thinking and does not try to substitute for it. Still, it may seem excessive to say, as I have stated earlier, that phenomenology is indifferent to the truth or falsity found in the natural attitude. Does phenomenology do nothing for the experience that comes before it? Does it just stand back and reflect for its own benefit?</p>

  <p>现象学可以阐明在自然态度中起作用的意向性。例如，它可以显示逻辑与数学有何不同，以及两者与自然科学有何不同；它可以显示每种形式的意向性所追求的是什么，它的目标是什么证据。现象学通过澄清这种经验揭示了什么以及它如何与其他形式的证据相适应来帮助前哲学经验。然而，在这样做时，现象学或哲学并没有用新的方法来代替已经存在的方法。它所做的只是更清晰地区分已经建立了自身完整性的意图。它消除了这些意图中的混淆，并解决了表达这些意图的言语中的歧义。</p><p>Phenomenology can clarify the intentionalities at work in the natural attitude. It can show, for example, how logic differs from mathematics, and how both differ from natural science; it can show what each of these forms of intentionality is after, what evidences it aims at. Phenomenology assists prephilosophical experience by clarifying what such experience discloses and how it fits in with other forms of evidence. In doing so, however, phenomenology or philosophy does not substitute a new method for what was already there. All it does is to distinguish more sharply the intentions that have already established their own integrity. It removes confusions in these intentions and resolves ambiguities in the speech that expresses them.</p>

  <p>现象学也有助于前哲学思考，因为这种思考不可避免地会超越自身，并试图形成关于整体的观点。每一种局部科学，以及人类常识，都表达了对整体的看法。然而，它根据自己的部分观点提出了这一意见。物理学家将整体视为物理整体，政治家将其视为政治整体，心理学家将其视为心理整体。每个局部视图都延伸出自己的哲学伪足。相比之下，现象学，就像每一种真正的哲学一样，看到了对整体的局部观点和适合整体的观点之间的区别。它避免了部分科学的积极性。它知道思考整体需要微妙、保留、细微差别、类比和隐喻，而不是一头扎进。它比部分科学所做的更基本的区分。当我们谈论最广泛的上下文时，它对必须发生的语言转换很敏感。</p><p>Phenomenology also helps prephilosophical thinking because such thinking inevitably goes beyond itself and tries to formulate an opinion about the whole. Every partial science, as well as human common sense, expresses an opinion about the whole. It formulates this opinion, however, in terms of its own partial view. Physicists think of the whole as a physical whole, politicians think of it as political, psychologists think of it as psychological. Each partial view stretches out its own philosophical pseudopod. In contrast, phenomenology, like every true philosophy, sees the difference between a partial view of the whole and a view that is appropriate to the whole. It avoids the positivity of partial sciences. Instead of plunging ahead with blinders on, it knows that thinking about the whole requires subtlety, reserve, nuance, analogy, and metaphor. It makes more basic distinctions than the partial sciences do. It is sensitive to the transformations of language that must occur when we speak about the widest context.</p>

  <p>因此，现象学通过澄清它们的偏向性、通过揭示它们所缺少的东西、以及通过表明它们所识别的东西可以从它们不喜欢的角度来看，来帮助偏向科学和自然态度。它不怀疑也不拒绝，而是澄清和还原。在澄清其他思维方式的偏颇性时，它形成了自己的整体意识。在谈论整体时，它也唤起自我，从而反对现代科学形式的自我遗忘和后现代性的自我否定。现象学帮助我们思考首要问题和最终问题，帮助我们认识自己。</p><p>Phenomenology thus helps the partial sciences and the natural attitude by clarifying their partiality, by bringing out what is absent to them, and by showing that what they identify can be seen from perspectives they do not enjoy. It does not doubt or reject, but clarifies and restores. In clarifying the partiality of other ways of thinking, it formulates its own sense of the whole. In speaking about the whole it also calls the self to mind, and thus counters both the self-forgetfulness of modern forms of science and the self-denial of postmodernity. Phenomenology helps us to think about the first and final issues and helps us to know ourselves.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/appendix.xhtml.heading_id_3"><a id="OEBPS/Text/appendix.xhtml.a_bmh"></a>运动的开始：胡塞尔</h2><h2><a></a>THE BEGINNINGS OF THE MOVEMENT: HUSSERL</h2>

  <p>现象学运动非常巧妙地、几乎完全地融入了 20 世纪。通常被认为是第一部真正的现象学著作，埃德蒙·胡塞尔的<em>《逻辑研究》</em>, 出现在 1900 年和 1901 年的两个部分，因此新运动恰好在世纪初开始。此外，这个日期实际上是一个新的开始，因为胡塞尔是一位真正的原创哲学家。他不能被认为是延续了在他之前形成的传统；就连马丁·海德格尔这样一位强大的哲学家，也只能在胡塞尔开辟的传统中才能得到理解，但胡塞尔并没有这样黯然失色的前辈。他借鉴了 Franz Brentano 和心理学家 Carl Stumpf 的工作，但他大大超越了他们。例如，他的意向性理论就远远优于布伦塔诺的理论。胡塞尔 1900 年以前的著作（他的<em>算术哲学</em>，出版于 1891 年，以及该书之后的几篇文章），虽然它预示了他后来的一些思想，但被公正地认为是前现象学的，就像康德在 1770 年就职论文之前的著作被认为是前批判的一样<em>。</em>所以现在，当我们站在二十世纪末，我们可以回顾始于 1900 年的哲学运动，并尝试对其进行考察。</p><p>The phenomenological movement fits very neatly, almost exactly, into the twentieth century. The work that is generally considered to be the first true phenomenological work, Edmund Husserl's <em>Logical Investigations</em>, appeared in two parts in the years 1900 and 1901, so the new movement began precisely with the dawning of the century. Moreover, this date was literally a new beginning, because Husserl was so truly an original philosopher. He cannot be considered as continuing a tradition that had taken shape before him; even Martin Heidegger, as strong a philosopher as he was, can be understood only in the tradition opened up by Husserl, but Husserl did not have any such overshadowing predecessors. He drew on the work of Franz Brentano and the psychologist Carl Stumpf, but he greatly exceeded them. His theory of intentionality, for example, is far superior to that of Brentano. Husserl's written work before 1900 (his <em>Philosophy of Arithmetic</em>, which appeared in 1891, and the few essays that followed the book), although it foreshadows some of his later thought, is justly considered to be prephenomenological, in the way that Kant's writings before the <em>Inaugural Dissertation</em> of 1770 are taken to be precritical. So now, as we stand at the end of the twentieth century, we can look back at the philosophical movement that began in the year 1900 and attempt to survey it.</p>

  <p>胡塞尔在哈雷大学当了 14 年的私人讲师，由于<em>逻辑研究</em>的成功，他被邀请成为哥廷根大学的教授。他从 1901 年到 1916 年在哥廷根，然后搬到弗莱堡，从 1916 年在那里任教到 1928 年退休。他在弗莱堡又呆了十年，直到 1938 年去世，享年七十九岁。胡塞尔一生只出版了六本书：<em>算术哲学</em>(1891)、<em>逻辑研究</em>(1900-1)、<em>思想 I</em> (1913)、<em>内在时间意识讲座</em>(1928)、<em>形式和先验逻辑</em>(1929) 和<em>笛卡尔沉思</em>(1931)，以法语出现。然而，他撰写了数千页的手稿：课程讲座、哲学素描和沉思、评论、可能出版的草稿；他通过写作进行哲学思考。<em>所有这些材料都收集在胡塞尔档案馆中，许多卷在他死后以Husserliana</em>系列出版，该系列现在有 29 本书，并且还在增加中。计划总共约四十卷。</p><p>Husserl had been a Privatdozent at the University of Halle for fourteen years when, because of the success of <em>Logical Investigations</em>, he was invited to become professor at Göttingen. He was at Göttingen from 1901 to 1916, when he moved to Freiburg, where he taught from 1916 to his retirement in 1928. He remained at Freiburg another ten years until his death in 1938 at the age of seventynine. Husserl published only six books during his lifetime: <em>Philosophy of Arithmetic</em> (1891), <em>Logical Investigations</em> (1900-1), <em>Ideas I</em> (1913), <em>Lectures on Internal Time-Consciousness</em> (1928), <em>Formal and Transcendental Logic</em> (1929), and <em>Cartesian Meditations</em> (1931), which appeared in French. However, he composed thousands of pages of manuscripts: course lectures, philosophical sketches and meditations, commentaries, drafts for possible publication; he philosophized by writing. All these materials were collected in the Husserl Archives, and many volumes were published posthumously in the series <em>Husserliana</em>, which now numbers twenty-nine titles and is still counting. A total of about forty volumes is planned.</p>

  <p>伊丽莎白·斯特罗克（Elisabeth Ströker）（个人通讯）观察到，胡塞尔即使转向哲学，也始终保持着某种自然科学家的气质；他开始学习并撰写了数学博士论文，在进入哲学之前还学习了天文学和心理学。Ströker 说，作为一名自然科学家，他更倾向于实验而不是专着，他的许多哲学著作就像许多实证研究或实验一样。即使是他的大部头书籍也更像是小型研究的集合，而不是建筑结构的作品。</p><p>Elisabeth Ströker (personal communication) has observed that Husserl always remained something of a natural scientist even when he turned to philosophy; he had begun his studies and written his doctoral thesis in mathematics, and also studied astronomy and psychology before entering philosophy. As a natural scientist, he was,&nbsp;Ströker&nbsp;says, more inclined to the experiment than to the monograph, and his many philosophical compositions were like so many empirical studies or experiments. Even his larger books were more like collections of small studies rather than architectonically structured compositions.</p>

  <p>通过他的教学和著作，胡塞尔在他的一生中刺激了现象学几个分支的发展。他施加影响的另一个重要方式是通过他在 1913 年创立的<em>Jahrbuch für Philosophie und phänomenologische Forschung 的编辑工作。许多重要的德国专着出现在该年鉴中，包括海德格尔的</em><em>《存在与时间》</em>、胡塞尔自己的<em>《观念 I》</em>和《形式与<em>形式》。先验逻辑</em>,马克斯·舍勒的<em>伦理学形式主义</em>, 以及阿道夫·赖纳赫、亚历山大·普凡德、奥斯卡·贝克尔和莫里茨·盖格的作品。1913 年至 1930 年间，该系列共出版了十一卷，其中一些包含不止一部作品。最后一部是欧根·芬克 (Eugen Fink) 的研究，题为 Vergegenwärtigung und Bild（表现和图像<em>）</em>。</p><p>Through his teaching and writings, Husserl stimulated the growth of several branches of phenomenology during his lifetime. Another important way in which he exercised influence was through his editorial work on the <em>Jahrbuch für Philosophie und phänomenologische Forschung</em>, which he founded in 1913. Many important German monographs appeared in that yearbook, including Heidegger's <em>Being and Time</em>, Husserl's own <em>Ideas I</em> and <em>Formal and Transcendental Logic</em>, Max Scheler's <em>Formalism in Ethics</em>, and works by Adolf Reinach, Alexander Pfänder, Oskar Becker, and Moritz Geiger. A total of eleven volumes, some of which contained more than one work, were published in this series between 1913 and 1930. The last was a study by Eugen Fink entitled <em>Vergegenwärtigung und Bild</em> (Representation and image).</p>

  <p>在胡塞尔的教学期间，有两个哲学团体受到了影响，一个在哥廷根，一个在慕尼黑。在慕尼黑的那个是通过阅读<em>逻辑调查而自发产生的</em>. 在慕尼黑大学，西奥多·利普斯 (Theodor Lipps) 的学生在世纪之交组织了一个哲学团体。该团体包括最初的亚历山大·普凡德和约翰内斯·多伯特，以及后来的阿道夫·赖纳赫、西奥多·康拉德、海德薇·康拉德-马蒂乌斯、莫里茨·盖格、迪特里希·冯·希尔德布兰德和马克斯·舍勒等人物，受到胡塞尔的著作影响并逐渐成为一个独立的现象学中心。成员们经常在哥廷根会见胡塞尔，他们邀请他到慕尼黑讲学，还有一些人调到哥廷根跟他一起学习。令慕尼黑哲学家感兴趣的是胡塞尔在哲学上对心理主义的克服和实在论的复辟。然而，他们不喜欢他后来发展的先验哲学，认为这是唯心主义的倒退，他们认为自己的工作是未经还原的现象学。随后，在哥廷根，另一个小组成立了。它的一些成员来自慕尼黑，例如 Reinach、Daubert、Conrad、Conrad-Martius 和 von Hildebrand，此外还有 Alexandre Koyre 和 Jean Hering 等人物。Roman Ingarden 和 Edith Stein 成为这个小组的成员，后来与胡塞尔一起去了弗莱堡。</p><p>Two philosophical groups were influenced by Husserl during his teaching period, one at Göttingen and one at Munich. The one at Munich arose spontaneously through the reading of <em>Logical Investigations</em>. At the University of Munich, students of Theodor Lipps had organized a philosophical group around the turn of the century; the group, including such figures as Alexander Pfänder and Johannes Daubert at the beginning, and later Adolf Reinach, Theodor Conrad, Hedwig Conrad-Martius, Moritz Geiger, Dietrich von Hildebrand, and Max Scheler, was influenced by Husserl's written work and gradually became an independent center of phenomenology. Members met frequently with Husserl at Göttingen, they invited him to lecture at Munich, and some transferred to Göttingen to study with him. What interested the Munich philosophers was Husserl's overcoming of psychologism and his restoration of realism in philosophy. They disliked his later development of a transcendental philosophy, however, thinking it to be a relapse into idealism, and they thought of their own work as phenomenology without the reduction. At Göttingen, subsequently, another group was formed. Some of its members came from Munich, such as Reinach, Daubert, Conrad, Conrad-Martius, and von Hildebrand, and they were joined by such figures as Alexandre Koyre and Jean Hering. Roman Ingarden and Edith Stein became members of this group and later went with Husserl to Freiburg.</p>

  <p>当胡塞尔于 1916 年搬到弗莱堡大学时，那里还没有建立正式的现象学圈子，但许多杰出人物与他共事：斯坦因、英加登、芬克、路德维希·兰格里布，尤其是马丁·海德格尔。其他在 20 年代留学期间受到他影响的还有雅各布·克莱因和汉斯-格奥尔格·伽达默尔，他们在马尔堡，更直接地受到海德格尔的影响。</p><p>When Husserl moved to the University of Freiburg in 1916, no formal circle of phenomenology was established there, but many prominent figures worked with him: Stein, Ingarden, Fink, Ludwig Landgrebe, and especially Martin Heidegger. Others who were influenced by him while studying elsewhere in the 1920s were Jacob Klein and Hans-Georg Gadamer, who were at Marburg and were more directly influenced by Heidegger.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/appendix.xhtml.heading_id_4"><a id="OEBPS/Text/appendix.xhtml.a_sshhs"></a>第二阶段：胡塞尔、海德格尔和舍勒</h2><h2><a></a>THE SECOND STAGE: HUSSERL, HEIDEGGER AND SCHELER</h2>

  <p>在 20 年代，作为一种文化现象的胡塞尔哲学运动，由于马丁·海德格尔出现在学术和知识界而有所偏离。海德格尔给德国哲学界留下了深刻的印象，抢了胡塞尔的风头。胡塞尔和海德格尔是哲学史上一对伟大的思想家，要了解他们的关系，让我们回到几年前的 1907 年，当时海德格尔阅读了布伦塔诺关于亚里士多德关于存在的多种感觉的书。两年后，作为弗赖堡的一名学生，他阅读了胡塞尔的<em>《逻辑研究》</em>. 1913 年，他在 Neokantian Heinrich Rickert 的指导下完成了他的博士论文，并于 1915 年写下了他的毕业证书，然后开始在弗莱堡任教，当时胡塞尔即将来到那里。作为一名年轻教师，海德格尔讲授希腊哲学家和现象学，以及宗教哲学。<em>他应邀在马尔堡任教，并于 1923 年离开弗莱堡。1923-24 年冬天，他完成了《存在与时间》</em>的初稿，并于 1924 年开始在马尔堡任教。《<em>存在与时间》</em>于 1927 年出版。胡塞尔于 1928 年退休后，海德格尔应邀在弗莱堡接替胡塞尔。海德格尔在马尔堡待了四年，即 1924 年至 1928 年，但他在那里和早些时候在弗莱堡的演讲已经使他名声大噪，揭示了自己独立的哲学立场。</p><p>During the 1920s Husserl's philosophical movement, as a cultural phenomenon, was somewhat derailed by the appearance of Martin Heidegger on the academic and intellectual scene. Heidegger made a tremendous impression on the philosophical world in Germany and stole Husserl's thunder. Husserl and Heidegger form one of the great pairs of thinkers in the history of philosophy, and to understand their relationship let us move back a few years to 1907, when Heidegger read Brentano's book on the many senses of being in Aristotle. Two years later as a student at Freiburg he read Husserl's <em>Logical Investigations</em>. He completed his doctoral dissertation under the Neokantian Heinrich Rickert in 1913, wrote his habilitation in 1915, and then began teaching at Freiburg, just as Husserl was coming there. As a young teacher, Heidegger lectured on Greek philosophers and on phenomenology, and also on the philosophy of religion. He was invited to teach at Marburg and left Freiburg in 1923. In the winter of 1923-24 he composed the first draft of <em>Being and Time</em>, and he began teaching at Marburg in 1924. <em>Being and Time</em> was published in 1927. Heidegger was invited to succeed Husserl in Freiburg on the latter's retirement in 1928. Heidegger had remained at Marburg for four years, 1924 to 1928, but his lectures, both there and earlier at Freiburg, had already made him famous and had revealed his own independent philosophical position.</p>

  <p>海德格尔十七岁读亚里士多德，十九岁读胡塞尔的<em>《逻辑研究》 。</em>正是这两个来源的结合在哲学上深深地塑造了他。在<em>《存在与时间</em>》§7 中，他断言他的分析方法将是现象学的，并且他对现象学的含义提供了清晰的解释，但尽管胡塞尔对他施加了影响，但两位哲学家之间存在许多明显的差异。</p><p>Heidegger read about Aristotle when he was seventeen years old, and he read Husserl's <em>Logical Investigations</em> when he was nineteen. It was the combination of these two sources that deeply shaped him philosophically. In <em>Being and Time</em> §7 he asserts that the method of his analysis will be phenomenological, and he provides a lucid explanation of what phenomenology means, but despite the influence Husserl exercised on him, there are a number of obvious differences between the two philosophers.</p>

  <p>首先，海德格尔用经典术语阐述了他的任务，并展示了他对哲学史的渊博知识。胡塞尔是数学家走上哲学之路，而海德格尔则从一开始就接受了哲学家的教育。<em>《存在与时间》</em>引用了亚里士多德、奥古斯丁、圣托马斯、苏亚雷斯、笛卡尔、康德等哲学家和神学家，以及创世记、加尔文、慈运理和伊索等人的资料，并将复兴存在的问题。海德格尔能够通过将胡塞尔的成就应用到更经典的哲学问题上来利用它。他也比胡塞尔更善于使用古典哲学词汇。</p><p>First, Heidegger formulates his task in classical terms and shows a great knowledge of the history of philosophy. Husserl was a mathematician who came to philosophy, while Heidegger was educated as a philosopher from the beginning. <em>Being and Time</em> quotes such sources as Aristotle, Augustine, Saint Thomas, Suarez, Descartes, Kant, and other philosophers and theologians, as well as the Book of Genesis, Calvin, Zwingli, and Aesop, and it sets as its goal the rejuvenation of the issue of being. Heidegger was able to make use of what Husserl accomplished by applying it to more classical philosophical issues. He was also better able than Husserl to use a classical philosophical vocabulary.</p>

  <p>其次，胡塞尔在其作品的风格和内容上是一个非常理性的主义者，而海德格尔的写作和教学的风格和内容吸引了读者并向他提出了存在主义的问题。这有好有坏。它的好处在于它明确地提出了这样一个事实，即哲学不仅是漫不经心或无忧无虑的思辨，而且是一种生活方式，对那些实践它的人来说是一种巨大的利益。然而，糟糕的是，海德格尔在追求他的哲学事业时，没有充分区分理论生活与实践生活、哲学与审慎；他也没有明确区分理论生活和宗教。他既想成为思想家，又想成为先知和道德领袖，这些生活方式之间的摇摆混淆了他自己的作品，并影响了那些受他影响的人的思想。海德格尔分析向死存在、焦虑或本真性的主要目的，主要不是给我们提供忧虑的理由，或让我们对生活认真，或让我们出去投票；相反，他正在使用这些现象作为解决存在问题的方法。它们具有分析功能，而不是劝告功能。它们将表明，存在问题不仅在思辨的形而上学中得到揭示，而且在人类存在的所有种类中得到揭示。然而，即使在海德格尔自己的著作中，分析的目的也确实与宗教和道德劝诫相融合。他们有一些预言。一个可以是先知，等待众神的新降临，一个可以是哲学家，</p><p>Second, Husserl is very much a rationalist in the style and content of his work, while the style and content of Heidegger's writing and teaching engage the reader and put existential questions to him. This is both good and bad. It is good in that it brings out explicitly the fact that philosophy is not merely unconcerned or carefree speculation, but a way of life and a great benefit for those who practice it. However, it is bad in that when pursuing his philosophical project, Heidegger did not distinguish adequately between the theoretical and the practical life, between philosophy and prudence; he also did not distinguish clearly between the theoretic life and religion. He wanted to be a prophet and moral leader as much as a thinker, and the oscillation between these forms of life confused his own work and affected the thought of those who were influenced by him. The main purpose of Heidegger's analysis of being-toward-death, or of anxiety, or of authenticity, is not primarily to give us grounds for worry or make us earnest about life or get us out to vote; rather, he is using these phenomena as approaches to the question of being. They have an analytic function, not an exhortative one. They are to show that the question of being is disclosed not only in speculative metaphysics, but in all the varieties of human existence. However, even in Heidegger's own writings, the analytic purpose does blend with a religious and moral exhortation. There is something prophetic about them. One can be a prophet, awaiting the new coming of the gods, and one can be a philosopher, but it is misleading to try to be both at the same time.</p>

  <p>胡塞尔与海德格尔的这种差异，换一种说法是，胡塞尔是从科学家和数学家的冲动出发，转化为哲学，而海德格尔是从宗教冲动出发，融入哲学。理性主义者胡塞尔认为自己是一个自由的、非教义的、非教条主义的基督徒，但他在他的作品中非常谨慎地使用宗教范畴。他致力于将哲学作为一门严谨的科学。他尊重宗教，但又有些疏远。相比之下，海德格尔似乎把他的哲学描述为宗教问题的解决方案。据观察，胡塞尔的一些追随者皈依了天主教或新教；这并不是因为胡塞尔鼓励这样的举动（事实上，他似乎对此有些尴尬），但因为他的工作恢复了对各种经验领域的尊重，从而使人们能够不受阻碍地培养自己的宗教发展。然而，这种转变在海德格尔的追随者中并不常见，而且我认为，在海德格尔形成转变的对立面的人类语境中，更有可能发生。人们会倾向于从宗教信仰转向哲学，以此作为对付宗教冲动的一种方式。死亡率、真实性、决定性、人类存在的解释学以及暂时性和永恒性的问题将通过哲学分析和劝告来处理，而不是通过传统形式的宗教奉献来处理。哲学上的回应甚至会被认为是两者中更真实的。</p><p>Another way of expressing this difference between Husserl and Heidegger is to say that Husserl began with the impulse of a scientist and a mathematician and transformed it into philosophy, while Heidegger began with the religious impulse and blended it into the philosophical one. Husserl, the rationalist, thought of himself as a free, nondoctrinal, and nondogmatic Christian, but he used religious categories very sparingly in his work. He was intent on philosophy as a rigorous science. He respected religion, but was somewhat distanced from it. Heidegger, in contrast, seemed to present his philosophy as a resolution of the religious problem. It has been observed that several followers of Husserl converted to Catholicism or Protestantism; this occurred not because Husserl encouraged such a move (indeed, he seemed somewhat embarrassed by it), but because his work restored respectability to various domains of experience and thus allowed people to cultivate their own religious development without hindrance. Such conversions were not common among Heidegger's followers, however, and I would suggest that in the human context that Heidegger formed the opposite of a conversion would be more likely to take place. People would be inclined to turn from religious faith to philosophy as a way of dealing with the religious impulse. Questions of mortality, authenticity, decisiveness, the hermeneutics of human existence, and temporality and eternity would be treated by philosophical analysis and exhortation rather than by religious dedication in its traditional form. The philosophical response would even be taken as the more authentic of the two. No one tried to interpret the New Testament in Husserlian categories, but Rudolf Bultmann tried to do so with the categories of Heidegger, and one might claim that others did something similar in regard to Catholic belief.</p>

  <p>胡塞尔对海德格尔影响最大的是什么？我认为这是一个事实，即在胡塞尔那里，笛卡尔或现代认识论问题已经得到解决和克服。胡塞尔的意向性概念摒弃了孤独的、自我封闭的意识，它只意识到自身及其自身的感觉和思想。事实上，认识论问题在<em>《存在与时间》中被嘲笑</em>§13。我们体验和感知事物，而不仅仅是事物对我们的表象、影响或印象。事物通过多种表现形式呈现给我们。胡塞尔不仅通过指出笛卡尔和洛克立场、思想方式的自相矛盾，而且通过对各种形式的意向性进行详细的描述性分析，证明了自己的分析以其精确性和有效性证明了这一现实主义。说服力。一个不能证明现实主义；怎么能这样做呢？一个显示它。</p><p>What was it in Husserl that most influenced Heidegger? I would suggest that it was the fact that in Husserl the Cartesian or the modern epistemological problem had been dissolved and overcome. The notion of a solitary, self-enclosed consciousness, aware only of itself and its own sensations and thoughts, was disposed of by Husserl's concept of intentionality. Indeed, the epistemological problem is ridiculed in <em>Being and Time</em> §13. We experience and perceive things, not just the appearances or impacts or impressions that things make on us. Things appear to us through a manifold of presentations. Husserl presented this realism not only by pointing out the self-contradictions of the Cartesian and Lockean position, of the way of ideas, but also by working out detailed descriptive analyses of various forms of intentionality, analyses that proved themselves by virtue of their precision and convincingness. One does not prove realism; how could one do so? One displays it.</p>

  <p>更具体地说，这种意向性学说的突破体现在胡塞尔的两个更特殊的学说中：首先，他对范畴表达的分析，其次他坚持认为我们确实在不存在的情况下确实意向事物。这两种教导都生动地呈现在海德格尔的早期作品中。在他的范畴学说中，胡塞尔表明，当我们表达事物时，当我们判断、关联、组合或构造事物时，我们不仅仅是在安排我们自己的内在概念、想法或印象；相反，我们表达世界上的事物。我们把部分带出整体。例如，我们的判断不是我们试图与某种“外部”世界相匹配的内部组合；它们以最基本的形式，是对我们所经历事物的自信表达；我们表达了事物的存在，以及它们被赋予我们的方式。因此，胡塞尔的意向性学说不应该仅仅从知觉的角度来理解，在知觉中我们被告知我们所感知的事物确实会立即呈现给我们。应该特别注意建立在感知之上的范畴表述。胡塞尔的范畴陈述学说，如第 6 章所述<em>逻辑研究</em>，对于海德格尔对存在问题的表述至关重要。</p><p>More particularly, this breakthrough in the doctrine of intentionality expressed itself in two more particular doctrines of Husserl: first, his analysis of categorial articulation, and second his insistence that we truly do intend things in their absence. Both of these teachings are vividly present in the early Heidegger. In his doctrine of categoriality, Husserl shows that when we articulate things, when we judge or relate or compose or structure things, we do not merely arrange our own internal concepts or ideas or impressions; rather, we articulate things in the world. We bring out parts within wholes. Our judgments, for example, are not internal compositions that we try to match against some sort of "external" world; they are, in their most elementary form, the assertive articulation of the things we experience; we articulate the presence of things, the manner in which they are given to us. Thus, HusserI's doctrine of intentionality should not be taken only in regard to perception, in which we are told that the things we perceive do immediately present themselves to us. It should be taken especially in regard to the categorial articulation that is built upon perception. The doctrine of categorial presentation in Husserl, as given in the sixth of the <em>Logical Investigations</em>, was crucial for Heidegger's formulation of the question of being.</p>

  <p>此外，通过意向性学说，胡塞尔能够说我们实际上意向了不在场的事物。我们并非总是只处理眼前的存在；事实并非如此，当我们提到不存在的事物时，我们实际上是在谈论我们对事物的印象或概念。人类的思维是这样的，它超越了当下，意在不在场；不存在的，不存在的，是这样给予我们的。此外，还有不同类型的缺席，对应于我们的意向性可以承担的不同类型的空洞意图：我们所感知事物的另一面的缺席，仅通过文字表达的事物的缺席，被记住的事物的缺席，只描绘事物的缺席，远方的人的缺席与死者的缺席相对，过去和未来的缺席，神圣的缺席。胡塞尔描述的另一种重要的不在场是模糊的，在这种情况下，事物被给予我们，但只是模糊地给予，需要进一步的表达和占有。我相信，这个缺席的主题刺激了海德格尔关于涉及真理的无蔽状态的概念。</p><p>Also, through the doctrine of intentionality Husserl is able to say that we actually intend things that are absent. It is not the case that we always deal only with immediate presences; it is not the case that when we refer to something absent, we are really talking about an image or a concept we have of the thing. Human thinking is such that it transcends the present and intends the absent; the absent, what is not there, is given to us as such. There are, furthermore, different kinds of absence, corresponding to the different kinds of empty intendings our intentionality can take on: the absence of the other side of things we perceive, the absence of things meant only through words, the absence of things being remembered, the absence of things only depicted, the absence of those who are far away as opposed to the absence of those who have died, the absence of the past and that of the future, the absence of the divine. Another important kind of absence that Husserl described is that of vagueness, in which things are given to us, but given only indistinctly, in need of further articulation and possession. This theme of absence was, I believe, a stimulus to Heidegger's notion of unconcealedness as involved in truth.</p>

  <p>海德格尔在胡塞尔发现的意向性中看到了哲学上的可能性，并以报复的方式加以利用。其他哲学家对胡塞尔的开辟印象深刻。例如，慕尼黑学派和哥廷根学派的成员为胡塞尔的发现使“实在论”成为可能而欢欣鼓舞。然而，他们都没有海德格尔的深度、独创性和哲学能量，也没有他宗教调性的诱人魅力。</p><p>Heidegger saw the philosophical possibilities in Husserl's discovery of intentionality and exploited them with a vengeance. Other philosophers had been impressed by what Husserl opened up. The members of the Munich and Gottingen schools, for example, rejoiced in the "realism" that was made possible by Husserl's discoveries. None of them, however, had the depth and originality and philosophical energy of Heidegger or the seductive charm of his religious tonality.</p>

  <p>我想再提一个海德格尔和胡塞尔的区别。胡塞尔对哲学史的使用非常吝啬。他偶尔会提供对那段历史的调查，他使用了笛卡尔、伽利略、洛克、休谟和康德，但他对这些作家的了解显然有限。他对他们做了一些尖锐的评论，通常会触及他们哲学中问题的核心，但他对他们的工作只有相当简单的教科书知识。另一方面，胡塞尔提出的哲学分析内容丰富而广泛。他提出了语言结构、感知、各种形式的时间、记忆、预期、生物、数学、数字、因果关系等问题。他提出许多存在区域作为分析的主题。那么，胡塞尔，</p><p>I would like to mention one more difference between Heidegger and Husserl. Husserl is very skimpy in his use of the history of philosophy. He does provide occasional surveys of that history, and he uses Descartes, Galileo, Locke, Hume, and Kant, but he does so with an obviously limited knowledge of these writers. He makes some incisive comments about them and usually gets to the heart of issues in their philosophy, but he has a rather simplified, textbook knowledge of their work. On the other hand, the content of what Husserl proposes for philosophical analysis is rich and wide-ranging. He opens up issues in the structure of language, perception, time in its various forms, memory, anticipation, living things, mathematics, numbers, causality, and so on. He proposes many regions of being as subjects for analysis. Husserl, then, is oversimplified in his treatment of authors but rich in his treatment of speculative topics.</p>

  <p>海德格尔与此相反。他似乎只关心一个问题，即存在及其含义的问题。诚然，在<em>《存在与时间》</em>中他引入了一些可以被视为“区域性”的问题，例如工具性、言语和死亡，但所有这些都从属于一个存在问题。他没有在我们面前展开各种区域任务，各种领域进行分析；他在哲学上是一个偏执狂，总是在通往第一原则的道路上，而胡塞尔既朝着第一原则前进，又花很多时间远离它们，并将它们体现在我们所经历的各种事物中。至于内容，Husser！似乎是杂色的，而海德格尔似乎过于简单化了。</p><p>Heidegger is the opposite of this. He seems concerned with only one issue, the question of being and its implications. It is true that in <em>Being and Time</em> he introduces a number of what could be taken as "regional" issues, such as instrumentality and speech and death, but all of them are subordinated to the one question of being. He does not spread out various regional tasks before us, various domains to be analyzed; he is philosophically a monomaniac, always on the way to the first principles, while Husserl both moves toward the first principles and then spends much time moving away from them and embodying them in the various things we experience. As regards content, Husser! seems variegated while Heidegger seems oversimplified.</p>

  <p>然而，就作者而言，海德格尔的多样性非常丰富。他对前苏格拉底学派、柏拉图、亚里士多德、中世纪思想家、莱布尼茨、康德、黑格尔、克尔凯郭尔和尼采，以及荷尔德林和里尔克等诗人以及安吉鲁斯·西里修斯和路德等宗教作家进行了详尽的讨论和复杂的解释。然而，所有这些作家都被审查了关于存在的问题是如何在他们身上提出的。我还想提一下海德格尔对希腊哲学的新方法的重要性，对前苏格拉底哲学家、柏拉图和亚里士多德的解释，尤其是在过去一百年的繁荣时期的德国和法国。</p><p>As regards authors, however, Heidegger is positively exuberant in his variety. He discusses in great detail and in sophisticated interpretations the Presocratics, Plato, Aristotle, medieval thinkers, Leibniz, Kant, Hegel, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche, as well as poets such as H6lderin and Rilke and religious writers such as Angelus Silesius and Luther. All these writers, however, are examined in regard to how the question of being is raised in them. I would also like to mention the importance Heidegger had for a new approach to Greek philosophy, for the interpretation of the Presocratics, Plato, and Aristotle, especially in Germany and France during the rich period of the last one hundred years.</p>

  <p>在结束对德国现象学阶段的考察之前，我应该谈谈马克斯·舍勒。舍勒不能像胡塞尔和海德格尔那样清楚地置身于现象学运动之中；他是一位独立的思想家，有时发展和评论现象学主题，有时批评和远离这种形式的哲学。使他看起来像个现象学家的地方在于，他关注具体的、具体的问题，尤其是人类的宗教、同情、爱、恨、情感、道德价值等问题，并进行详尽的分析。他与现象学的边缘联系有助于普及该运动，但他也可以自由活动。在经历了戏剧性和动荡的一生之后，舍勒于 1928 年去世，享年 54 岁。</p><p>Before closing this survey of the German phase of phenomenology, I should say a word about Max Scheler. Scheler cannot be placed as clearly within the phenomenological movement as Husserl and Heidegger can; he was an independent thinker who at some times developed and commented on phenomenological themes, at other times criticized and distanced himself from that form of philosophy. What makes him seem to be a phenomenologist is that he pays attention to concrete, specific issues, especially human issues such as religion, sympathy, love, hate, emotions, and moral values, and he analyzes them in detail. His marginal affiliation with phenomenology helped popularize the movement, but he also moved freely outside it. After a dramatic and turbulent life, Scheler died in 1928 at the age of fifty-four.</p>

  <p>毫不夸张地说，政治和历史事件侵入了 1930 年代的现象学运动。随着国家社会主义者的掌权，海德格尔加入了该党，并于 1933 年担任弗莱堡大学校长，言行一致。相比之下，胡塞尔在 1938 年去世前遭受了许多侮辱和危险。欧洲大事记民族导致德国和大陆哲学与英国和美国世界之间的深刻分离。</p><p>It would be an understatement to say that political and historical events intruded on the phenomenological movement in the 1930s. With the rise to power of the National Socialists, Heidegger became involved with the party and acted and spoke accordingly as rector of the University of Freiburg in 1933. Husserl, in contrast, suffered many indignities and dangers before his death in 1938. Events among European nations led to a deep separation between German and continental philosophy and the British and American world.</p>

  <p>就在战争爆发前夕，鲁汶的方济会会士赫尔曼·列奥·范·布雷达来到弗莱堡研究现象学，看到那里的情况，采取行动拯救胡塞尔的文字资料和图书馆，并于 1938 年秋天将它们运到鲁汶，大约六胡塞尔死后几个月。他还营救并保护了胡塞尔的遗孀马尔文，她在战争期间被安置在鲁汶的一座修道院中。范布雷达的行动导致战后在鲁汶大学建立了胡塞尔档案馆。该档案馆成为编辑和出版胡塞尔著作以及研究其思想的重要国际中心。后来在科隆、弗赖堡、巴黎和纽约建立了附属档案馆。</p><p>Just before the outbreak of war, the Franciscan Herman Leo Van Breda of Louvain came to Freiburg to study phenomenology and, seeing the situation there, acted to save Husserl's written materials and library, having them shipped to Louvain in the fall of 1938, some six months after Husserl's death. He also rescued and protected Husserl's widow, Malvine, who was sheltered in a convent at Louvain for the duration of the war. Van Breda's actions led to the establishment of the Husserl Archives at the University of Louvain after the war. The archives became an important international center for the editing and publication of Husserl's writings and for research into his thought. Mfiliated archives were later established at Cologne, Freiburg, Paris, and New York.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/appendix.xhtml.heading_id_5"><a id="OEBPS/Text/appendix.xhtml.a_pf"></a>现象学在法国</h2><h2><a></a>PHENOMENOLOGY IN FRANCE</h2>

  <p>在德国之后，对现象学运动具有最重要意义的肯定是法国分支。伊曼纽尔·列维纳斯在20年代师从胡塞尔和海德格尔，撰写了一篇关于胡塞尔思想中直觉概念的论文，于1930年发表，并合译了笛卡尔沉思集，1931年<em>出版</em>。</p><p>After the German, it was certainly the French branch that was of greatest significance for the phenomenological movement. Emmanuel Levinas studied with Husserl and Heidegger in the 1920s, wrote a thesis on the concept of intuition in Husserl's thought, which was published in 1930, and cotranslated <em>Cartesian Meditations</em>, which appeared in 1931.</p>

  <p>让-保罗·萨特 (1905-1980) 在德国 (1933-35) 的柏林和弗赖堡度过了两年。他的早期作品表现出胡塞尔的强烈影响，但转变为一种存在主义的人道主义。事实上，萨特的许多早期作品都是出色的现象学分析，它们发展了胡塞尔的重要主题。我要特别提到<em>想象力</em>（1936）、“自我的超越”（1936）、<em>情绪理论素描</em>（1939）、<em>想象</em>（1940）和<em>存在与虚无</em>（1943 年）。阅读这些作品给人留下深刻印象的是，萨特在对各种人类经验的描述和分析中，如何很好地把握了意向性的概念并看到了它的哲学潜力，以及他如何有效地将缺席元素用作哲学主题自我的。萨特对胡塞尔的尊重无疑极大地帮助了胡塞尔的思想在战后为更广泛的公众所接受和感兴趣。</p><p>Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980) spent two years in Germany (1933-35), in Berlin and Freiburg. His early works show the strong influence of Husserl, but transformed into an existentialist humanism. In fact, many of Sartre's early works are excellent phenomenological analyses that develop important themes in Husserl. I would mention especially <em>The Imagination</em> (1936), "The Transcendence of the Ego" (1936), <em>Sketch of a Theory of the Emotions</em> (1939), <em>The Imaginary</em> (1940), and <em>Being and Nothingness</em> (1943). What strikes one in reading these works is how well Sartre grasped the concept of intentionality and saw its philosophical potential, and how effectively he used the element of absence as a philosophical theme, both in his descriptions of various kinds of human experience and in his analyses of the ego. Sartre's respect for Husserl certainly helped greatly in making Husserl's thought accessible and interesting to a wider public after the war.</p>

  <p>特别是，萨特对我们如何实际感知或体验非存在、事物的缺席有出色的描述；否定不仅是我们判断的一个特征，而且是在判断之前的直觉体验中给出的。各种情绪的转化力量，以及想象力的生动运动和投射，都以与胡塞尔自己的描述相辅相成的方式被描述。例如，萨特将想象力称为“<em>感知文艺复兴时期”</em>”并详细描述了前反射意识。他还强调了行动自我，展示了抽象可能性与作为他自己的代理人存在的可能性之间的区别，如果没有他自己在某种情况下就不会发生的可能性。他描述了facticity 和 transcendence 之间的区别，并对决定论作为一种避免自由带来的焦虑的形式进行了出色的分析。他的风格流畅而引人入胜。</p><p>In particular, Sartre has excellent descriptions of how we actually perceive or experience nonbeing, the absence of things; negation is not merely a feature of our judgments, but is given in the intuitive experience that precedes judgment. The transforming power of the various emotions, as well as the lively movement and projection of imagination, are described in ways that complement Husserl's own descriptions. Sartre speaks of imagination, for example, as "<em>perception renaissante</em>" and describes prereflexive consciousness in great detail. He also stresses the acting self, showing the distinction between abstract possibilities and possibilities that are there for an agent as his own, those that would not come about without his own presence in a situation. He describes the difference between facticity and transcendence and provides a remarkable analysis of determinism as a form of avoiding the anxieties that freedom brings. His style is fluid and engaging.</p>

  <p>然而，萨特有意识地将现象学主题纳入他自己的存在人道主义哲学计划，其中涉及许多其他来源的元素，尤其是笛卡尔、黑格尔和马克思。<em>他甚至在《存在与虚无》</em>中批评胡塞尔的哲学胆怯；他说，胡塞尔将自己限制在中立的分析上，并避免了存在主义和本体论的承诺（“他仍然害怕 [ <em>craintivement</em>] 在功能描述的层面上”）。我相信，顺便说一下，当萨特声称意向目标就像斯多葛的 lekton 并且他声称胡塞尔仍然是现象主义者而不是不是现象学家，总是徘徊在康德唯心主义的边缘。</p><p>However, Sartre consciously incorporated phenomenological themes into his own philosophical project of existential humanism, which involved elements from many other sources, especially Descartes, Hegel, and Marx. He even criticizes Husserl, in <em>Being and Nothingness</em>, for a kind of philosophical timidity; he says Husserl restricted himself to neutral analysis and avoided existential and ontological commitments ("he remained fearfully [<em>craintivement</em>] on the level of functional description"). I believe, incidentally, that Sartre misinterprets Husserl on the concept of noema and the nature of appearance when he claims that the noema is like the Stoic lekton and when he claims that Husserl remained a phenomenalist rather than a phenomenologist, always tottering on the brink of Kantian idealism.</p>

  <p>萨特在“自在”和“自为”之间的根本对比忽视了应该尊重的中间区别，例如动物意识中出现的区别。特别是，当谈及虚无现象时，<em>勒内昂</em>将其建立在人类意识中，他如此强调差异和差异性，而忽略了始终伴随这些负面因素而来的身份元素。<em>他将le rien</em>描述为允许自我在意识中变得与自身异化，这预示了德里达引入<em>延异</em>和“痕迹”，但这两位法国思想家似乎都忽略了胡塞尔在这些现象中会认识到的相应的相同性和同一性。萨特在一种哲学中使用现象学，这种哲学不仅是分析性的，而且是劝诫性的，一种戏剧性的人道主义，在这种修辞性的写作中，人们总是强调事物的某些方面而忽略其他方面。</p><p>Sartre's radical contrast between the "in itself" and the "for itself" overlooks intermediate distinctions that should be respected, such as those that occur in animal awareness. In particular, when speaking of the phenomenon of nothingness, <em>le néant</em>, as being founded in human consciousness, he so stresses difference and otherness as to overlook elements of identity that always come along with these negatives. His description of <em>le rie</em>n as permitting the ego to become alien to itself in consciousness anticipates Derrida's introduction of <em>différance</em> and "traces," but both French thinkers seem to neglect the corresponding sameness and identity that Husserl would recognize in such phenomena. Sartre made use of phenomenology within a philosophy that was not only analytic but also exhortative, a kind of dramatic humanism, and in such rhetorical writing one always emphasizes some aspects of things to the neglect of others.</p>

  <p>莫里斯·梅洛-庞蒂（Maurice Merleau-Ponty）（1908-1961）的发展比萨特晚了几年。Merleau-Ponty 从未在德国学习过，但在他的研究中受到其他影响，他在 1930 年代初期得到了 Aron Gurwitsch 的帮助，他在 1930 年代初期逃离德国并在巴黎任教，然后来到美国，在那里，他成为 1960 年代和 70 年代新社会研究学院现象学的重要人物。梅洛-庞蒂的第一部主要著作，也许是他最经久不衰的著作，是<em>《行为结构》</em>（1942 年）和<em>《知觉现象学》</em>（1945 年）。两者都是对实证主义心理学的批评。梅洛-庞蒂强调前反身性、前谓性、感性、时间性、活生生的身体和生活世界。他描述的丰富性和复杂性与萨特作品的质量相匹配，并且仍然是重要的现象学成就。梅洛-庞蒂主要借鉴了胡塞尔后期的作品，并利用了胡塞尔档案馆中未经编辑的材料。或许是因为他对实证主义科学的批判，也可能是因为他工作的卓越，梅洛-庞蒂在 20 世纪 50 年代和 60 年代的美国产生了巨大的影响。许多人发现他的作品比胡塞尔本人严谨的、近乎数学的著作更容易理解。</p><p>Maurice Merleau-Ponty's (1908-1961) development followed a few years after that of Sartre. Merleau-Ponty never studied in Germany, but among other influences in his studies he was helped in his understanding of both phenomenology and Gestalt psychology in the early 1930s by Aron Gurwitsch, who had fled Germany and taught in Paris before coming to the United States, where he became an important figure representing phenomenology at the New School for Social Research in the 1960s and 1970s. Merleau-Ponty's first major writings, and perhaps his most enduring, were <em>The Structure of Behavior</em> (1942) and <em>Phenomenology of Perception</em> (1945). Both were criticisms of positivist psychology. Merleau-Ponty stresses the prereflexive, the prepredicative, the perceptual, the temporal, the lived body, and the life world. The richness and complexity of his descriptions match the quality of Sartre's work and remain as important phenomenological achievements. Merleau-Ponty appealed mostly to Husserl's later work and made use of unedited materials in the Husserl Archives. Perhaps because of his criticism of positivist science, but also because of the excellence of his work, Merleau-Ponty exercised a great influence in the United States during the 1950s and 1960s. Many found his work more accessible than the rigorous, almost mathematical writing of Husserl himself.</p>

  <p>我还应该提到 Paul Ricoeur（生于 1913 年），他是现象学运动法国分支的成员。他翻译了胡塞尔的<em>思想一</em>，对其进行了广泛的评论，并对人类自由、宗教、象征主义、神话和精神分析进行了独立的哲学分析。有趣的是，他对人类自由的研究《<em>自愿与非自愿</em>》深受慕尼黑现象学家之一亚历山大·普凡德 (Alexander Pfänder) 的影响。</p><p>I should also mention Paul Ricoeur (b. 1913) as a member of the French branch of the phenomenological movement. He translated Husserl's <em>Ideas I</em>, commented extensively on him, and carried out independent philosophical analyses of human freedom, religion, symbolism, myth, and psychoanalysis. It is interesting that his study of human freedom, <em>The Voluntary and the Involuntary</em>, was very much influenced by Alexander Pfänder, one of the Munich phenomenologists.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/appendix.xhtml.heading_id_6"><a id="OEBPS/Text/appendix.xhtml.a_poc"></a>其他国家的现象学</h2><h2><a></a>PHENOMENOLOGY IN OTHER COUNTRIES</h2>

  <p>现象学的德国根源和法国分支当然是这一运动的主要部分，但其他重要部分也出现在其他国家。在美国，William Ernest Hocking 曾于 1902 年跟随 Husserl 学习了一个学期，20 年代末和 193 年代初的 Dorion Cairns 也是如此。凯恩斯在1933年写了一篇关于胡塞尔的哈佛论文，成为胡塞尔著作的出色译者。马文·法伯 (Marvin Farber) 于 1928 年在布法罗 (Buffalo) 撰写了一篇关于胡塞尔 (Husserl) 的论文，后来写下了他的思想，并创立了评论、<em>哲学与现象学研究 (Philosophy and Phenomenological Research)</em>，但他仍然更像是自然主义哲学家，而不是现象学家。现象学在美国的主要影响发生在 1950 年代和 1960 年代，当时它成为美国主要的哲学流派之一，尽管它被其他更本土和更圣公会的形式所掩盖。在北美哲学界，与各种风格的分析哲学相比，现象学享有持久但相对较小的存在。许多大学都设有重要的现象学中心，并成立了几个致力于现象学的协会和期刊。最早的中心可以追溯到 1950 年代，位于新社会研究学院的研究生院，多里安凯恩斯、阿隆古维奇和阿尔弗雷德舒茨在那里任教。</p><p>The German root and French branch of phenomenology were certainly the main parts of this movement, but other significant parts arose in other countries. In the United States, William Ernest Hocking had studied with Husserl for a semester in 1902, and so did Dorion Cairns in the late 1920s and early 193os. Cairns wrote a Harvard thesis on Husserl in 1933 and became a superb translator of Husserl's works. Marvin Farber wrote a dissertation on Husserl at Buffalo in 1928 and later wrote about his thought and founded the review, <em>Philosophy and Phenomenological Research</em>, but he remained more of a naturalist philosopher than a phenomenologist. The main impact of phenomenology in the United States occurred in the 1950s and 1960s, when it became established as one of the major schools of philosophy in this country, even though it was overshadowed by other more native and more anglican forms. In the North American philosophical world, phenomenology has enjoyed a durable but relatively small presence, compared with that of analytic philosophy in its various styles. Significant centers of phenomenology have been present in many universities, and several associations and journals dedicated to it have been established. The earliest center, dating from the 1950s, was at the Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research, where Dorion Cairns, Aron Gurwitsch, and Alfred Schutz taught.</p>

  <p>现象学在英格兰从来都不是很突出，尽管在曼彻斯特的沃尔夫·梅斯和他的学生巴里·史密斯、凯文·穆里根和彼得·西蒙斯的努力下，大约二十年前成立了一个充满活力的学者团体，目的是探索现象学的早期阶段并说明它与弗雷格等本世纪初奥地利分析哲学起源的关系。</p><p>Phenomenology was never very prominent in England, although through the efforts of Wolfe Mays at Manchester and his students Barry Smith, Kevin Mulligan, and Peter Simons a vigorous group of scholars was founded about twenty years ago with the intent of exploring the early period of phenomenology and showing its relation to the origins of analytic philosophy in Gottlob Frege and other thinkers in Austria in the early part of this century.</p>

  <p>顺便说一下，这种在英国的发展在美国也有对应的发展，这是一种受弗雷格和分析哲学启发的对胡塞尔的解释。它以加利福尼亚为中心，代表人物有达格芬·福莱斯达尔、休伯特·德雷福斯、罗纳德·麦金泰尔和大卫·伍德拉夫·史密斯。它特别借鉴了胡塞尔早期的著作。这种对胡塞尔的“西海岸”解读与“东海岸”解读相对立，主要位于从波士顿到华盛顿的走廊，它特别从胡塞尔后期的哲学和逻辑著作中汲取灵感，并没有使用弗雷格和分析哲学作为起点。它根据胡塞尔来解读弗雷格，而不是相反。它在 John Brough、Richard Cobb-Stevens、John Drummond、James Hart 的著作中有所表达，罗伯特·索科罗斯基等人。本书就是本着它的精神写成的。这两个“学派”的不同之处尤其在于他们对意向目标、意义和现象学还原的理解。它们之间的基本理论差异在于，西海岸组将感觉和意向识别为思想和世界之间的中介，而东海岸组将感觉和意向区分为对预期对象的两种不同反思的结果；它并没有将它们定位为调节心灵与世界的意向关系。JN Mohanty 发展了对胡塞尔和弗雷格的独立解释，并将现象学与古印度哲学联系起来。意义，以及现象学的还原。它们之间的基本理论差异在于，西海岸组将感觉和意向识别为思想和世界之间的中介，而东海岸组将感觉和意向区分为对预期对象的两种不同反思的结果；它并没有将它们定位为调节心灵与世界的意向关系。JN Mohanty 发展了对胡塞尔和弗雷格的独立解释，并将现象学与古印度哲学联系起来。意义，以及现象学的还原。它们之间的基本理论差异在于，西海岸组将感觉和意向识别为思想和世界之间的中介，而东海岸组将感觉和意向区分为对预期对象的两种不同反思的结果；它并没有将它们定位为调节心灵与世界的意向关系。JN Mohanty 发展了对胡塞尔和弗雷格的独立解释，并将现象学与古印度哲学联系起来。而东海岸小组将感觉和意向区分为对预期对象的两种不同反思的结果；它并没有将它们定位为调节心灵与世界的意向关系。JN Mohanty 发展了对胡塞尔和弗雷格的独立解释，并将现象学与古印度哲学联系起来。而东海岸小组将感觉和意向区分为对预期对象的两种不同反思的结果；它并没有将它们定位为调节心灵与世界的意向关系。JN Mohanty 发展了对胡塞尔和弗雷格的独立解释，并将现象学与古印度哲学联系起来。</p><p>This development in England, incidentally, has a counterpart in the United States, an interpretation of Husserl that is inspired by Frege and analytic philosophy. It is centered in California and is represented by such writers as Dagfinn Føllesdal, Hubert Dreyfus, Ronald McIntyre, and David Woodruff Smith. It draws especially on Husserl's earlier writings. This "West Coast" reading of Husserl has as its antithesis an "East Coast" interpretation, situated largely in the Boston-to-Washington corridor, that takes its bearings especially from Husserl's later philosophical and logical works and does not use Frege and analytic philosophy as its starting point. It reads Frege in the light of Husserl and not vice versa. It is expressed in the writings of John Brough, Richard Cobb-Stevens, John Drummond, James Hart, Robert Sokolowski, and others. The present book is written in its spirit. The two "schools" differ especially in their understanding of noema, sense, and the phenomenological reduction. The basic theoretic difference between them is that the West Coast group identifies sense and noema and posits them as mediators between the mind and world, whereas the East Coast group distinguishes sense and noema as the outcomes of two different kinds of reflection upon the intended object; it does not posit them as mediating the intentional relation of mind to world. J. N. Mohanty has developed an independent interpretation of both Husserl and Frege and has also related phenomenology to ancient Indian philosophy.</p>

  <p>何塞·奥尔特加·加塞特是西班牙的胡塞尔和海德格尔的代表和批判的独立哲学家；泽维尔·祖比里 (Xavier Zubiri) 也可以提及参与现象学。在意大利，现象学和存在主义是在两次世界大战期间由安东尼奥·班菲 (Antonio Banfi) 在米兰发展起来的，在第二次世界大战后由恩佐·帕奇 (Enzo Paci) 发展起来的。此外，Sofia Vanni Rovighi 将胡塞尔的思想与亚里士多德和阿奎那的主题联系起来。Nicola Abbagnano 的存在主义也值得一提。在波兰，1912-18 年师从胡塞尔并在后来与他保持密切联系的罗曼·因加登发起了现象学运动的一个分支，并撰写了几部关于美学、伦理学和形而上学的重要现象学著作。他于 1930 年代在 Lwow 任教，战后在克拉科夫任教。这一传统后来继续作为对 Karol Wojtyła 的工作和卢布林托马斯主义学派的工作的部分影响。在捷克斯洛伐克，胡塞尔的学生兼朋友扬·帕托卡是布拉格现象学的有力代表，也是公民自由的勇敢捍卫者。他在接受警方审问后于 1977 年去世。现象学在革命前的俄罗斯很有影响力。<em>《逻辑研究》</em> 1909年译成俄文，通过罗曼·雅各布森的著作对文学理论中的结构主义和形式主义产生了间接影响，雅各布森一直将胡塞尔的部分和整体理论作为重要的哲学学说。古斯塔夫·施佩特被认为是当时俄罗斯现象学的代表人物，但第一次世界大战和共产主义革命阻止了这些开端的任何发展。现在正在努力将胡塞尔翻译成俄语。</p><p>José Ortega y Gasset was an independent philosopher who both represented and criticized Husserl and Heidegger in Spain; Xavier Zubiri could also be mentioned as involved in phenomenology. In Italy, phenomenology and existentialism were developed in Milan by Antonio Banfi in the period between the two world wars and by Enzo Paci after the Second World War. Also, Sofia Vanni Rovighi related Husserl's thought to themes from Aristotle and Aquinas. The existentialism of Nicola Abbagnano should also be mentioned. In Poland, Roman Ingarden, who studied with Husserl in 1912-18 and remained in close contact with him later, initiated a branch of the phenomenological movement and wrote several important phenomenological works on aesthetics, ethics, and metaphysics. He taught at Lwow in the 1930s and at Cracow after the war. This tradition was later continued as a partial influence on the work of Karol Wojtyła and the work of the Lublin school of Thomism. In Czechoslovakia, Jan Patocka, a student and friend of Husserl's, was a strong representative of phenomenology in Prague and a courageous defender of civic freedom. He died in 1977 after having been interrogated by the police. Phenomenology was influential in prerevolutionary Russia. <em>Logical Investigations</em> was translated into Russian in 1909 and exercised an indirect influence on structuralism and formalism in literary theory through the work of Roman Jakobson, who always referred to Husserl's theory of parts and wholes as an important philosophical doctrine. Gustav Shpet is mentioned as a representative of phenomenology in Russia at that time, but the First World War and the Communist Revolution prevented any development of these beginnings. Efforts are now being made to translate Husserl into Russian.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/appendix.xhtml.heading_id_7"><a id="OEBPS/Text/appendix.xhtml.a_hd"></a>诠释学与解构</h2><h2><a></a>HERMENEUTICS AND DECONSTRUCTION</h2>

  <p>在对现象学主要时期之后发生的事情进行地理调查之后，我可以提到两种进一步的变质形式，这些形式紧随其后，并且在某种程度上处于现象学的边缘——解释学和解构学。</p><p>After this geographic survey of what came after the main period of phenomenology, I could mention two further metamorphic forms that have followed and are somewhat on the margins of phenomenology — hermeneutics and deconstruction.</p>

  <p>诠释学最初是一场特定的德国运动，由弗里德里希·施莱尔马赫 (Friedrich Schleiermacher) (1768-1834) 尤其是威廉·狄尔泰 (Wilhelm Dilthey) (1833-1911) 发起，他是胡塞尔的资深当代人。释经学最初强调阅读和解释过去文本的结构，并将其工作描述为圣经和文学解释以及历史研究的哲学。海德格尔将解释学的概念从文本和记录的研究扩展到对人类存在本身的自我解释。主要与诠释学相关的人当然是汉斯-乔治·伽达默尔，他不仅是海德格尔的学生，而且还是柏拉图、亚里士多德和诗歌文本的博学诠释者。他也是现象学运动的活生生的博斯韦尔，能够向其他国家和年轻一代代表它；他这样做是作为其主要人物和事件的独立见证人，并且作为一个人，他的和蔼可亲和活泼的演讲帮助他在世界各地建立了联系。伽达默尔受海德格尔的影响，他在马尔堡师从海德格尔，但受胡塞尔的影响较小，他还在弗莱堡师从胡塞尔一段时间。胡塞尔的一些概念在解释学中很有帮助——例如理想意义、沉淀和语言的概念——但它们在伽达默尔的思想中所起的作用相对较小。遗憾的是，解释学经常被当作相对主义的许可，伽达默尔肯定会反对这种用法。一个文本可以有多种解释这一事实并不破坏文本的同一性，也不排除错误或完全不恰当的解读，即那些破坏文本的解读。</p><p>Hermeneutics began as a specifically German movement, with Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768-1834) and especially Wilhelm Dilthey (1833-1911), who was a senior contemporary of Husserl. Hermeneutics originally stressed the structures of reading and interpreting texts from the past and presented its work as a philosophy of biblical and literary interpretation and of historical research. Heidegger expanded the notion of hermeneutics from the study of texts and records to the self-interpretation of human existence as such. The person primarily associated with hermeneutics is, of course, Hans-Georg Gadamer, who was not only a student of Heidegger but also a learned interpreter of Plato, Aristotle, and poetic texts. He has also been a living Boswell of the phenomenological movement, able to represent it to other countries and to younger generations; he does so as an independent witness of its major figures and events, and as a person whose congeniality and vivacious lecturing have helped him establish contacts all over the world. Gadamer was influenced by Heidegger, under whom he studied at Marburg, but less influenced by Husserl, with whom he also studied for a while at Freiburg. Some of Husserl's concepts are helpful in hermeneutics — the concepts of ideal meanings, sedimentation, and language, for example — but they playa relatively small role in Gadamer's thought. It is regrettable that hermeneutics is often taken as a license for relativism, a use that Gadamer would certainly dispute. The fact that there can be multiple interpretations of a text does not destroy the identity of a text, nor does it exclude erroneous or totally inappropriate readings, those that destroy the text.</p>

  <p>在对现象学运动的调查中也应该提到解构主义，尽管有些尴尬，就像一个家庭可能被迫谈论一个古怪的叔叔，他的滑稽动作众所周知，但在礼貌的社会中却试图避免提及。雅克·德里达 (Jacques Derrida) 的第一批著作是对胡塞尔短篇作品的翻译和解释（当然，这种解释非常值得怀疑），但他很快就抛弃了胡塞尔，转而进入更广泛的哲学领域。解构主义更强烈地受到黑格尔、海德格尔、萨特和雅克·拉康等人物的影响，在更深的意义上受到尼采和弗洛伊德的影响。我还声称胡塞尔对缺席和差异的处理比德里达认为的要微妙得多，一个承认这些现象但不陷入解构主义极端的人。我听过的关于解构主义最恰当的评论之一是在苏格兰文学理论家阿拉斯代尔福勒的一次演讲中发表的；他观察到，适度啜饮的解构主义为传统文学理论提供了一个受欢迎的修正，传统文学理论可能变得有点过于整洁和理性主义，但在美国，它被吸收到一种政治意识形态中，因此发展超出了任何比例。</p><p>Deconstruction should also be mentioned in a survey of the phenomenological movement, albeit with some embarrassment, the way a family might be forced to speak about an eccentric uncle whose antics are known to everyone but whom one tries to avoid mentioning in polite society. Jacques Derrida's first writings were translations and interpretations (highly questionable interpretations, to be sure) of short works by Husserl, but he soon abandoned Husserl and moved into wider philosophical fields. Deconstruction is more strongly influenced by figures like Hegel, Heidegger, Sartre, and Jacques Lacan, and in a deeper sense by Nietzsche and Freud. I would also claim that Husserl has a much more subtle treatment of absence and difference than Derrida gives him credit for, one that recognizes these phenomena but does not fall into the extremes of deconstruction. One of the most appropriate comments I have heard about deconstruction was made in a lecture by the Scottish literary theorist Alasdair Fowler; he observed that deconstruction in moderate sips provides a welcome correction to traditional literary theory, which might have become a bit too tidy and rationalist, but that in the United States it became absorbed into a political ideology and hence developed beyond all proportion.</p>

  <h2 id="OEBPS/Text/appendix.xhtml.heading_id_8"><a id="OEBPS/Text/appendix.xhtml.a_fr"></a>最后的评论</h2><h2><a></a>FINAL REMARKS</h2>

  <p>作为哲学的主要传统之一，现象学仍然以一种不那么引人注目的方式继续存在。其代表作将继续被视为经典，时间会证明星星会升到多高。本世纪上半叶的思想家必将跻身于思想史上的重要人物之列，他们将像过去最好的著作一样激发哲学思考。现象学作为一场运动的力量体现在它不仅向我们展示了明显的主要人物，而且还向我们展示了范围广泛的次要作家，这些人填补了现象学哲学风格的壁龛和角落的可能性。</p><p>Phenomenology still continues in a somewhat less spectacular way as one of the major traditions in philosophy. Its leading works will continue to be read as classics, and time will tell how high the stars will rise. The thinkers in the first part of this century will certainly stand among the significant figures in the history of thought, and they will inspire philosophical thinking as the best writings of the past have done. Phenomenology's strength as a movement is evidenced by the fact that it presents to us not only obvious major figures, but also a wide range of minor writers, those who fill out the possibilities in the niches and corners of the phenomenological style of philosophy.</p>

  <p>此外，大量的学术工作继续在这一传统中完成，例如文本的编辑（以鲁汶和科隆为特别重要的中心），对主要著作和主要思想家的评论，以及对各种术语和含义的争论概念。尽管胡塞尔著作的版本已经到了可以说“够了”的地步，但一些重要的资料，比如他后来关于内在时间意识的手稿，仍然有待出版。海德格尔讲义的这一版对他的思想发展历程提供了很多启示，并为我们提供了具有重大哲学价值的文本。</p><p>Furthermore, a great deal of scholarly work continues to be accomplished in this tradition, such as the edition of texts (with Louvain and Cologne as especially important centers), commentaries on major works and major thinkers, and controversies about the meaning of various terms and concepts. Although the edition of Husserl's work is arriving at the point at which one might well say "enough," some important materials, such as his later manuscripts on the consciousness of internal time, still await publication. The edition of Heidegger's lectures has shed much light on the development of his thought and provided us with texts that are of great philosophical value.</p>

  <p>现象学运动的一大缺陷是它完全缺乏任何政治哲学。这显然是一个需要补充的领域。的确，人们可能会说，缺乏政治敏锐度对海德格尔来说不仅是一种思辨，而且是一种实际的灾难。阿尔弗雷德·舒茨 (Alfred Schutz, 1899-1959) 在新学派任教并部分评论了胡塞尔的思想，他受韦伯和舍勒的影响最大，在社会哲学和人本主义社会学方面做了重要的工作，但他也没有真正发展出一种政治哲学。</p><p>One of the great deficiencies of the phenomenological movement is its total lack of any political philosophy. This is clearly an area in which a supplement is needed. Indeed, one might say that the lack of political acumen was not only a speculative, but also a practical catastrophe in the case of Heidegger. Alfred Schutz (1899-1959), who taught at the New School and commented in part on Husserl's thought, had been most influenced by Weber and Scheler and did important work in social philosophy and a humanistic sociology, but he too did not really develop a political philosophy.</p>

  <p>我还要说，它的既定术语是现象学运动的障碍。像“noesis”和“noema”、“还原”、“生活世界”和“先验自我”这样的词往往会变得僵化并引发人为的问题。它们具体化了应该是存在的一个方面和哲学活动的一个方面。“现象学”这个名字本身就具有误导性和笨拙性。这个术语翻译成英语很糟糕，而且看起来很浮夸；英国现象学作家应该向 John Findlay、Michael Oakeshott 和 Gilbert Ryle 等作家学习。</p><p>I would also say that its established terminology is a handicap for the phenomenological movement. Words like "noesis" and "noema," "reduction," "life world," and "transcendental ego" tend to become fossilized and provoke artificial problems. They substantialize what should be an aspect of being and of the activity of philosophy. The very name "phenomenology" is misleading and clumsy. The terminology translates badly into English and seems pompous; English writers in phenomenology ought to learn from authors like John Findlay, Michael Oakeshott, and Gilbert Ryle.</p>

  <p>现象学中有许多重要的理论资源尚未开发，可以说是矿藏，仍有待开采。胡塞尔在现代思想上取得了决定性的突破；他展示了避免笛卡尔、洛克将意识概念视为封闭球体的可能性；他恢复了对心灵的理解，即心灵是公开的，是对事物的呈现。他开辟了通往哲学现实主义和本体论的道路，可以取代认识论的首要地位。胡塞尔思想中的许多这些积极的可能性并没有得到重视，因为笛卡尔的控制——“la main morte de Descartes”——对如此多的哲学家和学者来说是如此强烈。太频繁了，胡塞尔的一切都根据他拒绝的立场重新解释。思想之道，孤立意识的想法仍然束缚着我们中的许多人，一旦这种思维方式生根发芽，一旦人们习惯于解决某些问题和习惯，就很难甚至不可能将其赶出某种推理方式。但是对于那些想要它的人来说，现象学中还有很多东西。现象学运动起源于本世纪初的胡塞尔，其在过去一百年的丰富历史为真正的哲学生活提供了许多资源。</p><p>There are important theoretical resources in phenomenology that are still unexploited, mineral deposits, so to speak, that still remain to be mined. Husserl made a decisive breakthrough in modern thought; he showed the possibility of avoiding the Cartesian, Lockean concept of consciousness as an enclosed sphere; he restored the understanding of mind as public and as present to things. He opens the way to a philosophical realism and ontology that can replace the primacy of epistemology. Many of these positive possibilities in Husserl's thought have not been appreciated because the Cartesian grip — "la main morte de Descartes" — is so strong on so many philosophers and scholars. All too frequently, everything in Husserl is reinterpreted according to the very positions he rejected. The way of ideas, the idea of the isolated consciousness, still holds many of us captive, and it is very difficult, if not impossible, to dislodge people from this way of thinking once it has taken root, once they have become used to a certain set of problems and a certain way of reasoning. But much remains in phenomenology for those who want it. The phenomenological movement, with its origins in Husserl at the beginning of this century and its rich history in the past one hundred years, furnishes many resources for an authentic philosophical life.</p>
