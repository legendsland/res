<h2>人工智能在微软战略中的作用</h2>
<h2>AI's Role in Microsoft's Strategy</h2>
<p><strong>采访者：</strong> 萨提亚，您之前强调过，人工智能将塑造我们所做的一切。这在实践中是怎样的呢？在微软，这实际上是如何推动你们的战略的？特别是考虑到人工智能将如何影响超越现有卓越产品套件之外的理念，比如更广泛的经济？</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> So Satcha, you've emphasized before that AI is going to shape all that we do. What does this look like in practice? At Microsoft, how does this actually drive your strategy? And particularly thinking about how AI will influence ideas behind beyond, you know, the immediate incredible product suite, you know, like the broader economy?</p>
<p><strong>萨提亚·纳德拉：</strong> 在微软，我觉得我们是一家平台公司、一家产品公司和一家合作伙伴公司。在我 35 年的职业生涯中，我经历了客户端-服务器、网络、互联网、移动、云，而这是第四个时代。我首先想到的是平台机遇。有趣的是所有这些平台的复合效应。我认为人工智能的传播速度如此之快、范围如此之广的原因在于它建立在上一代技术的基础之上。如果没有云，我们就无法构建人工智能超级计算机，也就不会有后来的模型，更不会有这些产品。</p>
<p><strong>Satya Nadella:</strong> At Microsoft, I feel we are a platform company, a product company, and a partner company. In my 35 years, I've lived through client-server, web, internet, mobile, cloud, and this is the fourth. The first thing that I think about is the platform opportunity. The interesting thing is the compounding effects of all these platforms. The reason why I think the rate of diffusion for AI is so fast and so wide is because it builds on the previous generation. If the cloud was not there, we wouldn't have been able to build the AI supercomputers, which then led to the models, which then led to the products.</p>
<p>你总是利用上一个平台来构建下一个平台。每一次平台转变都伴随着一种工作负载。大规模训练任务与我们最初构建云时所针对的工作负载截然不同。它是一种数据并行同步工作负载，与 Hadoop 作业非常不同。平台本身也因此被彻底重新评估和改变。对我来说，这正是平台方面令人兴奋之处。这是系统软件的黄金时代。今天，如果我考虑在基础设施层进行构建的任何人，不仅仅是超大规模云服务商，也包括初创公司，我认为这是一个巨大的机会。显然，在模型方面以及其上的产品方面也存在着巨大的机会。</p>
<p>You always sort of take the previous platform and build the next platform. With each one of these platform shifts, there's a workload. The large-scale training job is a very different workload to what we built the cloud for. It's a data-parallel synchronous workload, so different than a Hadoop job. The platform itself then completely gets relitigated and changed. To me, that's the exciting thing on the platform side. It's a golden age of system software. Today, if I had to think about anybody who's building at the infrastructure layer, not just the hyperscalers but even the startups, I think that's a tremendous opportunity. Obviously, there's a tremendous opportunity in the model side and then the products on top of it.</p>
<p>归根结底，这一切是为了什么？它只为一件事，那就是最终推动经济增长和 GDP 增长。我对人工智能的评判标准是：它是否正在我们周围的世界中创造剩余价值，一次一个社区、一个国家、一个行业、一个公司？</p>
<p>Ultimately, what's it for? It's for one thing and one thing alone, which is to drive ultimately economic growth and GDP growth. My benchmark for AI is: is it creating surplus in the world around us, one community, one country, one industry, one company at a time?</p>
<h2>应用和模型的演变</h2>
<h2>The Evolution of Applications and Models</h2>
<p><strong>采访者：</strong> 似乎在应用层面，你们几十年来已经打造出了具有决定性意义的应用。感觉我们正处在一个奇怪的、不平坦的时刻，模型已经涌现并让我们惊叹，但计算和应用需要迎头赶上。这里的希望实际上是，在座的各位将成为那些应用的开发者。</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> It seems like at the app level, you guys have built the defining apps for so many decades. It feels like we're at this weird lumpy moment where the models have popped up and we're astonished, but the compute and the apps need to catch up. The hope here is actually the people in this room will be the people who build those apps.</p>
<p><strong>萨提亚·纳德拉：</strong> 这是一个很好的问题。其中一个问题是，模型是像 SQL 一样，还是它本身就是 SaaS 应用和模型？模型的边界在哪里，产品的边界又在哪里？如果你说一个带有一些脚手架和工具调用并在某种无限循环中运行的模型就是产品，那就会有点混乱。但这就像说一堆 SQL 业务逻辑就是一个应用一样。我认为任何人都仍然可以在模型之上构建一个应用层。你必须将自己抽象出来，然后说模型对我来说就像 SQL 一样。</p>
<p><strong>Satya Nadella:</strong> It's a good question. One of the questions is, is the model like SQL, or is it the SaaS app itself and the model? Where does the model end and where does the product begin? If you sort of say a model with some scaffolding and tool calling in some infinite loop is the product, that's where it gets a little confusing. But that's like saying a bunch of SQL business logic is what an app is. I think it's still possible for anyone to build an app tier on top of a model. You have to abstract yourself and say the model is just like SQL was to me.</p>
<p>我一直梦想着人工智能/机器学习能有一个“SQL 时刻”。我们第一次在这个模型层中有像 SQL 引擎一样的东西，然后我们可以用它来构建非常复杂的产品。这些技术，仅仅是推理时间的计算加上工具调用，就为我们提供了一个非常强大的工具集，能够构建出相当复杂的产品。</p>
<p>I always dreamt of a moment when AI/Machine learning will have a SQL moment. For the first time, in this model layer, we have something like a SQL engine that we can then use to build pretty sophisticated products. These techniques also, just the inference time compute plus tool calling, is giving us a pretty robust harness to be able to build pretty sophisticated products.</p>
<h2>计算和全球基础设施的未来</h2>
<h2>The Future of Compute and Global Infrastructure</h2>
<p><strong>采访者：</strong> 人工智能的规模法则持续有效，对智能的需求似乎可能是无限的。昨天，埃隆提到未来将会有 99 个超级智能体对应一个人类。为人工智能的未来进行建设，对全球计算基础设施的真正需求在哪里？您预计这些需求将如何演变？</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> AI scaling laws are continuing to hold, and the demand for intelligence appears to be potentially infinite. Yesterday, Elon was mentioning that there will be 99 hyper-intelligent beings to one human. Where does the building for the future of AI truly demand for global compute infrastructure? How do you anticipate these demands evolving?</p>
<p><strong>萨提亚·纳德拉：</strong> 如果你退后一步看，说智能是计算的对数，然后你问计算消耗多少能源，以美国为例，今天大约是 2-3%。假设它翻倍到 6%。这是巨大的，因为为人工智能需要生产的额外能源非常高。如果历史教会了我们一个教训，那就是如果你要使用能源，你最好获得社会许可。这意味着你必须确保人工智能的产出对社会有益。如果我们没有真正在国家和社区层面创造社会剩余和经济剩余，那么我们就不能消耗能源。</p>
<p><strong>Satya Nadella:</strong> If you sort of really step back and say intelligence is a log of compute, and then you ask how much energy does compute consume, let's take in the United States, maybe 2-3% today. Let's say it doubles to 6%. That's massive because the amount of extra energy that needs to be produced for AI is pretty high. If there's one lesson history has taught us, it's that if you're going to use energy, you better have social permission to use it. That means you've got to make sure that the output of this AI is socially useful. If we really are not creating social surplus, economic surplus as measured by countries and communities, then we just can't consume energy.</p>
<p>未来 5 年真正的问题是，我们必须生产出足够多的能创造巨大价值的产品，对此我非常有信心，无论是在医疗保健、教育还是生产力领域。这才是我们作为科技行业面临的真正挑战：明确无误地证明我们所创造的东西正在真实的统计数据中显现出来，而不仅仅是一个 AGI 或 AI 基准。</p>
<p>The real question in the next 5 years is we've got to produce enough products that are creating great value, which I'm very confident of, in healthcare, in education, in productivity. That's the real challenge for us as a tech industry: to prove unequivocally that what we have created is showing up in real stats that is not just an AGI or AI benchmark.</p>
<h2>人工智能部署的速率限制器</h2>
<h2>Rate Limiters for AI Deployment</h2>
<p><strong>采访者：</strong> 您认为当今人工智能部署最大的速率限制器是什么？</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> What do you see as being the biggest rate limiter for AI deployment today?</p>
<p><strong>萨提亚·纳德拉：</strong> 这很有趣。如果你是一家在个人电脑出现之前的跨国公司，我们是如何做预测的？你会发送传真，人们会接收这些传真并发送内部备忘录，然后希望在季度末之前能得出一个预测。然后突然之间，有了电子邮件、个人电脑和 Excel，工作产物和工作流程都改变了。这正是人工智能需要带来的改变。</p>
<p><strong>Satya Nadella:</strong> Here's the interesting thing. If you were a multinational company pre-PCs, how did we do forecasts? You would send faxes, people would take those faxes and send inter-office memos, and a forecast would come hopefully before the quarter end. Then suddenly, with email and PCs and Excel, the work artifact and the workflow changed. That is what needs to happen with AI.</p>
<p>当有人说，“我现在要用我指挥的 99 个代理来完成我的工作”，工作流程将不会一成不变。你现在真的需要改变；甚至你工作的范围也会改变。这种变革管理是一个真正的速率限制器。你现在正在拿走一家保险公司、一家金融服务公司、一家医疗保健公司、一家软件公司的生产资料，并说我们要改变我们工作的一切方式。</p>
<p>When someone says, "I'm going to now do my job but with whatever 99 agents that I am directing on my behalf," the workflow is not going to be constant. You're now really going to have to change; even the scope of your job is going to change. That change management is a real rate limiter. You're now taking the means of production in an insurance company, in a financial services company, in a healthcare company, in a software company, and saying we are going to change everything in the way we work.</p>
<p>在 LinkedIn，我认为他们将多个职能——设计职能、前端工程师职能、产品职能——整合在一起，并说：“我们将拥有全栈构建者。”这甚至是工作范围的改变。那么你如何用新的角色、新的范围等等来重建产品团队呢？这对我来说更多的是社会速率限制器。</p>
<p>At LinkedIn, I think they took multiple of these functions—the design function, the front-end engineer function, the product function—put them all together and said, "We're going to have full-stack builders." That's a change in scope of even a job. How do you then rebuild the product team with new roles, new scopes, and what have you? That's to me more the social rate limiter.</p>
<h2>解决知识工作中的枯燥乏味</h2>
<h2>Tackling the Drudgery in Knowledge Work</h2>
<p><strong>采访者：</strong> 在 YC，我们告诉这里的很多人去“卧底”。去做一名医疗计费员，看看有多少知识工作实际上是从浏览器复制粘贴到电子表格，再到电子邮件，然后点击发送。</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> At YC, we tell a lot of people here to go undercover. Go work as a medical biller and see how many knowledge work jobs are actually copying and pasting from a browser into a spreadsheet into an email and then clicking send.</p>
<p><strong>萨提亚·纳德拉：</strong> 我认为，对于任何创造产品或实现根本性突破的人来说，即使是在模型层面，一个最被低估的机会就是知识工作中存在的大量枯燥乏味。在软件工程中，我们看到了这一点。我们正在剥夺软件工程的乐趣，因为你脱离了心流状态。能够保持心流状态，能够完成一项任务，这本身就是一个很好的例子，说明了我认为将发生在所有知识工作中的事情。你在带外收集信息所花费的精力……让一个复杂的推理模型和你的前额叶皮层协同工作，而许多单调乏味的事情则由某个代理完成，我认为这绝对是前沿领域。</p>
<p><strong>Satya Nadella:</strong> I think one of the most understated things as an opportunity for anyone creating products or fundamental breakthroughs, even at the model layer, is the amount of drudgery there is in knowledge work. In software engineering, we saw that. We're taking the joy out of software engineering because you were out of your flow. To be able to stay in the flow, to be able to complete a task, that itself is a great example of what I think is going to happen to all knowledge work. The amount of cycles you spend out of band collecting information... having a sophisticated reasoning model and your prefrontal cortex work together, whereas a lot of the mundane stuff is getting done by some agent, that I think is definitely the frontier.</p>
<h2>转型与人工智能发展的未来</h2>
<h2>Transformational Shifts and the Future of AI Development</h2>
<p><strong>采访者：</strong> 除了简单地采用人工智能工具，您认为当今该领域最大的转型是什么？</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Beyond simply adopting AI tools, what are the biggest transformational shifts you're seeing in the field today?</p>
<p><strong>萨提亚·纳德拉：</strong> 这个领域变化如此之快。我去年甚至没有想到我们能通过强化学习和基本上是测试时计算取得如此大的进展。它似乎是无限的。预训练奏效了，其上所有的后训练技术都非常出色，然后这种推理时计算似乎又增加了一个巨大的规模法则。所以现在我感兴趣的是，是否会有一些新的算法突破。整个范式可能会被这里的某个人改变，他站出来说：“我有一种更有效的方法来做这件事。”</p>
<p><strong>Satya Nadella:</strong> This field is changing so rapidly. I had not even imagined last year that we would get this far with RL and with basically test-time compute. It seems pretty limitless. Pre-training worked, all the post-training techniques on top of it were fantastic, then this inference time compute seems to have really added another massive scaling law. So now I'm interested in whether there is some new algorithmic breakthrough. This entire regime could be changed by one person here who comes up and says, "I have a more efficient way to do this stuff."</p>
<p>另一个是，下一步是什么？从预训练到强化学习，端到端的训练循环是什么？这是我认为明年会发生的下一个大样本。如果那又是一个规模法则的突破呢？</p>
<p>The other one is, what is the next step up? What is the pre-training to RL, the end-to-end training loop? That's the next big sample that I think will happen in the next year. What if that is another scaling law breakthrough?</p>
<h2>人工智能是工具，而非人类的复制品</h2>
<h2>AI as a Tool, Not a Replica of Humanity</h2>
<p><strong>采访者：</strong> 这里有一个非常有趣的地方，如果你把一个 LLM 实例看作一个意识——我认为有些人开始这么说了——你和它一起做了一堆工作，然后它就消失了。</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> There's something very interesting here in that if you think about an LLM instance as a consciousness, which I think some people are starting to say, you do a bunch of work with it and then it sort of goes away.</p>
<p><strong>萨提亚·纳德拉：</strong> 我完全不赞成将人工智能拟人化。“人工智能”不幸的是我们能选的最糟糕的名字。我把它看作一个工具。它不是在试图复制我们的思维方式。它确实显示出智能的迹象，但它不是我所拥有的那种智能。我认为人类的能动性仍然很重要，将继续存在，而我们会把这些当作工具来使用。</p>
<p><strong>Satya Nadella:</strong> I'm not into this anthropomorphizing AI at all. "Artificial intelligence" is unfortunately the worst name we could have ever picked. I come at it as it's a tool. It's not trying to replicate how we think. It is definitely showing signs of intelligence, but it's not intelligence that I have. I think of human agency; it still will matter, will be there, and we will sort of use these as tools.</p>
<p>话虽如此，一个记忆系统是件好事。如果我展望下一个前沿，我会说有三件事：记忆、使用的工具，然后是第三件，也许是最重要的，那就是权限。如果我要采取行动，我有什么权限来采取行动？这三个系统必须作为模型周围的一等公民来构建，以便我们构建更复杂的应用程序。</p>
<p>That said, a memory system is a good thing. If I look at the next frontier, I would say there are three things: memory, tools used, and then the third, which is perhaps the most important, is entitlements. If I'm going to take action, what entitlements do I have to take action? These three systems have to be built as first-class around the model for us to build more sophisticated applications.</p>
<h2>软件和设计的未来</h2>
<h2>The Future of Software and Design</h2>
<p><strong>采访者：</strong> 您是否担心代码生成会让用户在某个时候更愿意即时制作软件，而不是使用打包软件？</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Do you worry with code generation that users at some point will just prefer to make software just in time instead of using package software?</p>
<p><strong>萨提亚·纳德拉：</strong> 这是一个很好的问题。与此同时，我看到有那么多人正在复刻 VS Code，我说：“天哪，我们一定做对了什么。” 构建一个伟大的 IDE 是有道理的。我认为 Excel 就是一个 IDE。你可以将最好的分析师模型带到这个 IDE 中，然后在画布和模型之间创建一个循环。所以我认为是的，你可以即时生成应用程序，你也可以有一个预制的应用程序，它真正有助于向模型提供反馈循环。我认为这两者将共存。</p>
<p><strong>Satya Nadella:</strong> It's a great question. At the same time, I look at the number of people who are forking VS Code and I say, "Man, we must have done something right." There is something to be said about building a great IDE. I think of Excel as an IDE. You can bring the best analyst model to this IDE and then create a loop between the canvas and the model. So I think yes, you can generate applications just in time, and you could have a prefabbed application that is really helping with the feedback loop to the model. I think both of these things will exist together.</p>
<p><strong>采访者：</strong> 您认为设计在这一切中扮演着什么角色？</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Do you think there's a role for design in all of this?</p>
<p><strong>萨提亚·纳德拉：</strong> 我认为将会发生的是，我们所有人都将创造软件，但会有一个叫做软件工程师的职位。它将会与众不同。你实际上是把一个软件工程师变成了一个软件架构师。你的元认知……我的意思是，我最大的感触之一是，天哪，Copilot 太棒了，直到它做了一些我完全不知道发生了什么的事情。所以这意味着我必须拥有我的代码仓库的元模型，并且确切地知道发生了什么。我现在最喜欢的 GitHub 功能是真正查看所有在我的代码仓库上工作的代理的完整变更日志。那将是很多软件工程工作所在的地方。</p>
<p><strong>Satya Nadella:</strong> I think what will happen is all of us are going to be creating software, but there is going to be a job called a software engineer. It's going to be different. You are really taking a software engineer and saying you're now a software architect. The metacognition of your... I mean, one of my biggest things is, man, Copilot is fantastic until it does stuff that I don't know what the heck happened. So that means I have to have the meta-model of my repo and exactly what happened. My favorite feature of GitHub now is to really look at the complete change logs of all the agents that are working on my repo. That is where a lot of the software engineering will be.</p>
<h2>炒作与现实</h2>
<h2>The Hype vs. The Reality</h2>
<p><strong>采访者：</strong> 在人工智能发展中，您认为什么被低估了，什么被过度炒作了？</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> In AI development, what do you think is underestimated and what is overhyped?</p>
<p><strong>萨提亚·纳德拉：</strong> 我们正处于“一切都是人工智能”的时代。作为科技界，我们最需要担心和努力的是如何赢得社会许可。我在 23 年初在印度看到的一个演示让我大开眼界。我看到一个本地开发人员将 GPD-3.5 与印度的一个语音转文本、文本转语音的开源项目连接起来。然后展示了一个当地的印度农民如何能够使用 WhatsApp 中内置的聊天机器人通过访问政府网站来获得一些农业补贴。这对我来说简直难以置信。这是一个需要大规模讲述的故事。这是被低估的故事。因为现在被过度炒作的是模型的能力，而模型的能力确实很棒。但是，天哪，如果我们能以某种方式让世界认识到这正在真正改变世界各地人们的生活，那我们就处于有利地位了。</p>
<p><strong>Satya Nadella:</strong> We're at the "everything is AI all the time." The thing that we have to most worry about and most work on as a tech community is how do we earn that social permission? One of the demos I saw which completely blew me away was in the beginning of '23 in India. I saw a local developer daisy-chain GPD-3.5 with one of these India stack speech-to-text, text-to-speech open-source things. And then showed a local Indian farmer who was able to use a chatbot built in WhatsApp to get some agricultural subsidy by going to a government website. That to me was unbelievable. That is the story that needs to be told at scale. That is the underhyped story. Because right now the overhyped thing is the model capability, and the model capability is fantastic. But man, if we can somehow get the world to recognize that this is making a real difference in the lives of people everywhere, we're in good shape.</p>
<h2>隐私、安全和主权</h2>
<h2>Privacy, Security, and Sovereignty</h2>
<p><strong>采访者：</strong> 在这方面，当您看待您的公司和苹果公司时，他们似乎必须站在为所有计算机用户保护隐私的前线。</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> In that respect, you know, when you look at your company and Apple, they sort of have to be on the front lines of protecting privacy for all computer users.</p>
<p><strong>萨提亚·纳德拉：</strong> 对我们来说，有隐私、有安全、有主权。这是三个重要的考虑因素。隐私，每个用户都关心。安全，每个租户或每个客户都会关心。然后每个国家都会关心主权、安全和隐私。你真的需要构建任何产品或任何系统，以便能够回答个人、组织和国家的问题。</p>
<p><strong>Satya Nadella:</strong> To us, there's privacy, there is security, there's sovereignty. These are three big considerations. Privacy, every user cares about it. Security is what every tenant or every customer will care about. And then every country will care about sovereignty, security, and privacy. You really need to build any product or any system to be able to answer the questions for the people, for organizations, and for countries.</p>
<h2>给下一代建设者的教训</h2>
<h2>Lessons for the Next Generation of Builders</h2>
<p><strong>采访者：</strong> 萨提亚，您在微软的经历非常不凡。您会与下一代建设者分享哪些经验教训？</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Satcha, you've had an absolutely extraordinary journey at Microsoft. What lessons from that path would you share for the next generation of builders?</p>
<p><strong>萨提亚·纳德拉：</strong> 并不是说你开始任何旅程时都有一个明确的终点目标，但你确实是以占据第一并为自己设定最高抱负为目标的。我总是说，我并不是等到成为首席执行官才做我最好的工作。我的第一份工作，我觉得是我能拥有的最棒的工作。那是一个很好的心智模型。不要等待下一个大事。把你拥有的东西当作最大的事，然后把它扩展开来。</p>
<p><strong>Satya Nadella:</strong> It's not like you start any journey with a specific goal of where you want to end up, but you do start with this goal of taking the first spot and having the highest ambition for yourself. I always say it's not like I was waiting to become CEO to do my best work. The first job I had, I felt was the greatest job I could ever have. That was a great mental model. Don't wait for the next big thing. You take the thing that you have as the biggest thing and then make it expansive.</p>
<p>另一件事是，大事是通过你周围的团队来实现的。学会团队合作，让团队变得伟大。最少被教导的是，你如何真正确保你能作为一个团队进行组合，以及你在其中的角色。</p>
<p>The other thing is that big things are achieved by having a team around you. Learn how to work in teams, making teams great. The thing that is least taught is how do you really make sure you can compose as a team and what's your role in it.</p>
<h2>领导者的品质</h2>
<h2>Qualities of a Leader</h2>
<p><strong>采访者：</strong> 您在个人和团队中寻找什么样的品质？</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> What are the qualities that you look for in people and teams?</p>
<p><strong>萨提亚·纳德拉：</strong> 我一直在寻找三种品质。第一，能够进入一个模糊、不确定的情况并带来清晰度的人。第二，能够创造能量的人。他们能够将多个利益相关者聚集在一起。最后，善于解决过度约束问题的人。我最喜欢的面试问题是让某人描述一个他们曾经参与的、毫无进展的项目，而他们找到了出路。我认为，带来清晰度、创造能量并通过解决过度约束问题来推动成功，这就是领导力的全部内容。</p>
<p><strong>Satya Nadella:</strong> I'm always looking for three qualities. One is, people who can drop into an ambiguous, uncertain situation and bring clarity. The second thing is people who create energy. They're able to bring multiple constituents together. And then the last thing is people who are good at solving over-constrained problems. My favorite interview question is asking someone to describe a project they worked on which was going nowhere and they figured out a path. Bringing clarity, creating energy, and driving success by solving over-constrained problems is what I think leadership is about.</p>
<h2>关于量子计算</h2>
<h2>On Quantum Computing</h2>
<p><strong>采访者：</strong> 我想简单谈谈量子。你们二月份刚刚发布了你们的 Majorana 1。它与人工智能的未来有互动吗？</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> I want to cover quantum briefly. You guys just released your Majorana 1 in February. Is there an interaction with the future of AI?</p>
<p><strong>萨提亚·纳德拉：</strong> 我们已经为此努力了 20 多年。我们一直以来的重点是，如果我们真的想构建一个通用的量子计算机，你必须解决真正稳定、可纠错的量子比特的问题。我们押注于意大利物理学家马约拉纳设想的这种物理特性。我们终于取得了物理学上的突破，并能够制造出那个粒子。如果你想理解自然的语言，也就是模拟，最好的方法就是通过量子计算机。但我认为人工智能是那个模拟器的模拟器。我们看到的很多是在使用 HPC 加人工智能来加速化学、物理、材料科学领域的进步方面取得了相当不错的进展。因此，量子将是其中的下一步。</p>
<p><strong>Satya Nadella:</strong> We've been at it for 20-plus years. The focus we always had was if we really want to build a general-purpose quantum computer, you got to solve for really stable, error-corrected qubits. We bet on this physical property envisioned by the Italian physicist Majorana. We finally had a physics breakthrough and were able to fabricate that particle. If you want to understand the language of nature, which is simulation, the best way to do it is through a quantum computer. But AI is, I think of it as an emulator of that simulator. A lot of what we are seeing is pretty good advances in using HPC plus AI as a way to accelerate advances in chemistry, in physics, in material science. And so quantum would be the next step in it.</p>
<h2>今天该做什么</h2>
<h2>What to Work On Today</h2>
<p><strong>采访者：</strong> 让我们来做一个模拟。你 22 岁，2025 年开始你的职业生涯。你在做什么？</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Let's do a simulation. You're 22 years old, starting your career in 2025. What are you working on?</p>
<p><strong>萨提亚·纳德拉：</strong> 如果你回顾微软的历史，Office 是如何诞生的，那是一个令人难以置信的故事。想想这些工具——文字处理器、电子表格、幻灯片制作工具。这些工具对我们所有人的意义。我最喜欢的产品永远是 VS Code，另一个是 Excel。这一切都关乎你所拥有的赋权感。我想从事下一代工具的开发工作。当我今天看到 Copilot 时，我就是这种感觉。我们能把什么样的工具交到人们手中，让他们拥有那种赋权感？这就是我乐于从事的工作。</p>
<p><strong>Satya Nadella:</strong> If you look back at the history of Microsoft, how Office got built is an unbelievable story. Thinking of these tools—a word processor, a spreadsheet, a slide-making tool. What those tools have meant to all of us. My favorite product is always VS Code and the other one is Excel. It's all about the sense of empowerment you have. I would want to work on what are the next set of tools. When I see even Copilot today, that's kind of where I feel. What are the tools that we can put in the hands of people that will give them that sense of empowerment? That's what I would love to work on.</p>
<p><strong>采访者：</strong> 我感觉创造这些工具的人就坐在这个观众席里。请为萨提亚·纳德拉鼓掌。非常感谢。</p>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> I have a feeling the people who make those tools are sitting in this audience right now. Please give it up for Sachin Nadella. Thank you so much.</p>
